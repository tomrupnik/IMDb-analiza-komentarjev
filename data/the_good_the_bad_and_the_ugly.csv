0;MartinHafer;"while i have given some pretty long reviews to clint eastwood's westerns--particularly the wonderful fistful of dollars and for a few dollars more, i will only give a brief review of this movie because there are so many reviews already i doubt if my pontificating will actually influence many people. after all, this is widely seen as one of the greatest westerns ever made and since i liked it immensely, there isn't much need to say more. well, there are actually a few westerns i liked a bit more--i am a huge fan of the big country. but, when it comes to style, originality and the epic proportions of this film, none can match it, though once upon a time in the west comes very, very close. the acting and script are just fine and the music is intensely weird but effective. of all the films i have seen with music by ennio morricone, this is his most intense and strangest. and it works perfectly in this film, but i also appreciate much of his more restrained work in other films and would never want all westerns to have such distinctive and bizarre music as in the good, the bad and the ugly--it would just lose its magic and might even tend to overwhelm the film. about the only negatives about this film are the title and it is a pretty violent film that the little ones probably shouldn't watch. there is a lot of blood and violence and you do get to see (yuck) eli wallach's butt. as for the title, sure, lee van cleef was truly ""bad"" and eli wallach was cure ""ugly"", but clint as ""the good""? well, his character was far from good--but of course, who would like the title to be ""the kinda good, the bad and the ugly""?! not to be missed by any serious fan or the genre.";23 August 2006;10;['long', 'wonderful', 'few', 'brief', 'many', 'many', 'great', 'much', 'more', 'few', 'more', 'huge', 'big', 'epic', 'close', 'fine', 'weird', 'effective', 'intense', 'strange', 'much', 'restrained', 'other', 'such', 'distinctive', 'bizarre', 'bad', 'ugly', 'only', 'violent', 'little', 'bad', 'cure', 'ugly', 'good', 'good', 'kinda', 'bad', 'ugly', 'serious'];0.0256127450980392
1;TheLittleSongbird;well what do you know? another amazing movie from sergio leone. the good, the bad and the ugly has so much good about it, and quintessentially it is one of the best westerns ever made. there may be nothing new about the story at first glance, but that's the point, leone is paying homage to the hollywood western, and despite the initial simplicity there is also a complexity mainly in the film's characters. regardless of whether simple or complex it is, the good, the bad and the ugly does have a compelling and brilliantly written story. but there are other assets that make the good, the bad and the ugly so good. the dialogue is always excellent, while leone's direction is superb once again. the characters are great and are superbly played. clint eastwood gives one of his best performances ever here, and eli wallach is perfectly cast and more than a match for him. i was also very impressed with lee van cleef, who i recognised from high noon and such, but he makes a bigger impression here. the good, the bad and the ugly is also the most violent of the trilogy, and one of the most violent of the genre, not a bad thing whatsoever. the pace was spot on too, even though the film is nearly three hours long, it is never boring or dull. the best things though about the good, the bad and the ugly are the visuals and ennio morricone's score. the film looks amazing, the cinematography is gorgeous and the sweeping images and scenery are very lovingly crafted. morricone's score is even more impressive than that, it is simply one of the best film scores i've ever heard, and if i had to say which was morricone's best score, i would immediately say this. overall, there is nothing bad or ugly about the film. the film is amazing. 10/10 bethany cox;9 January 2011;10;['amazing', 'bad', 'ugly', 'good', 'good', 'new', 'first', 'initial', 'simple', 'complex', 'bad', 'ugly', 'compelling', 'other', 'bad', 'ugly', 'good', 'excellent', 'superb', 'great', 'good', 'more', 'impressed', 'high', 'such', 'big', 'bad', 'ugly', 'violent', 'violent', 'bad', 'boring', 'dull', 'good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'amazing', 'gorgeous', 'sweeping', 'impressive', 'good', 'good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'amazing'];0.0256749311294766
2;bkoganbing;bearing in mind that i think westerns are an american art form and i have an aversion to the european made ones, sergio leone's the good the bad and the ugly has a lot to recommend it. not the least of which the impact it had on clint eastwood's career making him an american icon. the good the bad and the ugly follows an odyssey of three men, two of them a pair of lowlifes and the third no better than he ought to be in a search for buried gold. it's quite the odyssey that clint eastwood, eli wallach, and lee van cleef in those title roles have in search of the loot. a minor theater of the civil war is operating in the west and all of them get caught up in it as well. clint eastwood developed and honed his laconic and cynical character who was in fact a good guy. which gives you some idea of the bad guys he faced in his western films. note that clint eastwood also never returned to the spaghetti western after this film. van cleef is his usual mean self, perhaps exponentially so. one thing about him is that he's a hired killer with a strong work ethic so i guess that counts for something. when he takes a contract he follows through. as for wallach he dusts off his mexican bandit characterization that served him so well in the magnificent seven is dusted off and embellished. at one point he's got eastwood at his sadistic mercy, but when he learns of the loot, wallach's greed gets the better of him. i don't consider this the great classic that many do, but the good the bad and the ugly will satisfy most western fans.;7 October 2015;6;['american', 'bad', 'ugly', 'least', 'american', 'good', 'bad', 'third', 'well', 'minor', 'civil', 'laconic', 'cynical', 'good', 'bad', 'western', 'western', 'usual', 'mean', 'strong', 'mexican', 'magnificent', 'sadistic', 'well', 'great', 'many', 'good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'most', 'western'];-0.0145833333333333
3;Leofwine_draca;"leone's conclusion to his dollars trilogy once again shows how he had progressed as a director from the previous two films - with his style now evident and developed, his pacing slowed down to a gentle speed and exactly the right combination of editing, photography, and art direction, leone was ready to make what many consider to be his greatest film - once upon a time in the west. unfortunately, the good, the bad and the ugly is sometimes overlooked in place of that film, and although it's only the third of a trilogy, the film still has an epic feel to it. this film's main benefit over the previous two is ennio morricone's score. while his music was very good in a fistful of dollars and for a few dollars more, here it becomes the stuff of legend and one of most recognised western tunes ever written; it's also by and far morricone's best ever work, to this day. leone retains the solid eastwood from the previous two films and also brings back lee van cleef, this time playing a bad guy (unfortunately - i prefer his heroes to his villains as i like the guy). most screen time, though, is given to the magnificent seven's eli wallach, who is also excellent as the wanted criminal tuco, a man who lives by his wits and courage and isn't afraid to take risks. eastwood plays his role to perfection, as he should with so much practice. he gets to say some well-remembered lines such as ""there are two kinds of people in this world, my friend..."" van cleef is exceptionally evil and sadistic as the villain of the piece, my only complaint is that he has relatively little screen time in comparison to the other two main stars and thus feels slightly underused. also appearing are some familiar faces like luigi pistilli and rada rassimov. the plot is a wider and more political one than before, as it shows how the civil war intruded upon the quiet serenity of the old west. the brief battle scenes we do see are sweeping and epic, up there with the best put on film. leone's direction is stylish and a work of genius, and he serves up a number of odd, memorable situations. these include a shoot-out in a bombed town, complete with blackened smoking ruins; an ingenious way to remove handcuffs; and the blowing up of a bridge. the scene is also set for one of the best sequences in cinema; the confrontation between wallach, van cleef, and eastwood in the cemetery at the film's end. here, the music, quick photography (close-ups of people's eyes, etc.) and acting combine to make this one of the coolest, most tense showdowns in history. one must not forget the element of comedy which leone also uses to make the film lighter and more enjoyable; he succeeds well. definitely one of the best spaghetti westerns out there.";23 July 2016;10;['previous', 'evident', 'gentle', 'right', 'ready', 'many', 'great', 'bad', 'ugly', 'epic', 'main', 'previous', 'good', 'few', 'western', 'good', 'solid', 'previous', 'bad', 'most', 'magnificent', 'excellent', 'wanted', 'criminal', 'afraid', 'much', 'such', 'evil', 'sadistic', 'only', 'little', 'other', 'main', 'underused', 'familiar', 'wide', 'political', 'civil', 'quiet', 'old', 'brief', 'sweeping', 'epic', 'good', 'stylish', 'odd', 'memorable', 'complete', 'ingenious', 'good', 'quick', 'close', 'cool', 'tense', 'light', 'enjoyable', 'good'];0.134297619047619
4;SnoopyStyle;the good blondie (clint eastwood), the bad sentenza (lee van cleef), and the ugly tuco (eli wallach) are racing to find buried gold during the civil war. blondie and tuco had a scam where blondie would bring in tuco for the reward. just when tuco is about to be hanged, blondie would shot tuco down off the noose. except the last time when blondie double crossed tuco and left him behind. so comrades in crime turn into enemies. just as blondie is about to be killed by tuco, blondie hears a name from a dead soldier. that name leading to the buried gold. so enemies become comrades in crime once again. the action is bigger than before. the scale of the movie is bigger. the number of people is bigger. the sets are bigger. the battle scene is gigantic. but it's eli wallach that steals the show. he is able to bring humor into this movie. he and clint really have great chemistry together.;21 September 2013;9;['bad', 'ugly', 'civil', 'about', 'last', 'about', 'dead', 'big', 'big', 'big', 'big', 'gigantic', 'able', 'great'];-0.0299999999999999

6;Horst_In_Translation;"""il buono, il brutto, il cattivo"" or ""the good, the bad and the ugly"" is an italian co-production that is in the original also in the english language and was released back in 1966, so this one is over half a century old now already, which sadly means that almost all of the people working on it are (long) gone. but first things first. the director here is sergio leone and he is also one of many people working on the screenplay here. the movie runs for considerably over 2 hours and there are many versions out there, one of them even crossing the 3-hour mark. the cast includes many well-established actors and the big name by today's standards is of course clint eastwood who was in his mid-30s when this was made. maybe eli wallach (who almost turned 100 before his death not too long ago) is also still known to many and maybe even lee van cleef, who did not get as old as the other two. these three play the main characters in this movie we got here, the three mentioned in the title. and there is a nice introduction so we know who is who. and the ugly even gets another quick mention near the end, maybe because his one at the beginning was so short. honestly we learn a lot more about the ugly in the introduction of the good than in his own introduction. or maybe he gets the one at the end because in my opinion he was just the most memorable of the three and eli wallach also gave the best performance in the movie. already how effortlessly he looked like a hispanic was impressive because he really was a jew. and he is also the one who kept this film from becoming too serious because his character always brought in some comedy value and even during these moments when eastwood makes a short funny one-liner like along the lines of ""idiots they are talking to you"" wallach is present and his body language adds a lot to the fun element. but people should not mistake tuco for a fool. he may not be educated or a leader, but he makes up for it with grit determination and also ruthlessness. and there is also a soft side to him, he is not as cold-blooded as sentenza, who would kill anybody if he had to. tuco's soft side is especially brought out by his brother as we see during one scene and despite being a ruthless killer he believes in god and salvation it seems. he also mostly really only kills those who did something bad to him first, such as eastwood's character, but also sentenza's big henchman. sentenza really has no mercy for anybody and he is also a schemer unlike tuco. a really dangerous man, who still is a man of his word. when he makes a contract, he fulfills it. you could also call him talented when it comes to upping the ranks as you see when the two more central characters get caught in a funny sequence that involves a lot of dust. but like i said nobody here delivers the comedy as good as tuco/wallach. even if he goes over the top, it is still hilarious to watch and never feels out of place. the best example is really the scene when he all of a sudden acts like a best friend to blondie to find out the name of the grave where the treasure is hidden. by the way, i also liked at the very end that there was an actual treasure and not just some meaningful message a la ""the biggest treasure is friendship"" or so. there is none of that anyway. the three-men shootout shows it best. it is a matter of life and death. honestly if the other two, especially tuco, had been as smart as blondie they could have guessed where the treasure really is. there must be a reason he knows the name and surely it is not that the name he mentions was a deceased friend or so. also makes sense blondie does not tell tuco the real name, he is too smart for that, just like the empty name on the stone. also pretty fitting that the treasure is in the grave of an unknown soldier in terms of the political message the movie sends. it takes place during the days of the civil war and there is one lengthy sequence when tuco and blondie are led along by a captain and this is the one occasion during which the focus is not really on these two, but on the pointlesssness of war back then just like today. the bridge is the best example. they won't fight for it, but just go elsewhere and fight if it is gone. it's pretty deep and telling how the captain waits for the bridge to be destroyed and smiles before he passes. so yeah this was interesting because the sequence felt so different compared to the rest of the movie, but still it felt like an essential inclusion nonetheless. basically i could really write a novel about every single scene here. other people have said it correctly that each and every one of them adds a lot. also the small characters are memorable like the fat henchman i already mentioned. or the guy who lost a hand and wants his revenge on tuco and probably half a dozen other characters who maybe would have deserved their own movie. but good that these three got it. actually, in the german title there are only two characters mentioned and called something like crooks. i still prefer the three, even if sentenza / angel eyes is not as much in the center as the other two. now finally a few words on blondie as a big eastwood fan. he was coolness personified, but not an invincible superhero as you see from how he is tricked by tuco during the spikes scene and even if he gets away there, tuco gets him again, which shows you he knows how to get his revenge. during the lengthy desert scene he really suffers badly, but still most of the time he is nicely in control of it all. a really memorable character we got here, even if maybe how he is depicted with baby kittens was slightly too much. we get it he's the good guy, the only one really with morals and nonetheless as relentless and determined as the other two. that he cares at least a bit for other people is shown in the scene when he has too say goodbye to shorty when he found another partner in crime for his bounty hunting scam. he was not as blond as i thought he was though that he deserved the nickname. i watched this movie as part of a retrospective on ennio morricone and it was a truly nice experience. it was not the first time i saw it and honestly it did not take away any of the quality, or almost none, that i basically knew the key plot points, even if it has been a long time since i saw it. so yeah i already mentioned morricone, his soundtrack here is really as defining as it gets for the western genre which was also proved by the people dancing and moving in their seats in my showing every time the soundtrack was heard and so is the movie itself. no doubt most people consider this one of the five finest western movies ever made, if not the number one even. and i can see where they are coming from. really almost everything works out about this one, also the sound side away from the music, be it the effects of running horses or gunfire you just really felt inside the movie. what did not work out was wallach's and everybody else's glaring omission from awards bodies. oh yeah also this is one of the westerns that has no female love interest for the protagonist(s). the woman you see in bad's presentation for example is all you get. and that is perfectly fine and enough. i give it a big thumbs-up and it is a definite contender for best film of 1966. highly recommended.";2 August

8;classicsoncall;"i guess i find myself somewhat in the middle on this film, i enjoyed it to a point, but i don't get the sense that this is one of the greatest westerns ever, and the western is my favorite movie genre. i much prefer a good psychological western between complex antagonists, eastwood's own ""unforgiven"" would be an example. this was more a straightforward tale of three desperadoes consumed by greed who attempt to outwit each other on the trail to an unknown grave containing two hundred thousand dollars in gold coin. each though, earns their respective title credit in the story, even if eastwood's blondie might be the 'good' simply based on his classically rugged features. more on the plus side, it was really cool to hear the title theme music expressed in a handful of different ways throughout the story. the picture also captured the gritty realism of what the 1860's wild west was probably a lot like. you know, the more films i see of cowboys out in the desert days at a time with no access to soap and water, i start to wonder if they'll ever produce a picture that captures the fresh aroma of that experience. it's one thing to hear tuco accused of smelling like a pig, but to actually get the full flavor of that would really be something. then again, theater goers would never make it to the end of the picture - oh well for that idea. as for the film's length, i too side with those that feel it took a long time to get from point a to point b. i'm really wondering if it was necessary to bring in the civil war battle for that bridge, but it did give rise to perhaps the most meaningful scene in the picture for me. watching blondie try to ease the soldier's death with his coat and a smoke was a masterful touch. you know, i could probably go so far as to put this film in the top twenty westerns of all time, but it's position at #4 in the imdb top rankings of all pictures (as i write this) is just too much of a stretch. that's probably the reason i find myself going to that page less and less, and watching movies of all types more and more.";20 September 2007;8;['great', 'western', 'favorite', 'good', 'psychological', 'complex', 'own', 'unforgiven', 'straightforward', 'other', 'unknown', 'gold', 'respective', 'good', 'rugged', 'cool', 'different', 'gritty', 'wild', 'more', 'fresh', 'full', 'long', 'necessary', 'civil', 'meaningful', 'masterful', 'top', 'top', 'much', 'less', 'less', 'more'];0.263095238095238

11;jboothmillard;"i had not seen the ""spaghetti"" western trilogy, directed by sergio leone (a fistful of dollars, once upon a time in the west, once upon a time in america), for many years, and it made perfect sense to watch them again during the 90th birthday of the leading star. basically, set during the american civil war, a trio of bounty hunters attempt to kill fugitive mexican bandit tuco ramirez, ""the ugly"" (eli wallach). tuco shoots the three bounty hunters and escapes on horseback. elsewhere, mercenary angel eyes, ""the bad"" (lee van cleef) interrogates former confederate soldier stevens (antonio casas), to find out about the new name of jackson, a fugitive who has stolen and hidden bags of gold. steven tells angel eyes that jackson is using the new name bill carson. stevens offers the bounty hunter $1,000 to kill baker (livio lorenzon), his employer. angel eyes takes the money, but kills stevens, fulfilling his contract. he then returns to baker, collects his fee for killing stevens, and then, shoots baker. meanwhile, tuco is rescued from three bounty hunters by a drifter, a ""man with no name"" to whom tuco refers as ""blondie"" (clint eastwood), who takes him to the local sheriff (john bartha) to collect his $2,000 bounty. as tuco is about to be hanged, blondie sets tuco fre, shooting the noose. the two escape on horseback and split the bounty in a lucrative money-making scheme. they repeat the process in another town for more reward money. blondie grows weary of tuco's complaints and abandons him without horse or water in the desert. tuco manages to walk to a village, and tracks blondie down. he plans to force him to hang himself before union forces distract him, and blondie is able to escape. tuco manages to recapture blondie and forces to walk across the desert until he collapses from dehydration. as tuco prepares to shoot him, he sees a runaway carriage. inside are several dead confederate soldiers and a near-death bill carson (antonio casale), who promises tuco $200,000 in gold, buried in a grave in sad hill cemetery. tuco demands to know the name on the grave, but carson collapses from thirst before answering. when tuco returns with water, carson has died, but blondie, slumped next to him, reveals that carson told him the name on the grave before dying. tuco is now motivated to keep blondie alive, he gives him water and takes him to a nearby mission to recover. after blondie's recovery, the two leave in confederate uniforms from carson's carriage, but union soldiers capture them and take them to the prisoner of war camp of batterville. tuco answers to the name ""bill carson"" during roll call, gaining the attention of angel eyes, disguised as a union sergeant. angel eyes tortures tuco, who reveals the name of the cemetery, but confesses that only blondie knows the name on the grave. knowing he will not talk if tortured, angel eyes offer blondie an equal share of the gold and a partnership. blondie agrees and rides out with angel eyes and his gang. tuco is packed on a train to be executed, but escapes. blondie, angel eyes, and his henchmen arrive in an evacuated town; tuco eventually makes his way to the same town. tuco takes a bath, during which he is surprised by one of the earlier three bounty hunters, elam (al mulock), but he manages to shoot him dead. blondie investigates the gunshots and finds tuco, they agree to resume their old partnership. the pair kill angel eyes's men, but angel eyes himself has escaped. tuco and blondie travel toward sad hill, but their way is blocked by a battle between union troops and the confederates. blondie decides to destroy the bridge to disperse the two armies and allow them access to the cemetery. as they wire the bridge with explosives, tuco suggests they share information, in case one person dies before he can help the other. tuco reveals the name of the cemetery, while blondie says ""arch stanton"" is the name on the grave where the gold is buried. after the bridge explodes, the armies disperse. on their way, blondie finds a dying soldier, but is unable to help him, he takes a poncho following the young man's death. tuco steals a horse and rides to sad hill to claim the gold for himself, but blondie fires a cannon, causing him to fall, and fires further to intimidate him. tuco eventually makes it to the cemetery and runs, passing the various graves, to find the named grave marker. he finds the name arch stanton and begins digging, and blondie arrives and encourages him at gunpoint to continue. moments later, angel eyes surprises them both. blondie opens stanton's grave, revealing only a skeleton, no gold. blondie states that he lied and offers to write the real name of the grave on a rock, placing it face-down in the courtyard of the cemetery, challenging tuco and angel eyes to a three-way duel. the trio stare each other down in a mexican standoff. everyone draws, and blondie shoots and kills angel eyes, while tuco discovers that his own gun was unloaded by blondie the night before. blondie reveals that the gold is actually in the grave beside arch stanton's, marked ""unknown"". tuco digs and elated to find the six bags of gold pieces, but blondie holds him at gunpoint. he orders him into a hangman's noose, standing balanced precariously on top of an unsteady grave marker beneath a tree. blondie takes half the gold and rides away. as tuco screams for mercy, blondie returns into sight. from the distance, blondie fires a rifle shot at the rope, dropping tuco, alive but tied up, onto his share of the gold. tuco curses loudly while blondie rides off into the horizon. eastwood as the iconic ""man with no name"" is cool, looking steely eyed, smoking cigars, wearing a few different costumes, ending in his iconic poncho, it is said most of his dialogue was cut to make him more mysterious, this third and final film cemented him as an international superstar. the film does have lip-sync and dubbing issues, it is admittedly long, but for eastwood, the likeable wallach, the civil war battle sequence, the violence, the final showdown, and the memorable score by ennio morricone, this is a fantastic classic western. clint eastwood was number 18 on the 100 greatest movie stars, and he was number 61 on the 100 greatest pop culture icons, and the film was number 46 on the 100 greatest films. outstanding!";15 November 2005;10;['spaghetti', 'western', 'many', 'perfect', 'american', 'civil', 'fugitive', 'ugly', 'mercenary', 'bad', 'former', 'confederate', 'new', 'new', 'local', 'about', 'lucrative', 'more', 'weary', 'able', 'tuco', 'runaway', 'several', 'dead', 'confederate', 'near', 'tuco', 'tuco', 'alive', 'nearby', 'confederate', 'equal', 'same', 'early', 'dead', 'old', 'sad', 'other', 'unable', 'young', 'sad', 'various', 'grave', 'real', 'challenging', 'other', 'mexican', 'own', 'unknown', 'balanced', 'unsteady', 'grave', 'tuco', 'alive', 'iconic', 'cool', 'eyed', 'few', 'different', 'iconic', 'most', 'mysterious', 'third', 'final', 'international', 'dubbing', 'long', 'likeable', 'civil', 'final', 'memorable', 'fantastic', 'classic', 'great', 'great', 'great', 'outstanding'];0.1276806526806526
12;Tweekums;"this classic spaghetti western follows three men as the search for a quarter of a million dollars during the american civil war. the first 'angel eyes' is a gun for hire who learns the name of the man who stole the money from one of his victims. the other two are tuco and 'blondie' have been working a scam where blondie turns in tuco for the reward money then rescues him to do it again in another town till they have a falling out. shortly afterwards they come across a confederate coach that just happens to contain the man angel eyes was looking for; he tells tuco about the gold and the name of the cemetery where it is buried then, while tuco is getting him water he tells blondie the name on the grave if either of them are to get their hands on the money they will have to work together. things don't go according to plan and they have a run in with angel eyes; he gets the name of the cemetery from tuco then offers blondie the same 50/50 deal he had with tuco. ultimately the three of them will be reunited in the cemetery but which of them will get the gold. this is probably the best known of the spaghetti westerns and deservedly so. it starts with a quiet menace as we are introduced to angel eyes (the bad) then shows a touch of cynical humour as we are introduced to tuco (the ugly) and blondie (the good). the plot is fairly simple but the journey for our protagonists will be anything but as the travel through the war torn american south west towards a grave in a remote cemetery. their journey will be full of betrayals as each tries to get the information that will cut the others out of the deal. people who are used to classic american made westerns may be a little surprised that there are no heroes here; all three protagonists are venal, cynical and would happily kill the others for the cash this of course is what makes the film so refreshing! it is also quite violent for a film of its time with numerous shootings and plenty of blood. director sergio leone captures the action perfectly and the cast do a fine job. clint eastwood brings a dry humour to the role of blondie, lee van cleef is delightfully unpleasant as angel eyes and eli wallach is great as tuco. the story has plenty of action, some amusing moments and even a few touching scenes such as when tuco meets his brother. the spanish scenery looks spectacular and more like the 'wild west' than many westerns churned out in california. it is impossible to comment on this film without mentioning ennio morricone's score; it is brilliant throughout but there are some scenes that will have the viewer reaching for the remote to crank up the volume; not only does it sound great it also fits with the action. overall i heartily recommend this; it is deservedly considered a classic.";25 November 2015;10;['classic', 'western', 'american', 'civil', 'first', 'other', 'tuco', 'confederate', 'tuco', 'same', 'quiet', 'bad', 'cynical', 'ugly', 'simple', 'remote', 'full', 'classic', 'little', 'surprised', 'venal', 'cynical', 'refreshing', 'violent', 'numerous', 'fine', 'dry', 'unpleasant', 'great', 'tuco', 'amusing', 'few', 'touching', 'such', 'spanish', 'spectacular', 'wild', 'many', 'impossible', 'brilliant', 'great'];0.0386904761904761

16;BA_Harrison;'the good' is sharp-shooter blondie (clint eastwood), although how someone who runs a bounty racket, betrays his friend, and shoots numerous people dead can be deemed good is beyond me. bandit tuco (eli wallach) is 'the ugly', which i think is a little unfair to the bloke: he's no george clooney, but he's not quasimodo either. that leaves cold-hearted killer angel eyes (lee van cleef) as 'the bad', which he most definitely is, even going so far as to kill a child in order to achieve his goals. after blondie and tuco chance upon a dying confederate soldier who reveals to them the whereabouts of a fortune in gold, the pair come to the attention of angel eyes, who will do anything to lay his hands on the treasure. the good, the bad and the ugly, the third film in sergio leone's dollars trilogy, is an epic spaghetti western that benefits from iconic central characters, an undeniable sense of cool, and, of course, that classic ennio morricone soundtrack (waaawawah, waa waa waa!). where the film doesn't fare quite so well is in the pacing and storytelling, the basic plotthree guys go in search of hidden treasurestretched painfully thin, particularly in the extended cut, which clocks in at approximately three hours. the expansive historical backdropthe american civil warfrequently detracts from the flow of the story and leone has a tendency to labour a little too much over his style, lingering on his characters for an eternity and repeating similar shots ad nasueum, all of which causes scenes to drag. fortunately, some nice touches of humour and a couple of neat plot twists help to make matters a little easier to digest. 6/10. not quite as hard-going as once upon a time in the west, but not a patch on the earlier dollars movies, or indeed, leone's underrated a fistful of dynamite.;28 May 2015;6;['sharp', 'numerous', 'dead', 'good', 'ugly', 'little', 'unfair', 'quasimodo', 'cold', 'hearted', 'bad', 'confederate', 'bad', 'ugly', 'third', 'epic', 'western', 'iconic', 'central', 'undeniable', 'cool', 'classic', 'basic', 'plotthree', 'hidden', 'extended', 'expansive', 'historical', 'american', 'civil', 'little', 'similar', 'nice', 'neat', 'little', 'easy', 'early', 'underrated'];-0.0715773809523809
17;Quinoa1984;"...and though those last several words could also be attributed to leone's ""once upon a time"" films (west and america) as well as the other pieces in his trilogy of films with clint eastwood- fistful of dollars and for a few more dollars- arguably this is the most ambitious and spellbinding one of the bunch, and one that has inspired (i.e. quentin tarantino, sam raimi, robert rodriguez) and will most likely continue to inspire filmmakers and fans into the 21st century. there's something in the good, the bad, and the ugly that's nearly (or perhaps is) mythical in it's craft, certain scenes come off as being more than relevant and exquisite for that scene/sequence- it transcends into aspects of humanity. for example, in the first part of the film (this is after the extraordinary introductions to tuco, played by eli wallach, sentenza or 'angel eyes', played by lee van cleef, and as blondie by a 35/36 year old clint), joe gets tuco out of a hanging, which is something of a regular practice for them, but joe decides to leave his 'buddy' out in the desert to walk the rest of the way back into town. a little later, the situation gets reversed, as tuco has a horse and water and joe doesn't, and they both go to cross the desert. leone decides to not follow tuco coming back to town as much as he follows in earnest tuco and joe going across that desert, as joe starts to burn and dry up, going towards a story that will soon unfold. there is something to these scenes that i can barely describe, that they're executed in the mind-set of a western, but in the abstract leone lets the audience know this is a story that is bold and bigger than life. what makes much of the good, the bad, and the ugly such a huge success is the trust leone had in his own style he spun into his own after the first two westerns, his trust in his collaborators, and in his leading players as well. i, for one, had to mistakenly figure out that it is near depressing to watch this film on a regular vcr tape due to the pan & scan process. there is such a clear, distinct visual scope that leone and camera director tonino delli colli achieve that it's practically a must to get the dvd (preferably the extended version, which was leone's original cut more or less). the editing, too, is unique in many sequences (the climax is the most noted and memorable). the score, with usual collaborator ennio morricone, is one of the landmark movie scores, and themes, of not just in the western genre but in all movie history. and the three main players who take on the screen have their own chops to show off: eastwood, technically, was playing a joe that took place before fistful of dollars, yet by this film had it down to a t (it's still my favorite performance from him, despite having few words and reactions); cleef's cold, cunning angel eyes steals the scenes he's in; ditto for wallach, who gets under the skin of his co-patriots as much as he sometimes does under the viewer's. if anyone really stays in the mind, at least for me, it's wallach - especially as he gets the most 'character', and one of the very best scenes is between tuco and his religious brother. without that scene, the movie actually wouldn't work quite as well, surprisingly enough. overall, the good, the bad and ugly, is an entirely satisfying western, at least one of my five favorites ever made, and it's an endearing bravo to all who were involved.";1 January 2004;10;['last', 'several', 'other', 'few', 'more', 'ambitious', 'bad', 'ugly', 'mythical', 'certain', 'more', 'relevant', 'first', 'extraordinary', 'sentenza', 'old', 'regular', 'little', 'reversed', 'earnest', 'western', 'abstract', 'bold', 'big', 'much', 'bad', 'ugly', 'huge', 'own', 'own', 'first', 'depressing', 'regular', 'clear', 'distinct', 'visual', 'delli', 'extended', 'original', 'less', 'unique', 'many', 'noted', 'memorable', 'usual', 'western', 'main', 'own', 'favorite', 'few', 'cold', 'cunning', 'least', 'good', 'religious', 'bad', 'ugly', 'western', 'least', 'endearing'];0.0434990662931839

""the good, the bad, and the ugly"" became leone's most expensive western to date and he set the action against the american civil war. naturally, all three eponymous characters are a little larger than life themselves. the relationship between the eastwood as well as the van cleef character changed drastically because van cleef was not playing colonel douglas mortimer. ironically, van cleef's character was named 'angel eyes,' and he made his living as a man who hunts down other men and kills them for a price. no, ""the bad"" isn't a bounty hunter. meantime, ""the good"" brings in a slimy, profane mexican bandit named tuco. he collects the reward on tuco's head, and later shoots the noose from around tuco's neck, so the slippery mexican can escape. later, blondie and tuco split the money. this relationship comes to an end because blondie doesn't think that tuco will be worth more than $3-thousand. clocking in at 180 minutes, ""the good, the bad, and the ugly"" bristles with shoot-outs. live is cheap in the world of the italian western and the horses outnumber the corpses. money means everything. the three protagonists refuse to let a national catastrophe like the civil war interfere with their plans to find the cashbox. eventually, they do and confront each other in a massive graveyard to shoot it out. anybody who considers himself or herself a connoisseur of spaghetti westerns must watch ""the good, the bad, and the ugly."" this savage western made quite an impression on audiences when it was released and grammy award-winning composer ennio morricone's orchestral soundtrack emerged as a hit on american music charts.";24 August 2010;10;['western', 'bad', 'ugly', 'tenacious', 'confederate', 'strong', 'memorable', 'united', 'big', 'big', 'big', 'western', 'bad', 'ugly', 'first', 'fistful', 'continental', 'few', 'more', 'second', 'american', 'heavy', 'entire', 'western', 'more', 'fistful', 'bad', 'ugly', 'american', 'magnificent', 'third', 'american', 'bad', 'ugly', 'bad', 'ugly', 'expensive', 'american', 'civil', 'eponymous', 'large', 'other', 'bad', 'good', 'slimy', 'profane', 'mexican', 'slippery', 'worth', 'more', 'bad', 'ugly', 'cheap', 'italian', 'national', 'civil', 'interfere', 'other', 'massive', 'bad', 'ugly', 'grammy', 'orchestral', 'american'];-0.1323412698412698

41;lasttimeisaw;sergio leone's third piece of the dollars trilogy, years ago i watched a fistful of dollars (1964, 7/10), but for a few dollars more (1965) is still sitting laid-back in my waiting to see list. i wish my jumpy sequence might not hinder the logical understanding of the film, although it is never a major concern of mr. leone and his team. i cannot claim myself an ardent western genre follower, also without any trickle of fetish towards neither guns or other weaponry, nor killing for fun, plus being an out-and-out urbanite, my natural response over the usual tonal settings of western films is quite nonchalant (also the bleak milieu is not my preference to admire), what i need to fathom is whether it will evince any on-screen dynamite to maintain a buoyant vibe through its storytelling and action. the good, the bad and the ugly, without any doubt, has done a crack job here, the lengthy narrative never cease to fall into tepid, three leading characters are richly depicted with accumulated details and minor plots, eli wallach's the ugly, who receives the most amount of screen time and rendered as a complete hypocrisy and opportunist, is the arch-protagonist, eastwood and van cleef's roles are less colorful but more pragmatic to be idolized in the hero and anti-hero cinema realm. one cannot evade morricone's masterly work (not only in leone's filmography), but here, his knack of enhancing the whole film's temperament has been comprehensively facilitated, the hyena-mimicking theme tune for me is something worth persisting for my entire life. the very much discussed and highly appreciated mexican standoff could be regarded as the pinnacle of the wholesome western films, leone's obsession with relentless close-ups is another trademark of its own kind. leone's film career is an underachieved one, and most of his fame has been accruing after his untimely decease in 1989 at the age of 60, with only 7 feature films under his rein (another one i have watched is his swan song once upon a time in america, 1984, 8/10), if only he could live a bit longer, his feat would easily stride outside his comfort zone and evolve himself and his work with the time, like what martin scorsese has attained. what should i whine about the film? i really cannot say it explicitly, the only thing impedes me from rating it higher is the innate trait of the grumpy and grubby world, which seems to me like a pit on earth.;23 October 2012;8;['third', 'few', 'more', 'jumpy', 'logical', 'major', 'ardent', 'western', 'other', 'out', 'urbanite', 'natural', 'usual', 'tonal', 'western', 'nonchalant', 'bleak', 'buoyant', 'bad', 'ugly', 'lengthy', 'minor', 'ugly', 'most', 'complete', 'colorful', 'pragmatic', 'anti', 'hero', 'masterly', 'whole', 'facilitated', 'hyena', 'worth', 'entire', 'mexican', 'wholesome', 'western', 'relentless', 'close', 'own', 'underachieved', 'most', 'untimely', 'only', 'innate', 'grumpy', 'grubby'];-0.0120192307692307
42;MovieAddict2016;"sergio leone is arguably the most visionary director of all time. they say that before he even had a written script he could picture exactly what was to be on screen and the camera's direction in leading his characters. it was sergio's world - an alternate place in an alternate time that he was free to control. he controlled the audience and his story like no other director. to me, his best film was the one that was on many critics' ten worst films of 1984 list: ""once upon a time in america."" i love the finished director's cut, the cut of the film sergio leone himself wanted and pictured in his mind while filming the movie. unfortunately, the editor of the film cut everything into a two-hour picture and messed up the timeline for the theatrical release in 1984 - the result was a disastrous motion picture that now, with the director's cut, stands as one of the best of all time. james woods once said that one of the critics who named it the worst film of 1984 later named it the best film of the decade. ""once upon a time in america"" was sergio's dream project, one that took him ten years to get on the big screen and ultimately killed him by sucking the life out of him, but ""the good, the bad and the ugly"" (1967) was undoubtably his most visual film. the extreme close-ups, the great way he lets the audience see nothing but what he wants - as far as he saw it, the audience should not wonder what is off-screen; whatever is within the frames is all there is. compared to ""once upon a time"" it seems a bit more corny and unrealistic - but it is a spaghetti western, and that is simply the point. it stands above the rest as the best spaghetti western of them all. leone is best remembered for his extreme close-ups. director quentin tarantino once said, among many other things about leone, his role model, that when he started out he knew not many camera directions, so when he wanted an extreme close-up in a film he'd shout, ""i want a sergio leone on this guy!"" quentin tarantino has such a respect for leone that he even suggested the title ""once upon a time in mexico"" to director robert rodriguez, the title, of course, a derivation on ""once upon a time in the west"" and ""once upon a time in america,"" both films of sergio leone. ""the good, the bad and the ugly,"" a.k.a. ""buono, il bruto, il cattivo, il,"" is the final film in the dollars trilogy - ""a fistful of dollars,"" ""for a few dollars more,"" and, of course, ""the good, the bad and the ugly."" i have yet to see this film's predecessors, but i doubt they are much better than this film. it isn't really about anything per se - it's a showcase of art and camera techniques. it is a showcase for sergio leone and a great one at that. i have no real care about the themes or outcomes - i simply enjoy being controlled by a masterful director such as leone. when there's a director who can literally push in and give the audience specifically what he wants them to see, without the audience feeling cheated, you know you have a great director, because there's a fine line between a selfish director and a visionary director. leone has a bit of both, so indistinct that it is hard to notice. the same thing was done in carol reed's ""the third man"" (1949), and the same is done here. and it is pulled off without any objections from the audience. clint eastwood is the good - he rides around the desert kidnapping criminals, giving them to the authorities and claiming reward money, and then freeing the criminals before they are to be hanged. he meets tuco (eli wallach), a.k.a. the ugly, and does his routine - but the ugly fights back and, ultimately, kidnaps good ol' clint, taking him into the desert and practically torturing him in the heat. then the good overhears where a stash of gold is hidden from a dying man. the ugly wants the gold so much that he nurses the good back to health so that they can go off on a wild goose chase and search for the treasure. but there is already another man searching for the treasure - angel eyes, a.k.a. the bad (lee van cleef), a man whose skills at gunfighting match those of the good, a true marksman if ever there was such a thing. there's a terrific scene towards the end of ""the good, the bad and the ugly,"" where three men have found the gold buried in a graveyard. at exactly the same time. they each have guns pointed at each other. they could all pull their triggers and die, or kill one of the three and the two could then take the money and split it. leone zooms in with his extreme close-ups and truly gives the audience a sense of paranoia, a sense of what it would feel like in a circumstance such as that. sergio leone is a great director, perhaps the most visionary of all time, and now that his films are turning up again with their intended running times, the realization strikes and sinks in. he's an even better director than we thought he was. 5/5 stars - john ulmer";3 October 2003;9;['visionary', 'alternate', 'alternate', 'free', 'other', 'good', 'many', 'bad', 'finished', 'theatrical', 'disastrous', 'good', 'bad', 'good', 'big', 'bad', 'ugly', 'visual', 'extreme', 'close', 'great', 'more', 'unrealistic', 'western', 'good', 'western', 'extreme', 'close', 'many', 'other', 'many', 'extreme', 'bad', 'ugly', 'final', 'few', 'more', 'bad', 'ugly', 'well', 'great', 'real', 'masterful', 'such', 'great', 'fine', 'selfish', 'visionary', 'indistinct', 'hard', 'same', 'third', 'same', 'good', 'ugly', 'routine', 'ugly', 'good', 'good', 'wild', 'bad', 'true', 'terrific', 'bad', 'ugly', 'same', 'other', 'extreme', 'close', 'such', 'great', 'well'];0.0114754098360655

44;Red-Barracuda;"the good, the bad and the ugly will always be near the pinnacle of the western genre. there are several reasons for this. for one thing, it has never really dated at all in all these years. the immorality of its central three characters is a factor of course. the black and white moral certainties of the traditional american western are nowhere to be found here. one of the reasons for this is the film's italian origins. the movies of italy had no qualms with projecting morally ambiguous heroes onto the screen. nor did they see any issue with and filling their stories with plenty of violence. add to this, the italian tradition of operatic drama and you have the basic ingredients of the spaghetti western. the immorality, cynicism, violence and operatic sense of drama were the template where this most american of genres was filtered through, the result was a somewhat distinctive sub-genre. but what makes the good, the bad and the ugly stand out from most spaghetti westerns is because of the personnel behind and in front of the camera. clint eastwood, lee van cleef and, especially, eli wallach all shine in their respective roles of 'the good', 'the bad' and 'the ugly'. while behind the scenes were two monumental cinematic giants in the form of director sergio leone and composer ennio morricone. these latter two form one of the most outstanding director-composer partnerships in the history of the medium. leone shoots the film with consummate brilliance, with extreme close-ups and widescreen vistas; he has an understanding of cinematic space like few others, while he paces events within that space in a highly individual way - he takes his time, is quite minimalistic yet is always dramatic and at times epic. of course the film would not be anywhere near the masterpiece it is without the contribution of morricone. the soundtrack in this film is quite honestly legendary. if you were to have looked at his ideas on paper without hearing the end result you would be forgiven for thinking that this music would be wildly inappropriate for a western - electric guitars, feedback, chanting, avant-garde elements - yet it hardly needs saying that the result is one of the greatest examples of film music ever composed. it will always remain so. the fact that the film is epic, yet simultaneously tough, muscular and cynical is a somewhat unusual combination. it's storyline of greed, betrayal and brutality is not one usually given the epic treatment. no doubt this is one of the aspects that confused critics back in the 60's who disparaged this film. it does seem extraordinary from a modern perspective that this movie was greeted with a lukewarm reception. but i suppose this may explain why it seems nowadays to not have dated at all - it was clearly ahead of its time. its fair to say that this will always be a template example of the western genre, and one of the great films in general.";3 October 2011;8;['bad', 'ugly', 'western', 'several', 'central', 'black', 'white', 'moral', 'traditional', 'american', 'italian', 'ambiguous', 'italian', 'operatic', 'basic', 'western', 'operatic', 'most', 'american', 'distinctive', 'bad', 'ugly', 'most', 'respective', 'bad', 'ugly', 'monumental', 'cinematic', 'latter', 'outstanding', 'extreme', 'close', 'widescreen', 'cinematic', 'few', 'individual', 'minimalistic', 'dramatic', 'epic', 'legendary', 'inappropriate', 'western', 'electric', 'avant', 'garde', 'great', 'epic', 'tough', 'muscular', 'cynical', 'unusual', 'epic', 'confused', 'extraordinary', 'modern', 'lukewarm', 'western', 'great', 'general'];-0.0295679012345678

49;ElMaruecan82;"introduction : a nasty face full of scars and sunburns suddenly fills the screen, covering the extended vision of the sierra landscape : a curious opening, creating two incongruous feelings of authentic yet comical ugliness. this sums up the very essence of the 'western spaghetti', a pivotal sub-genre that traced the singular evolution, hence the survival, of the western genre in two polar opposite directions : the ""anticonformity"" and the ""overconformity"" or let's just simplify and say ""demystification"" and ""amplification"". demystifaction: akira kurosawa's innovative ""yojinbo"" ended the classic 'good vs. bad' antagonism, which directly inspired sergio leone. like ""a fistful of dollars"", the realism of ""the good, the bad and the ugly"" lies within the lack of morality of the three main characters, each of them has malicious motives. leone's intuition over using kurosawa's characterizations proved to be useful for the western genre that was begging for a metamorphosis. john ford's era was over, and with all due respect to john wayne, everyone knew how the west was won, and were tired of the pompous idealism displayed, despite the breath-taking imagery of monument valley. even the mythic civil war, the powerful symbol of the fraternal fight that ultimately consolidated the american spirit, is treated like a vulgar subplot, which somewhat betrays the foreign aspect of the film, and in the same way, sweeps off all the dust of semi-propaganda stuff disguised in entertainment. the myth was agonizing, and the 'western spaghetti' genre proceeded to a sort of creative destruction. take the three main characters, the irony in the title, is that all their 'nicknames' are interchangeable, there is something ugly in the bad, and vice versa, and the good isn't 'boy-scout' good. listen to the opening credits, flute for blondie, clint eastwood as the good, ocarina for sentenza, lee van cleef as the bad and human voices for eli wallach as tuco, the ugly. different instruments were used for each but they all play the same iconic melody, inspired from the howling of a coyote. symbolically, each character is different, but the deadly greed inhabiting their hearts is the same, it's ""the good, the bad and the ugly"" rather than ""the good vs. the bad vs. the ugly"". their relationships are all tactical, cynical and hypocritical, with friendships based on a mutual need to reach a hidden gold. the good and the bad need each other, because they know half the secret about the gold's location, and sentenza, need them alive to find it. they're all tied to each other until the strongest and cleverest wins; this was the humanistic reality during the dark ages of the last century. amplification: i guess the fact that i watched it for the first time when i was 10, built my personal affection to the film, because at that age, my expectations were not tarnished by the cynicism of the classic know-it-all film buff. for me, the three characters were not similar; the good was the hero, the bad, the villain, and the ugly, the comic relief. they happen to be the only recognizable actors' faces in the film, but it hardly matters because we don't need them overshadowed by other supporting performances. eli wallach, in a career-defining role, is the fastest talking and provides the best moments of the film as the indisputable scene stealer. his humor also relies on the exciting duo he formed with blondie whose cool sense of humor, and cynical detachment proved at many occasions to be the yin to tuco's yang. and lee van cleef is the senseless, cold-blooded killer who makes the ugly look good. he represents the dark side of the film, a man who always finishes his job, and from the first scene involving him, i took him as the bad guy of the story. the characterization is why i loved the film both as a kid and as a movie buff. the line between amplification and parody is very thin, but there's a difference. when parody takes all the conventions into derision, amplification insists on them, providing the typical leonesque shots. time is dilated, locations are magnified, like belonging to a unique dimension, and the whole film oscillates between extreme close-ups and extended shots from very far away. all the effects are amplified with cinematic hyperbolas exceeding the limit of believability. in his 'great movies' review, ebert stated that leone invented a rule which consisted on the characters' point of view limited by the screen. i never understood until i re-watched the film and got it, and i respect leone even more for having pushed the limits of creativity to this point since most of the greatest effects from the film depend on that rule, and are transcended by the iconic score of the musical genius, ennio morricone. ""the good, the bad and the ugly"" has all the tragic, comic, epic and musical elements that makes it a kind of operatic masterpiece. conclusion : film-making is far from being an exact science, and you can make a masterpiece out of the least complex plot elements, the lowest budget, and the cleverest directorial tricks. not to diminish the quality of leone's ""the good, the bad and the ugly"" but the point is that the movie works as if it was self-aware of its own restrictions and transcended it with a magic that another director, wouldn't have judged necessary. some apparent weaknesses are sometimes the necessary drivers to push the creation to the limit of genius while confidence can work as a tricky obstacle, maybe that explains why ""the good, the bad and the ugly"" is the highest ranked western on imdb top 250 and undoubtedly the most iconic. so, to conclude, i would simply say that there's two kinds of people in this world, those who love the film, and those who don't get it ...";30 July 2011;10;['nasty', 'full', 'extended', 'curious', 'incongruous', 'authentic', 'comical', 'very', 'western', 'pivotal', 'singular', 'western', 'polar', 'opposite', 'innovative', 'classic', 'good', 'bad', 'bad', 'ugly', 'main', 'malicious', 'useful', 'western', 'due', 'tired', 'pompous', 'mythic', 'civil', 'powerful', 'fraternal', 'vulgar', 'foreign', 'same', 'semi', 'propaganda', 'western', 'creative', 'main', 'interchangeable', 'ugly', 'bad', 'good', 'bad', 'human', 'ugly', 'different', 'same', 'iconic', 'different', 'deadly', 'same', 'bad', 'ugly', 'bad', 'ugly', 'tactical', 'cynical', 'hypocritical', 'mutual', 'hidden', 'bad', 'other', 'alive', 'other', 'strong', 'cleverest', 'humanistic', 'dark', 'last', 'first', 'personal', 'classic', 'similar', 'bad', 'ugly', 'comic', 'only', 'recognizable', 'other', 'fast', 'good', 'indisputable', 'exciting', 'cool', 'cynical', 'many', 'cold', 'blooded', 'ugly', 'good', 'dark', 'first', 'bad', 'thin', 'typical', 'unique', 'whole', 'extreme', 'close', 'cinematic', 'great', 'most', 'great', 'iconic', 'musical', 'bad', 'ugly', 'tragic', 'comic', 'epic', 'musical', 'operatic', 'exact', 'least', 'complex', 'low', 'clever', 'directorial', 'bad', 'ugly', 'aware', 'own', 'necessary', 'apparent', 'necessary', 'tricky', 'bad', 'ugly', 'high', 'western', 'iconic'];-0.063440366972477
50;bensonmum2;"i know some movie fans who consider the good, the bad and the ugly the best movie ever made. while i don't even think it's the best thing sergio leone made, it's a solid spaghetti western that has all but transcended the sub-genre. there are images, such as clint eastwood in the poncho, and music, like the main title theme, that are known by people who have never seen the movie. i also know people who wouldn't be caught dead watching a movie made outside of the usa who love the good, the bad and the ugly. i can't think of another italian made film, let alone an italian made western, that has become so universally known and enjoyed. there are so many moments in the good, the bad and the ugly that i enjoy. one of my favorites is that of tuco running through the cemetery as morricone's ""the ecstasy of gold"" plays in the background. it literally gives me goosebumps. it's one of those movie moments that i look forward to no matter how many times i've seen them. i'm also a fan of the techniques leone used in the good, the bad and the ugly. leone's use of the widescreen shots of the landscape inter-cut with extreme close-ups of faces is brilliant. it adds a sense of intimacy to vastness of the setting that allows the viewer feel like they're part the movie and gain some insight into the characters. it's a technique that very few other filmmakers have the guts to employ. but i sincerely doubt that leone's film would be so widely and wildly regarded if it weren't for the music of ennio morricone. i've already mentioned the main title theme and ""the ecstasy of gold"", but these are only two examples found in this amazing score. can you imagine the final showdown without morricone's music? i can't think of many instances where music and film go together to create such tension and anticipation. i've already used the word ""brilliant"" to describe leone, but it's also applicable to morricone. finally, the good, the bad and the ugly wouldn't be the same without the three lead actors. each, at least in this movie, is brilliant (there's that word again) in his own right. clint eastwood is ""the good"". he's ""the good"" in the sense that he's not as ""bad"" as the other two. lee van cleef is ""the bad"". he's a ruthless killer who would just as soon shoot you as look at you - as long as the price was right. and then there's eli wallach as ""the ugly"". as good as eastwood and van cleef are, wallach is really something special. wallach's tuco is one of the most crazed, but complicated characters i've seen. it's a special cast for a very special movie.";2 July 2006;9;['bad', 'ugly', 'good', 'good', 'solid', 'western', 'such', 'main', 'dead', 'bad', 'ugly', 'italian', 'western', 'many', 'bad', 'ugly', 'many', 'bad', 'ugly', 'widescreen', 'cut', 'extreme', 'close', 'brilliant', 'few', 'other', 'main', 'amazing', 'final', 'many', 'such', 'brilliant', 'applicable', 'bad', 'ugly', 'same', 'least', 'brilliant', 'own', 'good', 'bad', 'other', 'bad', 'ruthless', 'right', 'ugly', 'good', 'special', 'complicated', 'special', 'special'];-0.0379685916919959

52;Robert_duder;"i have been a clint eastwood fan for years. but i have never watched his westerns. that's kind of idiotic isn't it?? well suddenly i'm having an eastwood movement and sinking myself into westerns for the first time in my life and it only made sense that i start with what some critics and fans call ""the greatest western ever made."" in some respects i agree with that because it embodies everything that the western is...even if you have never seen a western you know the way they are supposed to go and the good, the bad, and the ugly encompasses every aspect of the stereotypical western. also a film like this has to be judged by it's release time as well and for 1966, this film's violent and gritty story would have made heads explode and eastwood's trademark man with no name made eastwood the gosh darned coolest, slickest man in history. the story explodes into an epic 3 + hour (extended cut) film about three man of completely different personalities, backgrounds, and goals trying to find a hidden treasure by a civil war soldier and stay alive while basically beating the living daylights out of each other. the film is gritty, bleak, and the three main characters are so watchable that each one could carry their own film. clint eastwood...how can you possibly say that name and then try to critique the man's acting. if you looked up the definition of masculine in the dictionary...there his picture would be...probably from this film. eastwood's raspy voice, his ""doesn't take any crap"" attitude, and completely violent personality (in his characters of course) makes him the best gun fighter in any western. he is the perfect leading man especially for a western and he had to be the good in the good, the bad, and the ugly. eastwood is eastwood and that is the highest compliment you can give. lee van cleef embodies the bad, i mean the man has being a villain down to a science and although he doesn't share a whole lot of screen time with the stars he has his own brand of justice that makes him the perfect villain. in a lot of ways he is the polar opposite of eastwood. he still has the raspy voice, and the cool demeanor and he has this killer instinct that makes him petrifying to see on screen. but all in all he doesn't get the majority of the story and there is a lot of back story to his character left unexplored. i would have loved to see a sequel or another story where he plays angel eyes because it would have great to see him back on screen in this role. and finally i save the best for last. i have found a new absolute favorite screen character in tuco played by veteran actor eli wallach. tuco is the ugly in every way shape and form. his drunken, sarcastic, and annoying personality makes him the real stand out performance in this film. in fact he seems to get the majority of the lines and the screen time as we watch his journey to try and get rich. and on top of that the tumultuous relationship between his off again, on again partner eastwood's ""blondie"" as named by tuco. the two of them start as partners until eastwood turns on him and leaves him which only makes tuco seek revenge in a horrible way, one of the great scenes where tuco forces eastwood across the desert nearly killing him in the process. but you know that can only mean eastwood will get the last word and he does. tuco is amazing. he's hilarious, he's bumbling, but he has fantastic good luck when it comes to getting away and on top of it all despite his humorous character he's not easy to kill or a push over. he's blood thirsty, crafty and skilled as a gun man and a villain. the whole film must be watched for wallach's tuco alone. this is my first taste but not my last of eastwood westerns and sergio leone who apparently is the be all and end all of action western directors. i have the first two installments of the man with no name trilogy fired up in the vcr and ready to go. the good, the bad, and the ugly in many ways is not outstanding and yet it has this mysterious quality that just sucks you in and makes it an absolute classic. from the dusty streets of the western town amidst the brooding civil war and the front, this film encompasses everything. and you can't mention the film without pointing out that haunting western theme which almost seems like it's used comically but perhaps that's because it has been used as such in the future. you can't ever start a love for westerns without seeing this...i have no doubt. and it will permanently go down in my books as one of my favorite westerns. i will say it didn't need to be as long as it was and perhaps more of a climatic ending would have been nice but it's a classic and you can barely pick it apart. made on a million bucks and probably 100 times that made back. just see it!!

54;dromasca;seeing again the last film in the 'spaghetti westerns' trilogy was a true revelation. it already happened to me to see classical movies, live again the feelings i had at the previews viewing and discover new perspectives brought up by the years. with 'the good, the bad and the ugly' something different seems to have happened. it's my third viewing if i remember well. i scarcely remember the first one, i was a teenage and i must have seen the movie at the same time i was seeing other classic westerns like these starring john wayne. then i saw it again in the 90s and what struck me was the fabulous acting especially eli wallach's. this latest experience is different as i dare now discharge all the labels and enjoy what is best in this film - the camera art, the dynamic of the characters, the superb acting of the three lead actors, ennio morricone's music which entered the best soundtracks gallery, the color and diversity of the extras and the fresh perspective brought to a moment of history often present in the american film. by the mid 60s when sergio lepne had the chutzpah of undertaking the trilogy project western was a genre in stagnation. the period of the big films of john ford was passed over, actors like john wayne or richard widmark were beyond their pick, and westerns were not considered a source of blockbusters by the big studios.it was kind of natural to expect renewal to come from out of america, as in europe the far west space was keeping its fascination and the potential of staging eternally human dramas. after the success of the first two films in the trilogy leone wanted the third one to be a quality upgrade, more ambitious and more stylish. although he could not hire the actors he wished, he was lucky to receive as replacement eli wallach who gives here one of the best performances of his career, a combination wicked shrewdness and surviving skills, a dangerous creep with a sense of humor. the viewing is a fest from start to end. that was the period of technicolor and big screens, and leone masters the technology and the format, which fit the endless desert where most of the action happens. while filmed in spain, one can say that never had andalucia looked so texan. the local extras faces carved by wind and sun fit perfectly the cinematographic landscape. morricone's music fills in the vision in a synthesis that was played and quoted in endless movies that followed (to mention 'kill bill''s theme as the last i remember). especially visible and special is the reconstruction of the civil war background. from 'gone with the wind' to 'cold mountain' this is one of the most filmed episodes of american history, allowing for numerous mass and battle scenes. amazingly the vision of the italian leone fits perfectly in the gallery. moreover the juxtaposition of the situations of fortune seekers and of the soldiers caught in the absurd of the was allows for a comparison with anti-militaristic nuances. soldiers and adventurers play death games with little chances of survival. and yet, for at least one moment the the game of the fortune seekers seems more rational and even more human than the organized game of destruction called war. the actor that dominates the film is without any doubt clint eastwood. closing up the trilogy that launched his career, 'the good, the bad and the ugly' brings the last touches to the portrait of the man with no name from the previous movies, the soldier of fortune and killer who never draws first his gone and never kills without a reason. the script places him here in different situations than in the previous movies, but the scene of the duel in three close to the final brings him back the poncho as the sign that the cycle draws to its end. in the permanent game of trickery and death blondie is the only of the three characters that allows to himself manifestations of humanity and acts of compassion that endanger him. howevwe he knows and we know that he aims and shoots faster and better and he will eventually prevail. the final scene with eastwood's character melting in the infinite desert landscape closes up in the best possible way leone's trilogy.;27 December 2010;9;['last', 'true', 'classical', 'new', 'bad', 'ugly', 'different', 'third', 'first', 'same', 'other', 'classic', 'fabulous', 'late', 'different', 'good', 'good', 'fresh', 'present', 'american', 'big', 'big', 'natural', 'human', 'first', 'third', 'ambitious', 'stylish', 'lucky', 'good', 'dangerous', 'f', 'big', 'endless', 'most', 'texan', 'local', 'cinematographic', 'endless', 'last', 'visible', 'special', 'civil', 'cold', 'american', 'numerous', 'italian', 'anti', 'militaristic', 'little', 'rational', 'human', 'organized', 'doubt', 'bad', 'ugly', 'last', 'previous', 'different', 'previous', 'close', 'final', 'permanent', 'only', 'final', 'good', 'possible'];0.0272304210940574

(reminds me of the old king cole nursery rhyme -- ""pulled out a plum and said what a good boy am i"" -- another reference lost on those living the age of portable devices.) for those who actually care about the history of film: * leone invented a brand new genre called the italian western. his first, fistful of dollars, recycled a japanese story (yojimbo), recycled an american ex-pat whose hollywood career was officially over (eastwood) and introduced one of the greatest music composers of the modern film era, ennio morricone. * next came for a few dollars more, an original story, which locked into film history leone's trademark use of closeups and sound editing, and brought out of mothballs lee van cleef, one of the greatest ""faces"" in the history of the western. (""angel eyes"" in this one.) * with two international hits under his belt, leone aimed for the stars and created this movie which marks his legacy. while simultaneously continuing the tradition he started, and using the two stars from his second film, he gave eli wallach (an a-list star from the 1950s) the role of his career. wait there is more. he set the story against the backdrop of the civil war and manged to make the transitions seamless and brutally compelling. it is simultaneously a violent film and an anti-war film at the same time! (the only film of leone's that may compete with this one is once upon a time in america, also reviewed by this writer on the imdb). by modern standards the film is overlong and, had it been produced in america (as was indeed the case with upon a time in america), the ""suits"" would have butchered it down to 100 minutes. luckily for the rest of us, this was an international release, cut-proof, and survives very nicely to the present day in its original form. qt was a young lad when these films appeared but the impact is clear. he used morricone's music in kill bill (his best film in my view) and in my view the hateful eight tries to emulate the power of leone but falls somewhat short. for you youngsters out there, i recommend these films as some of the most entertaining efforts ever set to film, period. imitated but not duplicated. astonishing, mind-blowing, unforgettable.";9 September 2016;10;['original', 'italian', 'young', 'tarantino', 'real', 'far', 'young', 'old', 'good', 'portable', 'new', 'italian', 'first', 'fistful', 'japanese', 'american', 'great', 'modern', 'few', 'more', 'original', 'great', 'western', 'international', 'second', 'more', 'civil', 'seamless', 'compelling', 'violent', 'anti', 'war', 'same', 'only', 'modern', 'overlong', 'international', 'present', 'original', 'young', 'clear', 'good', 'hateful', 'short', 'entertaining', 'astonishing', 'unforgettable'];0.2042464114832535

60;CuriosityKilledShawn;in the last of the so-called 'dollars' trilogy eastwood now plays a man called blondie (despite clearly having brown hair) who has hooked up with tuco, a bandit with an amusingly long list of crimes, to run a reward-and-release scam with various towns and cities across the old west. soon tiring of tuco's behavior, blondie ends their volatile partnership and heads off on his own. angered by the double-cross, tuco exacts a laborious revenge on blondie, but just as the punishment reaches its zenith under a burning hot sun in a remote part of the desert a wagon carrying dead confederate soldiers interrupts. with his last breath, the sole surviving rebel tells tuco of a stash of treasure buried in a cemetery, and, while tuco is distracted, tells blondie what grave it is buried under. their difficult partnership is quickly restored as they trek across the west, through civil war conflicts, towards the treasure. so far i've only covered the good and ugly. the bad just so happens to be angel eyes (lee van cleef), a ruthless mercenary who has also learned of the hidden loot and eventually crosses paths with his rivals. he has the least screen time, but is necessary as a pure villain to lessen the crude vulgarity of tuco. it's a long film. but it's not about the destination, it's about the journey, and sergio leone allows himself plenty of time and space to indulge in quirky idiosyncrasies. i especially like tuco having a bubble bath in the midst of his current location being blown to smithereens. villains always interest me, and actors mostly choose villains over heroes as they make for better characters. blondie may comfort dying soldiers and play with kittens, but he's just too bland. angel eyes, is hardcore, and a better character, but he's nothing compared to tuco. eli wallach owns this film, and takes most of the screen time away from eastwood and van cleef. the scene where he searches the cemetery, as the camera spins around and around and around has such a beautiful innocence to it. even though tuco may have killed and robbed many this scene makes him seem like an easily excitable child at heart. it's absolutely wonderful. if you've got an evening free, and just don't know how to spend 3 otherwise empty hours, the good, the bad, and the ugly is a fine way to spend them.;23 January 2012;9;['last', 'brown', 'long', 'various', 'old', 'volatile', 'own', 'double', 'cross', 'laborious', 'hot', 'remote', 'last', 'sole', 'difficult', 'civil', 'good', 'ugly', 'bad', 'ruthless', 'hidden', 'least', 'necessary', 'pure', 'crude', 'long', 'quirky', 'current', 'well', 'bland', 'hardcore', 'well', 'most', 'beautiful', 'many', 'excitable', 'wonderful', 'free', 'empty', 'bad', 'ugly', 'fine'];-0.0118347338935574

65;ironhorse_iv;"the good, the bad and the ugly is just amazing to watch. i'm watching the 2004 extended version, with all the delete scenes in it. directed by sergio leone, this movie is the third film in the dollars trilogy following 1964's a fistful of dollars and 1965's for a few dollars more, serving as a prequel to them. thank goodness, the movie wasn't call 'the two magnificent tramps', its working title. in the united states, united artists considered using the original italian translation, river of dollars, or the man with no name, but decided on the good, the bad and the ugly. the title, the good, the bad and the ugly suite the plot so well. the plot revolves around three gunslingers, 'the good' aka 'brodie' aka 'the man with no name (clint eastwood), 'the bad' aka 'angel eyes' (lee van cleef) and 'the ugly"" mexican bandit tuco ramirez (eli wallach). all three are competing to find a fortune in buried confederate gold during the american civil war. all the actors in this film are great. clint eastwood is great. i love that the producers finally explain where his character got his trademark poncho. granted, the other two were morally worse than him, but blondie's not exactly a nice guy, too. it's more like 'the good enough'. i love, how clint eastwood and eli wallach work with each other. lots of chemistry there, yet a lot of backstabbing triathlon with the trio. tuco is the only one of the trio, the audience really gets to know all about. we meet his brother and find out where he came from and why he became a bandit. the other two are more of a mysteries. the names ""blondie"" and ""angel eyes"" aren't exactly threatening, but workable. blondie's hair is sandy brown. this is due to imperfect translation from the original italian. mad props to eli wallach for doing all the dangerous stunts as he almost got killed in real life like three times during the making of this movie. eli wallach pretty much steals the movie with his character. originally, leone wanted charles bronson to play angel eyes but he was already committed to another movie, and leone choose lee van cleef as the villain, playing opposite to the character, he plays in the 'for a few dollars more'. i glad, lee van cleef was chosen for the film. he was best as the villain. still, it does get kinda confusing, story wise seeing how the films are supposedly connect to each other. in the theatrical trailer, angel eyes is referred to as the ugly and tuco as the bad. this is due to a translation error; the original italian title translates literally to ""the good, the ugly, the bad"". still, the good, the bad and the ugly had tons of memorable lines, funny scenes, and epic action, but the movie is really long. it takes forever to get to the buried treasure part of the movie, even if you watching a way cut down version. angel eyes besides the opening, doesn't show up, until half way to the film. lots of desert scenes that they add in the 2004 version was cut out for a good reason. the movie takes a lot of side steps missions like blowing a strategic bridge, bounty hunters, and money-schemes that were entertaining, but kinda distracting as the gold plot takes a backseat, most of the first act and second. the movie has a great sweeping widescreen cinematography by director of photography tonino delli colli. the cemetery showdown is intense. i love how the movie is shot with all the dramatic extreme close ups to give the audience, a sense of tensed. the movie got tense, due to falling out between leone and clint eastwood, as eastwood got tired of all the camera shooting in different angles, sweeping long shots, and extreme close ups. both never work together again, after this. i can see why eastwood might had got upset. there is a bit too much artsy in the film, but it's not too bad. many of leone's trademarks, hugely influential to modern filmmakers. unlike a fistful of dollars nor for a few dollars more, this film had a bigger budget and its shows. mad props to the people had to build the bridge in the blowing up scene, it had to be filmed and build twice due to the camera being destroy in the first shot. another to the crew building a cemetery, just for the sad hill shootout scene. the money was well-used. i love the civil war theme. the theme shows how brutal the backdrop, the civil war was during that time and how absurd it was. the dubbing on my version was really good. love the curse cut beep. ennio morricone composed the soundtrack. the main theme is turned into one for each protagonist: the good's has a whistle, the bad's an ocarina, and the ugly's screamed. it works so well. 'story of a soldier' is beautiful. it's eerily in a way, since it play during the torture scene. i also love the score, ecstasy of gold. it's haunting at the beginning, it draws you in, slowly. then it smacks you in the face like a ton of bricks and voila! depending on what version, you're watching this movie. it can take from 161 min to 186 min. the 186 minute is dubbed. if you find the 2002 extended, it's in english, but cut to 179 min. then you have an old copy, like the 1984's version, its 142, but its cut as hell. in my opinion, just get the 2004 dvd. tons of special features on the behind the scene production, documentaries, and additional footages like too badly damaged film negative. all of them are worth the price of 2004 dvd. overall: one of the best cinematic film. worth watching if haven't yet saw.";22 April 2014;9;['bad', 'ugly', 'amazing', 'extended', 'delete', 'third', 'few', 'magnificent', 'united', 'original', 'italian', 'bad', 'ugly', 'bad', 'ugly', 'bad', 'ugly', 'american', 'civil', 'great', 'great', 'other', 'bad', 'nice', 'good', 'other', 'only', 'other', 'more', 'workable', 'sandy', 'brown', 'due', 'original', 'mad', 'dangerous', 'real', 'few', 'more', 'glad', 'good', 'confusing', 'wise', 'connect', 'other', 'theatrical', 'ugly', 'bad', 'due', 'original', 'italian', 'ugly', 'bad', 'bad', 'ugly', 'memorable', 'funny', 'epic', 'long', 'half', 'good', 'strategic', 'entertaining', 'backseat', 'most', 'first', 'second', 'great', 'sweeping', 'delli', 'intense', 'dramatic', 'extreme', 'close', 'tense', 'due', 'tired', 'different', 'long', 'extreme', 'close', 'upset', 'much', 'artsy', 'bad', 'many', 'influential', 'modern', 'few', 'big', 'mad', 'due', 'first', 'sad', 'civil', 'brutal', 'civil', 'absurd', 'good', 'main', 'ugly', 'beautiful', 'old', 'special', 'additional', 'negative', 'worth', 'good', 'cinematic', 'worth'];-0.0298822899946495

74;SAMTHEBESTEST;finally the good the bad and the ugly (1966) now that's what i call real men's cinema. no love story, no melodrama, no emotions just the bullets and machoism till the last stage. a real man would love this film more than any other love triangle story with women and romance involved in it or a happy go lucky film because this is stuff made only and only for men. i doubt any such particular film was ever made for women or will ever be made. we men are lucky, aren't we? possibly, it is the spaghetti western which was better than many big budget films in the genre. i can sense so many nuances in the screenplay where the hero proves that this is how a real man should be. the other 2 guys doesn't care much about anything but money. clint eastwood as the good proves what the real good means even in bad encounter. lee van cleef as the bad brings the cruelty into the character whereas eli wallach as tuco aka the ugly did exceptionally well. if i have to mention some iconic scenes then i would go with the introduction scene of all 3 guys in the film. one can do anything if he is paid, other one is lusty for money and the 3rd guy is one hell of a good fella, doesn't matter what the situation is. other than that, there are multiple situations which i can say are influential and iconic and have inspired so many action films over the years. the background score which is still giving me chills. the good the bad and the ugly is well known as sergio leone most hard-hitting work and totally different vision to look at a western film. the distinctive use of violence, cold blooded encounters, stylistic bullets fires and machoism of the lead hero all these things surely makes the good the bad and the ugly a classic western action film. and like i said, if you're bored of typical romance, unnecessary melodrama and mainstream dramas then this film is the most different experience for you just like it was for entire generation of 60s cinema lovers. rating- 8/10*;24 April 2020;8;['good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'real', 'last', 'real', 'more', 'other', 'happy', 'lucky', 'such', 'particular', 'lucky', 'western', 'well', 'many', 'big', 'many', 'real', 'other', 'real', 'good', 'bad', 'iconic', 'other', 'lusty', 'good', 'other', 'multiple', 'influential', 'iconic', 'many', 'good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'different', 'western', 'distinctive', 'cold', 'blooded', 'stylistic', 'lead', 'good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'classic', 'western', 'bored', 'typical', 'unnecessary', 'mainstream', 'different', 'entire'];0.0419715447154471
75;Rectangular_businessman;sergio leone's massive epic is one of my favorite films, pitting a manic eli wallach as tuco against an autistic clint eastwood (leone: eastwood has two acting emotions, with hat on and hat off). lee van cleef hovers around the the center of the film menacing everyone, although his performance fades between the tension of wallach and eastwood. ostensibly a story about the search for buried gold, gbu undercuts its exploitative surface by giving us almost beckett-like relationship between a man that is wanted for murder and his partner who turns him in for the reward and then shoots the rope off his neck, a droll comment on human existence if there ever was one. other existential moments occur in this rich film, such as the beautiful song the confederate prisoners sing while angel-eyes tortures tuco, and the essay on the nature of the futility and pointless brutality of war appears when tuco and blondie witness a battle on a bridge they must cross. chaotic, cynical, sentimental, violent, gbu resembles an opera more than anything. amazingly, when this film first appeared in 1967, most critics wrote it off as one more spaghetti western, not seeing the fatalism, the grandeur, and the comedy of this world classic. how could you watch a film with a score like morricone's finest and not be impressed? don't mistake this film for realism and criticize it on that basis, as some reviewers have done. this is not a documentary-style western (for that see mccabe & mrs. miller), but a romance, based more in the imagination, more in symbolism, bowing to the classical westerns stereotypes and cliches. 11/10;4 July 2010;10;['massive', 'favorite', 'manic', 'autistic', 'exploitative', 'like', 'human', 'other', 'existential', 'rich', 'such', 'beautiful', 'confederate', 'pointless', 'chaotic', 'cynical', 'sentimental', 'violent', 'most', 'more', 'western', 'fine', 'impressed', 'more', 'classical'];0.1058333333333333

77;johnnyboyz;"sergio leone's 1966 western the good, the bad and the ugly unfolds under this hostile, violent and hate filled umbrella of civil war america; a fitting backdrop of ongoing warfare and hostilities to which two american men and a mexican bandit strive to find a large box full of valuable coins buried out in the big country somewhere behind confederate army lines. in using a plot item as routine as said example and applying it to a relatively routine singular strand arc for the film's narrative to take, leone essentially breathes so much life into a set up and plot plan that about half way through you forget the basic bare bones of the movie and find yourself going with it, utterly immersed in the tale the director's laying out in front of you. so much has been written and said about the film, like other such examples at the top of each genre, that further comment and analysis may seem futile. the good, the bad and the ugly may very well be the pinnacle to the western as psycho might be to horror or apocalypse now to the war, for instance. if it isn't, or either of the said examples aren't, then there will still be a large cluster of individuals that would sternly argue otherwise. the film begins with a loud and confrontational title sequence, a brash and expansive manner in which to announce your film has arrived; the sort that sees a flashing of character faces and arrays of different colour, a sequence in which even the little animated horse gets the full force of a cannonball that's been fired off. it sets the tone for a no holds barred ride of guns; gunslingers and no nonsense people with no nonsense attitudes as observations of greed and that of both a mid and post-war crumbling society plays out. the film features some of the best direction i've ever seen; leone's ability to shift gears and change the film's tact from one thing to another, as loyalties shift and events take a turn for the different is near-flawless. his ability to essentially construct a number of small, minute set-pieces amidst this wide-open and dusty, hostile setting is immaculate; but the change of tact he applies later on towards the end of the film in capturing a civil war battle between the north and south is just as impressive; portraying a larger fight sequence as the inevitable showdown between the film's three main players draws nearer and that sense their showdown will be of a similarly epic proportion, despite it being just another gunfight and despite the fact all of those thus far have been between grossly outmatched participants. leone is all for spectacle and action to propel the plot, but his ability to capture the little things; the terrain and just the sounds that it omits is wonderful. the introduction of angel eyes, aka the bad (van cleef), for instance sees a young boy flee into his house on first sight of him as he arrives; angel eyes' boots stomping on a stone floor whilst he approaches an elderly man sitting at a table as a dog barks outside, all of it a routine use of composition and sfx, but the drawn out editing process; the fact a kid ran for his life at first sight of him and the semiotical driven noise of a barking dog which suggests a rabid animal or ominousness build the scene and character without anyone ever explaining or saying anything. they call him the bad because he shoots without mercy and takes without conscience, leaving a family in tatters and on another occasion beats a girl to a near pulp until she gives him what info he's looking for. the name angel eyes is wholly ironic. this makes clint eastwood's 'good' (aka blondie) and wallach's 'ugly' (aka tuco) perhaps look more favourable than they actually are when it's revealed they're mostly in it together against this blackly dressed; father/husband murdering; woman slapping figure of evil. tuco and blondie's relationship is a strange one, a mutual appreciation of one another and the death they leave in their wake. tuco would no sooner shoot blondie, than hang him, than act like they're best friends. no longer is 'the good' of a western limited to wearing the sheriff's badge and/or cleaning up towns of drunks and no-good varmints; as here, 'the good' would much rather come across as upstanding; fleece a local sheriff of $2,000 and then make off with the cash against the guy he was initially in tow with. tuco's raging attitudes are captured in a single shot that encompasses a sketching of christ on the cross as he swigs alcohol whilst wearing an eye-patch, the film at a point where tuco seems to be doing good in aiding an old friend but perhaps with a traitorous eye still on the prize as the patch acts as a visual distinction of the two sides of his face doubling up as his sinful and righteous attitudes, whereas he gives the holy trinity throughout. but the scene that encapsulates his character is in a store early on during which, betrayed and foaming at the mouth for revenge, he fondles some handguns in front of an elderly clerk before angrily discarding them. he then fondles some more and asks for bullets, drawing you into the scene in an utterly effective manner and its threat element within as we wonder what he has in store for the clerk above all else. there's a solid hour of character involvement and some set-piece exchanges which work wonderfully well; and a later juxtaposition between diegetic musical content with an interrogation brought a smirk to my face when i realised whom it was that felt so inspired to pay homage to such a sequence. the film is engrossing, rich in detail on so many levels and an absolute outright winner of a piece.";28 April 2010;10;['western', 'bad', 'ugly', 'hostile', 'violent', 'civil', 'fitting', 'ongoing', 'american', 'mexican', 'large', 'full', 'valuable', 'big', 'routine', 'routine', 'singular', 'much', 'basic', 'bare', 'other', 'such', 'further', 'futile', 'bad', 'ugly', 'western', 'large', 'loud', 'confrontational', 'expansive', 'different', 'little', 'animated', 'full', 'mid', 'post', 'war', 'good', 'different', 'flawless', 'small', 'minute', 'wide', 'open', 'dusty', 'hostile', 'immaculate', 'civil', 'impressive', 'large', 'inevitable', 'main', 'near', 'epic', 'little', 'wonderful', 'bad', 'young', 'first', 'elderly', 'routine', 'first', 'semiotical', 'rabid', 'ominousness', 'bad', 'near', 'ironic', 'good', 'ugly', 'favourable', 'strange', 'mutual', 'good', 'western', 'limited', 'good', 'local', 'single', 'old', 'traitorous', 'visual', 'sinful', 'righteous', 'holy', 'elderly', 'effective', 'solid', 'later', 'diegetic', 'musical', 'rich', 'many', 'absolute', 'outright'];0.0576822916666666

79;Movie_Muse_Reviews;"""the good, the bad and the ugly"" is cool with brains. most other action films, especially westerns, are celebrations of cool, but this film masters cool -- heck, practically invents it -- and also applies it sensibly. nothing is merely for cool's sake, it is for the sake of telling a story full of mistrust as well as one that searches for depth in the blanket adjectives of its title. set in the west during the civil war, the film identifies its characters right away: the good, blondie (eastwood), the bad, angel eyes (lee van cleef), and the ugly, tuco (eli wallach). each is after nothing but money, making the word associations merely relative to the principles that they live by. distrusting of one another, they are soon forced to work together -- specifically tuco and blondie -- in order to find 200 k in buried gold, because one of them knows which cemetery it's buried in and the other knows which grave. gold is also every word that comes out of clint eastwood's mouth. although his body of work today is enough proof of his talent, he clearly owes much of his career to director/writer sergio leone. in this their third western collaboration, leone knows what eastwood's strengths are and he gives him some killer lines. every man supposedly wants to be james bond, but every american man should want to be blondie. every time he speaks, you know you're either going to be impressed or enlightened with his machismo and/or wisdom. wallach is also invaluable to the film as tuco. he keeps things interesting playing a money- grubbing rat. in a film of this length, he helps keep things from getting too serious and dull. leone also hones his craft in this movie. his gritty close-ups and split-second gunfire shots give this film its style, suspense and power. there's some ""it"" quality to his film-making that is hard to describe, but every shot feels important or at the least cool. distinct ""chapter"" breaks also contribute to the western mythos/tall tale idea that has made the genre an important one of the 20th century. there is a clear journey-like story line that recalls what made homer's ""the odyssey"" one of the first great western (in the global sense) literary classics. there is a clear objective with obvious obstacles, unlikely partnerships and plenty of surprises. if all that wasn't enough, there's the score. ennio morricone not only provides one of the most memorable themes in movie music history, but the timing of the music, the way it lifts the important scenes up into a realm of cinematic immortality is unlike anything before or since it. it's exciting and epic when it needs to and it's suspenseful and emotional when the action gets intense. with so much silence in this film, picking the right moments to break it is challenging, but morricone nails it. and if it doesn't do all that for you, well, it's still cool. ""the good, the bad and the ugly"" proves that all three of those descriptors are relative. it's no great revelation, but it's interesting to see how you watch and form opinions of characters assigned to general moral stereotypes and then to see how those opinions are affected as the film goes on. if that's too deep, than at the least you can appreciate how cool everything is.";31 March 2009;9;['bad', 'ugly', 'cool', 'most', 'other', 'cool', 'full', 'civil', 'good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'tuco', 'relative', 'tuco', 'other', 'enough', 'much', 'third', 'western', 'american', 'blondie', 'impressed', 'invaluable', 'tuco', 'interesting', 'serious', 'dull', 'gritty', 'close', 'split', 'second', 'hard', 'important', 'least', 'cool', 'distinct', 'western', 'tall', 'important', 'clear', 'like', 'first', 'great', 'western', 'global', 'literary', 'clear', 'obvious', 'unlikely', 'enough', 'memorable', 'important', 'cinematic', 'exciting', 'epic', 'suspenseful', 'emotional', 'intense', 'much', 'right', 'cool', 'bad', 'ugly', 'relative', 'great', 'interesting', 'general', 'moral', 'deep', 'least', 'cool'];0.0664245359160613

81;weezeralfalfa;"i submit that my review title is a more accurate descriptor of the 3 stars than the given film title. clint eastwood, as ""blondie"", may be the justified ultimate victor, but i see little in him that is good. i don't like westerns with too much gun play, and too many corpses piling up. there is an abundance of both here, some justified, some not. blondie, on several occasions just mows down a bunch of people for no reason. he tries to get extra bounty money by collaborating with escaped mexican bandit tuco(eli wallach), to deliver him to peace officers in exchange for a bounty reward, which he would later share with tuco, after he had cut the suspending rope tied around tuco's neck with a gun shot. tuco would ride off on the horse he was sitting on. when they reconvened, they went to the next town and tried the same trick. but something was bound to go wrong eventually. so, tuco stuck up blondie and made him walk a long way across a desert with no water, and no protection from the sun. when blondie was virtually dead, they came upon a closed wagon full of dead or nearly dead bodies. while tuco is getting water for the one barely alive man, this man tells blondie the name on the grave where a fortune in gold is hidden. blondie tells tuco he knows the relevant grave site, but not which graveyard it's in. tuco then gives blondie some water and shade, and they agree to eventually share the 2 parts of the puzzle..........after they have found the cache of gold coins, blondie, not trusting tuco, ties his hands behind his back, fashions a hanging rope, has him stand on a rickety grave cross, and puts the noose around his neck. blondie leaves tuco's share of gold at his feet, then rides off. responding to tuco's pleading, blondie turns around , and from some distance, breaks the rope with a single shot, thus completing this redundant gag, after which blondie continues to ride off into the sunset, while tuco is left in this bleak waterless desert, with his hands tied behind his back,, and no horse. this was blondie's way of extracting revenge for several transgressions of tuco. tuco had nearly succeeded in hanging blondie, except for a traumatic interruption. also, for tuco nearly killing him by making him walk across that waterless desert. tuco showed his sadistic side by tempting blondie with some water, then throwing it away. also, tuco had tried to get to the relevant grave before blondie, after blondie told him where it was. crafty blondie told him wrong in case he had the idea to make off with all the gold. .......the occasional switch between 2 of the 3 main characters being reluctant buddies to being outright enemies is an important factor in making this an interesting western.........angel eyes(lee van cleef) has some encounters with the other two relating to finding the treasure. at last, blondie writes the name of the relevant grave on a rock(?), and places it in middle of a triangle formed by the 3 men. a three-way duel ensues. blondie shoots angel eyes dead, and previously unloaded tuco's gun. thus, he is the winner, sparing tuco's life, for the present, and awarding him half the gold, but as i previously described, blondie imposes severe restrictions of tuco's ability to make use of all that gold...........i think the film could have been tightened by about 30min.,to make it seem less daunting. the 3 main actors did an excellent job. incidentally, eastwood was a non-smoker, thus objected to having a cigarillo in the corner of his mouth in nearly every scene. however, this did contribute to his charisma.";19 May 2019;8;['accurate', 'justified', 'ultimate', 'little', 'good', 'much', 'many', 'several', 'extra', 'next', 'same', 'long', 'dead', 'full', 'dead', 'dead', 'alive', 'relevant', 'grave', 'single', 'redundant', 'bleak', 'several', 'traumatic', 'tuco', 'sadistic', 'relevant', 'occasional', 'main', 'reluctant', 'outright', 'important', 'interesting', 'western', 'other', 'last', 'relevant', 'dead', 'severe', 'daunting', 'main', 'excellent', 'non', 'smoker'];0.104527417027417

83;Polaris_DiB;"it's really interesting. i really don't like westerns and i don't particularly like italian directors. but sergio leone's westerns, that's a whole 'nother bucket of fun. basically, three characters defined by the title--the good, the man with no name who travels the land turning wanted bandits in for money, but not really so they can die; the bad, a man set out to track down a soldier who holds the secret to a lot of cash; and the ugly, a bandit that runs into the man with no name and gets caught up in their journey--set out on a fateful journey across civil war torn western landscapes in search of $200,000 gold. the money is buried in a graveyard that the ugly knows the location of, in a grave that the good knows the name of, in a place that the bad wants to get to. however, they all must cross confederate and union lines, somehow keep each other alive, and prevent each other from double-crossing each other (typically by doing just that, double-crossing each other) until the inevitable fateful showdown at the rocky center of the graveyard. you definitely gotta give it to mr. leone, even in the extended 3-hour english language cut, he keeps the movie building gracefully and moving forward to its exciting conclusion. whereas i did not find this movie to be quite as good as the profoundly moving vengeance narrative of once upon a time in the west, i still have more than enough to keep me interested merely in the vast widescreen compositions. clint eastwood is every stolid hero wrapped up into one, and even eli wallach's tuco has some sympathy built for him. meanwhile, lee van cleef's angel eyes, well, he's just around to make things more worrisome, it seems. in a way the title refers to the three main archetypes of the west, the roving, solid marksman we admire, the roving, lonely bandit that we pity, and the roving, powerful evil that insinuates itself into every railroad path, wooden town, and power situation, seemingly. and of course it's not a question of who is the toughest, but the most quick-witted, that decides how the outcome is. --polarisdib";9 September 2009;7;['interesting', 'italian', 'whole', 'nother', 'bad', 'ugly', 'fateful', 'civil', 'western', 'ugly', 'bad', 'other', 'alive', 'other', 'double', 'other', 'double', 'other', 'inevitable', 'fateful', 'rocky', 'extended', 'english', 'exciting', 'good', 'moving', 'more', 'enough', 'interested', 'vast', 'widescreen', 'stolid', 'worrisome', 'main', 'solid', 'lonely', 'powerful', 'wooden', 'tough', 'quick', 'witted'];-0.0146296296296296

(eastwood, of course, wouldn't become a big-league hollywood star until ""dirty harry"" in 1971.) the legendary ""the good, the bad and the ugly"" is set during the civil war, and concerns three men's quest for a fortune in confederate gold buried somewhere in a cemetery. the three men are: the man with no name/blondie/""the good"" (eastwood), angel eyes/""the bad"" (lee van cleef), and tuco/""the ugly"" (eli wallach). all three have itchy trigger fingers but therein lies the problem: they all know the secret to the location of the buried confederate gold (one knows the cemetery, but not the grave; another knows the name of the grave but not the cemetery). this film, in its full-length unedited 179-minute running time, may very well be the first epic (spaghetti) western, or at least, the first epic western that i've seen. it's one of the most thoroughly engaging, action-packed, and provocative films i've ever had the pleasure of watching. at center stage is star clint eastwood, playing the ""man with no name"" for the third and probably last time, and he's at the top of his game here as a truly bad-a** anti-hero. sure, he speaks softly, but he carries a big six-shooter and he knows how to use it! but don't overlook the contributions of co-stars lee van cleef and eli wallach. it's been a while since i've been so thoroughly captivated by someone as truly evil and sadistic as van cleef's steely-eyed killer angel eyes; there is also something to be said about eli wallach's portrayal of the unkempt, desperate con man tuco, who also serves as this film's comic relief. leone was at the peak of his skill in ""the good, the bad and the ugly,"" clearly the best film of his ""dollars trilogy."" his love of wide-angle shots to capture the oppressive desert landscape, and intense close-ups of the actor's faces were unmatched here. it's also the best film of his to make truly excellent use of the extensive talents of the brilliant italian composer ennio morricone (i'm listening to his score for this film right now as i type this up). it only seems fitting that as the western film genre's most iconic star, clint eastwood would go on to make his dark, violent anti-western ""unforgiven"" in 25 years later in 1992. 10/10";14 November 2011;10;['legendary', 'bad', 'ugly', 'long', 'good', 'few', 'more', 'well', 'good', 'western', 'bad', 'ugly', 'last', 'good', 'capable', 'previous', 'big', 'dirty', 'legendary', 'bad', 'ugly', 'civil', 'confederate', 'bad', 'ugly', 'full', 'unedited', 'first', 'western', 'least', 'first', 'epic', 'provocative', 'center', 'third', 'last', 'bad', 'anti', 'hero', 'big', 'evil', 'sadistic', 'steely', 'eyed', 'desperate', 'comic', 'bad', 'ugly', 'good', 'wide', 'oppressive', 'intense', 'close', 'unmatched', 'good', 'excellent', 'extensive', 'brilliant', 'italian', 'fitting', 'western', 'iconic', 'dark', 'violent', 'anti', 'western', 'unforgiven'];-0.0243589743589743
86;ackstasis;this week i was fortunate enough to see 'the good, the bad and the ugly (1966)' (namely, the 2003 extended english-language version) in the cinema, perhaps the only place that sergio leone's classic spaghetti western can be properly appreciated. this was my second viewing the first being in 2006, when my interest in cinema was still in its infancy and, just as leone's film gained status only in subsequent decades, my admiration has since grown substantially. by the early 1960s, the western had become a tired genre, and even the best american entries {such as ford's 'the man who shot liberty valance (1962)'} could more closely be described as somber rather than thrilling. leone's low-budget italian productions breathed new life into the western, the director's highly-stylised (and purely cinematic) film-making style tackling the recently-emerged revisionist western sub-genre with a cheekily-parodic sense of humour. though 'the good, the bad and the ugly' clearly identifies each of its three protagonists with a titular adjective, the separating lines are decidedly blurred. blondie (clint eastwood) is the archetypal anti-hero, a laconic, cigar-smoking bounty-hunter who makes every word, and every bullet, count. tuco (eli wallach) is a slimy opportunist, a bottom-dweller whose unabashed enthusiasm especially opposite the apathetic eastwood makes him an oddly-likable character. angel eyes (lee van cleef) is a crafty, intelligent schemer, greed and contempt mixing behind those cold, steely eyes. leon's film revolves almost exclusively around these three characters, and the american civil war is utilised purely as a historical backdrop. as was the director's style, the film is a triumph of contrasts: an epic period of american history is used merely as a stage for an intimate battle-of-wills between three determined men with their own selfish aims. contrast, too, is evident through leone's camera lens. few directors (perhaps david lean or sergei bondarchuk are his only true rivals in this field) have more inspiringly utilised the cinema screen as a canvas. leone switches between landscapes and portraits, at times cutting unexpectedly from a distant long-shot to an extreme close-up of eastwood's sweaty brow, his eyes narrowed and alert. i wrote in my review for 'a fistful of dollars (1964)' that that leone's landscape was the human face. unlike ford, to whom setting was significant (one reason why he so adored monument valley), leone's westerns unfold in an anonymous landscape, dry and unremarkable and unforgiving. colour is instead injected through ennio morricone's score, perhaps the most memorable ever composed for a film. the composer's contribution is uniquely cinematic, refusing to linger in the background and instead serving to overwhelm and enhance leone's imagery.;2 March 2010;10;['fortunate', 'bad', 'ugly', 'english', 'only', 'classic', 'western', 'second', 'first', 'subsequent', 'early', 'western', 'tired', 'good', 'american', 'such', 'somber', 'low', 'italian', 'new', 'western', 'cinematic', 'revisionist', 'western', 'parodic', 'bad', 'ugly', 'titular', 'archetypal', 'anti', 'hero', 'laconic', 'slimy', 'unabashed', 'apathetic', 'likable', 'crafty', 'intelligent', 'cold', 'steely', 'american', 'civil', 'historical', 'epic', 'american', 'intimate', 'determined', 'own', 'selfish', 'evident', 'few', 'sergei', 'only', 'true', 'distant', 'extreme', 'alert', 'human', 'significant', 'anonymous', 'dry', 'unremarkable', 'unforgiving', 'memorable', 'cinematic'];0.0241779497098646

92;estebangonzalez10;"you see in this world there's two kinds of people my friend, those with loaded guns, and those who dig. you dig. i wonder what would've been of clint eastwood's career if it weren't for the dollars trilogy. before working with italian filmmaker, sergio leone, he had a career as a television actor in rawhide, a western based tv series, but he couldn't get a decent job in hollywood so he began to look for work abroad. he reached international success thanks to leone's reinvented spaghetti westerns: a fistful of dollars (1964), for a few dollars more (1965), and the good, the bad, and the ugly (1966), known as the dollars trilogy. he proved producers wrong because they thought that people wouldn't pay to see movies of actors they could see for free on television, but audiences were more than willing to see him in the big screen. his pairing with leone couldn't have worked out better for him since the director's trademark was combining long wide shots with extreme close-ups. these wide shots couldn't have been enjoyed as much on the small television sets at home. eastwood's rough features and manly charisma also contributed to leone's success, and both seemed destined to work with each other. there is no need to see the previous dollars movies as the good, the bad, and the ugly stands out on its own and is actually a prequel since the movie takes place during the civil war in the early 1860's before the other plots take place and they are all separate stories that only have clint eastwood's character in common. when i see eastwood's latest films as a director i can't help but think how much he was influenced by the great sergio leone. he must have learned a great deal working with the italian director in this masterpiece. it is just shot beautifully and to perfection by leone, the cinematography and scenery are amazing and feel real, and the score is perfect. eastwood may be a different director than leone was, but he pays close detail to his craft and also knows how to shoot beautifully. the plot is pretty simple for a movie that is about three hours long, but leone's use of the camera and extended shots makes the film longer. he also adds several side stories that work really well in the narrative. the film begins by introducing each character (although in the opposite order: the ugly, the bad, and the good). the film begins with an extreme close up on a bounty hunter (al mulock) and then when we see the wide shot there are three of them who are quietly entering a bar. once the men enter we hear three shots and out comes tuco, also known as the ugly (eli wallach), who escapes. in the next scene we are introduced to the bad, angel eyes (lee van cleef), who is tracking down a peasant farmer. the scene is truly a classic as no words are spoken for about ten minutes, but the tension can be felt. angel eyes is actually looking for information on the location of a treasure of coins lost during the civil war and he is told a soldier named bill carson has it. finally, we are introduced to blondie, the good (clint eastwood), who saves tuco from a group of men who want to turn him in because there is a reward on his head. blondie saves him only to collect the reward himself, but once tuco is about to be hanged he shoots the rope and sets him free as part of a scam in which they divide the money. they later turn against each other only to discover the location of the treasure that has been buried and the race begins to see who can get to the treasure first as the three men have different information regarding its whereabouts. the good, the bad, and the ugly is my all-time favorite western. any other film in the genre will always be measured by its standards. the opening scene in which we are introduced to angel eyes (the bad) is just so beautifully shot that no dialogue was needed and we were already hooked (ennio morricone's amazing score can also take some credit for that). the first ten minutes have no dialogue whatsoever but it sets up the general tone of the movie: several wide shots where we can see the great landscape and deserts combining them with extreme close ups of the characters facial expressions, the tension and suspense is built with long and slow scenes and suddenly the violence happens so quickly that we are caught off guard. the film doesn't celebrate violence, it portrays it truthfully. the main character is the quiet blondie (the good), but without a doubt tuco (the ugly) is the one who has the most lines and brings some unbalance and goofiness to an otherwise serious picture. one of the funniest scenes is when he is in the tub and one of the bounty hunter shows up to kill him but before shooting he begins the classic speech villains tend to give and tuco pulls out his gun and fires at him saying, when you have to shoot, shoot, don't talk. tuco plays a key role and his character is kind of the gray in an otherwise black (angel eyes) and white (blondie), good guy and bad guy western movie. he breaks the conventionality in the genre. the final mexican standoff scene is also truly memorable and one of the best shot sequences. this is a truly unique film that has stood the test of time; it catapulted eastwood into a movie star, and has influenced him on his way to becoming a great director. the good, the bad, and the ugly is one of my all time favorite movies and is a must see film. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/";17 September 2010;10;['loaded', 'italian', 'western', 'decent', 'international', 'few', 'more', 'bad', 'ugly',

93;jimbo-53-186511;"having been hugely impressed with sergio leone's once upon a time in america and having enjoyed previous clint eastwood westerns, i finally decided to sit down and watch the good, the bad and the ugly. my expectations were high as this film currently has an imdb rating of 9.0 and is ranked as the 5th best film of all time (according to imdb). needless to say, my expectations for this film weren't just met, but they were exceeded. the film basically follows angel eyes (van cleef) blondie (eastwood) and tuco (wallach) who are all trying to find some missing coins which are worth $200,000. initially, it is only angel eyes that is aware of the hidden loot, but after tuco has a chance encounter with an injured and rather thirsty bill bryson (who happens to be the man that angel eyes is looking for) bill bryson informs tuco that he will tell him where the coins are hidden as long as he gives him water - he tells him which graveyard it is hidden in, but not the name of the gravestone. desperate to find out which gravestone the coins are hidden in, tuco obliges and runs to get water. however, in the few minutes that he is gone bryson dies and tells a worn out blondie the name of the gravestone where the loot is hidden. reluctantly, tuco decides to nurse blondie back to health so that he can take him to the gravestone where the loot is hidden. tuco had been punishing blondie due to the fact that blondie double crossed him earlier. there are so may things to praise this film about; firstly we have that fantastic ennio morricone score - i loved his music in once upon a time in america and was equally impressed with the score in this film. who can also forget the iconic signature tune which is played in the opening credits and several times throughout this film? just brilliant. then we come to the acting, van cleef, eastwood and wallach were all fantastic - check out the scene between van cleef and the guy that he intimidates at the start of the film. there is no dialogue between the men for a number of minutes as the 2 men just fix each other with icy stares- sometimes the best way to create atmosphere and tension is to use the 'less is more' approach and that perfectly sums up the first 10-15 minutes of this film. eastwood was also fantastic and i feel that he is at his best when he plays the 'tough gunslinger'. he's a great actor and i feel that nobody combines grit and coolness quite like clint. wallach was also fantastic in the role of a fairly dumb outlaw. i thought he was convincing in this role and thought he was a really funny character. for me, the biggest strength of this film lies with eastwood and wallach and for the most part it is them that this film belongs to. the continual point scoring and 'one oneupmanship' between the 2 men was hilarious to watch. they both share great on screen chemistry and that for me is one of the main reasons that tgtbatu works so well. another strength is in the story telling. you are constantly left guessing throughout the film and as a viewer you are never quite sure what is going to happen next which certainly made sure the film held my interest throughout. although this film is quite long it never felt drawn out and pretty much every scene was relevant in advancing the plot. the film culminates in a rather tense finale which proved to be a great ending to a great film. tgtbatu is an absolute classic and is a film that i would recommend to everyone.";21 December 2013;9;['previous', 'bad', 'ugly', 'high', 'good', 'needless', 'worth', 'aware', 'hidden', 'injured', 'thirsty', 'desperate', 'tuco', 'few', 'worn', 'fantastic', 'impressed', 'iconic', 'several', 'brilliant', 'fantastic', 'other', 'good', 'less', 'more', 'first', 'fantastic', 'good', 'tough', 'great', 'fantastic', 'dumb', 'convincing', 'funny', 'big', 'most', 'continual', 'hilarious', 'main', 'sure', 'next', 'sure', 'long', 'relevant', 'tense', 'great', 'great', 'absolute'];0.2094056847545219

96;kluseba;exactly one year ago, i wrote my first reviews on this web site and this one is my review number one hundred. to underline and celebrate this kind of anniversary, i decided to pick one of my favourite movies of all times. everything about this movie just seems perfect to me. let's start with the director's work. sergio leone is one of the most gifted directors of all times and he had a feeling for monumental and impressing landscapes. his images are as epic as the scripts and stories. i also adore the way he captures the emotions of its actors. the devil is in the detail as he concentrates on seemingly instinctual nervous movements and actions, the impressions of the actor's faces and especially the looks of their eyes. even almost fifty years after the release of this monumental milestone of the western genre, his way of filming remains unbeaten and unreached. it is emotional, well crafted and perfectly organized. the filming goes hand in hand with the majestic score of the movie. ennio morricone is maybe the greatest composer for cinema alive. the instruments are diversified, the melodies epic and still catchy and filled with emotions of pressure, anger, despair, hope and joy that fusion perfectly with the chosen images. without the music, often only chosen randomly to underline a conceptual background by many others, the movie wouldn't be the same. sergio leone really knew what he wanted and i music has never had such an important role in a movie since the end of the age of silent films. without the works of morricone, there would have been no place for many grand composers such as john williams or hans zimmer that create stunning soundtracks nowadays. another amazing thing is the acting around the three key personalities. lee van cleef as angel eyes does the best work of his career as a cold hearted, pitiless and cool villain with an eerie look. he is not the usual bad guy but a rather silent, patient and intellectual villain and this what makes him appear so cruel and dangerous. eli wallach as tuco, one of my favourite actors of all times, does also the best job of his long career in this movie. he plays an ugly little bandit that seems to be naive, superficial and rude at first sight but turns out to be much more diversified and is finally a crafty, darkly humorous and brutal villain that is nevertheless very sympathetic because of his high degree of charisma and the high amount of bad coincidences that he lives throughout the whole movie. finally, clint eastwood as blondie does also an amazing job and has developed since the first two movies he had done with sergio leone before. in this movie, he is extremely smart, calm and thoughtful but nevertheless a mean villain that plans and organizes everything at his advantage and that never stops to surprise. those three memorable actors at the peak of their early careers have an amazing chemistry and i have never ever seen a movie with three outstanding actors. normally, there are one or rarely two actors that give good movies a certain kind of soul and creativity, but this movie is graced by the works of three great actors. if that was not already enough, the supporting actors such as aldo giuffre as a drunk and desperate union captain that befriends with the characters of wallach and eastwood. one must also underline the story itself. it takes the time to slowly introduce each of the characters in their own special ways. the viewer gets the time to get used and connect with them before the main plot kicks off which is an unusual and great idea. the further development reveals more and more about the characters and their past. lee van cleef is shown as he fulfils his dirty works and contracts, eli wallach meets his brother, a catholic friar that confronts him with old family problems and clint eastwood remains the tough vagabond and mysterious man without a name. the story is filled with many memorable and diversified situations, connecting a the elements of a treasure chase with a tale of revenge and scenes of the american civil war. the movie is not just a western, it's has some slight social touches that look behind the brutal characters and gore or desperate war or prison scenes. the movie has some touches of a drama, an anti war movie, a satire of the usual westerns and an epic adventure flick. there is much to discover and analyze beyond the main plot that is a breathtaking treasure chase filled with cliffhangers. finally, this movie has also had an important influence on an entire genre. the italian spaghetti western genre got finally accepted and boomed as well as the whole western genre. the movie made an incredible gross with a very low budget. many critics regard this movie as a classic nowadays and even people which use to hate westerns happen to like this flick, especially women. that's why this movie is way more than just a western, it is an epic masterpiece for the ages and everybody that disagrees on that has a very subjective point of view because the artistic factor of this flick is very elevated and the acting memorable. everybody that hasn't seen this movie yet should do this right now, it is one of those movies one should have seen at least once in a lifetime. personally, i watch this flick at least once a year and i'm always looking forward to it and never get bored. i happen to invite friends that don't know this movie yet to open their minds and until now, i never got less than enthusiastic comments. i would say that this movie is probably my favourite one of all times until now and will surely stay in my eternal top five.;5 April 2011;10;['first', 'favourite', 'perfect', 'gifted', 'monumental', 'epic', 'instinctual', 'nervous',

98;myriamlenys;"only one serious objection : the movie is too long, it might be shortened by at least half an hour. for the rest : this is riveting, blistering, intoxicating viewing. propelled by greed, three rogues go their criminal way amidst a moral landscape which seems to have been designed by hieronymus bosch at his most pessimistic. they live in a world where cruelty is king and where the kind and innocent have ""victim"" tattooed on their forehead. (for clarity's sake, the ""good"" from the title can only be called good if one puts the bar for virtue really low - think world championship limbo dancing.) it would be tempting to think of that world as ""lawless"", but the problem runs even deeper. the story plays against the background of the civil war, with the south fighting for the continuation of slavery. the south has laws defending the idea that it's okay for you to drag inoffensive humans from their countries and homes and work them to death while you sit on the porch and admire the butterflies. this is violence enshrined by law and supported by society ; it is a different beast than, say, individual acts of transgression by reprobates or renegades living outside the system. and the southerners aren't the only ones who find it difficult to recognize the humanness of others : this is a universe where people can be insulted, mistreated or killed simply because someone somewhere doesn't like one of their characteristics, for whatever reason. this must be one of the most knowing, most disillusioned westerns ever made. it depicts the nightmare face of the conquest of the west : a seething, grotesque mass of greed and avarice, propelled by dreams of an el dorado which may, or may not, lie behind the next mountain. leone's movie paints unforgettable images in the viewer's mind. i, for one, have never been able to hear the words ""mexican standoff"" without hearing that famous music and seeing that famous scene. and i'm not the only one : the scene is one of the most influential and iconic in western movies, and rightly so. it's a work of art : inventively filmed, superbly choreographed, and both stark and over-the-top operatic. if you have never seen ""the good, the bad and the ugly"", run, don't walk to the nearest store or cinema.";3 November 2017;9;['serious', 'long', 'least', 'criminal', 'moral', 'pessimistic', 'innocent', 'good', 'good', 'tempting', 'lawless', 'civil', 'south', 'okay', 'inoffensive', 'different', 'individual', 'only', 'difficult', 'knowing', 'most', 'disillusioned', 'seething', 'grotesque', 'next', 'unforgettable', 'able', 'famous', 'famous', 'only', 'influential', 'iconic', 'western', 'stark', 'bad', 'ugly', 'near'];0.0765432098765432

100;drystyx;"this isn't the worst of the spaghetti films, but it is a terrible films. if you don't know what a spaghetti film is, it means, great exciting music trying to make up for a weak stupid plot, uninteresting, unlikable characters, silly comic book style gunfights, terrible writing, terrible directing, and slow paced boredom. this film isn't a complete bomb because of the efforts of some of the actors. it's no secret that eastwood wasn't a gifted actor, and he had to be surrounded by superior actors such as eli wallach and lee van cleef. those two, and the supporting cast almost make this bearable. it involves three men. one is good, one is bad, and one is the guy who took your last girlfriend away from you. but which is which? the film literally has to tell you. eastwood is supposed to be good, but the only two not completely vicious things he does are try to save a handicapped from hanging (so he can take him to be executed again), and offering a dying soldier a puff from his cigar-not trying to stop his bleeding or even give him some pain killer, but to just do a cigarette commercial in the middle of a movie. there's no reason to care about him at all. in fact, the guy who stole your girlfriend comes across as almost sympathetic (almost.) the plot is the three are after a decent amount of gold. the trouble they go through, they could've much easier just stolen that much cash somewhere is. so the plot is ludicrous. the characters are just an example of that era's movie making in which movie makers tried to outdo each other with evil characters. billed as anti-heroes, they don't come close to filling that role. true anti-heroes are self absorbed, maybe somewhat selfish, probably anti-social, such as in ""hombre"", ""the lost continent"", and the edmond o'brien version of ""doa"". these guys are just vicious punks who you would not want to be your boss, your law enforcement official, your anything. that said, there is some great music, which doesn't match up at all with the mundane events and characters. the shootout scenes are ridiculous, probably comical, and unfortunately they paved the way for a multitude of later movies that copied these inferior techniques. for exciting shootouts you really need to go way back before these movies, or to more modern movies that know better. this cannot be construed in any way as a good movie, much less a classic. you will be bored to tears if you let one of these guys talk you into watching it. these are the same guys who would take you on a snipe hunt.";6 March 2007;3;['bad', 'terrible', 'great', 'exciting', 'weak', 'stupid', 'uninteresting', 'unlikable', 'silly', 'comic', 'terrible', 'terrible', 'paced', 'complete', 'gifted', 'superior', 'such', 'bearable', 'good', 'bad', 'last', 'good', 'only', 'vicious', 'sympathetic', 'decent', 'easy', 'much', 'ludicrous', 'other', 'evil', 'true', 'anti', 'selfish', 'anti', 'social', 'such', 'lost', 'vicious', 'great', 'mundane', 'ridiculous', 'comical', 'later', 'inferior', 'exciting', 'modern', 'good', 'bored', 'same'];-0.0601626016260162

102;davidmvining;this is one of those movies that you simply don't dislike. everyone who loves movies loves sergio leone's the good, the bad, and the ugly. well, my opinion of the film has honestly just degraded with time to the point where i throw this in, ready to rediscover the love for the film i saw in my youth, and instead i discover a bloated, aimless mess of a film. i swear i'm not trolling. i genuinely think this. i felt like for a few dollars more was a nearly ideal meld of style and somewhat minimal substance to create a high-quality entertainment. leone had discovered that his style required small, focused storytelling, allowing him to spend large amounts of time on heightened moments that really drove the film's enjoyment. for the first half of the good, the bad, and the ugly, i had similar thoughts to the earlier parts of his previous two films. leone was taking his time to introduce his characters and his world. it was more self-indulgent than previously, but it was still pretty consistently entertaining. we have our three characters, the ugly (tuco, played by eli wallach), the bad (angel eyes, played by lee van cleef), and the good (blondie, played by clint eastwood). tuco is introduced in the opening sequence where he shoots several men out to kill him before jumping out of a window and racing off into the wilderness. angel eyes' first scene introduces the actual plot when he shows up to a remote house with orders to kill a man after he extracts some information from him, the pseudonym of a man along with some extra bits about a cash box. blondie executes a con with tuco in his first scene where he drops tuco off in a town for a cash reward and shoots out the rope that's to hang him before tuco actually strangles, dropping him onto the horse below and letting him bolt off to freedom where the two will share the money. however, blondie decides that tuco really isn't worth it, robs him blind, and leaves tuco in the desert alone. this is all fine, solid, cinematic storytelling from leone. it continues, if a bit self-indulgently, with tuco crawling back to civilization and robbing a gun shop before heading towards blondie. eventually catching up, tuco takes blondie hostage and forces him to walk into the desert without water, enjoying every second of it, until they come across a seemingly abandoned confederate stagecoach with a dying man who promises tuco $200,000 for a drink of water. fate makes it so that tuco receives one piece of information about the money (the name of the cemetery) and blondie receives the other (the name of the grave), with neither willing to give up the information to the other. however, they both need each other if they want that cash. this is also, of course, the man that angel eyes was looking for information on in his early scene. tuco helps blondie convalesce in a monastery that will treat soldiers on either side of the american civil war, and this is pretty much the exact point where i feel like the movie ends its promise. a quality scene between tuco and his monk brother leads to tuco and blondie leaving the monastery to head towards the cemetery. and immediately they're sidetracked when they get captured by a random union patrol because the pair are wearing the confederate uniforms they picked up. the story was just about to move forward, and suddenly we have to watch the two go into the union's answer to andersonville, complete with a subplot that goes nowhere about the commandant deciding to investigate angel eyes (who is now a sergeant in the union army? whatever) for stealing from the prisoners as well as mistreating them. we literally never see the commandant after the scene he declares that he's going to investigate, so what's the point? what this prison setting is supposed to do narratively is to tell angel eyes that tuco and blondie have the information he seeks (the coincidences around this are rather large), and for angel eyes to learn enough that he just needs blondie instead of tuco when tuco gives up the cemetery name. so, then they're off with tuco set to be executed...somewhere else. tuco manages to jump off a train with his large guard chained to him without anyone noticing, cutting the chains with the next train on the tracks. yes, our story is moving forward again. in a town being evacuated, blondie and angel eyes, along with angel eyes' five men, rest for a bit until tuco shows up. blondie decides team up with tuco, presumably because angel eyes can't be trusted and he needs to whittle down angel eyes' men (an echo of for a few dollars more). the scene where they take out the five men is...curious. saved by luck several times including a man with a rifle having worse aim than tuco with a pistol (while also having the jump on him) and a shell landing right next to two of the men right before they are going to fire into the backs of blondie and tuco, they eliminate angel eyes' men, and then we're off to the cemetery. except, that bridge sequence comes up. i still maintain that this sequence can be hard cut out of the film (though you'd need some adr to get blondie to give tuco the name of the grave). it's a pointless sequence in terms of the actual story. stopping the film completely so that we can get some obvious metaphor for the quagmire of vietnam is bad enough, but then it stops making literal sense after a certain bit. recalling the bridge on the river kwai, but without even trying to explain how two men could tie explosives to a bridge in broad daylight without being seen by the army looking straight at them, blondie and tuco blow up the bridge, ending the conflict, and letting them move onto the cemetery! well, after blondie has a tender moment with a dying soldier he's never seen before and expertly shoots a cannon at tuco (twice!). and then we get our famous ending of tuco, blondie, and angel eyes at sad hill cemetery. yes, this ending is great. it's peak leone in an individual sequence with a fantastic use of a fantastic score by ennio morricone, but it took us a meandering three hours to get here. i do not question the many, many people who hold up this film as one of their favorites and even their opinions of it being one of the greatest films ever made. i simply do not agree. there is no focus to this story. this is leone going epic and having no idea how to do it. this is leone wanting to say something about vietnam but not really understanding how to actually integrate that message into the story at hand. this is leone being given a huge budget based on the wild success of his previous two films and not really knowing what to do with all the resources. there's definitely entertainment to be had, but it's all mired in the middle of a story that never comes close to gelling, especially in its second half. robbing itself of any narrative drive or even a basic point, the good, the bad, and the ugly becomes a tedious struggle.;1 November 2021;5;['bad', 'ugly', 'ready', 'bloated', 'aimless', 'trolling', 'few', 'ideal', 'minimal', 'high', 'small', 'focused', 'large', 'first', 'bad', 'ugly', 'similar', 'early', 'previous', 'indulgent', 'entertaining', 'ugly', 'tuco', 'bad', 'good', 'several', 'first', 'actual', 'remote', 'extra', 'first', 'worth', 'blind', 'fine', 'solid', 'cinematic', 'other', 'willing', 'other', 'other', 'early', 'american', 'civil', 'exact', 'monk', 'random', 'confederate', 'about', 'complete', 'large', 'enough', 'large', 'next', 'few', 'more', 'curious', 'several', 'bad', 'pointless', 'actual', 'obvious', 'bad', 'literal', 'certain', 'broad', 'tender', 'famous', 'great', 'individual', 'fantastic', 'fantastic', 'many', 'many', 'great', 'epic', 'huge', 'wild', 'previous', 'second', 'narrative', 'basic', 'bad', 'ugly', 'tedious'];0.0033517773306505
103;slokes;"there are few films that have gained in stature over the decades as this one has. it's looking more and more like the latter 20th century's answer to ""citizen kane,"" a film that influenced young directors with its style and technique while managing to be popular with the public. more so, in some respects, because ""citizen kane"" was not the same sort of successful popular entertainment as was ""the good, the bad, and the ugly."" if you haven't seen the movie, you may think you know the story, but you don't. there's this fellow named tuco (eli wallach) who always finds himself on the wrong side of the law. he gets himself a partner, a silent type named blondie (clint eastwood), and they go into business collecting bounties for tuco and skipping town until blondie leaves tuco in the desert, vowing revenge. meanwhile, weasel-eyed nasty angeleyes (lee van cleef) is hot on the trail of a fellow going by the name of carson, part of the confederate army of the west, who knows something about $200,000 in gold coin. meanwhile, all around, the american civil war rages on. rest assured this all comes together, in a way that feels as natural as sunshine on a dog's bottom. the arresting thing about this film is how fresh and clever the journey is in getting there. it's not just cinema, but mega-cinema, the way every scene flows effortlessly into the next, while not one frame feels tired or overused. one worries a little about the new dvd that adds 20 minutes of footage. you can't improve on perfection. but the fact that this movie was ruthlessly edited after its italian premiere for u.s. distribution suggests that this might be the one time a classic is actually improved on by such additions. it's the ultimate guy's movie. there's not even a trace of a romance, unless you count carson's whore. but it's a very philosophical film, too, even sensitive in a cleverly perverse way. the title, really one of the best movie titles ever, sets up an interesting premise that we see delivered in corkscrew fashion in the movie. sure, angeleyes is bad, and tuco ugly in his morally conflicted manner, shooting people in cold blood and then making the sign of the cross as if to appease divine judgment. but blondie as good? when we first see him, he's murdering three bounty hunters who just captured an outlaw and were preparing to bring him to justice. his treatment of tuco, however enjoyable in its sadistically jolly way, is not good in any sense of the word. but we do see growth in this man of few words, a sense of appreciation for the moral stands life allows us to take. he is concerned enough to ask about tuco's fate in his first encounter with angeleyes, and by the end of the movie, we've seen him show real concern for the senseless victims of war. the film works by throwing up a hard-edged tone of cruelty it never lets go of, but there's an undertone that posits something better, which leads to a conclusion that is one of filmdom's best. what else is great? what isn't? every line is a classic, especially tuco's, like ""there are two kinds of spurs, my friend..."" and ""if you're going to shoot, shoot, don't talk."" there are some welcome faces from other parts of the dollars trilogy, especially the indefatigable heavy mario brega as corporal wallace, who has one of the nastiest moments (beating tuco) and then one of its funniest (when tuco complains ""i can't while you're watching"" while trying to relieve himself in the boxcar). it's impossible to overstate how good a movie this is. the only negative is that it's too long, but that very same quality is what makes it so enjoyable to watch over again. it's not even my favorite sergio leone film (that would be ""for a few dollars more""), but it's not only his best film, it's one of the best films ever made.";13 May 2004;10;['few', 'latter', 'young', 'popular', 'same', 'successful', 'popular', 'bad', 'ugly', 'wrong', 'silent', 'nasty', 'hot', 'confederate', 'gold', 'american', 'civil', 'natural', 'fresh', 'clever', 'next', 'tired', 'overused', 'little', 'new', 'italian', 'such', 'ultimate', 'philosophical', 'sensitive', 'perverse', 'good', 'interesting', 'corkscrew', 'bad', 'ugly', 'cold', 'divine', 'good', 'enjoyable', 'jolly', 'good', 'few', 'moral', 'first', 'real', 'well', 'good', 'great', 'welcome', 'other', 'indefatigable', 'heavy', 'corporal', 'nasty', 'impossible', 'good', 'only', 'negative', 'long', 'same', 'enjoyable', 'favorite', 'few', 'good', 'good'];0.0658884297520661

107;Witchfinder-General-666;"sergio leone's ""il buono, il brutto il cattivo"" aka. ""the good, the bad and the ugly"" of 1966 is, beyond doubt, one of the greatest movies ever brought to screen. period. i lack the words to express my admiration for this film adequately, but i'll try to indicate how brilliant this film is. this film is pure cinematic perfection. the story, the brilliant directing, the impressive cinematography, the unique atmosphere, the ingenious score, the great characters, the unforgettable performances, the dialogue, the wit, the violence,... everything in this film is pure perfection! this is one of the few movies that actually deserve their high ranking in imdb's top 250 list, and if i was to make such a list, ""the good, the bad and the ugly"" would rank even higher. leone's brilliant directing and a superb cinematography come along with what is maybe the greatest of ennio morricone's unique soundtracks. each one of the three leading actors fits perfectly in his role. as in the movie's two predecessors, ""a fistful of dollars"" (1964) and ""for a few dollars more"" (1965), clint eastwood ('the good')is the epitome of coolness in his role of the man with no name (who actually always has a name - he is credited as 'joe' in ""fistful of dollars"", his character is called 'monco' in ""for a few dollars more"", and he is referred to as ""blondie"" in ""the good the bad and the ugly""). together with irascible mexicantuco ('the ugly' brilliantly played by eli wallach), he rips authorities off by collecting the reward, that is set on tuco's head and then saving him a very second before his execution.since i first saw this dollar trilogy as a kid, the word 'coolness' is linked with this character played by clint eastwood. no other character in any other film is embodies coolness the way the man with no name does in the dollar trilogy, and no other ever will. lee van cleef ('the bad'), one of my personal favorite actors of all-time, and one of the true icons of the italian western, is brilliant in the role of sentenza aka. angel eyes, a ruthless assassin who knows no mercy or scruples to achieve his goals. while all of the three men are selfish crooks, and all of them selfish and violent in getting what they want, sentenza is truly evil, and lee van cleef plays this role with absolute brilliance. the arguably greatest performance, however is delivered by eli wallach as 'the ugly' mexican bandit tuco. hot-tempered, irascible, savage and yet crafty, and sometimes sadistically vengeful, tuco is a criminal with an immense crime record and an immense talent to survive hangings (with the help of 'the good'). eli wallach's performance as tuco is ingenious beyond comparison. wallach plays 'the ugly', his anger and rage, his quick, violent temper and brutality, his savagery but also his craftiness with a unique brilliance. wallach's performance is not only the single greatest performance ever in a western, but, as far as i am considered, also one of the greatest performances ever in a movie. set in one of the final years of the american civil war, somewhere in the southwest of the us, ""the good, the bad and the ugly"" tells the story of these three men, who are on the hunt for a case carrying 200,000 dollars in gold, buried somewhere in a graveyard.each of the three men wants the gold for himself, of course, but since none of them has all the information they need, they have to work together in order to get it. although all three of them are reckless and sneaky, clint eastwood (despite to being an antihero and crook that shoots a lot of people, the man with no name shows some mercy and charity in comparison to the foregoing movies ""for a fistful of dollars"" and ""for a few dollars more"") is rightly referred to as the good, eli wallach, playing the angry thug tuco, is the epitome of (the) ugly, and lee van cleef is wonderfully evil and ruthless as the bad. ""the good, the bad and the ugly"", a spaghetti western at the genre's best, is a brilliant movie full of violence and dark humor, a film full of wit and pictures that will make a great visual impact on everybody with taste, a masterpiece going along with one of the most brilliant scores of all time. this is not only a film that every cineaste should see this is a film that everybody must see! if i was to name my favorite movies of all-time, ""the good, the bad and the ugly"" would be one of the strongest contenders for numero uno! in one sentence: ""the good, the bad and the ugly"" is one of the greatest films ever made! absolutely essential and brilliant beyond comparison! 10/10";17 October 2005;10;['bad', 'ugly', 'great', 'brilliant', 'pure', 'cinematic', 'brilliant', 'impressive', 'unique', 'ingenious', 'great', 'unforgettable', 'pure', 'few', 'high', 'top', 'bad', 'ugly', 'high', 'brilliant', 'superb', 'great', 'unique', 'few', 'more', 'fistful', 'few', 'good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'irascible', 'ugly', 'second', 'other', 'other', 'other', 'bad', 'personal', 'favorite', 'true', 'italian', 'brilliant', 'ruthless', 'selfish', 'selfish', 'violent', 'evil', 'absolute', 'great', 'ugly', 'irascible', 'crafty', 'vengeful', 'immense', 'immense', 'ingenious', 'ugly', 'quick', 'violent', 'unique', 'single', 'great', 'western', 'great', 'final', 'american', 'civil', 'bad', 'ugly', 'reckless', 'sneaky', 'few', 'angry', 'ugly', 'evil', 'ruthless', 'bad', 'bad', 'ugly', 'western', 'good', 'brilliant', 'full', 'dark', 'full', 'great', 'visual', 'brilliant', 'favorite', 'bad', 'ugly', 'strong', 'bad', 'ugly', 'great', 'essential', 'brilliant'];0.0188201058201058
108;Steffi_P;"sergio leone always wanted every picture he made to be, in every way, bigger than the one which preceded it. with the good, the bad and the ugly he continued his upward trajectory and rounded off his dollars trilogy in style. this picture was leone's most stylised and grandiose to date, and brought all the themes and styles he had been developing in his earliest films to perfection. among the most notable was his characterisation, particularly his all-important introductions of characters. look at the introductory scenes of the three leads. we first see tuco bursting out of a window, obviously interrupted in the middle of a meal, and straight away we get his freeze-frame and the title ""the ugly"" this is a simple character, and needs no further introduction. angeleyes appears out of the distance, but grows towards us until his face fills the screen. we see him commit two despicable acts of murder and treachery before we get his freeze-frame and title ""the bad"", telling us he is pure evil. finally, in blondie's first appearance he steps into the frame from behind the camera, as if he had always been there. he rescues tuco, but only for his own profit. it's not until we have seen him betray and abandon tuco that we get his freeze-frame and title ""the good"" obviously a fairly ironic label given the way he has just acted. leone's trademark long drawn out face-offs exaggerated versions of the shootouts of john ford westerns and the sword duels of kurosawa's samurai films are also brought to a peak here. not only are they now taken to absurd heights of stylisation, they are also spread out and adapted to cover the whole picture, until the point where even two men sitting opposite each other eating a meal and glancing suspiciously at one another is treated like another stand off. in fact, the entire film can be considered one long series of duels. we also see more of the importance leone attaches to church and family. the dollars trilogy could be thought to lack emotion, taking place as it does in a world where there are no morals and everyone is out for gold. however the good, the bad and the ugly contains several moments of poignancy, perhaps the most prominent of which is when tuco confronts his estranged priest brother. religious iconography and references crops up time and again. leone loved biblical epics almost as much as he loved westerns, and there is something of the feel of those pictures here in the overwhelming landscapes and eerie, choral music. on top of this the central trio can be read as an allegory for god, the devil and humanity. this arguably presents rather a cynical view of the catholic faith given the treacherous and chequered nature of the ""good"" but it could be argued to be a typically italian one. in a country in which the church is so omnipresent and universally accepted, it's sometimes said that god is cursed as much as loved. having said that, this was clearly never intended as the central theme leone wasn't trying to make some grand statement here it's simply part of the mix of ideas going on in this picture. this brings me onto the war theme. anti-war sentiments are not directly addressed in this picture, but the way the civil war is woven into the plot makes a powerful statement. for the first half hour we don't see that the war is going on. the central characters aren't concerned with the it they are only interested in hunting down the gold. however the war encroaches on the plot more and more often, until it moves from background to foreground and takes over the entire picture, culminating in a colossal battle scene. and of course the fact that the film ends in a huge military graveyard is also very significant. i've spent so long talking about the themes and ideas going on in this film i've nearly run out of space to talk about all the genius that has gone into making it so enjoyable. the dialogue is superb, often funny and plenty of it quotable. technically leone has perfected his art he composes a shot like john ford, edits like eisenstein, paces like kurosawa, but all with a degree of his own originality. there is brilliant acting eli wallach steals it as tuco, probably his best ever performance. it's funny how lee van cleef was cast as a villain here. van cleef's early career mostly involved playing mean-looking gang members, but as leone discovered when casting him as the hero in for a few dollars more, while his face said ""bad guy"" his voice and manner could be warm and likable. the good guy van cleef obviously proved more popular, as in the dozen or so other spaghetti westerns he made for other directors he was invariably cast as the hero. just time for a final word on the recent (2003) restored edition. while it's great that several lost scenes have been added, i have to say that very few of them were entirely necessary. the only one of the added scenes i really like is the one in which angeleyes visits the field hospital it keeps his story arc going, and also shows an act of compassion from the ""bad"" when he lets the soldier keep the bottle. however the new dubbing for these scenes, strange as it may seem considering today's technology, is mixed absolutely atrociously. on top of this, clint eastwood and eli wallach are now so elderly, they actually sound less convincing than the guy impersonating the late lee van cleef. as a result the restored segments stick out like sore thumbs, and break up the flow of what is in every other way a perfect motion picture.";25

110;ShootingShark;"three separate mercenaries drifting through the us civil war in 1862 hear about a cache of looted confederate gold, rumoured to be buried in a cemetery. picking up clues, and with many criss-crossing adventures en route, they each make their way to the treasure. can they find it, and who will emerge alive ? the good, the bad and the ugly, or il buono, il brutto, il cattivo to give it it's proper name, is simply the finest western ever made. many accused leone of being a hack; he made westerns, but he made them in spain, and he wasn't even an american. not only was he not a hack, he made pure cinema - a genre stylist unburdened by all the boring moral constraints of so many westerns (clean-cut good guys, white supremacy, social responsibility). as a result, this film is the purest distillation of the western myth, with the most amazing cinematic treatment ever committed to film. its style is beyond criticism and its influence cannot be underestimated; leone's themes, his camera angles, his use of music, his intuitive widescreen style, his moves, his incredible closeups - all have been and continue to be copied by lesser men. at a time when everyone was making crappy new age films like barefoot in the park and georgy girl, leone was going back to his cinematic childhood of gone with the wind to create an astonishingly mythic epic which is the greatest depiction of the american civil war despite not being about it. the three main characters are larger than life in the best way possible; eastwood is extraordinary as the man with no name here, his character gradually mellowing from the hardened bounty-hunter he was as he witnesses the horrors of the war. if you do not cry at the scene near the end where this hardest of hard men dispassionately comforts a dying boy you are truly heartless. wallach is amazing as tuco, giving one of the greatest physical performances i have ever seen, all darting eyes, fastidious little movements and operatic comedy; he can be scary, funny, vicious and tender, all in the same scene. van cleef on the other hand is the purest depiction of black-hearted evil in any film. his introduction, as he rides a black horse out of a desert sundown and commits three horrific murders is amongst the greatest screen villainy of all time. these three incredible turns are all-time career bests for three astonishingly talented and prolific actors. also superb are guiffre as the doomed drunken yankee captain clinton, pistilli as tuco's brother pablo and brega as wallace, van cleef's burly henchman (brega plays similar heavies in the two previous dollar movies). the other unforgettable element to this movie is ennio morricone's astounding music, which i think i must say is simply the greatest score ever recorded. there is no movie i can name with better, more original or dynamic music. the music is in unique harmony with the images and emotes from the first note to the last crescendo. the music completes every scene. it is lustful, haunting, touching, humorous, ominous, grandiose, suspenseful, operatic, delicious, magnificent, riveting, quiet, melancholy and philosophical. there are too many great musical moments to mention, but perhaps the greatest of all is the l'estasi dell'oro sequence as a crazed tuco runs amongst the graves of sad hill accompanied by the silken soprano voice of edda dell'orso. morricone is probably the most gifted film composer who has ever lived - he is certainly the most prolific - and this is the finest of his many many great scores. in an average movie i hope for maybe five strong scenes with atmosphere and originality. in this long movie, every single scene, bar none, is a brilliant little vignette, yet each flows into the other with perfect rhythm. what else is there to say about this extraordinarily beautiful film ? it is a diamond, an absolute diamond of world cinema, made by one of the few truly original directors, and don't believe for a second anyone who tries to write it off as trashy or simplistic. it contains so many moments of pure storytelling genius it would take me forever to list them. it is a great story, an astounding assault on the senses, a hugely entertaining masterpiece and an everlasting testament to leone's total command of cinema. featuring exquisite photography by tonino delli colli and fantastic sets by carlo simi, it was shot at elios studios in rome, in castilla-leon in northern spain and in leone's favoured locations in almeria. stunningly well written by agenore incrocci, furio scarpelli, luciano vincenzoni and leone. re-mastered and re-released in 2003, with several additional scenes which didn't make it into the original us release, notably a sequence where tuco reunites with his gang and one where angel eyes visits a ruined fort. trivia - eastwood/blondy is the good (buono), wallach/tuco is the ugly (brutto) and van cleef/angel eyes is the bad (cattivo); the latter two are often transposed in much of the english-language publicity and merchandise for the movie. this is the great sergio leone's best film, the best film of the sixties and the best western ever made.";9 September 2008;9;['separate', 'civil', 'looted', 'many', 'alive', 'bad', 'ugly', 'proper', 'fine', 'western', 'many', 'pure', 'boring', 'moral', 'many', 'good', 'white', 'social', 'pure', 'western', 'amazing', 'cinematic', 'intuitive', 'incredible', 'less', 'crappy', 'new', 'cinematic', 'mythic', 'great', 'american', 'civil', 'main', 'large', 'good', 'possible', 'extraordinary', 'hard', 'hard', 'heartless', 'amazing', 'tuco', 'great', 'physical', 'fastidious', 'little', 'operatic', 'scary', 'funny', 'vicious', 'tender', 'same', 'other', 'pure', 'black', 'hearted', 'black', 'horrific', 'great', 'villainy', 'incredible', 'talented', 'prolific', 'drunken', 'burly', 'similar', 'previous', 'other', 'unforgettable', 'astounding', 'great', 'well', 'original', 'dynamic', 'unique', 'first', 'last', 'lustful', 'haunting', 'touching', 'humorous', 'ominous', 'grandiose', 'suspenseful', 'operatic', 'delicious', 'magnificent', 'riveting', 'quiet', 'melancholy', 'philosophical', 'many', 'great', 'musical', 'great', 'tuco', 'sad', 'silken', 'gifted', 'fine', 'many', 'many', 'great', 'average', 'strong', 'long', 'single', 'brilliant', 'little', 'other', 'perfect', 'beautiful', 'absolute', 'few', 'original', 'second', 'trashy', 'simplistic', 'many', 'pure', 'great', 'astounding', 'entertaining', 'everlasting', 'total', 'exquisite', 'delli', 'fantastic', 'northern', 'mastered', 'several', 'additional', 'original', 'good', 'ugly', 'bad', 'cattivo', 'latter', 'much', 'english', 'great', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'western'];0.2233005733005733

116;p-stepien;"here is where the ""man without a name"" trilogy ends. or rather this is where it begins (in a minor major plot spoiler). clint eastwood for the third time dons his trademark multicoloured poncho to mark his place in the international hall of fame, while sergio leone imprints himself as one of the greats of world cinema. after a poorly remade ""yojimbo"" and a barely passable ""for a few dollars more"" leone manages to take hold of all that worked in his previous movie (long focused eyeshots, enrio morricone's soundtrack, quirky but memorable one-liners, the eastwood character) and molds it together with a very good plot, great cast, witty dialogue and a markedly improved budget. the end product is an absolute classic western. despite a wacked-up moral compass it permeates with a sense of profound humanity, which manages to entice in between the wit and humour of the main action. running a mere 3 hours in the extended version time flies by unnoticed, which says a lot about how well and how entertaining this movie is. the 'bad' is money-hungry (albeit all three of our antiheroes love their piece of gold) and scrupulous hired killer angel eyes (lee van cleef). the 'ugly' is wacky wanted dead or alive criminal joker tuco (eli wallach). the 'good' is a morally ambiguous gunslinger, who seems to be more interested in cash than the idea of right or wrong. in the first scene with him in it we see clint gun down three bounty hunters simply because they were after the same man. somehow however in this dastardly world, where the civil war reigns supreme, his character always seems to come out as the better man. naturally being the fastest gun in the state with the bestest aim period always helps. especially when there is treasure buried in a cemetery deep in the civil war front-line. given the era in which this is based the moral ambiguity of good seems to speak in volumes that in such times of war and strife the definition itself seems to shift drastically. the grey area is vast in sergio leone's wild west and suitably so. nonetheless both tuco and blondie (the man without a name has a nickname) are extremely likable antiheroes, while angels eyes makes for a memorable... eee... villain? given the budget and scope of the production leone manages to create a shameless epic, where simultaneously the small-mindedness starkly contrasts, but also beautifully completes, the tragic enormity of death and war. the audacity of war seems to be reflected in these petty squabbles over money, as if the war itself is nothing more than such an feeble argument enhanced to the stage of mass slaughter. within this logic blondie turns out to be an almost angelic figure, who in all his money warmongering is able to have brief flashes of sincere and unabated selflessness. but than again it hard not to agree with tuco and he exclamation that blondie is nothing more than a dirty son of a &^%$*. an absolute classic movie with an influence on westerns, cinematography in general and pop-culture that is impossible to undermine. the iconic eye shots, music, showdowns and characters remain as influential as they were over 40 years ago. and if this doesn't convince you than the longest staring contest in movie history shall blow your socks off (fast forward to the final act for five minutes of nothing else happening but people staring at each other).";3 October 2011;9;['minor', 'major', 'third', 'international', 'passable', 'few', 'more', 'previous', 'quirky', 'memorable', 'good', 'great', 'witty', 'improved', 'absolute', 'classic', 'moral', 'profound', 'main', 'mere', 'extended', 'unnoticed', 'entertaining', 'bad', 'hungry', 'scrupulous', 'ugly', 'wacky', 'dead', 'alive', 'criminal', 'good', 'ambiguous', 'interested', 'wrong', 'first', 'same', 'dastardly', 'civil', 'well', 'fast', 'best', 'civil', 'front', 'moral', 'such', 'vast', 'wild', 'likable', 'memorable', 'shameless', 'small', 'tragic', 'petty', 'more', 'feeble', 'mass', 'angelic', 'able', 'brief', 'sincere', 'unabated', 'more', 'dirty', 'absolute', 'classic', 'general', 'impossible', 'iconic', 'influential', 'long', 'staring', 'final', 'other'];0.0828125

124;oneguyrambling;first up for a spaghetti western this doesn't appear anywhere near as hackneyed and half-arsed as the label might lead you to believe. in fact the blu-ray i rented looked pretty awesome. the tale of the three titular desperados is long and elaborate. how long? how about 3 hours long. long enough to have two on screen deaths and a full meal eaten before a line of dialogue is uttered. the good is clint eastwood, a rough n tough cowboy who plays as fair as you play him. he sports a perpetual three day growth and an equally permanent short cigar propped out of the corner of his thin lips. the bad is lee van cleef, a dodgy soldier on the lookout for a man with one eye, for reasons that i will explain later. the ugly is the only guy with a name used regularly, tuco (eli wallach). in fact tuco is pretty much the star of the show, though good n bad get their moments. good, bad and ugly are eventually all in pursuit of the same target, stolen gold coins, the whereabouts of which are only known to a one eyed soldier who sports a patch. the greater part of the film plays like those riddles where the farmer must get the chook, the fox and the wheat from one shore to the other without something eating something else, only he can only fit one thing in his boat at a time. the bad knows the location of the gold, the good knows not the location but specifics once you get there, and the ugly is the key to bringing all loose ends together. each of the grimy trio spend ample time getting to know and beat the shtuffing out of each other. they take turns leaving each other for dead and at various times all seem to hold the upper hand, only to have it taken from them. there are loads of close ups highlighting shifty eyes, many slow drawn out scenes including what must be the longest mexican stand off on history, and i must say the makeup jobs were quite well done. as the film is set in the us civil war era some of the settings are surprisingly intricate and feature a cast of thousands of well costumed extra, further dispelling any notion that i had of a 'spaghetti western' being a cheap knock-off, and though the length and long periods of inactivity were a little different to my modern day add sensibilities i was rarely bored, which in a three hour 45 year old film might be the strongest recommendation i can give. final rating 7.5 / 10. i wish i could explain it better but the circular sounding whistle that forebodes every gun fight (and parody) know to film originated in this film. if you only watch once western this year or this decade you could do a lot worse than this.;27 January 2012;7;['hackneyed', 'awesome', 'titular', 'long', 'elaborate', 'full', 'rough', 'tough', 'fair', 'perpetual', 'permanent', 'short', 'thin', 'bad', 'dodgy', 'ugly', 'only', 'good', 'bad', 'good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'same', 'eyed', 'great', 'other', 'bad', 'ugly', 'loose', 'grimy', 'ample', 'other', 'other', 'dead', 'various', 'upper', 'close', 'shifty', 'many', 'slow', 'long', 'mexican', 'civil', 'intricate', 'extra', 'western', 'cheap', 'long', 'little', 'different', 'modern', 'bored', 'old', 'strong', 'final', 'circular', 'western', 'bad'];-0.0390212746191006

131;TheUnknown837-1;"""the good, the bad, and the ugly"" is one of the pinnacles of my experiences of a moviegoer. not only is it my all-time favorite western and therefore, one of my all-time favorite movies regardless of genre, but is a landmark in the history of cinema itself. first of all, it is proof that oftentimes the simplest ideas are the best ones. the plot is fairly simple: three men try to reach a buried fortune of army gold coins while the civil war erupts around them. the story is even simpler and yet the audience gets wrapped around in it as 160 minutes and those 160 minutes just seem to whip by so fast that when the movie does end, we're craving for more. the film is also evidence that the western is not a dying genre, for this landmark film from italian director sergio leone has aged like wine; time has done nothing to varnish its style and authority. and it is also proof that spaghetti westerns, which are low in budget and oftentimes flamboyant and over-the-top, can be art, too. this was the third and final time that clint eastwood worked with sergio leone. he returns again as the mysterious man with no name: a cigar-chugging bounty hunter quick on the draw and minimal in emotions. here is the pinnacle of the vintage eastwood as an actor, where he could manufacture a character by doing little other than squinting and hissing some sparse dialogue. eastwood's in prime form here. the movie also features lee van cleef as angel eyes, a mercenary/bounty hunter/army colonel, the exact opposite of the warm-hearted character he played in the previous western ""for a few dollars more."" but oddly enough, even though eastwood gets top billing, the central character is tuco, played with outstanding charisma and sharp energy by eli wallach. wallach had played bad guys and anti-heroes before, but here as the bumbling, deliberately comical, greedy, self-centered, and yet somehow likable and personable tuco, he steals the show. the movie stays interesting as these three men change partnerships with each other, whenever it seems convenient and when it'll bring them closer to the 200,000 dollars in stolen coins. these three characters, wonderfully written and acted, are an important column holding this film's roof up. sergio leone was very much the david lean of italy. he could set up beautiful landscape shots and cinematography tricks like few others could. that's part of the reason why so little can happen for so long and yet the tension mounts higher than most. the way he also contrasts long shots with close-ups and montages it all is sheer brilliance. his timing is also exquisite. he knows how long to go, when to cut, when to produce a long take, when to crop a short one, and so on and so forth. and i cannot leave out ennio morricone's music, which is even more famous than the movie itself. his main theme, which has been used in parodies and cultural references for more than forty years, is justifiably famous. but whereas it is usually used in parodies to produce a comical effect, here it fits the mood of the picture down to the bone. there's not a single weak cue of music in this marvelous soundtrack. but what's most remarkable about this movie is that it sustains itself for the entirety of its 160-minute length and throughout most of it, very little happens. there are long stretches - minutes upon minutes - where virtually nothing happens. oftentimes there isn't any music. it's not just the suspense of waiting for leone's trademark bursts of action; the cinematography and the montage and the directing are so taut and winded together that the audience cannot even force themselves to look away. and if one seeks proof, they have to look no further than the film's climax. of course because it's a western, it will have an obligatory final showdown. but consider this showdown. we have three men facing each other down and it goes on for four minutes. four minutes and the actors are hardly even moving. the only real movement is the camera, which is locked-down, but montaging amongst what is very nearly static images. coupled with ennio morricone's heart-thumping music, this showdown, where very little happens for so long, comes across as one of the most electrifying climaxes in cinema history. sure the music helps a lot, but it's the directing by sergio leone that really makes this scene so intense. ""the good, the bad, and the ugly"" is most definitely one of the most important films of all time and it certainly has earned its immortality in the realm of the cinema. it is undoubtedly the greatest spaghetti western of them all and sergio leone's masterpiece. the first film is this trilogy, ""a fistful of dollars"" was nothing more than an off-beat, but fun remake of ""yojimbo."" the second film was also entertaining and fun. but the third movie is a masterpiece. even at a great length of 160 minutes, and having most of it consumed by silence and stillness, the film never falters to goes on for too long. it goes on and when it does at last end, the audience is left craving for more. they can satisfy themselves in two ways: a) seeking out leone's director's cut, which is about twenty minutes longer and b) watching the movie again, something i have done and will continue to do many, many times.";26 August 2010;10;['bad', 'ugly', 'favorite', 'western', 'favorite', 'simple', 'good', 'simple', 'civil', 'simple', 'more', 'italian', 'low', 'flamboyant', 'third', 'final', 'mysterious', 'quick', 'minimal', 'vintage', 'little', 'other', 'sparse', 'prime', 'mercenary', 'exact', 'warm', 'hearted', 'previous', 'western', 'few', 'more', 'top', 'central', 'outstanding', 'sharp', 'bad', 'comical', 'greedy', 'likable', 'personable', 'interesting', 'other', 'convenient', 'important', 'beautiful', 'few', 'little', 'high', 'most', 'long', 'close', 'sheer', 'exquisite', 'long', 'short', 'famous', 'main', 'cultural', 'more', 'famous', 'comical', 'single', 'weak', 'marvelous', 'remarkable', 'most', 'little', 'long', 'western', 'obligatory', 'final', 'other', 'only', 'real', 'static', 'little', 'electrifying', 'intense', 'bad', 'ugly', 'important', 'great', 'western', 'first', 'more', 'second', 'entertaining', 'fun', 'third', 'great', 'most', 'last', 'more', 'many', 'many'];0.1743524970963995
132;FightingWesterner;"absolutely irresistible, the good, the bad, and the ugly is both the quintessential spaghetti western and the ultimate film from director sergio leone (not to mention one of the most popular westerns of all time), though for a few dollars more and once upon a time in the west are pretty hard to beat. needless to say, it's hard to talk about this without repeating the same praise others have heaped on this film. strangely enough, for something that's become known as one of the definitive clint eastwood vehicles, the real main character (as far as the script is concerned) is eli wallach's tuco ramirez. it's through the eyes of tuco that most of the action is witnessed and all of the character development takes place. as flashy as their roles are, eastwood's ""man with no name"" and lee van cleef's angel eyes seen almost cardboard by comparison. when it comes to deleted and extended scenes, i find myself (surprisingly) in agreement with united artists' studio hucksters from way back when. added scenes are either unnecessary and awkward, like the introduction of tuco's gang, or they interrupt the flow of the story, like angel eyes' trip to the pitiful rebel camp. it's much more effective to watch van cleef disappear after his encounter with bill carson's woman and become almost forgotten, only to reappear at the confederate prisoner-of-war camp, in time to get in on the action. one surprise that awaits those who've seen the movie multiple times and then listened to ennio morricone's soundtrack album, is that the climactic showdown theme il triello (the trio) differs substantially on the album from the take used in the final film, with the movie version featuring a callback to the musical pocket watch in for a few dollars more and the album version containing an extended horn solo at the end, lasting longer than in the film.";11 November 2011;10;['irresistible', 'bad', 'ugly', 'quintessential', 'western', 'ultimate', 'popular', 'few', 'hard', 'needless', 'hard', 'same', 'definitive', 'real', 'main', 'tuco', 'most', 'flashy', 'extended', 'unnecessary', 'awkward', 'pitiful', 'rebel', 'effective', 'confederate', 'multiple', 'climactic', 'final', 'musical', 'few', 'more', 'extended'];-0.092063492063492

138;Bob-45;"during his 25 years as a director, sergio leone directed only eleven films. remarkably, eight rate a 7.0 or better among imdb members, and five are the on the imdb top 250 film all time best list! gb&u is the highest rated of leone films by imdb subscribers. gb&u is also the final segment of the most successful western trilogy ever made, the ""man with no name"" series; though gb&u is a prequel to the first film, a fistfull of dollars. narratively, i've always felt gb&u is the weakest of the series. however, now that i have seen the dvd version with the excised scenes, i believe it is the strongest. two scenes in particular tie the film together. the first, and most crucial, is a scene where angel eyes (lee van cleef) visits a battle-damaged confederate fort and is told the best place to find ""bill carson"" (if he is alive) is in the union p.o.w. camp. so angel eyes appearance later in the film at the camp as the chief jailer makes sense. the second excised scene shows tuco (eli wallach) taking the horribly dehydrated blondie (clint eastwood) to the nearest confederate camp, and finding out the mission where his brother lives is nearby. now, tuco's assuming the identity of ""bill carson"" makes much more sense. i can still quibble with some other shortcomings of the film. lee van cleef did such a terrific job as a the heroic colonel mortimer in the previous film in the trilogy, for a few dollars more, it is almost impossible to accept him here as the cold- blooded killer angel eyes (could the name be referring to the ""angel of death?"" the narrative never explains.) second, though eastwood's hair is blonde in highlights, the name ""blondie"" seems rather arbitrary and, again, jarring. still, these are minor quibbles about a film and a series that transformed westerns completely. the influence of the ""man with no name"" series can be found in virtually every great western made since. though the narrative is, on the surface, about three incredibly ruthless men pursuing $200,000 across a landscape of the civil war, gb&u's underlying agenda is ""anti-war"", particularly the vietnam war. the film makes these points effectively without being offensively preachy. critics of the time criticized the film for ""putting a desert in the middle of the south."" what a crock! although not in the center of the war between the states, quite a bit of action took place in new mexico and texas, and the film's writers even got the generals' names right! this is the handsomest of all of leone's films, and that's saying a lot. the art direction and set decoration are particularly impressive, down to the mortars, gatling guns and naval-style artillary of the time. amazingly, cleopatra, made four years before, cost almost 30 times as much! never before or since have i seen so much of the budget up there on the screen. if you plan to see this film, make sure you watch it on a dvd with additional scenes. you will need to turn on the english subtitles, since the cheap distributors didn't bother to hire ""sound-alikes"" to dub these ""fill-in"" scenes. hopefully, criterion will one day release a restored version of this films with the additional scenes inserted in the film where they belong. after seeing the additional scenes, i raised my rating of the film from a ""7"" to a ""9"". that's how important they are.";28 November 1999;9;['well', 'good', 'high', 'final', 'successful', 'western', 'prequel', 'first', 'weak', 'strong', 'particular', 'first', 'crucial', 'good', 'alive', 'chief', 'second', 'near', 'nearby', 'more', 'other', 'terrific', 'heroic', 'previous', 'few', 'impossible', 'blooded', 'blonde', 'arbitrary', 'jarring', 'minor', 'great', 'ruthless', 'civil', 'underlying', 'anti', 'war', 'preachy', 'right', 'impressive', 'naval', 'much', 'sure', 'additional', 'english', 'cheap', 'additional', 'additional', 'important'];0.1562464985994398

150;Igenlode Wordsmith;"this film is undoubtedly powerful. it is also -- right from the beginning -- almost relentless in its dark fascination for ugliness, cruelty and violence; i spent most of the three-hour running time both metaphorically and physically tensed for the next atrocity, as the camera lingered lovingly across every scar, sweat-stain and ploughed bullet-wound. not so much a case of pornography of violence as pornography of sadism: there is violence aplenty, both of the movie stereotype kind where every shot is an instant kill, and of brutal bloody beatings, but the real mark of this film lies in the long-drawn-out sequences of anticipation, as a man is told how he will die and then the process prolonged to attain the full pleasures of revenge. having experienced at least three vicarious hangings and two deaths by thirst, not to mention a starvation diet and several stalkings-with-guns, with nerves jumping at every minute, i was as wrung out by the end of the picture as if it had been an explicit horror movie -- save that horror movies generally end in catharsis of some kind, the victory of good over evil, the exposure of sanity onto our darkest fears. leone's film is not just 'morally ambiguous' but morally absent; in this world, everything is filthy, corrupt or brutalised, from the idealistic commandant dying of gangrene to the eager anticipation of the townsfolk at the hanging. it's pretty hard to watch. if asked to date this film offhand i'd have put it in the 1970s, for it shares much of the nihilism of the critical favourites of that decade. i've rated it as high as i have because it is both effective at what it does and memorable; it also has a strain of occasional mordant humour, skilfully deployed to relieve otherwise unrelenting degradation. but i've watched the film twice now and have no desire ever to see it again.

153;elvircorhodzic;"the good, the bad and the ugly is a spaghetti western film that, through an unique perspective and style, brings us a magnificent view of the wild west, including plenty of violence. the story of three gunslingers who hate, love and torture each other to find fortune in a cemetery, while avoiding chaos of the american civil war, is one of my favorite of all time. i have watched this movie, regardless of the amount of violence, with great pleasure. this film captures you in almost three hours. during the american civil war, mercenary angel eyes interrogates a former confederate soldier. a frightened soldier has discovered, in order to stay alive, to a dangerous mercenary a secret about a cache of confederate gold. meanwhile, mexican bandit tuco is rescued from three bounty hunters by ""blondie"", a taciturn and enigmatic loner, who delivers him to a local sheriff to collect his bounty. it seems, that they are partners in a lucrative money-making scheme, however, these partnerships in the wild west almost always last for a very short time. blondie grows weary of tuco's complaints, and abandons him penniless in the desert. tuco's revenge is brutal. blondie life was saved by man with a secret of buried gold. the two carry on a portion of the secrets of buried gold, however, the third player, who wants to join, waiting in ambush... regardless of wartime background and some bizarre elements, this is a realistic view of violent, brutal and fanatical relations in the west. the title is a phrase of an ironic attitude, which is even more pronounced through three close characters which are trying to get hold of a hidden treasure, while thousands of people dying around them. it is impossible to remain indifferent to this film, given the cruelty, sharp dialogues and the wit that pervades through the general madness, which borders with an apocalypse. the scenery is simply amazing, characterization is excellent, despite the fact that two of the three characters remain mystical. well, the soundtrack .... the soundtrack is a masterpiece. morricone's magic in the true sense of the word. clint eastwood as ""blondie"" (a.k.a. the man with no name) became a true symbol of the genre after this film. his facial expressions, cigarette and specific way of speaking somewhat borders with trash and again becomes an essential part of the film culture. blondie is definitely not a ""good"" character, he is only smarter, more patient and quicker on the trigger. lee van cleef as angel eyes is a ruthless, unfeeling, and sociopathic mercenary who always finishes his job. he creates a certain counterbalance with his charisma, attitude and cruelties. angel eyes is antagonist, which has maybe a little ""different"" approach in order to achieve his objective, as opposed to the main protagonists. eli wallach as tuco has stole the show, as a dirty, arrogant, sore, but very capable outlaw. his fanaticism exceeds all reasonable limits. he has no right to make mistakes, because he walks through a thin wire between two completely opposite characters. it is difficult to distinguish between good and evil, generosity and cruelty or luck and coincidence in this film. il buono, il brutto, il cattivo is, in my opinion, the best western film of all time.";25 October 2017;10;['bad', 'ugly', 'spaghetti', 'western', 'unique', 'magnificent', 'wild', 'other', 'american', 'civil', 'great', 'american', 'civil', 'mercenary', 'former', 'frightened', 'alive', 'dangerous', 'confederate', 'taciturn', 'enigmatic', 'local', 'lucrative', 'wild', 'last', 'short', 'weary', 'brutal', 'third', 'wartime', 'bizarre', 'realistic', 'violent', 'brutal', 'fanatical', 'ironic', 'close', 'hidden', 'impossible', 'indifferent', 'sharp', 'general', 'amazing', 'excellent', 'mystical', 'true', 'true', 'facial', 'specific', 'essential', 'good', 'smart', 'patient', 'ruthless', 'sociopathic', 'certain', 'little', 'different', 'main', 'dirty', 'arrogant', 'sore', 'capable', 'reasonable', 'thin', 'opposite', 'difficult', 'good', 'evil', 'good', 'western'];-0.0100741239892183
154;Hayden-86055;sergio leone proves yet again that he's the master of cinematography and the western genre. the film is so brilliant in setting up the tone and themes, slipping seamlessly from comedy to tragedy to violent passion and back to comedy again. every character is designed to perfection, even the little characters who have but minutes of screen time are all interesting and very unique. cinematography is spot on, with vast panning shots of the western land and also encompasses frequent but well placed close ups of character's faces so as to better read their emotions (or presumed lack of) and dominate the screen. furthermore, in some shots what the camera cannot see the characters cannot see, and that gives leone the freedom to surprise us with character entrances (tuco surprised blondie for example) that cannot be explained by the normal geography of shots. the music by ennio morricone is absolutely superb and can be both subtle and obvious to drive a scene and enhance the action. the sharp jab of music when the evil angel eyes first rides into frame leads to a certain level of unease that cannot be explained any other way apart from the music. music that has long become legendary and iconic, rightfully so. the acting is breath-taking, clint eastwood, eli wallach, lee van cleef and every single supporting actor (reluctant to use supporting considering how great the roles are) are perfect. 10/10: you cannot dislike this film, and if you do you're just plain wrong in my eyes;31 December 2020;10;['western', 'brilliant', 'violent', 'little', 'interesting', 'unique', 'vast', 'western', 'frequent', 'close', 'surprised', 'normal', 'superb', 'subtle', 'obvious', 'sharp', 'evil', 'certain', 'other', 'legendary', 'iconic', 'single', 'reluctant', 'great', 'perfect', 'wrong'];0.1457093253968253

158;virek213;"between 1964 and 1975, it is said that there were no fewer than three hundred italian-made (though shot in spain) so-called ""spaghetti westerns"" made. most of them were done on the kinds of budgets that wouldn't even cover the catering costs of most big budget hollywood extravaganzas of today. and, truth be told, most of them weren't very good, with badly dubbed voices, and sadistic violence. but sergio leone, though he loathed the term ""spaghetti western"", was different. in his famous ""dollars"" trilogy, he not only became a director of international renown, but he also elevated his star clint eastwood from the rowdy yates years of ""rawhide"" to immortality as the man with no name. the first two films of that trilogy were 1964's a fistful of dollars and 1965's for a few dollars more, both of which were released in america in 1967. the final, and best, film of that trilogy was the mercurial the good, the bad, and the ugly, made in 1966 and released here in america at the end of 1967. in the nearly forty years since, it has come to be seen quite rightly as the quintessential film of the much misunderstood spaghetti western genre. eastwood reprises his man with no name role, having come across information from a dying casualty of the civil war regarding a $200,000 treasure buried in a massive cemetery. the problem is, of course, this dying soldier has only told eastwood part of the information; the other part of it is with a mexican bandido named tuco (wallach, in an extension of his role in the 1960 western classic the magnificent seven). they form an uneasy alliance as they travel across the hellish landscape of the civil war-era southwest, along with the sadistic angel eyes (lee van cleef, extending his role from for a few dollars more). everything, of course, comes to a climax in that massive cemetery, and a traditional leone-choreographed showdown of tremendous intensity. in contrast to a fistful of dollars (which was indeed made with a fistful of dollars--$100,000) and for a few dollars more (made, of course, for a few dollars more--$400,000), leone lavished $1.2 million on the good, the bad, and the ugly; and every red cent (or lira) shows up on the screen. leone and his cinematographer tonino delli colli never miss a trick, as the film juxtaposes wide-open, albeit sun-scorched, landscapes with extreme close-ups of the characters' faces. that last aspect is most in evidence during the climactic showdown. there are also plenty of good lines to be had as well, many of them variations on ""there are two kinds of people in this world."" the extremes in the performances of eastwood, wallach, and van cleef may make it seem like leone doesn't have any control over the film, but he does indeed, and those extreme performances are absolutely right for this outrageously successful film. but the thing that really seals the deal in the good, the bad, and the ugly, of course, is ennio morricone's intense music score, one of the finest composed for any kind of film ever, western or otherwise. the main theme is known to just about anyone who has ever seen even part of this movie; and the cues for the ""ecstasy of gold"" and ""trio"" scenes at the end burn with fiery intensity and sweating suspense. this successful collaboration of leone and morricone, begun in the two earlier films, would reach its apex in the 1969 epic that is generally agreed to be leone's true masterpiece, once upon a time in the west. very lengthy, often blackly comic, flamboyant, and unquestionably violent, the good, the bad, and the ugly is the definitive film in this much-maligned genre, and a film that, aside from the typically bad dubbing of the italian actors, keeps having an impact to this very day.";18 June 2006;8;['few', 'italian', 'most', 'most', 'big', 'most', 'good', 'sadistic', 'western', 'different', 'famous', 'international', 'rowdy', 'first', 'few', 'final', 'good', 'mercurial', 'bad', 'ugly', 'quintessential', 'much', 'western', 'civil', 'massive', 'other', 'mexican', 'western', 'magnificent', 'uneasy', 'hellish', 'civil', 'sadistic', 'few', 'more', 'massive', 'traditional', 'tremendous', 'few', 'few', 'bad', 'ugly', 'red', 'delli', 'wide', 'open', 'extreme', 'close', 'last', 'climactic', 'good', 'many', 'extreme', 'right', 'successful', 'bad', 'ugly', 'intense', 'fine', 'western', 'main', 'fiery', 'successful', 'early', 'true', 'lengthy', 'comic', 'flamboyant', 'violent', 'bad', 'ugly', 'definitive', 'bad', 'italian', 'very'];0.0271962233169129

164;alice liddell;"the good, the bad and the ugly is leone's most sustained attack on the american values psychically embodied in the western, and contemporaneously being globally disseminated culturally, corporately, militaristically (the cold war, vietnam). for instance, the civil war (and this is the great civil war movie, shorn of heroics and ideals) is deliberately decontextualised, so that we have no simplistic dichotomy between noble abolitionists and evil racists, or arrogant yankees and honourable southerners. robbed of context, war is seen for what it is, a mass slaughter, a gigantic mirror firing squad searing the land, the logical outcome of progress. the civil war is often seen as the defining moment of the american 'idea', the victory of certain ideals about liberty and fraternity. here prized amercian liberty is a sprawl of corpses and limbs. the 'good' yankees, the ones who might be seen as carriers of the official myth, are lame, dying, ineffectual, drunk, neurotic, in both cases prone, helpless to stop the victory of evil. the truth about america, embodied in angel eyes, the one effective, powerful union leader we see, is one of torture, robbery and murder. many have compared the prisoner-of-war camp sequences to world war ii - angel eyes' gestapo-like interrogations; the prisoners' orchestra like those in many concentration camps; the equation of the compound with these camps; the wholesale fleecing of prisoners; the trains jammed with prisoners going to their deaths. what is shocking is that the men equated with nazis are the bringers of liberty to slaves, and the creators of a space for the american dream, free from european abuses and corruption. leone shows that american history - the genocide of natives; the history of slavery (and civil rights was a traumatic issue is the us at the time); the obscene culturalisation of capitalism and its concomitant military imperialism are not all that different from the nazi project (never mind that it was the spillover of the civil war that offset the wild west). what is most bitter of all is that in the midst of this holocaust, the mythic machinations of capitalism, as adumbrated in the opening dollars films, continues unabated. indeed, so powerful is the drive of blondie, tuco and angel eyes, that is can actually remove the obstacle of a full-blown war, clear history and human idiocy out of their ritualistic games (the bridge sequence). history tries to catch them; they are swept up by it on occasion, but constantly elude it, looking on at the spectacle just as we do, hitting the remote control when they're sated. it could be said that they are finally marginalised by the reality of america and history, that the grotesque, extreme close-ups are replaced by sweeping long shots full of anonymous distracted mass, but it's really the other way around, america and history have no way of stopping the mythic drive, indeed it depends on it. good makes all 'traditional' westerns look thin. like 'ulysses', every scene is a classic in itself, rich in detail, character, incident, critique, meaning and form. who'd have thought in the 1960s that the greatest, most celebrated and influential italian director would not be antonioni, fellini or visconti, but a hack of sensationalist oaters. but leone's overwhelming mastery of form is near its peak here, as he brings together all the thematic concerns of the first two films. the opening vignettes adumbrate the terms of reference - ugly is defined by gluttony and constant quick-witted flight; bad is a frightening display of murderous, yet humorous efficiency, pinned down by a curious code of conduct; good embodies a systematic defiance and humiliation of the law, inhuman greed, betrayal and attempted sadistic murder. the geometry of circle and triangle are repeatedly invoked to underpin the fabled linearity of the west, endless combinations from the boy at the well and the climactic shootout, to the opening triangle of angel eyes and tuco linked to food, blondie not. the themes of the family (angel eyes' opening slaughter; tuco and his brother), religion (the monastary hospital; blondie as tuco's guardian angel, with the power to give and take life; his jesus-like ordeal in the desert, taunted by the devil), the place of the body in a mythical landscape (and blondie suffers a horrible lashing in the desert), and the contrasting of these mythic archetypes with gross, concupicent humanity, a humanity that opens and closes the film, because this is wallach's film, a man whose crimes have understandable motivation (women, food, money for comfort etc.), who must live in while the abstractions haunt the western landscape. the score, though frequently parodic and comic as ever, is one of morricone's most beautiful, though always ironic;

167;dr_foreman;"on a partial first viewing, i didn't like ""the good, the bad and the ugly."" i thought it was a slow, tedious story about a bunch of unpleasant jerk characters involved in a bog-standard conflict over money. it all seemed very macho and self-consciously cool, and it had obviously inspired all the overrated macho directors i don't like in my own generation - tarantino, for example, and robert rodriguez. in short, i was unimpressed. years later, i gave the film a second shot, watching it all the way through this time. i loved it. what had changed? for one thing, i took more notice of the technical side of the film. i paid attention to leone's famous use of close-ups, his selection of memorable character actors, and his wonderful scene-setting. i admired the detailed sets and the sweeping landscapes, the props and the costumes and all those weird, wonderful faces that leone clearly loved to photograph. i also got hooked by some of the quieter moments that i had skipped over in my first viewing. one of the most effective scenes involves eli wallach's character, tuco, quarreling with his brother when they meet after they've been apart for years. their argument is great, emotionally charged stuff, made all the more effective by the suggestion that they really do love and care about each other. it's the kind of sensitive, human scene you never get to see in a tarantino or rodriguez movie. before i get too fuzzy-wuzzy, i should also like to point out that, on my second viewing, i loved all the action, too. every gunfight is great, in its own way, and they're all a bit different. the greatest of them all is, of course, the final confrontation between the trio, which is accompanied by some of the most rousing music i've ever heard in a film. and hey, there's even a huge civil war battle to provide a change of pace from all the small-scale action. ultimately, ""the good, the bad and the ugly"" is probably just a potboiler of a film, without too much to say about, for example, the human condition. but what a potboiler! it doesn't have to try to be cool - it simply is cool. in fact, it probably defined heroic coolness for an entire generation. eli wallach's performance, leone's direction and morricone's music alone are enough to elevate it to classic status - and the fact that everything else in the movie is great, too, helps elevate it to the level of perhaps the greatest action film ever made. and to think, i missed all that the first time through...";21 August 2006;10;['partial', 'first', 'bad', 'ugly', 'slow', 'tedious', 'unpleasant', 'bog', 'standard', 'macho', 'cool', 'overrated', 'macho', 'own', 'tarantino', 'short', 'unimpressed', 'second', 'more', 'technical', 'famous', 'close', 'memorable', 'wonderful', 'detailed', 'sweeping', 'weird', 'wonderful', 'first', 'effective', 'great', 'effective', 'other', 'sensitive', 'human', 'tarantino', 'fuzzy', 'second', 'great', 'own', 'different', 'great', 'final', 'rousing', 'huge', 'civil', 'small', 'bad', 'ugly', 'much', 'human', 'cool', 'cool', 'heroic', 'entire', 'enough', 'classic', 'great', 'great', 'first'];0.175354609929078

176;PCC0921;"let's backtrack for a minute here. the good, the bad and the ugly (gbu), is the most famous of the spaghetti westerns, however, the spaghetti western was around a little bit before the release of gbu. the term basically describes western films, based on american history, that were made in europe, most notably italy and spain. some also were made in mexico and they all came out in the theaters in the 60s & 70s. it is actually a critical term that american critics coined in the 60s, making fun of these films, because america was so used to the tv westerns that filled the airwaves. but, as time moved forward, the term became acceptable, as well as, the movies themselves. it turned into a positive term, because these films were really good, but a little too different for some. these films now have achieved critical acclaim today, long after their release. gbu is the third film in a series known as ""the man with no name"" trilogy, directed by legendary, italian film director, sergio leone. the musical score was done by master film composer, ennio morricone. he would later go on to do the score for brian de palma's untouchables (1987), another great movie and favorite of mine. gbu is that classic story about three completely different guys, the good one (clint), the bad one (van cleef) and the ugly one (wallach). it has a wonderful collection of colorful, interesting supporting characters that help propel this film to its exciting end. its so well, craftily done that you don't even notice the basic, simple plot of three outlaws, in the ultimate struggle to see, who can find the gold from a heist that was hidden away. this also helps to bring forward the time period that the film wants to establish, being as the gold was stolen from a confederate stash during the civil war. eastwood and wallach's characters get intertwined with each other, while van cleef's, angel eyes, always is looking for an opportunity to kill them both. it's a great story. eli wallach almost killed himself a couple times in this film. issues with stunts and poor safety measures almost did some of the work for angel eyes. eli wallach is brilliant and funny in this film too. this is clint eastwood at his best. clint's character also influenced marty mcfly (michael j. fox), in back to the future iii (1990). having mixed language-speaking actors also complicated matters. eastwood, van cleef and wallach all spoke english, but most of the rest of the cast was italian or spanish, hence the need for dubbing. sergio leone spoke hardly any english, so he and wallach communicated by speaking french to each other and the others had interpreters. charles bronson was originally chosen to be in lee van cleef's ""bad"" roll, but declined to be in the film. there is no dialogue in the first eleven minutes of the film, but who cares. gbu's strongest link is its dreamy-like imagery mixed in with amazing, mesmerizing music. this is what film is all about and this is the definitive western. 9.4 (a mygrade) = 9 imdb.";14 January 2021;9;['bad', 'ugly', 'famous', 'western', 'little', 'western', 'american', 'critical', 'american', 'used', 'acceptable', 'positive', 'good', 'little', 'different', 'critical', 'third', 'legendary', 'italian', 'musical', 'great', 'favorite', 'classic', 'different', 'good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'wonderful', 'colorful', 'interesting', 'exciting', 'basic', 'simple', 'ultimate', 'confederate', 'civil', 'other', 'great', 'poor', 'brilliant', 'funny', 'good', 'future', 'mixed', 'complicated', 'english', 'most', 'italian', 'spanish', 'other', 'bad', 'first', 'strong', 'dreamy', 'like', 'amazing', 'mesmerizing', 'definitive'];0.1255347593582887

""the bad"" is second-string actor lee van cleef, coming into his glory. he played an avuncular character in ""for a few dollars more"" (not the same character). leone tried to get his hooks on several better or better-known actors (as he had with eastwood's role in ""fistful"") and got stuck with van cleef again. well, that worked out just fine. bronson might have been excellent, but playing second fiddle to eastwood might not have been his style. ny stage actor and movie star eli wallach (legendary from this role) is tuco, a bandit with no moral compass. wallach's comedy ""how to steal a million"" (starring audrey hepburn and an unlikely peter o'toole) came out also in 1966 and it's interesting to compare his two characters, one a jet-setting businessman and the other an unimaginably dirty western drifter). oh, and in the scene where he's trying to find the grave, wallach runs like a girl. the plot: the good (eastwood) the bad (van cleef) and the ugly (wallach) chase after buried gold, with changing alliances to suit their needs. but to get the gold, the three have to fight their way through a war (loosely based on sibley's new mexico campaign in early 1862, fitting for the date on arch stanton's grave marker). i thought this was a great movie the first few times i saw it--on television, shown on two nights, broken by commercials. seeing it again for the first time in years, restored and uncut, i changed my opinion. the story takes about an hour to start. the good, the bad and the ugly are introduced in unconscionably long sequences. nearly every scene could have been trimmed with no loss to the story. but leone is not interested in story. as he proved in his even more bloated epics ""once upon a time in the west"" (where he dawdles through a credit sequence that is a mini-movie in its own right and longer than most ""short features"") and the pretentious but tedious ""once upon a time in america"",leone is interested in showing off what he can do with money. he spends as if he's a congressperson and his movies are government programs: the more he gets, the more ways he can find to waste it. the first hour: meet the characters. some of it's fun, especially tuco's chase of ""blondie""; but it's bloated, full off leone's trademark too-close closeups and far-off vistas (can he do nothing in between?) the second hour: the plot gets rolling and blondie, tuco and ""angel eyes"" begin their episodic interactions. the first third of the third hour could be liberally cut with no devastating results to the story or the movie. and they even restored some scenes in a new version! can there be too much of a good thing? you bet there can. tuco's scene talking to a dead chicken might clear up a few points previously left vague, but it adds nothing to the film. spoilers ahead: the last half-hour, where all the ragged ends begin being sewn together, is brilliant. i own the leone westerns to see just the good bits over and over, and the climax here almost makes one feel squirming through the first two and a half hours was worth every yawn. from the time blondie fires his cannon until the final frame, especially the search through the cemetery and the classic showdown between the three, when they have finally left the war behind and only they exist in the world to live or die, is beautifully shot and acted. the good: 1) ennio morricone's legendary score. the movie's theme is rightfully iconic, and i love his ""ecstasy of gold"" (i'm a sucker for bells). his score also has foreshadowing of his delicate work in ""the mission"" in the 1980s. 2) clint eastwood. while eastwood's flicks as director are strangely humorless, eastwood's wry humor and charm shine through this movie's bloat. he's an underrated film actor who deservedly shot to stardom in these films. 3) lee van cleef. while no one's first choice for a costar, van cleef seems to realize this is his moment and he makes the most of it, becoming one of the most slyly despicable baddies in westerns. 4) eli wallach. while i'm tempted to move him to ""the bad"" for stealing almost every shot he's in, his performance is good . . . if tiring when the movie his watched on several outings. wallach did not know how to dial tuco back; neither did leone who, i guess, decided, for once, to get value for money. nevertheless, eastwood can express more with a flick of his cigar than wallach for all his overacting. 5) spain. franco, the one fascist dictator not targeted in ww2, ran an oppressive regime, but one where filmmakers found they could get anything they wanted for a well-placed bribe. the long shots of the land do resemble the never-never land of the old west, but they have their own stark beauty. just as one can't go wrong with tuscany, it's difficult to make this part of spain look bad on film (lean even used it in ""lawrence of arabia""). the ugly: leone. his closeups of ugly actors, his meaningless tracking shots, the very overwhelming bloat of the whole movie when seen in one go. if any movie benefited from being chopped up by commercial television this one did. had i not known, from repeated previous tv viewings, just how good the climax was, i might never have finished it. overall, a good story well acted, but with no sense of restraint. by all accounts leone was a glutton. he simply never knew when to stop eating. he also never knew when to cut a movie. he could easily trim an hour out of this long-winded, overblown, occasionally messy flick and it would never be missed.";14 June 2018;6;['bad', 'ugly', 'bloated', 'big', 'pun', 'few', 'more', 'imho', 'fine', 'more', 'much', 'big', 'well', 'small', 'underrated', 'later', 'wry', 'relative', 'separate', 'occasional', 'such', 'bad', 'avuncular', 'few', 'more', 'same', 'several', 'well', 'fistful', 'fine', 'excellent', 'second', 'legendary', 'moral', 'unlikely', 'interesting', 'other', 'dirty', 'western', 'good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'early', 'grave', 'great', 'first', 'few', 'first', 'uncut', 'bad', 'ugly', 'long', 'interested', 'bloated', 'own', 'long', 'most', 'short', 'pretentious', 'tedious', 'interested', 'more', 'first', 'fun', 'full', 'close', 'second', 'episodic', 'first', 'third', 'devastating', 'new', 'much', 'good', 'dead', 'few', 'vague', 'last', 'half', 'ragged', 'brilliant', 'good', 'first', 'worth', 'final', 'classic', 'legendary', 'iconic', 'delicate', 'wry', 'underrated', 'first', 'most', 'despicable', 'bad', 'good', 'tiring', 'several', 'more', 'fascist', 'oppressive', 'long', 'old', 'own', 'stark', 'wrong', 'tuscany', 'difficult', 'bad', 'lean', 'ugly', 'ugly', 'meaningless', 'overwhelming', 'whole', 'commercial', 'previous', 'good', 'good', 'overblown', 'messy'];0.0413476874003189
184;TheHonestCritic;"""the good, the bad and the ugly"" (1966), this movie gives you everything that a great western has to offer, and then some! i've seen a lot of western movies in my life, and i enjoyed the majority of them. but, none of them have ever come close to matching this one. perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects and a perfect soundtrack. the story at first glance just sounds like your typical hunt for gold. but, i assure you that it's presented in such a very fresh and unique way. one thing to point out, most western films usually have a duel scene at some point during the movie. this film has a three-way duel at the end, you're probably wondering: ""how does that work?"" well, that's all i'm going to say about that. you'll have to watch the movie and see for yourself! the acting is nothing short of sublime from the whole cast. clint eastwood puts on a flawless performance as blondie. eli wallach is fantastic as tuco, the friend/enemy of blondie. lee van cleef is exceptional as angel eyes, the main villain. as for the rest of the cast, they are just as exceptional. the sets/locations are spectacular and give this movie a great atmosphere. all of the special effects are very well-done, and still hold up to this day. finally, the soundtrack composed by ennio morricone is phenomenal. it is, without a shadow of a doubt, one of my top 10 all-time favorite film scores. my personal favorite parts of the soundtrack are: ""the ecstasy of gold"", ""the trio"" and the main theme song is one of my top 10 favorite opening theme songs in any movie. the film score sets the tone right from beginning to end. that's one way you can tell that you have a phenomenal soundtrack, when you play it at any random point in the song itself and recognize what movie, or show, it's from. the soundtrack for this movie is nothing short of memorable and iconic, kudos to you, ennio morricone! ""the good, the bad and the ugly"" is a cinematic masterpiece. another thing, it's just shy of three hours long. but, i can promise you, the three hours go by in a flash. it doesn't even feel like three hours, yet it is. what more can i say? i could watch this film 1,000 times in a row and never get bored with it. of course, i give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 imdb stars. if you love western films, and you haven't seen ""the good, the bad and the ugly"" yet, what are you waiting for? go and watch it today! i promise that you will not regret it.";27 April 2020;10;['bad', 'ugly', 'great', 'western', 'perfect', 'perfect', 'perfect', 'perfect', 'special', 'perfect', 'first', 'typical', 'fresh', 'unique', 'most', 'western', 'duel', 'short', 'sublime', 'whole', 'flawless', 'fantastic', 'exceptional', 'main', 'exceptional', 'spectacular', 'great', 'special', 'phenomenal', 'top', 'favorite', 'personal', 'favorite', 'main', 'top', 'favorite', 'phenomenal', 'random', 'short', 'memorable', 'iconic', 'bad', 'ugly', 'cinematic', 'shy', 'more', 'bored', 'western', 'bad', 'ugly'];0.2445684523809524

198;jcbutthead86;the good,the bad and the ugly is simply a masterpiece of cinema and is not only my favorite movie of all time but,in my opinion the greatest western ever made and the greatest film ever made. from it's great direction,acting and score the good,the bad and the ugly is a flawless masterpiece that you'll watch again and again. tg,tb&tu tells the story of three gunslingers named blondie(the good,clint eastwood),angel eyes(the bad,lee van cleef)and tuco(the ugly,eli wallach)who are on the search for 300,000$ in gold coins. with blondie and tuco teaming up and angel eyes not far behind,the three gunslingers will stop at nothing to get the gold even if it means going through the civil war or traveling through sunny,dirty grind of the west. it's an unforgettable journey that the three men and viewers wont forget. tg,tb&tu is a film i love for many reasons and one of the reasons is that it's a brilliant finale to the amazing dollars or man with no name trilogy. with a fistful of dollars and for a few dollars more,sergio leone brought brilliant direction,tension filled standoffs and gunfights and changed the western forever. but with tg,tb&tu,leone created an epic film something bigger and larger than the first two films. the gunfights and standoffs are given a much bigger scale and filled with more tension and excellence. tg,tb&tu also succeeds at being a great third film because where in most trilogies the third film is always the weakest,tg,tb&tu is one of the rare occasions in film history where the last film of a trilogy is the best one and tells a great story. leone obviously wanted to top the first two films and he tops them both in a flawless way and with the greatest of ease. also, tg,tb&tu is a different film from the first two where a fistful of dollars was about fighting families and for a few dollars more was about two gunslingers trying to get an outlaw for gold dollars,tg,tb&tu is about a journey through the west and a adventure about trying to find gold coins and traveling through hell and high water to get it. this is the greatest third film ever made and in my opinion when filmmakers want to complete a trilogy tg,tb&tu is a film that should be the template on how to complete a trilogy. another thing i love about this film and the other two films is the way leone paints the west the way it was:dirty,dusty and ugly. when you watch the film as a viewer you'll feel like you're in the dust and dirt with the characters giving the film a realistic feel and making you feel like you're in the west. with this film,gone was the white hat/black hat good guy/bad guy characters of the american western films. the characters like blondie and tuco aren't painted in black and white,there is a gray area with both of them unlike angel eyes who is a clear cut bad guy with no gray area and is vicious from beginning to end. with these characterizations in leone's trilogy the western film was forever changed and the western genre after this film became much more gritty and dirty and whether leone mean't it or not reinvented the western. the civil war scenes are breathtaking and gives the film a sense of realism where you feel like you're in the civil war with the soldiers. i also love the fact that leone shows the horrors of the civil war,showing the viewer how dark,brutal and bloody the civil war or war in general can be. tg,tb&tu despite it's epic running time of 163 amazing minutes moves at a great pace and there is not a wasted scene in the film. this is an epic that feels like it's shorter. the action and violence in the film is excellent and done in a fast and stylish fashion and will truly blow your mind when the action happens. the last 20-30 minutes are some of the best moments in film history. remember when i talked about the great standoffs and shootouts in the first two films? leone takes the standoffs of the first two films gives us a final,excellent standoff that fits with the films epic tone and is so masterful and truly unforgettable and will stay with forever. this film and the first two films are the reasons sergio leone is not only one of my favorite directors of all time but also one of the greatest directors of all time. clint eastwood is excellent as blondie(the good),bringing an intensity with his eyes,snarl and image,but also bringing a level of depth to the character. next to dirty harry callahan,the man with no name is his most iconic character. lee van cleef is amazing as angel eyes(the bad),a ruthless killer who will kill anyone or do anything to get wants. eli wallach gives a brilliant and masterful performance as tuco(the ugly),with wallach bringing humor,intensity and depth to the performance. a great performance. sergio leone's direction is excellent and masterful,giving the film an epic scope and landscape. leone's gunfights and action scenes are excellent and have great suspense and timing. i love leone's close-ups in the film and you can see the expressions in the actors eyes and what they are thinking. great job,leone. ennio morricone's score is brilliant,amazing and one of the greatest film scores in movie history. from it's masterful opening theme,the score is intense,memorable and iconic and morricone's best score although once upon a time in the west's score comes close. a flawless and unforgettable score from morricone. in final word,the good,the bad and the ugly is a flawless masterpiece from beginning to end that will live on forever and stand the test of time. if you love cinema and westerns i highly suggest you buy this film and see it now. highly recommended. 10/10.;10 November 2012;10;['bad', 'ugly', 'favorite', 'great', 'western', 'great', 'great', 'bad', 'ugly', 'flawless', 'good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'civil', 'sunny', 'dirty', 'unforgettable', 'many', 'brilliant', 'amazing', 'few', 'more', 'brilliant', 'epic', 'big', 'large', 'first', 'big', 'more', 'great', 'third', 'most', 'third', 'weak', 'rare', 'last', 'good', 'great', 'first', 'flawless', 'great', 'different', 'first', 'few', 'gold', 'gold', 'high', 'great', 'third', 'other', 'dirty', 'dusty', 'ugly', 'realistic', 'white', 'black', 'good', 'bad', 'american', 'western', 'black', 'white', 'gray', 'clear', 'cut', 'bad', 'gray', 'vicious', 'western', 'western', 'gritty', 'dirty', 'western', 'civil', 'civil', 'civil', 'dark', 'brutal', 'bloody', 'civil', 'general', 'epic', 'amazing', 'great', 'short', 'excellent', 'fast', 'stylish', 'last', 'good', 'great', 'first', 'first', 'final', 'excellent', 'epic', 'masterful', 'unforgettable', 'first', 'favorite', 'great', 'excellent', 'dirty', 'harry', 'iconic', 'amazing', 'ruthless', 'brilliant', 'masterful', 'great', 'excellent', 'masterful', 'epic', 'excellent', 'great', 'close', 'great', 'brilliant', 'amazing', 'great', 'masterful', 'intense', 'memorable', 'iconic', 'good', 'close', 'flawless', 'unforgettable', 'final', 'bad', 'ugly', 'flawless'];0.2443442292171106
199;zeekwunlau;at the end of the trilogy, it can be seen that due to the rising budget, one of the trilogy's narratives is more magnificent than the first one: the first is a single-line narrative of a single scene (town), and the second is a single-line narrative of a multi-scenario ( the goal of chasing the bounty), to the last part is a multi-scenes multi-line narrative, and even put it in the context of the civil war, quite the taste of western epic. it also reached the apex in the soundtrack, not only has the extremely classic main theme, but also other long soundtracks have very good melody. the story tells three people. the ugly, the bad, the good have a common goal: a treasure chest with 200,000 gold coins hidden. this goal is essentially the same as the reward object. the first two know half of the information, and dongmu hold the other half of the message. contrary to the second part, the rhythm of the first half of this part is slow, and it suddenly became tight when it entered the battlefield. the final three-person duel is also 100 times more exciting than the previous two-man or one-to-many duel, because you ca n't guess every who will shoot first? the ugly is undoubtedly a comedy character, he is funny, but also quite ambitious. the bad is indeed bad, and it is no wonder that in the end, the other two will choose to fight him first. our dongmu is still a decent one, and the conversation with the other two is quite the first to stir up the gang. the addition of war scenes is to my understanding that the director's aversion to violence is a concentrated manifestation: western cowboys are fighting each other for personal money, and even paying the price of their lives. it seems so naive and worthless in the face of the death and injury of war. and this tragic battle is only for a broken bridge that is meaningless to the non-commissioned officer, why not ironic. in general, this is a magnificent movie. with the support of funds, the scene, soundtrack, story and other aspects have reached a new height, leaving a paradigm for the later western movies, and also cleverly included director's thoughts on violence, justice and other topics;17 April 2020;9;['magnificent', 'first', 'first', 'single', 'single', 'second', 'single', 'multi', 'last', 'multi', 'scenes', 'multi', 'line', 'civil', 'western', 'classic', 'main', 'other', 'long', 'good', 'ugly', 'bad', 'common', 'same', 'first', 'other', 'contrary', 'second', 'first', 'slow', 'tight', 'final', 'exciting', 'previous', 'many', 'ugly', 'funny', 'ambitious', 'bad', 'bad', 'other', 'decent', 'other', 'first', 'concentrated', 'western', 'other', 'personal', 'naive', 'worthless', 'tragic', 'broken', 'meaningless', 'non', 'ironic', 'general', 'magnificent', 'other', 'new', 'later', 'western', 'other'];-0.0414747202483051

201;CelluloidRehab;"what can one say about a masterpiece ?? perfection!!! this movie is perfect. you have landscapes and locations that are amazing by themselves. there's the score by ennio morricone which has the spirit of the west all over it. there's the acting core of eastwood, wallach and van cleef. and there's sergio. out of all the sergio leone films that i've seen, this is the most complete (even more complete since i've seen the remastered dvd). it has a story that is more than revenge and has subtle humanistic and political messages (pow camp, references to andersonville prison, the meaningless bridge war, the missionary hospital, the dying confederate soldier,etc). of course the most refined was fistful of dynamite (a.k.a - duck, you sucker), but it didn't have eastwood and has a different ""feel"" from the first three. also in that same light as once upon in america (also politically charged and eastwood-less). it is safely the most refined of the eastwood-leone trilogy. it has a protagonist that is not the classical hero type. he is more of an anti-hero. you have the villain that is ruthless beyond measure and in between there's the dangerous comic relief brute. this is a must see film for anyone that likes movies. the best scene is the duel scene at the end with all 3 of our protagonists dueling each other in a mexican standoff/chess game.";22 June 2004;10;['perfect', 'amazing', 'complete', 'complete', 'remastered', 'more', 'subtle', 'humanistic', 'political', 'meaningless', 'missionary', 'refined', 'fistful', 'dynamite', 'different', 'first', 'same', 'less', 'refined', 'classical', 'more', 'anti', 'ruthless', 'dangerous', 'comic', 'good', 'other', 'mexican'];0.06375
202;disinterested_spectator;"prior to the release of ""the good, the bad, and the ugly,"" whenever a bunch of people in a movie embarked on a project to obtain a great deal of money, something always went wrong. in some cases, the project was illegal, and given the production code in force at the time, the criminals had to die or be arrested, as in ""the killing"" (1956). in ""it's a mad, mad, mad, mad world"" (1963), the treasure hunters are not criminals, but the buried treasure was stolen loot, so they all had to be arrested in the end. but even when the enterprise was entirely legal, there was an unwritten rule that it must fail, that pursuing money per se was wrong in some way and must not be rewarded. for example, in ""the treasure of the sierra madre"" (1948), there was nothing illegal about the three men prospecting for gold, but it had to fail nevertheless. when the two surviving members of the team realize that all their gold has been lost, they laugh about it. presumably, even when the search for money was legal, it had to fail, as a way of making those in the audience content with their lot. one slight exception is ""king solomon's mines"" (1950 et al.). they do manage to keep a handful of gems, but the vast treasure is lost for good. and then came ""the good, the bad, and the ugly."" three men set out to find buried treasure, and something incredible happens: the treasure does not turn out to be worthless confederate bonds; it does not blow away in the wind; the men pursuing the treasure are not arrested; and only one of them dies, leaving the other two alive to split the loot. nothing like that had ever been seen in a movie before, and the violation of the taboo against that sort of thing was exhilarating. this amoral ending was perfectly in line, however, with all that had come before in that movie. were it not for the advance notice provided by the tagline, ""for three men the civil war wasn't hell. it was practice,"" we would not even realize that the movie was set in the civil war when it begins. and it is only gradually that we become aware of the war, because it really does not seem to concern the three principle characters. the ugly is a bandit, the good is a bounty hunter, and the bad is a hired killer, each pursuing his own business with no interest in the war. only when they find out about the buried confederate gold does the war take on significance for them. and as they pursue that gold, the war slowly closes in around them, either getting in their way or providing opportunities. they walk through that war as if they were walking through a cluttered room. in one case, when the war is really getting in their way, they blow up a bridge so that the soldiers will leave the area, which has as an incidental byproduct the result that the pointless daily slaughter is brought to an end. actually, the amoral nature of this movie was no surprise, for it was also characteristic of the two previous westerns by sergio leone featuring the man with no name, ""a fistful of dollars"" (1964) and ""for a few dollars more"" (1965). this was a new kind of western protagonist. he was not a law enforcement officer; he was not seeking to avenge someone's death; and he was not trying to reform and hang up his guns. instead, he was either a hired gun or bounty hunter who profited by his expertise with a pistol, and had no intention of changing his ways. in many ways, the movie is a comedy, for it is replete with cruel jokes and humorous dialogue, of which these are some of my favorite punch lines: ""once i'm paid, i always see the job through."" ""but you don't look like the one who'll collect it."" ""i'd hate to be placed in his shoes."" ""more feeling!""

208;Jacques98;"in the sad little world of critical reviews, both professional and written by jobless house-husbands, the words ""masterpiece"" and ""classic"" are always used to mask any disappointments a film may have. when you go to a fine restaurant and spend half your paycheck on a piece of meat, you unconsciously force yourself into denial that that piece of meat is the best you've ever eaten. even if you would have been more content with mcdonald's. why? because you just spent half your paycheck on it, and some french guy somewhere says it's fine meat, thus you have to agree. you have to. you're unwilling to admit your disappointment. you tell yourself that your taste buds just aren't evolved enough, even though that is just stupid. it works the same way with movies. once you've seen 500 pages of perfect reviews, read that the film received 100% rating from professional critics, admitting to yourself that you weren't content with the film isn't easy. it's even harder to admit it to other people. it's nearly impossible to write a review stating it. this opening paragraph can apply to thousands of movies. but this is how i felt about the good, the bad, and the ugly. it wasn't bad, but it lacked the full contentment i expected. emphasis on story/plot has died out over the years. in 2009, top critics put only slightly more emphasis on it as they put on the color of the main character's shirt. perhaps this is why we see movies, forget about them, go see another one just like the last one, forget about it: repeat the same hollow cycle until we die. aristotle put story at the center of all fictional work; modern critics put cinematography and acting at the center. whether you side with an ancient dead guy or bitter middle-aged men devoid of sex lives, it's hard to deny that the latter mindset just leads to pretty moving pictures and eventually is completely forgettable. that is the main flaw i had with the good, the bad, and the ugly. while this film has purely awesome moving pictures (more on that later), the plot is weak. in fact, it's so weak and so predictable that i found that i could quickly care less about anything happening. for the film's credit, i will say that the predictable linier plot did have some quirky variation, and added scenes that you wouldn't normally expect in a western. however, the fact that the driving force of this epic film is nothing but a cliche treasure hunt is the reason i found it so lacking. couldn't the writers have been a little more creative? if they had been, this would have been an absolute perfect film. if they had been, there would be nothing for me to criticize. even those who already find this a perfect film, can you really deny that a little more creativity would have made it even more perfect? furthermore, the civil war scenes pumped an even more annoying vibe into the good, the bad, and the ugly because they were just copy/pasted from generic war films. they added nothing but another layer of seen-this-thousand-times to a generic plot that was already getting annoying because i've seen it a thousand times. and none of this criticism is from a modern standpoint. everything i just criticized was unoriginal in its time. what was good was the ugly. you've read this part in hundreds of other reviews, so i'm not going to take much time here. the good, the bad, and the ugly perfected true grit like never before. that's where the credit lies. from rugged faces to rugged deserts to rugged clothing to rugged buildings to rugged camera style, nothing was left of the sanitized world we live in. some people criticize the realism of this and the realism of other aspects of the film, to which i say: i just don't care. the good, the bad, and the ugly can be taken as a mature fantasy set in a overdone western worldwhat's wrong with that? people also criticize the film by saying it's not as good as its prequels, which is a matter of taste. however, it isn't a matter of taste that the prequels didn't even come close to the epic scope or raw grit of this film. they didn't have the brutal nihilism of the characters. they were more polished, with tight conventional plotting and less overt backdrops. another incorrect criticism of the good, the bad, and the ugly is that it is nothing but a macho, quirky, masculinity-fest with no bearing on the realistic world. those people make me laugh. the good, the bad, and the ugly pretty much singlehandedly brought the nameless antihero into cinema. while this character really gets annoying in modern films, he works here because he was one of the first, as well as one of the best. while i will agree that he has little bearing on real life, it's the secondary characters that break the cliche. the title of the film as well as the film itself both illustrate the opposite that the typical period western would illustrate: the world is not black-and-white. good doesn't always win. people can stand on both sides of the moral line. good guys can do immoral things. it's here that the true underline genius comes out, because this is something even modern filmmakers don't understand. overall, there is nothing i can say to shake people from the belief that the good, the bad, and the ugly is the best film ever made. be it due to nostalgia, or be it due to a level of depth i missed, i can't change that. i'm not trying to. but i just want to say that the good, the bad, and the ugly is typical in some aspects. in others, it's legend. i just refuse to give it a perfect score because it's a supposed ""classic"". 6/10";26 February 2009;8;['sad', 'little', 'critical', 'professional', 'jobless', 'fine', 'good', 'more', 'content', 'french', 'fine', 'unwilling', 'stupid', 'same', 'perfect', 'professional', 'content', 'easy', 'hard', 'other', 'impossible', 'bad', 'ugly', 'bad', 'full', 'top', 'more', 'main', 'last', 'same', 'hollow', 'fictional', 'modern', 'ancient', 'dead', 'bitter', 'middle', 'aged', 'devoid', 'hard', 'latter', 'forgettable', 'main', 'bad', 'ugly', 'awesome', 'weak', 'weak', 'predictable', 'predictable', 'lini', 'quirky', 'epic', 'lacking', 'creative', 'absolute', 'perfect', 'perfect', 'more', 'perfect', 'civil', 'annoying', 'bad', 'ugly', 'copy', 'generic', 'generic', 'annoying', 'modern', 'unoriginal', 'good', 'ugly', 'other', 'much', 'bad', 'ugly', 'true', 'rugged', 'rugged', 'rugged', 'rugged', 'rugged', 'sanitized', 'other', 'bad', 'ugly', 'mature', 'western', 'good', 'epic', 'raw', 'brutal', 'polished', 'tight', 'conventional', 'less', 'overt', 'incorrect', 'bad', 'ugly', 'macho', 'quirky', 'f', 'realistic', 'bad', 'ugly', 'annoying', 'modern', 'first', 'good', 'little', 'real', 'secondary', 'typical', 'western', 'black', 'white', 'good', 'moral', 'good', 'immoral', 'true', 'underline', 'modern', 'bad', 'ugly', 'good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'typical', 'perfect'];-0.0628710074971757

210;williampsamuel;"this movie is a legend. it changed the way we look at westerns. it's been endlessly imitated and parodied, but never equaled. it made clint eastwood a household name. and yet, as i watch the good, the bad, and the ugly, i can't help but feel a little sad knowing that what is perhaps the greatest of all westerns was made in italy. yes, this is one of the much-maligned spaghetti westerns, but it's as far above the average entry in its genre as star wars is to starship troopers, or a hard day's night to spiceworld. surely we're all familiar with the basics of the story. the mysterious gunman blondie (eastwood), the rough hewn bandit tuco (eli wallach), and the heartless killer angel eyes (lee van cleef) search the west for a hidden cache of gold, as the civil war rages around them. there are countless twists, turns and betrayals, as each man realizes he can't do this on his own. you can't be sure of anything, except that before the adventure is over, there's going to be one hell of a showdown. sergio leone has done an exceptional job of writing and directing. there's not one line of unnecessary dialog, in fact there's no dialog at all for many long stretches. and not since high noon has a movie been as successful at slowly building tension. of course in high noon, the entire movie was buildup, until the final shootout. here, leone gradually builds tension in a scene, and then provides a stylistically violent payoff again and again. nowhere does he do it better than in the final standoff, where each of the three leading characters have a gun trained on one of the others. they each know that whoever wins here will walk away one of the richest men in the west, but they're also aware that pulling the trigger has a very good chance of getting both them and their target killed. and yet, if two of them where to ally themselves against the third. we in the audience are also fully aware of these facts, but the movie gives us no clue as to who will come out the loser. leone has also produced something that is a true feast for the senses. through use of long unbroken shots, he shows the vastness, solitude, and desolate beauty of the west. mesas, canyon lands, endless sand dunes, and scrub forest are all lavishly photographed, as the wind whistles and dust flies on the breeze. his sunrises and sunsets are works of art. looking at this movie, it's easy to forget that it was filmed in europe. leone has also added quirky touches, like the legless veteran who hangs out at the local saloon, quite literally dragging himself up to the counter, or the union colonel obsessed with destroying the bridge he's supposed to guard, so there won't be anything fighting over and he can go home. of course it's not just the director who's responsible a movie's success or failure. the actors matter as well, and much credit is due the leading men for their brilliant performances. clint eastwood has long been one of my favorite actors, and this is by far one of his best pieces of acting. as blondie, he's as tough as nails, utterly cool under fire, and one of the most mysterious figures since jeff costello. there's little of his past; he's in a rather unique partnership with tuco at the film's beginning, and there's a history with angel eyes, but we get no idea where he's from, or what life he led before becoming an outlaw. he doesn't talk much either, preferring to puff on his cigarette. but he clearly follows some form of personal code, and there's no doubt that he's one of- if not the- best gunmen in the west. cleef's angel eyes is much more straightforward; he's the very embodiment of evil. this man has no qualms about killing. indeed, he seems to relish causing death and suffering for its own sake, as when he smothers an elderly employer to death with a pillow, or carries out his iron-fisted rule of a union prison camp. his every word drips with menace, and his smile is like gazing up death itself. but the most interesting character just might be eli wallach's tuco. he's got a rap sheet a mile long, and he goes to great lengths to carry out his revenge on blondie, but he doesn't have the same aura of menace as angel eyes. he lies, cheats, steals, and sometimes kills, but not so much because he's evil as because he has no concept of morality. he's also funniest guy on the screen. in one scene he's all sweet talk, your best pal; not that he's believable for a second. the next minute he's launching a hilarious obscenity-laced rant against you and your family. tuco's reunion with his brother- a priest! - is one of the best comedy scenes in any western. there are other comedic touches as well, like the legless veteran who hangs around the saloons, walking on his arms, or the union commander bent on destroying the bridge he's tasked with protecting so that the fighting will end. it's also refreshing how few cliches there are. there's no extraneous love interest, no indian attacks or stampedes, and you never hear anyone shouting about ""gathering up a posse."" there is talking killer, but he's only a bit player, and tuco lectures him on why you shouldn't talk when you can shoot- after shooting him, of course between the acting, the action, the characters, the production values, and the originality, the good, the bad, and the ugly is an achievement to rival the best of john ford. any fan of westerns, and anyone who enjoys good film should watch this one. it is truly one of the great movies.";7 December 2014;10;['bad', 'ugly', 'little', 'sad', 'great', 'average', 'hard', 'familiar', 'mysterious', 'rough', 'heartless', 'hidden', 'civil', 'countless', 'own', 'sure', 'exceptional', 'unnecessary', 'many', 'long', 'high', 'successful', 'high', 'entire', 'buildup', 'final', 'violent', 'final', 'rich', 'aware', 'good', 'third', 'aware', 'true', 'long', 'unbroken', 'desolate', 'endless', 'easy', 'quirky', 'local', 'responsible', 'much', 'due', 'brilliant', 'favorite', 'good', 'tough', 'cool', 'mysterious', 'little', 'unique', 'personal', 'good', 'straightforward', 'embodiment', 'own', 'elderly', 'interesting', 'great', 'same', 'evil', 'sweet', 'good', 'believable', 'next', 'hilarious', 'good', 'western', 'other', 'comedic', 'few', 'extraneous', 'indian', 'bad', 'ugly', 'good', 'good', 'great'];0.1495996732026143

212;ragosaal;"i really couldn't understand most of the reviews here that place this film as a great western or even the best ever for some fans. in my opinion this is just a watchable and good western, but not much more than that. i think the only possible explanation would be that imdb reviewers consider ""spaghetti"" westerns a sub-genre within the western genre. if that is so, ""the good, the bad and the ugly"" would probably stand among the best (if not the best)in the ""spaghetti"" westerns ranking. but the point is that in my opinion there are no sub-genres within the western genre. so i analyze this film just for what it is: a western film. in such terms, this film has its moments, fine open-wide outdoor locations, good action gunfights (though hardly believable) and an acceptable plot. good acting too mainly in eli wallach's tuco. but what really demerits this movie is its incredibly unnecessary overrun; there's no way the story can stand almost 3 hours in duration and so the development is definitely slow. overruning has always been a characteristic of director sergio leone; he sort of engages madly with some sequences and he goes on and on and on at it (the final duel here is an example with all those unnecessary close shots in the men's faces and eyes). another clear sample of what i'm saying was the incredibly long -and even boring- opening sequence of ""once upon a time in the west"", where leone takes more than 10 minutes in the opening sequence where three gunmen are waiting for charles bronson at a train station. come on guys, let's face it.

215;higherall7;"this is an amazing film that has traveled through a remarkable journey. directed by sergio leone, i fondly remembered watching it during christmas, just before my fourteenth birthday. i saw it back then as essentially a western comic book set to opera music, featuring violent men posturing themselves as cool and macho while communicating with each other through a language of cruelty and sadism. the other reviewers are correct when they see this as a deconstruction of the myth of the west. you could say this film is the flip side of how the west was won (1962), and you would not be far from right. produced by alberto grimaldi, this movie offers an impressive array of production values and is the culmination of the man with no name chronicles. these stories began with a fist full of dollars (1964), followed by for a few dollars more (1965), and this piece of cinema rounds out the trilogy. these films appealed to my adolescent sensibilities at the time, when the best take i had on being a man involved appearing stony faced and talking tough while spewing profanities and smoking cigars. each one of the man with no name films seemed to me to be better than the last, with director leone learning and perfecting his craft as he went along. you could say it was like the craze over the musclemen movies and bodybuilding, a celebration of form over function and style over substance. but there is a curious substance to this italian romance with the aesthetics of john ford and akira kurosawa, dovetailing as it does with the cultural breakdown of america due to its own legacy of shortcomings. it is hard to put your finger on that precise point when being good and virtuous began to be associated with being weak and submissive; and innocence related to a kind of naivete' that told of the uninitiated who possessed no knowledge of the way things really work. but this is a pardigm shift that really did happen in my time. the man with no name was no hopalong cassady prancing his horse down the spilling, splashing waters cascading over stone steps. he was no clean cut, grinning exemplar of the male ethic with a song in his heart. no, he was a dirty, crude drifter with a three day growth for a beard and a lightning draw, who always kept his cards close to his vest. this strange hybrid of zen confrontations and closeups along with vista embracing long shots basted with the italian macho that so influenced noir ganster films, was a new creature of its own. gone were the fist fights of roy rodgers and gene autrey to settle affairs. clint eastwood would whip out his colt to shoot first and ask no questions later. as the man with no name, he was the apex of a triangle of mercenaries who were in it for the gold and possessed no qualms about getting rid of the competition. lee van cleef is spellbinding as sentenza aka 'angel eyes', the hit man with the heart of a black hole, and eli wallach proves to be the true emotional heart of the tale as tuco benedicto pacifico juan maria ramirez, a raging, effusive, impulsive bandit guilty of many crimes. you could call this film a glorification of the criminal element. what with its confidence man always holding something in reserve, along with its marauding bandit and its contract killer always on the lookout for the next greedy opportunity. but that would be taking this epic far too seriously and might cause you to miss out on all the fun. this is the american western looked at through the european perspective with loving regard. oddly enough, its greatness is to found in what is lost in the translation as it is re-imagined by leone and composer ennio morricone in terms of putting the accent on 'opera', as in horse opera. in some respects, it is an examination of how the western can be made to reflect the european experience rather than the other way around. there is a torture scene in this movie that seems to presage the aestheticizing of violence later to be found in gibson's the passion of the christ (2004). nor is there any getting around the fact that this last entry in the man with no name trilogy is about the triumph of greed over death. indeed, the runway horse-drawn hospital ambulance racing through the desert without a driver, and filled with several dead confederate soldiers, made me recall the painting by pieter brueghel (c. 1520-69) entitled the triumph of death. these are heady waters to plunge into with three characters who represent anything but the father, the son and the holy ghost. but the meticulously choreographed gunfights set to stirring and haunting music and witty musical phrases, along with tuco's frenzied dance through the cemetery for the ecstasy of gold, lead to such a cool mexican standoff that we chuckle away from the thought that the man with no name might just be death himself.";7 May 2021;8;['amazing', 'remarkable', 'fourteenth', 'western', 'comic', 'violent', 'cool', 'macho', 'other', 'other', 'correct', 'flip', 'impressive', 'full', 'few', 'more', 'adolescent', 'good', 'faced', 'tough', 'well', 'last', 'curious', 'italian', 'cultural', 'own', 'hard', 'precise', 'good', 'virtuous', 'weak', 'submissive', 'uninitiated', 'clean', 'exemplar', 'male', 'dirty', 'crude', 'strange', 'zen', 'long', 'italian', 'new', 'own', 'sentenza', 'black', 'true', 'emotional', 'effusive', 'impulsive', 'guilty', 'many', 'criminal', 'next', 'greedy', 'epic', 'american', 'european', 'western', 'european', 'other', 'last', 'several', 'dead', 'confederate', 'heady', 'holy', 'witty', 'musical', 'frenzied', 'cool', 'mexican'];0.0770347707847707

221;basrutten;i must admit that i had some doubts prior to seeing this movie, considering its length and some people's comments that it is slow as molasses. well, they were mostly right about that. gb & u is indeed a movie that does not always move very fast, and it does take a little getting used to. yet if you manage to look past the slowness, this is easily one of the best movies ever made. this is one of those movies where nearly everything comes together in exactly the right way. first of all, there is a wonderful cast of characters. clint eastwood is at his best as the 'good' (even though he's not strictly a good guy but more a bad guy with an honor code), lee van cleef is so truly evil that you'll long for his downfall with a passion, and eli wallach steals the show as the 'ugly', turning him into a character that you'll root for even though he's quite clearly the least trustworthy character you'll ever meet. these wonderful characters engage in a quite complex plot full of twists and turns, as they are constantly trying to outwit and outshoot each other. there's quite a lot going on and in spite of the fact that the tone of the movie is actually fairly light (there is some truly good humor), it's actually a fairly good exploration of human nature and the lengths to which people will go to achieve their goals. and then, there's the music of course. ennio morricone has always composed some very distinct and recognizable tunes, which unfortunately were not always that great by themselves. the music here, however, is absolutely one of the most memorable scores ever. of course, the cinematography is wonderful as well. the production values here seem to be a lot higher than in some previous leone movies, and gb & u contains plenty of memorable shootouts that will truly keep you on the edge of your seat. at the same time, the gunmen here seem not nearly as invincible as in some other leone movies, which greatly adds to the suspense. as i said before, nearly everything comes together in this movie. sure, it might be a bit slow, but it's got a great story of good versus evil, told in an impressive and truly epic way, with memorable characters and shootouts everywhere. highly recommended;25 December 2007;10;['slow', 'right', 'little', 'good', 'right', 'wonderful', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'bad', 'evil', 'ugly', 'least', 'trustworthy', 'wonderful', 'complex', 'full', 'other', 'light', 'good', 'good', 'human', 'distinct', 'recognizable', 'great', 'memorable', 'wonderful', 'high', 'previous', 'memorable', 'same', 'invincible', 'other', 'slow', 'great', 'impressive', 'epic', 'memorable'];0.2563128306878307
222;TheHande;in the good, the bad and the ugly sergio leone perfected his epic western. it's key is the trio of main characters who all bring something different to the table and all serve as integral ingredients to a film that might appear a mere adventure film on the surface, but which is both a comedy and character drama as well as a great war movie at the same time. clint eastwood's the man with no name, this time called blondie, continues somewhat on the more ruthless note he took on from the previous film (for a few dollars more). however, he's not a truly malicious character but more of jerk-friend who is also extremely observant and at the end of the day doesn't stab anyone in the back so hard that they wouldn't get up again. this creates his rather odd relationship with tuco. lee van cleef's angel eyes is the very embodiment of evil as far as characters go. he wipes anyone who's in his way, is entirely devoid of any morals and generally manages to create a menacing mood with his presence. this is a stark contrast to the character he played in the previous film and made all the more unsettling by the fact that his appearance is almost identical to this character from the previous film, right down to the pipe. eli wallach as tuco the rat is easily the most memorable character from the film. appearing at first filthy, amoral and without any redeeming qualities he is suddenly thrust into a wavering partnership and later, one could even say, a type of friendship with blondie. we find out that there is more to tuco than meets the eye though he never stops being the seemingly greedy scum that he is at the start, by the end of the film the viewer is even able to sympathise with him to a degree. what truly sets this film apart from other westerns and as well as the rest of the dollars trilogy is that even in its close-to-three-hour length, the film doesn't feel excessively long. the length is justified. you 'want' to spend the 170 minutes with the main cast of characters.;14 November 2009;10;['bad', 'ugly', 'epic', 'key', 'main', 'different', 'integral', 'mere', 'great', 'same', 'ruthless', 'previous', 'few', 'malicious', 'more', 'observant', 'odd', 'embodiment', 'devoid', 'menacing', 'stark', 'previous', 'unsettling', 'identical', 'previous', 'memorable', 'first', 'filthy', 'amoral', 'wavering', 'more', 'greedy', 'able', 'other', 'close', 'main'];-0.1114197530864197

224;antagonist117;"this is not just an epic western, it is high art. every shot seems to be precisely-framed, every table and tableware set positioned to the inch, the light glinting perfectly off every dusty, sweaty surface. in this way it is an achievement in staging and cinematography not unlike kubrick's ""barry lyndon."" the camera lingers on tuco, ""the ugly"" (eli wallach, channeling a young toshiro mifune in a manic, wild-eyed performance), as he shifts his gaze restlessly and drains a bottle of red liquor in front of a crucifix. it sounds too obvious written out, but it the moment and in the setting it is startling in its painterly beauty. sergio leone told wallach that he wanted every shot to look like a vermeer. mission accomplished. a few moments later tuco untruthfully explains his relationship with his brother before just as untruthfully claiming a side in the fratricidal american civil war. there's a precise and intentional balance and symbolism to these moments, and to the film as a whole, but they are so slyly integrated that the tricks can pass unnoticed. for example, two wounded union officers, both figures of sympathy, echo each other, but they also balance out two sadistic men in blue uniforms: the ""bad"" angel-eyes and his brutish enforcer. the script has such a wealth of one-liners that it tosses them off just for kicks. one of tuco's old enemies, who's missing his right arm, tells him ""i've had a lot of time to learn to shoot with my left."" in most action movies that line would be saved for the end, and would feature in the trailers and maybe on the posters. in this movie it's there almost to be made fun of, because it sets up tuco's retort, one of moviedom's greatest and most widely-applicable soundbytes: ""if you have to shoot, shoot, don't talk."" more on tuco, because he's really the star of the show. he and eastwood's nameless ""good"" guy trade wry observations about the ""two kinds of people in this world."" all people can be divided into two categories, they seem to believe. but tuco, as the title of the film reminds us, belongs to a third category. he and eastwood are neither friends nor enemies, and the film's knack for exquisite balance reappears when first one and then the other drags his partner through the parching desert. ennio morricone's score lifts certain scenes, especially the final act in the cemetery, to a dreamlike plane. that scene seems to exist in an eternal moment that builds and builds as tuco runs through the graves. then it slams on the brakes, only to start again from nothing and build and build, rhapsodically and seemingly unendingly, to another sudden breaking point. no final shootout in the annals of westerns, even the much-anticipated culmination of ""high noon,"" feels more momentous, and this is thanks in great part to the music of morricone. as good as the first two movies of leone's trilogy are, this is by far the richest and the most artful, and it continues to reward with each viewing.";19 June 2013;10;['epic', 'high', 'tableware', 'ugly', 'young', 'manic', 'wild', 'eyed', 'red', 'obvious', 'startling', 'painterly', 'few', 'fratricidal', 'american', 'civil', 'precise', 'intentional', 'unnoticed', 'other', 'sadistic', 'blue', 'bad', 'brutish', 'old', 'right', 'most', 'great', 'applicable', 'good', 'third', 'exquisite', 'other', 'certain', 'final', 'dreamlike', 'eternal', 'tuco', 'sudden', 'final', 'high', 'momentous', 'great', 'good', 'first', 'rich', 'artful'];0.13109375
225;PetarNeo;after watching first two movies in dollars trilogy it was pretty amazing to see the last one because it just swapped all the focus on itself. it shows you the three guys that have found themselves in war between blue guys and grey guys and how they proceed in their missions. after a short period of time you start to feel like movie just wraps everything around and like everything is connected and then it just shows you that they cross their paths multiple times. then scene where blondie is pushed over the limit by the ugly you are in shock as you can't believe it's happening but then it all just shifts around and suddenly one need the other to find all the buried money and then they are going on a mission in finding the gold. suddenly you realize it's going to be bad as they get to the graveyard and it's absolutely huge. then in all motion and looking for grave the bad comes to the door and gets them to listen him after finding gold isn't there he is forced to take a challenge by the good and it was so tense that you just start feeling anxious and just break little by little. shootout is happening and you are stunned just in the moment you realize what happened and everything is getting to it's place. the end is coming and just once again just don't believe the good is going to leave the ugly hanging there, then he comes out and shots the rope and leaves leaving you just amazed. movie was so intelligently written and characters are also very smart, building tension was huge in couple of scenes and it just gets you to the edge and also all connections and deception creates a perfect movie. 4/4;5 October 2016;10;['amazing', 'last', 'blue', 'short', 'multiple', 'ugly', 'other', 'bad', 'huge', 'bad', 'tense', 'anxious', 'little', 'little', 'ugly', 'amazed', 'smart', 'huge', 'perfect'];-0.0705026455026454

228;drunken_munki;"hello friends. i am a long time imdb user and in october 2020 it will have been for 15 years. after watching the mulan (2020) remake i sat here and i wrote my review in mild disgust. i then proceeded to evacuate my bowels for 45 minutes in a strange but calming grip of horror that maybe the mastery and art of cinema is completely dead. however, what comes to mind is the ojibwe saying from 'the sopranos', which is: ""sometimes i go about in pity for myself, and all the while, a great wind carries me across the sky."" i also realised that i haven't made many written reviews, even though i have watched and rated as of right now 2,781 titles. in any case, i had decided to celebrate 15 years of me using imdb by reviewing all the titles that i have rated a 10 out of 10 perfect score. a change of pace. a palette cleansing. there aren't many titles, mind, as i have noted here only 8 that fit the bill... out of 2,781. there are of course a whole bunch of good titles that i have given a 9/10, and i will probably list those later on. so here we go, the 8 titles that i gave 10/10 are as follows: the good, the bad and the ugly (1966), the sopranos (1999-2007), jaws (1975), the shield (2002-2008), seven samurai (1954), the shining (1980), dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb (1964), and finally the passion of the christ (2004). the good, the bad, and the ugly. this is an adventure, with crazy characters, good music, a backdrop of civil war, and most of all a treasure hunt. i love the character development in this title, each of the good, the bad, and the ugly have their own motivations, and mix in a whole load of grey area in between. i can't really explain it, but these three characters might be some of my favourites. i want to feel sorry for tuco, but he's a wild animal. i want to root for the man with no name, but he is so ambiguous. i feel as if segio leone knew what he was doing in this regard, a commentary on the psychology of man and in particular the time period of the frontier west. the attention to detail is ahead of it's time i feel, the longshots, and the rapid editing in the showdowns. this has been copied and copied time and again, but lerone did it first i feel. his camerawork and positioning are top notch. i love the backdrop, and i love the composition of music, scenery and atmosphere. this is masterful and well balanced. i'm almost certain he has encoded the 7 sins in this movie as well. story wise the three main characters intertwine several times and end up on the same goal of finding the gold coins. i can't understand how well this plays out and the slow burn to the final showdown is just pure genius. i love this movie, and will continue to watch it until i die. in any case, this is a perfect 10 out 10 film, certainly the best 'western' ever created.";12 September 2020;10;['long', 'mild', 'strange', 'calming', 'dead', 'ojibwe', 'great', 'many', 'perfect', 'many', 'whole', 'good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'bad', 'ugly', 'crazy', 'good', 'civil', 'most', 'bad', 'ugly', 'own', 'whole', 'sorry', 'wild', 'ambiguous', 'particular', 'rapid', 'top', 'notch', 'masterful', 'balanced', 'certain', 'wise', 'main', 'several', 'same', 'slow', 'final', 'pure', 'perfect', 'out', 'good', 'western'];0.1323037323037323
229;Hancock_the_Superb;"in new mexico territory circa 1862, a mysterious bounty-killer known as ""blondie"" (clint eastwood) and a shifty mexican bandit, tuco ramirez (eli wallach), run a con job wherein blondie turns tuco in for money and then rescues him, splitting the reward money. however, the two engage in numerous double-crossings against each other, until stumbling across a dying confederate soldier (antonio casale) who gives each man a clue to the location of a hidden cache of gold. tuco and blondie re-form their alliance to find the gold, only to find that angel eyes (lee van cleef), a ruthless hired gun, is already after the gold. the three men form a frequently-changing series of alliances to get at the gold, and they must avoid the union and confederate armies operating in the region. ""the good, the bad and the ugly"" is a landmark film in many respects. its cultural influence is nigh-impossible to overstate, with its iconic musical score by ennio morricone, three memorably amoral protagonists, the close-ups, vast landscapes, and the title itself, all of which are instantly recognizable icons of cinema, having been referenced and replicated time and again in movies, tv shows, and even commercials. it is sergio leone's first truly great film, a transition from the low-budget spaghetti westerns (""a fistful of dollars"", ""for a few dollars more"") to the big budget, artistic epics that leone would make for the rest of his career (""once upon a time in the west/america""). it is also a film of utmost importance to me; after watching this movie as an eleven year old, admiring its wonderfully quirky characters, style, music, and breath-taking cinematography, i realized for the first time that i wanted to devote my life to films, be it watching them, writing on them, or hopefully making them. ""the good, the bad and the ugly"" is a full-blown epic, and one with an interesting subtext. we see three completely amoral characters whose crimes - robbery, murder, and racketeering - are minor compared to the brutal carnage we see the civil war inflicting. taking place during the little-known sibley campaign in new mexico, the film is not a documentary depiction of the war, but an allegorical one. this was the first total war, and leone uses it as a metaphor for conflict in general, with faceless mass slaughter inflicted by rifles, machine guns, and artillery. blondie, tuco, and angel eyes' transgressions are minor compared to a brutal, auschwitz-like concentration camp, spies being executed in the streets, towns being shelled, and vicious, stalemated trench warfare over a ""flyspeck"" of a bridge. even our amoral heroes have amounts of humanity which set them apart from the machine-like slaughter around them; blondie saves tuco's life and comforts dying soldiers of both sides; tuco struggles with a mixture of affection and hatred for blondie, and his troubled relationship with his brother (luigi pistilli), and even angel eyes shows disgust at the carnage he sees. the movie is extremely episodic, the plot only secondary to the adventures of these characters. leone's wonderful direction gives the film a fairy-tale quality, with an appearance of realism while being fanciful and at times almost surreal. the movie contains extremely memorable set pieces: the lengthy opening, with three gunmen going after tuco; the ""carriage of the spirits""; the prison camp; a shootout in a town under shellfire; an epic civil war battle; tuco running excitedly through the cemetery; and, of course, the unforgettable climactic ""triello"". tonino delli colli's cinematography is simply breath-taking, with desert landscapes as impressive as david lean's films contrasting with the most extreme close-ups imaginable. carlo simi's set designs, from shelled-out towns to prison camps to the cemetery, is breath-taking. and ennio morricone's score is, for lack of a better word, one of the most amazing ever written, the instantly recognizable theme tune and other brilliant pieces creating the movie's indescribable atmosphere. the cast creates unforgettably iconic characters. clint eastwood is back as the man with no name, here much more human in this film despite retaining his cool, detached, shifty nature. lee van cleef, who had played a likable character in leone's previous film, now plays one of the most memorably evil characters ever. aldo giuffre, antonio casas, and luigi pistilli are effective in supporting roles, and leone's usual stock cast - mario brega, benito stefanelli, al muloch, aldo sambrell, and many others - create their own iconography. but it's eli wallach who steals the show, as the scenery chewing tuco, a shifty, double-crossing, foul-mouthed bandit who manages to be the most likable and human of the cast despite his faults; truly, one of the most memorable film characters ever. ""the good, the bad and the ugly"" is one of the most well-known and influential movies ever made, and with good reason. in terms of style, it is an absolute triumph, being one of the most amazingly made movies ever made. those only familiar with the movie for its cast, its score, or peripherally through its iconic stature, are missing out on one of the most breath-taking cinematic experiences ever. thank you, sergio leone. 9/10";10 July 2007;9;['mysterious', 'shifty', 'mexican', 'numerous', 'double', 'other', 'confederate', 'ruthless', 'bad', 'ugly', 'landmark', 'many', 'cultural', 'impossible', 'iconic', 'musical', 'amoral', 'close', 'vast', 'recognizable', 'first', 'great', 'low', 'few', 'big', 'artistic', 'utmost', 'old', 'quirky', 'first', 'bad', 'ugly', 'interesting', 'amoral', 'minor', 'brutal', 'civil', 'allegorical', 'first', 'total', 'general', 'minor', 'brutal', 'like', 'vicious', 'amoral', 'like', 'troubled', 'disgust', 'episodic', 'secondary', 'wonderful', 'fanciful', 'surreal', 'memorable', 'set', 'lengthy', 'epic', 'civil', 'unforgettable', 'climactic', 'delli', 'impressive', 'extreme', 'close', 'imaginable', 'set', 'well', 'amazing', 'recognizable', 'other', 'brilliant', 'indescribable', 'iconic', 'human', 'cool', 'shifty', 'likable', 'previous', 'evil', 'effective', 'usual', 'many', 'own', 'shifty', 'double', 'foul', 'mouthed', 'likable', 'human', 'memorable', 'bad', 'ugly', 'influential', 'good', 'absolute', 'familiar', 'iconic', 'cinematic'];0.0521739130434782

233;freaky_dave;the best movies are those movies which you can watch over again and enjoy even more than the first time. the good the bad the ugly is one of these films. when i first saw it i thought it was rather slow but still memorable. the second time i watched it it didn't feel slow at all, and i found myself more impressed with it. the movie revolves around three gunmen looking for a fortune of gold hidden in a cemetery during the civil war. clint eastwood plays blondie (the good)a guy who though not really good, has probably the most morals of the three and a sense of honor. eli wallach plays toco, (the ugly). he is a man looking out for himself and nobody else, but i never got the sense that he was totally evil. selfish and distrustful but not outright bad. that's probably why toco is the most beloved of the three. he also gives the best performance in the movie. then we have lee van cleef who stars as angel eyes (the bad). his character name is totally misleading because he is the most outright evil of all three. each of these characters knows a bit of information about the gold, and so they have to rely on each other to find the location. of course neither one is inclined to share. so this all leads to an ending which boasts one the best showdowns in any cowboy western. though the story is mainly about these three characters, director sergio leone never lets us forget about the horrors involved with war. even though these three men are hunting for treasure, the war surrounding them as they make their way is shown in good detail to remind us what it might have been like back in those times. it is definitely a great movie. on top of all this, sergio leone is an expert with the camera. he uses close up shots of character's facial features where we see every tick and expression, but he is also able to expand out and give us panoramic views of the land surrounding these people. the opening scenes were excellent, as were so many more that followed. great characters, great pacing, and incredible gun fights with sweeping views of the country make this western one of the best ever. and let's not forget the fantastic score which is one of the most memorable ever. sort of a signature for the entire movie.;4 December 2006;10;['good', 'more', 'first', 'good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'slow', 'memorable', 'second', 'slow', 'impressed', 'civil', 'good', 'most', 'ugly', 'evil', 'selfish', 'distrustful', 'bad', 'beloved', 'good', 'bad', 'misleading', 'outright', 'other', 'inclined', 'good', 'western', 'good', 'great', 'close', 'facial', 'able', 'panoramic', 'excellent', 'many', 'more', 'great', 'great', 'incredible', 'sweeping', 'western', 'good', 'fantastic', 'memorable', 'entire'];0.2453947368421053

248;MichaelMRamey;"the film that is not only considered the greatest western of all time, but many would argue it is one of the greatest films of all time. that is high praise, setting up even higher expectations going into a film for the first time. however i can honestly say that this movie lived up to the hype from the acting to the cinematography and everything in between. this should rightfully be discussed as one of the most important films ever to be made. the good, the bad and the ugly is a spaghetti western that made clint eastwood a household name. at the time of its release it was panned by critics for saying it was glorifying war and there was too much violence. at the time the ""spaghetti western"" was looked down upon by critics who grew up with the classic western style. the clean cut hero taking out the no good bad guy; in the case of this film there is a more realistic take on the time period. it is gritty, dirty and despite the name; none of the three main characters are inherently good. ironically blondie who is considered ""the good"" kills the most people on screen with angel eyes ""the bad"" killing the least amount. now it seems normal to have an anti-hero as the lead of your film, but back then it was new. like i said before, this film blew clint eastwood's career up to a new level, but for me it was someone else who stole the show. eli wallach as tuco is brilliantly done. the dynamic between him and blondie is entertaining as the ying to his yang. you're not suppose to root for the conniving one consider as ""the ugly"", but his performance make for a likeable character that falls somewhere in between the good and the bad with one of my favorite lines from him being ""if you're going to talk, talk. if you're going to shoot, shoot."" which comes with its own irony as tuco spends most of the time talking while blondie communicates with his facial expressions. the film is instantly recognizable from ennio morricone's opening score; making for a great introduction to the film, followed by phenomenal introductions of the titled characters with sergio leone's captivating direction. the score also plays a big role in the final standoff scene. the silence being overtaken by the music building to invoke tension as each man stands with their hand over their gun. it builds almost until we can't take it anymore, followed by the climax of blondie shooting angel eyes. there are no words uttered during the entirety of this scene, but still it is so engaging that i had to stop the film just out of curiosity of whether tuco aimed at blondie or angel eyes with his unloaded gun - he aimed at angel eyes. one aspect of the good, the bad and the ugly i was not expecting to see was the civil war. it came as a surprise and played a major theme in this film. it is funny to think now that when the film came out in 1966, critics said it was glorifying war, but i think the contrary. this is one of the few films i've seen where isn't glorified and they don't make either side look good. it shows that everyone is a victim of war, no matter if you're on the winning side or the losing side. i don't know if it was the writers' plan to make an anti-war film, but that is what it comes across as. i am glad i watched this film and i'll most likely sit down and watch it again eventually. this is a must-see film for anyone movie buffs out there or aspiring filmmakers. even if you're not a big fan of the genre, you'll get something out of it. although the title can be a bit deceiving because all three characters are outlaws, the argument can be made that blondie is indeed ""good"" as depicted in a few scene. he's a man who is looking to become rich, but wouldn't hurt or kill someone innocent to make it happen unlike angel eyes and tuco. the good, the bad and the ugly comes highly recommended.";31 October 2018;10;['great', 'many', 'great', 'high', 'high', 'first', 'important', 'bad', 'ugly', 'western', 'much', 'western', 'classic', 'western', 'good', 'bad', 'realistic', 'gritty', 'dirty', 'main', 'good', 'good', 'most', 'bad', 'least', 'normal', 'anti', 'new', 'new', 'entertaining', 'ugly', 'likeable', 'bad', 'favorite', 'own', 'most', 'facial', 'recognizable', 'great', 'phenomenal', 'big', 'final', 'engaging', 'unloaded', 'bad', 'ugly', 'civil', 'major', 'funny', 'few', 'good', 'anti', 'war', 'glad', 'big', 'deceiving', 'good', 'few', 'rich', 'innocent', 'bad', 'ugly'];0.1005597643097643

260;Lucabrasisleeps;"so i have seen my first classic western finally. this is a genre i tried my best to avoid. i am more into thrillers. but this one was special. the plot is interesting in itself. 3 men are determined to get to the cash box that was buried under the ground in a certain place(trying my best not to reveal the plot here!). the excitement is in watching the many twists unfold. the characters are known as blondie, tuco and angel eyes. the real names of the characters are not revealed here. we come to know a little more about tuco in the course of the movie. it could be said that tuco is the central character in this movie as he appears in most of the movie. the plot moves throughout america and they go in search of the cash box even to war torn areas. the story is set in the late 1800's during the civil war. so the movie also effectively works as an anti-war movie as well. the most impressive thing about this movie is the great music by the legend ennio morricone. this might be the best ever music i have ever heard in movies. maybe that's an exaggeration but surely this is one of the best. the music in the scene where tuco searches frantically for the cash box is filmed brilliantly and the music builds into a crescendo at the end of the scene. another aspect that impressed me is the beautiful cinematography in certain scenes of the movie. the long shots showing the beauty of the place are absolutely breathtaking. the war scenes are shot well and i was surprised to hear about the budget. with this budget i was surprised to see the advanced effects and the meticulous depiction of the war. i also came to understand a few things about a part of history i didn't know - the american civil war. the bridge destruction scene is also another one i totally loved. the closeups of the character's faces is also another feature that i liked specifically about the movie - especially when they are actors with such great screen presence such as clint eastwood and eli wallach. i have never thought of clint eastwood as particularly good looking or talented. but this movie proved me wrong. his performance as the calm bounty hunter with a sense of humour enhanced his image considerably in my eyes. his quiet sexiness is something i have never seen in other movies of his(maybe i am biased because i saw only his newer movies). lee van cleef is notable for his portrayal of the villain. eli wallach's portrayal of the crooked and funny tuco is imo one of the best characters in movies ever. his line ""when you want to shoot, shoot, don't talk"" has become one of my favourite quotes as well. finally this movie has encouraged me to seek out more ""sphagetti westerns"" and regular classic westerns as well. the movie is quite a classic and is highly recommended for all movie fans because it is more of an exciting adventure movie with beautiful camera-work than a western. 10/10";1 January 2009;8;['first', 'classic', 'good', 'more', 'special', 'interesting', 'determined', 'certain', 'good', 'many', 'real', 'little', 'more', 'central', 'most', 'late', 'civil', 'anti', 'war', 'impressive', 'great', 'good', 'ever', 'good', 'tuco', 'beautiful', 'certain', 'long', 'breathtaking', 'surprised', 'surprised', 'advanced', 'meticulous', 'few', 'american', 'civil', 'such', 'great', 'such', 'good', 'talented', 'wrong', 'calm', 'quiet', 'other', 'biased', 'new', 'notable', 'crooked', 'funny', 'imo', 'good', 'favourite', 'regular', 'classic', 'more', 'exciting', 'beautiful', 'western'];0.3233864096896012

(spoiler alert) so we got a drunken union commander leading the charge (and he even looks a little like grant but he never led any charges except to the bar at the appomattox holiday inn) back and forth, to and fro...cannon fire.. boom boom...drag the dead back...yawn! now blondie and tuco got to get to the other side of the river, but there's this battle raging on and on and on over this bridge so it's logical that our heroes have to blow up the bridge right? we don't know why but we want to see clint blow the hell out of something don't we?? me, i would have forded the river, which appears to be about waist deep, somewhere downstream of all the fighting but that wouldn't suit our purpose here. i fall out of my chair everytime i see our boys knock that poor wounded yankee off his stretcher so the can load it up with dynamite to haul it down to the river. so the boys wait for an intermission in the battle, wire the bridge while no one on either side is looking, blow said bridge, jump behind the sandbags for cover but one of our heroes-tuco, has his butt stuck up in the air just waiting for one of the rebels to shoot it off. more cannon fire..boom boom...now everybody is dead, except of course our two boys who miraculously survived. even tuco's ass survived all the shelling which took out everybody and everything in sight! now with everyone dead it's safe to walk across the river to get the gold. oh, did i forget to mention that? yeah, they're after $200,000 in gold and there's another character in hot pursuit but i'm getting to that. first clint/blondie finds a cannon that hasn't been fired yet pointing in the opposite direction of the battle which suits him just fine cause it's aimed towards tuco who is racing off to find the gold. now clint is so cool he never even so much as flinches when he lights the fuse with his cheroot...without a doubt the coolest scene in the film. the three finally converge at the location of the gold, there's some witty repartee' between our hero/villains, and then we all square off for a three way gunfight. tuco, blondie, and angel eyes.......eyes, guns, fingers, eyes, teeth, guns, twitching fingers, more eyes, jeez get on with it! i'm sorry people but this is not a serious western and i laugh my ass off everytime i see it. not only is this not the ""greatest"" of all time, hell it ain't even in the top 25 imho. i will give the director his due for a number of innovations that have been roundly lauded here, hell i even thought the confederate pep band at the prison camp was a cute idea-silly as it was. they really needed a tuba though and the woodwind section was sorely in need of beefing up, but other than that? this thing is at least an hour too long but as a satire of the western genre i can live with it. i can't however live with this ""best ever"" tag which is an insult to the genre and to the myth, which is a myth to begin with. 6/10 but only for making me laugh.";17 July 2002;6;['little', 'obvious', 'good', 'western', 'top', 'great', 'great', 'unique', 'quirky', 'powerful', 'first', 'last', 'dynamite', 'few', 'more', 'great', 'interesting', 'civil', 'nice', 'excruciating', 'serious', 'asleep', 'artistic', 'famous', 'drunken', 'little', 'appomattox', 'dead', 'other', 'logical', 'right', 'deep', 'poor', 'more', 'dead', 'dead', 'safe', 'hot', 'first', 'opposite', 'cool', 'cool', 'witty', 'more', 'sorry', 'serious', 'western', 'great', 'top', 'imho', 'due', 'confederate', 'cute', 'silly', 'other', 'least', 'western', 'good'];0.1855476190476189

272;TankGuy;"if ever there was a movie that needed no explanation plot wise, it is the good, the bad and the ugly. even if you're not a fan of westerns, you'll at least have a vague idea as to what it's about. however for those of you who are unsure, it's about greed, war and er, two kinds of people. in 1966, sergio leone followed up the unparalleled awesomeness of a fistful of dollars and for a few dollars more with this gritty tale of the battle-of-wits between three outlaws whose fight for survival is driven not by instinct, but by greed. a somewhat politicised story of greed, there is more to the premise of tgtbtu than brazen immorality. in the powder keg decade that was the 1960s, the anti-war film was becoming increasingly popular thanks to images of u.s troops in vietnam being projected into households worldwide. many fans of tgtbtu will even ignore it's anti-war subtext, sadly dismissing the movie as nothing more than a cool cowboy flick. our three main characters are ""temporarily"" sobered by the effects of war, but choose to remain ignorant to it's horrors. leone isn't only interested in the physical effects of combat, he doesn't hold back from showing it's crippling emotional strain. take the character of the unnamed union captain, who has begun a slow descent into madness and severe alcoholism due to ridiculous military logic. i also found the sight of the thousands of soldiers charging into battle in the film's second half rather haunting, these men aren't going to fight, they're going to be slaughtered. we are transported to a post-apocalyptic world by visuals of towns ravaged by cannon fire and bodies littering a barren landscape. tongue-in-cheek cynicism is the order of the day and the hanging scenes allocate pinches of dark comedy, after all the movie is a satire. there are great performances all round but the three leads are just excellent. clint eastwood's blondie is great but it is eli wallach's tuco who steals the show. his foul mouthed tantrums are nothing short of humorous and the odds are stacked so ironically against him throughout the film. he also carries one of the coolest pistols ever to feature in a western and the gun store scene is just sublime. the last five minutes of the movie in which he is nearly hanged will always raise a hearty chuckle too. the legend that is lee van cleef played the sadistic angel eyes brilliantly, a far cry from the valiant colonel mortimer of fafdm. although, van cleef gets considerably less screen time than eastwood and wallach and he is really the most villainous of the three. of course no sergio leone film would be complete without the presence of a poetic morricone score. you would need to have been living underground all your life not to have heard the iconic title score at least once. thrillingly roaring over the gorgeous title sequence along with thunderous bursts of rifle and mortar fire, the score denotes the epic that is tgtbtu. ""story of a soldier"" is chillingly sincere, evoking the film's anti-war theme and ""the trio"" commences the climatic showdown, giving the sequence a pinch of gothic. ""ecstasy of gold"" is a truly majestic composition and will forever be one of my favourites. as with the previous two movies, the masterful editing techniques generate the tension brilliantly. here it isn't the action itself that matters, rather the heavy build-ups of disquieting tension prior to the sharp explosions of gunfire. the film climaxes with the amazingly operatic triello(three way showdown)in which leone relishes those continuous tight close-ups. spectacularly taut, i still have to force myself to watch even on a fourth viewing. heralding a new style of suspense, leone creates a superbly baroque feel and the movie's violence as a whole is so aestheticized that it becomes lyrical. he spent afod and fafdm practising the craft of tension and by this movie he had become a master of that craft, although the triello is such a phenomenon in itself that the entire sequence could be a short film on it's own. tgtbtu features impressive stunt-work and special effects(the controversial destruction of the bridge was fantastic!)and the aforementioned battle scene and subsequent bombardment were both extremely tense. the movie is set during the new mexico campaign of 1862 and maintains authenticity by making reference to prominent historical figures such as abraham lincoln, general sibley, lee, grant and colonel edward canby. it is also a prequel to afod and fafdm as they are set several years after the civil war. nobody will disagree that sergio leone revolutionised the western genre and this movie itself will forever be a pioneering force. arguably the best film of the three, the dollars trilogy goes out with a thunderous bang and an effect that no modern director can ever dream of achieving. 10/10";28 August 2015;10;['bad', 'ugly', 'least', 'vague', 'unsure', 'unparalleled', 'few', 'more', 'gritty', 'politicised', 'more', 'brazen', 'anti', 'war', 'popular', 'many', 'anti', 'war', 'more', 'cool', 'main', 'ignorant', 'interested', 'physical', 'crippling', 'emotional', 'unnamed', 'slow', 'severe', 'ridiculous', 'military', 'second', 'post', 'apocalyptic', 'barren', 'dark', 'great', 'excellent', 'great', 'foul', 'mouthed', 'short', 'humorous', 'cool', 'western', 'sublime', 'last', 'hearty', 'sadistic', 'far', 'less', 'villainous', 'complete', 'poetic', 'morricone', 'iconic', 'least', 'gorgeous', 'thunderous', 'tgtbtu', 'sincere', 'anti', 'war', 'climatic', 'majestic', 'previous', 'masterful', 'heavy', 'sharp', 'operatic', 'continuous', 'tight', 'close', 'fourth', 'new', 'baroque', 'lyrical', 'afod', 'entire', 'short', 'own', 'impressive', 'special', 'controversial', 'aforementioned', 'subsequent', 'tense', 'prominent', 'historical', 'such', 'general', 'prequel', 'several', 'civil', 'western', 'pioneering', 'good', 'thunderous', 'modern'];0.1546164218295365

276;raphaklopper;"leone after the underrated failure that was ""the colossus of rhodes"", leone decided to put his career in order doing the remake of the japanese classic ""yojimbo"" turning it into a american-western filmed in europe. ""a fistful of dollars"" not only launched his career, but started a new era of western films. and then came the superb sequel that was ""for a few dollars more"". and as if that was not enough, leone made the 3rd chapter of the story of the man with no name. and not only surpassed its predecessors but ended up being (maybe) the best westerns ever made. ""the good, the bad and the ugly"" starts when tuco (eli wallach), an mexican outlaw, finds in the desert a confederate convoy with all soldiers killed inside a wagon. but one of the soldiers was alive and tells tuco about a certain treasure he hid in a coffin in a cemetery. tuco goes to fetch water on his horse, to give to the soldier so that he could speak better, but when he is back the soldier died, and the only one who heard the name of the coffin was blondie (clint eastwood) tuco's former business partner which was being tortured by tuco crossing the desert without drinking water because blondie had betrayed him. blondie knows the name of the coffin but it doesn't know the location of the cemetery, which tuco does. now both bastards have to work together to find and maybe split the treasure. but the mission becomes difficult when both meet angel eyes (lee van cleef) a lieutenant of the union army that knew longer about the treasure but it didn't know the name of the coffin. now the three men who hate each other will have to join and across an america at war to find the mysterious treasure. and why this movie is (in my opinion) the best western ever made? again, it was the fault of leone and the exuberant cast. what leone made in this film, was bring was what was excellent in the first two films and put it all together in this masterpiece. from the 1st movie is the superb narrative that flows in history always perfectly highlighting their characters in the story with chilling and (believe it or not) reflective dialogs. and of course, leone also destroys (in a good way) in his amazing direction. giving not only spectacular and epic duels (which here contains the best ones of the trilogy), but also with breathtaking italian landscapes serving as the old west. thanks to the success of the previous films leone manages to give the film a huge magnitude, with gigantic landscapes and moments with beautiful scenery. not only landscapes but presents us with one of the greatest cinematic battles, the battle of langston bridge. but as i mentioned before, leone uses his genius in both script and direction, giving reflective moments to the story. not only humanizes his characters, but gives the film a huge critic to america using a western cliche. this cliche is the civil war, if you look at most western movies (especially john wayne's ones) they always had as stage the civil war. and through it leone makes his criticism. it comes in moments like when blondie and tuco met angel eyes, they had been imprisoned by union soldiers. in this open-air prison, the confederates soldiers are forced to play and sing songs against their will, while the guards torture other prisoners. clearly a metaphor comparing the union soldiers to the nazis, but this is based on facts. in many prison camps during the war, there was heavy torture and even rumors of cannibalism. and even a time when tuco unwittingly confuses union soldiers to confederates ones, because they were covered in dust. another metaphor trying to say that no matter what side you are, everyone is equal. in performances the movie definitely surpasses its predecessors: clint eastwood once again the badass as he ever was in the trilogy. in this film we can see more of his human side and clear, despite his schemes and greed, it has clearly a ""good"" side; eli wallach excellent. maybe his performance certainly reach the performance of eastwood, as this character that even with ""ugly"" attitudes have a pure side; lee van cleef again superb now as the villain. but maybe he's the only ""bad"" thing in the movie. not his performance, but his character doesn't has moments of exploration that tuco and blondie had, but leone does an excellent job showing why he is the devil in the movie. in conclusion, leone did absolutely in his masterpiece the best western ever made. thanks to an ambitious narrative that not only gives unforgettable characters but makes a big social criticism. thanks to a huge and beautiful direction with incredible views that captures tense and epic moments; thanks to a creepy and classic soundtrack by ennio morricone; thanks to superb performances; thanks to sergio leone with his genius that brought us a masterpiece trilogy that redefined the western forever, concluding it here perfectly making it legendary. 10/10";6 October 2013;10;['underrated', 'japanese', 'classic', 'american', 'new', 'western', 'few', 'enough', 'good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'mexican', 'confederate', 'alive', 'certain', 'only', 'former', 'difficult', 'other', 'mysterious', 'good', 'western', 'exuberant', 'excellent', 'first', 'superb', 'chilling', 'reflective', 'good', 'amazing', 'spectacular', 'epic', 'good', 'italian', 'old', 'previous', 'huge', 'gigantic', 'beautiful', 'great', 'cinematic', 'reflective', 'huge', 'western', 'civil', 'most', 'western', 'civil', 'open', 'other', 'many', 'heavy', 'equal', 'more', 'human', 'clear', 'good', 'excellent', 'ugly', 'pure', 'only', 'bad', 'excellent', 'good', 'western', 'ambitious', 'unforgettable', 'big', 'social', 'huge', 'beautiful', 'incredible', 'tense', 'epic', 'creepy', 'classic', 'western', 'legendary'];0.1948112919943905

279;joshuafagan-64214;"there is a reason that this movie has inspired so many parodies over the years. there is a reason it is the first thing that comes to people's minds when they think of westerns. there a reason that its theme is instantly recognizable. it is the best western movie ever made, plain and simple. every angle is perfect. every line contributes something. every event both captures your imagination and sets up what is to come. it does not involve me as much as skyfall does, but it is just so inhumanly great without sacrificing its very human grit and style. even people who are not film critics or analysts of any kind or even frequenters of high art can look at this movie and say, ""that's a really good film."" of course, this movie is not watched by as many people as it should be. i'm willing to bet that for every twenty people who have heard of this film, maybe one or two have actually seen it. again, i get it. if you're not a major film buff or film buff wannabe or die-hard lover of westerns, it is hard to convince yourself to take a full three hours out of your busy schedule to watch a slower paced film that was made fifty years ago. but if you ever have a chance, check it out. there is everything to be said about this movie. about how it subverted many traditional western tropes while laying the groundwork for far more. about how it catapulted clint eastwood into stardom, stardom that he has fostered and still basks in fifty years later. about how it took what worked in the first two sergio leone westerns and made some additions of its own. and so much else that i could likely think of if only i rewatched it. from what i remember, it is so dense despite being so sprawling. there is also nothing to be said about this movie. it is like the american west itself (ignore for a moment the fact that this film was shot in spain by a team of italians). i've been fortunate enough to explore the west myself, and let me tell you, no words can capture the open freedom that you feel out there. this movie is something similar. just like any journey, everyone will have a separate experience. but like any journey to a beautiful place, it will be worth it. there is something about the movie that makes you wish, at least for a second, that you could be in that world. not the old west, though that would be interesting. no, i'm talking about this film's version of the old west. there is pain and danger and adventure and action and risk; but also those long pauses that allows everything to sink in. combine that with the fact that they are going off of a real place, and you can both see yourself there and legitimately want to go. the main, is, of course, played by clint eastwood. he is subdued but fierce and sly. whether or not you consider the 'dollars films' a trilogy- i don't- there is no doubt that his character here could easily be the same man from the other movies. this doesn't mean he hasn't changed; he is more visibly weary here, something that both helps this film stand out from and tie together to the other two films. but of course, he is only 'the good.' the other two, lee van cleef's 'angel eyes' and eli wallach's tuco... ramirez, make up 'the bad' and 'the ugly,' respectively. the three of them are searching for some hidden confederate gold, and yes, it is an epic quest that takes them across the west. this is one of those movies where it's less about what sets the story in motion and more what it does when it's there. so much happens. it builds up and up, so high up that if the climax isn't spectacular, you would be disappointed and let down. but of course, that's fantastic as well. i'm not going to spoil what happens (though i don't think i'd be hurting anyone if i did; this film came out over fifty years ago) but i will say that you are in for a treat. on the surface, it's simple, if cleaver and well-written and smart. but the way they shoot it and direct it and score it and act it gives it so much depth and atmosphere. ennio morricone has composed many, many great pieces in this film alone, a few of which even people who have never seen this movie would recognize, so often are they repeated and parodied. but for my fist full of dollars (couldn't resist), none tops the piece that plays hear, simply called 'the trio.' this scene is famous for what people who went to film school might call 'super tight shots.' the camera zooms in right on the character's eyes. this, like any artistic technique, can be used masterfully or horribly, depending on the production (check out the dutch angles on battlefield earth; i shudder every time i see clips of it.) for this film, of course, it is the former. it is the crowning cherry on the top of three hours of conscious, radiant camera-work. in fact, now that i think about it, this scene perfectly captures the essence of the movie. the drama, the emotion, the art, the pure statement of excellence: it's all there. catch the clip and see what the film's about. just don't forget to watch the rest of the flick too.";11 December 2015;10;['many', 'first', 'recognizable', 'good', 'western', 'plain', 'simple', 'perfect', 'great', 'human', 'high', 'good', 'many', 'willing', 'major', 'hard', 'hard', 'full', 'busy', 'many', 'traditional', 'western', 'more', 'first', 'own', 'dense', 'sprawling', 'fortunate', 'open', 'similar', 'separate', 'beautiful', 'worth', 'least', 'old', 'interesting', 'old', 'long', 'real', 'main', 'fierce', 'same', 'other', 'weary', 'other', 'other', 'bad', 'ugly', 'epic', 'less', 'much', 'spectacular', 'fantastic', 'simple', 'smart', 'much', 'many', 'many', 'great', 'few', 'full', 'famous', 'super', 'tight', 'artistic', 'dutch', 'battlefield', 'former', 'conscious', 'radiant', 'pure'];0.1908313492063492
280;hackraytex;i read the first review here and it pretty much summed it all up. i saw the fully restored version a few years ago and have the dvd. the additional 14 minutes ties everything together and put the entire story in context. the restored version show something entirely missing in the earlier version. as noted, blondie remarks that he had never seen so many men wasted for so little. the deleted scene where angel eyes comes to the confederate infirmary, there is a brief spark of compassion in his face and eyes for all of the men lying there wounded and suffering. when tuco is told by father ramirez that their father had just died and the father had asked for tuco but father ramirez showed no compassion for tuco for his absence. tuco hits his brother and walks away feeling that father ramirez had not judged him fairly. the deleted scenes give a very accurate portrayal of the totally brutality of the civil war. one of my ancestors was drafted into the war and was wounded and captured. he was released in an exchange and fought at gettysburg at little round top. he got sick and was left behind and captured again. he signed the pledge to go home and stay home which he did. the bitterness and desire for revenge went on for a hundred years since almost everyone had lost someone had lost someone or knew someone who had lost someone. a brutal experience that i hope is never repeated.;4 August 2020;10;['first', 'few', 'additional', 'entire', 'early', 'many', 'little', 'deleted', 'confederate', 'brief', 'accurate', 'totally', 'civil', 'little', 'round', 'sick', 'brutal'];-0.0857142857142857
281;commandercool88;il buono! il brutto! il cattivo! indeed, there isn't a lot of bad to be talked about. and ugly certainly isn't the word. but good, now you're on to something. if there was any doubt that a western could be regarded as a truly great film, 'the good, the bad, and the ugly' solves that problem. and though it is without question one of the greatest westerns ever made, sergio leone's masterpiece is also one of the greatest crime dramas to be told. an epic rendering where the landscapes and score play as much of a role as do the actors, this spaghetti western is still today a suspenseful and glorious work of extreme art. a haunting story about three men brought together in unlikely ways in their search for a dead man's golden treasure, there's a brutal and gritty feel about the film as it drops us in the middle of a barren and dry landscape. raw, but also indescribably beautiful. sergio leone paints his canvas both with grand shots that appreciate the vastness of nature, and devastating close-ups for a first-hand point of view. leone simultaneously puts both styles to practice, and with electrifying results. yes it's long, but there's a passion within this story that deserves to be told. and like all great filmmakers, leone doesn't simply tell us. he shows us. long before his oscar-winning days, clint eastwood ('the good') reminded us what a simple facial expression can do. with leone's personal close-ups that allow us to see every bit of his sun-blistered face, eastwood skillfully leads 'the good, the bad, and the ugly' with that piercing gaze that's both menacing and pure. eli wallach's ('the ugly') performance is just as good, if not better. bringing a fierce two-headedness to his character, you're never quite sure what direction he's going to run with. it ups the suspense, adds to the fascination. the characters here aren't merely cardboard cut-outs, but complex and unpredictable people with different motives and different intentions. and when they're all together, expect fireworks. but above the actors, more powerful than the scenery, there is one who reigns supreme. ennio morricone's haunting score is one of the single-most recognizable products in cinematic history, and it gives 'the good, the bad, and the ugly' a bite that would be sorely missing otherwise. absolutely brilliant, it makes leone's picture an unforgettable experience that captivates us, 3-hour running time and all. a sprawling civil war era epic that takes its ideas about money and greed and power and betrayal and friendship and intertwines them all together in a cool, collected piece of work. an improbable masterpiece of sorts, but a profoundly rich one that deserves to be seen in all its intended beauty. more reviews at rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public;17 July 2008;10;['bad', 'good', 'great', 'bad', 'ugly', 'great', 'great', 'epic', 'much', 'western', 'suspenseful', 'glorious', 'extreme', 'unlikely', 'dead', 'golden', 'brutal', 'gritty', 'barren', 'dry', 'raw', 'beautiful', 'grand', 'devastating', 'close', 'first', 'electrifying', 'long', 'great', 'simple', 'facial', 'personal', 'close', 'bad', 'ugly', 'menacing', 'pure', 'ugly', 'good', 'well', 'fierce', 'sure', 'complex', 'unpredictable', 'different', 'different', 'powerful', 'single', 'recognizable', 'cinematic', 'bad', 'ugly', 'brilliant', 'unforgettable', 'civil', 'cool', 'improbable', 'rich', 'more'];0.0123215220153995

284;TheNabOwnzz;as sergio leone was cementing himself as a great director after the excellent yojimbo remake 'fistful of dollars' and the incredible 'for a few dollars more', with 'the good, the bad and the ugly' he has managed to reach his quality climax. with a lot of close ups, gorgeous landscape cinematography & stylish drawn out tenseful gunfights all of leone's trademarks are clearly visible. yet why is the good, the bad and the ugly even better than his other masterpieces? the three main characters are ofcourse the stars of this show, with each putting in an exceptional performance, especially eli wallach as the eccentric bandit tuco. clint eastwood & lee van cleef's natural acting talent show that there is no need for useless dialogue to insult the viewers intelligence, facial acting is an even more impressive kind of acting, and with van cleef and eastwood, they had the two best in the business. the little dialogue also gives the viewer a chance to listen to the absolutely incredible musical orchestrations by ennio morricone, which is always in a natural kind of harmony to leone's direction skills, resulting in absolutely graceful scenes that delight the eyes. the dialogue that is there always seems to further the story or enhance character development ( specifically in tuco's case ), and not insult the viewers intelligence. it even includes a parody on one of the most common hollywood cliches when tuco says: 'when you have to shoot, shoot. don't talk!'. unlike leone's previous films the good, the bad and the ugly is set during the american civil war between the union and confederacy, and a lot of small subplots feature this war. leone shows a sarcastic view on the purposelessness of the civil war in this film by putting the three main characters in its midst while maintaining its own personal story about greed. the alcoholic union captain shows this perfectly, with his fed up view about the brutality and the senseless deaths of the civil war, or angel eyes's trip through a confederate hospital showing all the wounded as morricone's dramatic music plays. as for morals, we see the nametags of the title of the movie added to the three characters, yet don't really see all three of them as more than common thugs at the start of the movie. however, the civil war changes this, showing blondie a man of compassion when faced with a dying soldier, to whom he shares his cigar. a little gesture of great moral worth. also showing angel eyes's indifference with his stolen identity as a fake union sergeant only to further his own personal greedy agenda. tuco is shown after the meeting with his brother to be forced into the way he is now, and even though he is a vulgar, dirty, ugly ( no pun intended ) character leone manages to make him likeable when he is influenced by greed. thus one of the greatest decisions leone made was having the setting during the civil war, as its part in this story further enhances character development and brings up questions about the senselessness of it all. the blowing up of the bridge could be seen as the greatest ironic statement of leone against war. yet the primary story still consists of finding gold in a certain cemetery, as a personal study of greed. this concept alone might not seem so spectacular, but ennio morricone's haunting score, the beautiful desert landscape cinematography, stylish gunfights and the brilliant acting results in an incredible primary story aswell. it is one of the films with some of the greatest final 15-20 minutes ever put to screen, resulting in a large payoff deserving of such a quality film. in the end we truly begin to understand why the tags 'good', 'bad' and 'ugly' are stated in the beginning of the film, as all of the characters have evolved to their respective states during the affairs in the civil war. this is excluding angel eyes, who is shown to be evil, dressed in black, from the start, but that makes sense since leone wanted to show the differences between the three characters in a morality contest during the film, and as blondie and tuco changed, angel eyes had to be different from them. all of this cements the good, the bad and the ugly as one of the greatest films ever made, and the greatest western ever made, since it tackles so many different kind of themes. it is one of the greatest pieces of entertainment, yet also tackling morality problems and making anti-war statements.;3 May 2018;10;['great', 'excellent', 'fistful', 'incredible', 'few', 'more', 'bad', 'ugly', 'close', 'gorgeous', 'tenseful', 'visible', 'bad', 'ugly', 'well', 'other', 'main', 'ofcourse', 'exceptional', 'eccentric', 'natural', 'useless', 'facial', 'impressive', 'good', 'little', 'incredible', 'musical', 'natural', 'graceful', 'common', 'previous', 'bad', 'ugly', 'american', 'civil', 'small', 'sarcastic', 'civil', 'main', 'own', 'personal', 'civil', 'confederate', 'dramatic', 'more', 'common', 'civil', 'little', 'great', 'moral', 'fake', 'own', 'personal', 'greedy', 'vulgar', 'dirty', 'ugly', 'likeable', 'great', 'civil', 'great', 'ironic', 'primary', 'certain', 'personal', 'spectacular', 'beautiful', 'stylish', 'brilliant', 'incredible', 'primary', 'great', 'final', 'large', 'good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'respective', 'civil', 'evil', 'black', 'different', 'bad', 'ugly', 'great', 'great', 'western', 'many', 'different', 'great', 'anti', 'war'];0.1088253968253968

josie wales."" if not for the success of tgtbtu, those films might not exist. </li></ul> <ul><li>the best soundtrack in the history of westerns.....the signature laughing hyena, the eerie whistling, the soaring mariachi trumpets, and most importantly, the twangy guitar solo and macho male chorus constantly driving the plot forward. other than the theme from ""the magnificent seven"", this is only western soundtrack to become a part of the general popular culture. hugo montenegro's cover version reached number two on the billboard charts in 1968. </li></ul> <ul><li>i call leone's counterpoint between the long, flowing episodes of deep sentimentality and short bursts of graphic violence ""john ford on steroids"". coppola would copy this technique several years later in an even more gruesome scene in ""the godfather"". </li></ul> <ul><li>fantastic 10 minute opening sequence with no dialog, a homage to ""rio bravo"" and ""comanche station"". this is bookended at the film's climax by another spellbinding five minutes with no dialog. </li></ul> <ul><li>i admire leone's bold decision not to sandwich in a gratuitous female romantic interest. last ""all guy"" western until ""brokeback mountain"" (just kidding). </li></ul> <ul><li>this may be the first ""vietnam"" western. this is impressive, since in 1965 when the story was conceived and written, opposition to the war was not yet fashionable. </li></ul> <ul><li>this was a watershed film for westerns in terms of realism. it wasn't the first one to completely break with production code restraints, but it was the first popular and successful western to do so. there would be no going back to the world where justice always prevails in the end, everyone's wardrobe is perfectly pressed, bullet wounds are bloodless and there are no gratuitous graphic rapes. </li></ul> <ul><li>brilliant casting of lee van cleef, a minor actor in many westerns from the golden age of the '50's, including ""high noon"", ""the bravados"", ""the gunfight at the o.k. corral"" and ""ride lonesome"". his presence is one of many leone homages in the movie to classic westerns (including a number of references to 1948's ""yellow sky""). the presentation of van cleef's facial features as sculpture reminds me of boetticher's use of randolph scott in the ranown cycle of films. </li></ul> <ul><li>the best use of the civil war ever in a western. the only competitors i'm aware of are ""dances with wolves"", ""major dundee"" and ""escape from fort bravo"". </li></ul> <ul><li>it's impressive that the portrayal of the civil war battle is realistically based on the battle of glorieta pass, which took place in new mexico in 1862. it is often falsely thought that this movie is set in texas, where there were no major civil war battles. this misinformation, spread by leone himself apparently, has deceived some critics into thinking the basic setting of the movie is implausible. </li></ul> <ul><li>finally, of the five leone westerns, this is the perfect blend of leone's distinctive style with a clever, fast moving and entertaining plot. the other four movies are all fine films, but the first two ""dollar"" movies were very low budget and leone's style was still evolving. meanwhile, in ""duck, you sucker"" and ""once upon a time in the west"", leone disconnected himself from the needs of his commercial audience. leone was quoted by his biographer, richard frayling, as saying that he made outitw ""for cineastes only"". tgtbtu is satisfying for both scholars and popular audiences. </li></ul> the bad and the ugly: <ul><li>i don't have much negative to say about this film. i've read critics who feel it is too long, that the story's not interesting enough, that the tuco character is irritating. that wallach's acting is hammy and that the premise of three criminals riding around loose during the civil war is implausible. i don't think any of these arguments hold water. when it was released in the u.s. in 1968, it was roundly panned for its excessive violence. these complaints seem laughably quaint today in light of the orgy of graphic cinematic gore and sadism that has engulfed filmdom since the late '60's.</li></ul>";19 October 2010;10;['classic', 'familiar', 'confederate', 'civil', 'excellent', 'audio', 'definitive', 'fourth', 'great', 'equal', 'amoral', 'paisan', 'comic', 'only', 'little',

293;andrewmerritt-31652;the good the bad, and the ugly is a spaghetti western film starring clint eastwood, eli wallach, and lee van cleef. the film is directed by sergio leone and is the conclusion to the dollars trilogy, which also starred clint eastwood. the film centers on three outlaws who are on the hunt to find a fortune in gold buried in a cemetery. to kick-start this review off i will mention that this is the final chapter in the dollars trilogy. the dollars trilogy are three spaghetti films starring clint eastwood as the man with no name. and these three movies are major influences that have inspired countless western films to come. but unlike the first two films, i think i speak for everyone in saying that this is the film that brings a breath of fresh air to the western genre. even though the movie is called the good the bad, and the ugly, the movie does display its good, bad, and ugly side to things. i don't know if it was sergio leone's intention to go all out in the final chapter and have this be his magnum opus, but he needs to work on the run time. this movie is three hours and in those three hours the movie felt like it was all over the place as we focus on these three outlaws hunting for buried treasure, but then it jumps to the american civil war. there just needed to be some common ground on whoever wrote the script, but i didn't feel any connection. and when this movie was released, people didn't like it and received criticism as well. and in a way i feel like i fit that category because i didn't like it after it was finished, but it grew on me after. but ignoring its three-hour run time, the movie does make up for its brilliant dialogue, acting, and the music department. the music does a great job building that suspense feeling and i as i was watching this zoning in and out, as soon as that theme song kicked in, i knew i was in for a ride. and that last scene alone is enough for me to say that you should definitely watch this if you're not a fan of the western genre. i'm not the biggest fan of western genres, but clint eastwood makes any western movie enjoyable to watch that no other western character can top clint eastwood's charm and charisma. so in the end, even though this movie is three hours long to the point where it bore me to tears, the movie grew on me to the point that i realize while it may not be the best movie of the western genre, its still the one western movie i would recommend watching regardless if you hate western movies.;8 January 2020;9;['good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'spaghetti', 'western', 'final', 'major', 'countless', 'western', 'first', 'fresh', 'western', 'good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'final', 'magnum', 'american', 'civil', 'common', 'brilliant', 'great', 'last', 'enough', 'western', 'big', 'western', 'western', 'enjoyable', 'other', 'western', 'long', 'good', 'western', 'western', 'western'];0.0260416666666666

298;SgtSlaughter;"sergio leone's third installment in his spaghetti western ""dollars"" trilogy is a full-blown epic about greed and the wasteful, destructive nature of warfare. in 1862 texas, we meet tuco (eli wallach), a thief with a price on his head. his friend blondie (clint eastwood) runs a scam in which he turns tuco in for bounty, and then as he about to be hanged shoots the rope and the two split the reward money. meanwhile, angel eyes (lee van cleef) is hired by baker (enzo petito), a bedridden confederate soldier to find out from stevens (antonio casas) what name a certain jackson (antonio casale) is currently hiding under. angel eyes not only finds out the name, but also learns that baker, jackson and stevens have stolen a case of $200,000 in gold from the confederate army and hidden it. angel eyes sets off in search of jackson, and it's only a matter of time and coincidence until tuco and blondie become embroiled in this obsessive search, too. the three lead performances are the heart and soul of this film; not a scene passes in which eastwood, wallach or van cleef fail to grace the screen. eastwood (""the good"") is a quiet, restrained presence who only speaks when he has to. when he does, everyone around him shuts up and listens. wallach's tuco (""the ugly"") is the exact opposite. when he should shut up, he elects to yak, shout and yell excitedly at everyone around him. and he comes up with some of the best insults, too. in one scene, tuco and blondie are disguised as confederates, and tuco calls out to fellow ""confederate"" soldiers, only to realize that they are union cavalrymen covered with dust. rounding out the trio is van cleef's incredibly ""bad"" angel eyes character. angel eyes is the epitome of evil. nothing motivates this man except pure, selfish greed. he's willing to kill anyone who gets in his way. his first two scenes revolve around brutal murders; he beats innocent women and, later, has tuco beaten in one of the harshest torture sequences ever shot. leone does give each of his leads a hint of humanity. for blondie, it's a brief, silent encounter with a dying confederate soldier near the film's conclusion. for tuco, it's an encounter with his long-lost brother pablo (luigi pistilli), who's become a priest; and for angel eyes, it's a look of disgust when he stumbles across a forgotten confederate outpost. this film revolves around violent encounters. leone likes to draw out his action sequences almost too far. nobody can make this combination of long silences concluded with quick, explosive action work the way leone does. in the first 15 minutes of the film, only one dialog exchange occurs, and six people have been murdered. the first scene consists of several mean-looking bounty hunters converging on tuco, only to have him quickly kill all four of them and then escape through a window. the second is an exchange between angel eyes and stevens. we know from the moment we're introduced to angel eyes how this scene will end, but it takes quite a long time to get to the expected conclusion. scenes like these occur throughout, building up to the climactic gunfight, which consists of about five minutes of itchy eyes and twitching trigger fingers, building up to a single climactic gunshot. the theme of this movie is, undeniably, that war is a destructive waste of lives. i first saw ""the good, the bad and the ugly"" at an early age and didn't really understand leone's theme, but subsequent viewings and a greater understanding of film as art have helped me to pick up on many of the underlying (and often blatantly stated) ideas which the central conflict revolves around. no significant military character is unaffected by the war. there's the legless soldier whom van cleef pays for information; stevens has a bum leg; baker is dying in bed; the drunken captain (aldo giuffre) is addicted to alcohol, and later, is wounded; captain harper (antonio molino rojo) has a gangrenous leg; and so on. nobody who fights in a war is unaffected by the consequences. even innocent people: the young blond boy from whom eastwood received his famous poncho; stevens' murdered son and there's maria, the victim of rape by confederate soldiers. leone's directorial style comes out full-force in this film. he felt the best way to show a character's true emotion was to get in close and he does get in very close. at least 25% of the film is composed of intense close-ups. another 25% is shot with extreme wide angles, framing a central character against expansive backgrounds. most of the film occurs outdoors and was shot in almeria, spain by brilliant cinematographer tonino delli colli. these exteriors are simultaneously beautiful and haunting. there's something new and out-of-the ordinary about them. tuco and blondie's decent into a desert hell is especially memorable, and later on, the colossal battle between union and confederate brigades has got to be one of the biggest battle sequences ever filmed. it's amazing to see what leone can accomplish in one shot without any dialog. character motivation and scene establishment is done with a facial expression or eye movement as the camera pans without cutting. then, in the rapid action scenes, eugenio alabiso's masterful editing combined with ennio morricone's most memorable score work hand-in-hand to deliver a suspenseful encounter. ""the good, the bad and the ugly"" is an unmissable screen gem about the nature of human greed and the waste of civil war. it's also one of the most entertaining movies ever produced, and anyone who has not seen this yet is missing out on a seriously good time.";26 March 2003;10;['third', 'spaghetti', 'western', 'wasteful', 'destructive', 'bedridden', 'certain', 'confederate', 'obsessive', 'quiet', 'restrained', 'ugly', 'exact', 'good', 'bad', 'pure', 'selfish', 'willing', 'first', 'brutal', 'innocent', 'harsh', 'brief', 'silent', 'confederate', 'violent', 'long', 'quick', 'explosive', 'first', 'first', 'several', 'mean', 'second', 'long', 'climactic', 'itchy', 'single', 'climactic', 'destructive', 'bad', 'ugly', 'early', 'subsequent', 'great', 'many', 'underlying', 'central', 'significant', 'military', 'unaffected', 'legless', 'drunken', 'gangrenous', 'unaffected', 'innocent', 'young', 'blond', 'famous', 'confederate', 'directorial', 'full', 'good', 'true', 'close', 'intense', 'close', 'extreme', 'wide', 'central', 'expansive', 'most', 'brilliant', 'delli', 'beautiful', 'haunting', 'new', 'ordinary', 'memorable', 'colossal', 'big', 'amazing', 'facial', 'rapid', 'masterful', 'memorable', 'suspenseful', 'bad', 'ugly', 'unmissable', 'human', 'civil', 'entertaining', 'good'];0.0770491151005857

302;Manthorpe;not having seen this until very recently, i'm going to try and give an objective review for this film with tentative criticism. i'm not all too educated in the western genre, but supposedly this is the best, so i figured it to be a good place to start. absolutely stunning cinematography technique, excellent characters and actors, and one of the most memorable musical scores ever help define tgtbatu's spot in film history. it's no wonder it's achieved the status it has. having never seen any of the old spaghetti westerns before, i really didn't know what to expect. i was surprised but also delighted. for some reason i thought this film was going to be extremely realistic, so i was a little surprised to see hats getting shot off and rope cut in half by a bullets. i suppose it is part of the genre's characteristics and probably takes a little getting used to. also, at the same time the film is very realistic as it introduces the theme of the civil war at different parts throughout the film giving us a small glimpse of it's effects back then. easily my favorite component to the film, the cinematography is simply amazing. panoramic backgrounds and extreme close-ups do their respective jobs quite nicely to give this film more character that it needs, which is not a bad thing. i'm sure it's played a huge part in the film's notoriety and support since it's release. the score and the well-cast actors obviously had a part in this also. oh yeah, and one more thing, clint eastwood...born for these parts. being new to the genre of spaghetti westerns, i offer up my criticism with much reluctance. for the record, i enjoyed the film quite a bit and was not disappointed. however, i was a little surprised to find the film rated so high, even if it is the genre-defining classic that it is. what's wrong with it? well, it's a tad too long for one. not that i can't stay interested, i just felt they could have cut a few of the scenes. also, while the cinematography is beautiful, and complimented by long shots, i feel these longs shots are sometimes a little too long. the cemetery and stand-off scenes in the end come to mind. they're wonderful sequences, just too long. it's not that big of a deal, just sensing a little pretension leaking out here and there. and lastly, the sound quality is fairly terrible, even if the score is decent. the quality makes it sound like everyone was in a cave, including the impressive score. i do realize that the film was dubbed...some of which isn't all that great, which explains some of the off-key lip movements from some of the characters, some of them english speaking. other than those three little gripes, that may not have been such forty years ago, this is a great film that i enjoyed immensely. i will definitely add it to my collection soon and continue my quest to see all of the great westerns. anyone interested in westerns, great adventures, or simply film in general should not miss this hallmark. highly recommended, but not for everyone.;19 July 2004;10;['objective', 'tentative', 'western', 'good', 'good', 'stunning', 'excellent', 'memorable', 'musical', 'old', 'surprised', 'delighted', 'realistic', 'little', 'surprised', 'little', 'same', 'realistic', 'civil', 'different', 'small', 'favorite', 'amazing', 'panoramic', 'extreme', 'close', 'respective', 'more', 'bad', 'sure', 'huge', 'more', 'new', 'much', 'disappointed', 'little', 'surprised', 'high', 'wrong', 'long', 'interested', 'few', 'beautiful', 'long', 'little', 'wonderful', 'big', 'little', 'sound', 'terrible', 'decent', 'impressive', 'great', 'key', 'english', 'other', 'little', 'such', 'great', 'great', 'interested', 'great', 'general'];0.17967868338558

307;Wulfstan10;"the good, the bad, and the ugly is without a shred of doubt absolutely one of the greatest westerns ever made and very, very few can even come close. in fact, it is among the greatest films ever made and i can only think of 2 other westerns that can even compare. brilliant in every respect, the film is original, tense, very gritty, and very atmospheric. throughout the film there is an incredible energy and sense of tension that suddenly mounts tremendously to a breaking point in the finale. the film, outstanding the entire way through, is pure magic from the moment tuco stumbles upon the cemetery until the very end. in a short period of time, this last portion of the movie crams in the incredible scene where tuco looks around to see the immense number of graves before searching for the treasure, and the extremely tense, gripping, and unusual three-way stand-off in which the tension becomes almost unbearable before the sudden, unexpected, and powerfully anti-climactic (if that makes sense) shootout. the cinematography is creative and artistic. it powerfully helps convey the moods of the events and adds tremendously to the feeling of tension. as usual, leone made the film with extreme care and artistry, combining his ""trademark"" tight close-ups and huge longshots, sometimes, with incredibly stunning visual results, in the exact same shot (as near the end when we see a close-up of tuco's gun and his hand slowly inching down toward it, while the bulk of the view is a longshot of the cemetery with another of the gunmen in the distance). the characters are fresh, entertaining, and beautifully portrayed. lee van cleef, eli wallach, and clint eastwood are all perfect in their roles, imbuing their characters with immense realism and personality while emphasizing their differences and their similarities. lee van cleef emphatically shows how good and versatile an actor he could be, despite the fact that he far too rarely got such big roles. after compellingly portraying the utterly sympathetic colonel in for a few dollars more, he is entirely convincing as a terribly ruthless baddie. clint is great as the taciturn blondie and gets in some great, convincing gestures, etc. eli is the most incredible of the lot here as the garrulous, untrustworthy, but likable and sympathetic tuco, a man boiling with life and quirky humanity who contrasts the other taciturn, calm characters wonderfully. another element of this film that i love is the great attention to detail, another leone strong point that pays off in all of his films this is particularly true with respect to the three main characters. so much thought seems to have gone into even the smallest aspects of their personalities, such as how each one carries his gun in a totally different manner. my favorite is probably how tuco carries his gun stuffed into a pocket and likes to have it simply hang from his lanyard when ready to fight. there is also a wonderful sense of humour and i love how this pops up to break the tension even at unexpected moments like the cemetery and the final shootout. i also want to comment on leone's handling of violence. his films certainly are violent in the sheer number of deaths (compare the man who shot liberty valance, where i remember only 1 person being killed), adding a grittiness to the films and making them less idealized and romantic. at the same time, leone's scenes of death are quick and sharp, with most of the time spent on building the tension beforehand. i actually think that this not only makes a much more interesting picture with greater tension and less gore than something done by, say, sam peckinpah, but the quickness of the deaths actually is more brutal in a way than a drawn-out death. it hits home the cheapness and fragility of life in a way that a long, bloody death never can. finally, ennio morricone's music is utterly perfect. it's brilliant and perfectly helps convey all the drama, tension, and general atmosphere of the film in the right ways at the right times. i don't think there has ever been a better score for a western. this is one film that i can watch over and over, every time enjoying every little detail. one of the most amazing things, and one which really hits home leone's incredible ability as a filmmaker, is how leone can take this genre, and what is really a very simple story, and produce a film that goes far beyond what might normally have been with the film, turning it into a real piece of art and something far grander and more powerful than it otherwise would have been in the hands of other filmmakers.";11 March 2005;10;['bad', 'ugly', 'great', 'few', 'close', 'great', 'other', 'brilliant', 'original', 'tense', 'gritty', 'atmospheric', 'incredible',

308;jameslinton-75252;a great spaghetti western film. i think this film has everything you would expect from spaghetti westerns. clint eastwood was great as the rugged, antisocial blondie- the rogue anti-hero. the camera-work was also great as well from the sweeping long-shots of the desert to the close-up shots of the actor's faces. the soundtrack is iconic and did brilliantly in building tension. if i were to criticise this film for anything, i would say sergio leone did stretch out the film a little. he did overdo the tension building, particularly during the final standoff which could have been significantly shorter. click here for my full review: http://goo.gl/uwwjlg;15 April 2016;8;['great', 'spaghetti', 'western', 'great', 'rugged', 'antisocial', 'rogue', 'anti', 'great', 'sweeping', 'long', 'close', 'iconic', 'little', 'final', 'short', 'full'];0.3012500000000001

310;tonyjackie;the first thing to say about this movie is that it is probably a prequel to the first two dollar movies.i say this because towards the end of the movie clint eastwood's character actually finds the poncho that he wears in the first two films. this is a great movie and in my opinion the finest western ever.i think that it has gained respect critically with each passing decade and rightly so.it comes in at almost three hours and it really does need to be that long. what is so great?the three leading actor's are all top notch here.clint eastwood fits the role to perfection,lee van cleef oozes menace and eli wallach chews up every scene he is in in probably his best loved role.the story is basically a hunt for missing gold set against the backdrop of the american civil war and is beautifully told.then there is the music which is tremendous throughout. this is a pretty long and violent journey but boy is it worth it.the final 30 minutes of the film are tremendous and the final shoot out grips with tension.i remember the first time i saw it and couldn't believe that clint could possibly leave poor old tuco to hang in the middle of the graveyard and even though the character of tuco is a bit of a swine i was really pleased clint decided to save him after all. watch this movie.not only is it a great western,it is a fantastic film in it's own right.;5 November 2006;10;['first', 'prequel', 'first', 'first', 'great', 'fine', 'western', 'long', 'top', 'american', 'civil', 'tremendous', 'long', 'violent', 'worth', 'final', 'tremendous', 'final', 'first', 'poor', 'old', 'pleased', 'great', 'western', 'fantastic', 'own'];0.1993055555555556

313;shhimundercoverdamnit;the good, the bad and the ugly hey, blond! you know what you are? just the greatest son-of-a-b-! sergio leone was a director of boundless vision and ambition, a man with no little ideas. everything you see is big, and ambitious. in a film that runs about 180 minutes... one could argue that leone tells the story more with pictures than in words. thus is the good, the bad and the ugly. a story of three men who are all after the same fortune of civil war gold. in fact, the secret of its location is spread out among them (one knows the cemetery but not the grave, and the other knows the name but not the cemetery). the men involved are clint eastwood ( the good), lee van cleef ( the bad) and eli wallach ( the ugly). each man knows that they will remain alive until the grave is found.....but just as it always is- it is more than likely that each of them will try to kill the others for the gold. they are also men who really never need to explain anything, their eyes and actions could simply be deemed more important than their words. ( the obsession in van cleef's eyes) though, eastwood's character. blondie. ( the man with no name) says very little, eli wallach's: tuco never stops. in fact, some of the best dialgue from the film is of wallach's 'speeches' about the differences between people. 'you can be one thing or you can be another.' he compares himself to blondie, and to his own brother, who became a priest. however...... blondie has the last word! though there is no shortage of ideas in the film, there is also a film within a film. thus, a grand civil war sequence. one of the best scenes from the film is a scene in which a union army captain ( aldo giuffre) explains the war to the best of his ability. the commander who has the most booze to get his troops drunk before the battle is the one who wins. however, probably my favorite scene from the film was the haunting runaway wagon scene. that cemetery scene with wallach stumbling around is also a highlight.;11 February 2008;8;['bad', 'ugly', 'great', 'boundless', 'little', 'big', 'ambitious', 'more', 'bad', 'ugly', 'same', 'civil', 'other', 'bad', 'ugly', 'alive', 'more', 'likely', 'important', 'little', 'good', 'own', 'last', 'grand', 'civil', 'good', 'good', 'most', 'drunk', 'favorite', 'runaway'];0.0482142857142857

316;eyesour;"one of the mysteries of modern life is how this motion picture currently comes to occupy its no 4 spot on the imdb list of all-time greats. if not totally insane, the story is undeniably either ridiculous, ludicrous, hilarious or risible. perhaps the word i'm looking for is laughable. i'm not saying it isn't entertaining. it is that also. it is an american western partly written by an italian director, sergio leone, who shot it in spain. he invented a new cinematic genre, by linking the maniacal overstatement of italian grand opera with the spanish picaresque tradition, as he himself has indicated. picaro is a spanish word for ""rogue"" or ""rascal"", and the picaresque novel is usually satirical, depicting, ""in realistic and often humorous detail, the adventures of roguish heroes of low social class who live by their wits in a corrupt society."" the viewer is asked to believe that two picaros, clint and eli, can make good money, if not a steady living, claiming bounty rewards for eli's sins (which include playing cards with a marked deck), and then having clint shoot through the rope which is hanging eli, from some considerable distance. eli then fortunately stays sitting on his conveniently placed horse which gallops away. pull the other one; it's got bells on. for a detailed exposition of the plot, and the different putative locations, see the faq, which is required reading if some sense is to be made of the narrative, as filmed. this is of little help when actually watching, however. two of the weirdest scenes occur at the very beginning, and at the very end. the opening starts with one of leone's trademark facial closeups, of a peculiarly evil-looking individual. a little further on eli bursts through a window. difficult to tell why, since he leaves about three gunmen dead on the floor of the room which he has just left. he was apparently in the middle of gnawing his dinner. some way into the movie we leave spain, which has been doubling for mexico, and enter what looks like the sahara desert. i was expecting at least a camel, or possibly omar sharif, to materialize out of the sand. but no, instead we get a driverless coach and six, full of dead and dying soldiers, coming out of nowhere like a bat from hell --- had we wandered into hammer films territory? skip to the end, where our two heroes, clint and eli, now find themselves in what has been called a mexican standoff with evil-eyed lee van cleef. difficult to know why he hadn't been shot a long time earlier, since he didn't appear to have any valuable information about where the buried treasure was, like the other two. anyway, he sure gets shot now in an amazingly pointless and prolonged three-cornered duel, which takes place in a uniquely circular cemetery, specially designed for the standoff. leone is fond of scenes where a man is shown to be terrified by suspension from a rope round his neck. this turns up four times in this movie, and once more in his far greater masterpiece, ouatitw. this film (gbu) is much inferior, but you can't say it isn't entertaining. clint is cool, and the rest of it is comical, and brutal. look out for cpl wallace. eli takes his gun into his bath with him. never saw that in a western before.";1 April 2011;5;['modern', 'insane', 'ridiculous', 'ludicrous', 'hilarious', 'risible', 'laughable', 'entertaining', 'american', 'italian', 'new', 'cinematic', 'maniacal', 'italian', 'grand', 'spanish', 'spanish', 'rascal', 'satirical', 'realistic', 'humorous', 'roguish', 'low', 'social', 'corrupt', 'good', 'steady', 'marked', 'considerable', 'other', 'detailed', 'different', 'putative', 'little', 'weird', 'very', 'very', 'facial', 'evil', 'little', 'difficult', 'dead', 'least', 'full', 'dead', 'mexican', 'evil', 'eyed', 'difficult', 'long', 'valuable', 'other', 'pointless', 'circular', 'fond', 'more', 'great', 'inferior', 'entertaining', 'cool', 'comical', 'brutal', 'cpl', 'western'];-0.0279393939393939

319;MadReviewer;a sprawling western epic that follows the adventures of three gunfighters looking for $200,000 in stolen gold, sergio leone's 'the good, the bad, and the ugly' is a masterpiece, one that continues to get better and better with each viewing. in a way, it's a morality play, weighing the consequences of good and evil, but it does so in a realistic manner. sometimes, crime does pay, at least in the short term, and sometimes good does go unrewarded. this film probably signaled the death knell of the traditional john wayne 'white hat/black hat' western. the three main characters make the film. lee van cleef ('the bad') is evil personified. totally ruthless, he'll do whatever it takes to get what he wants. clint eastwood ('the good') is the man with no name, not really 'good' in a traditional sense . . . but he has a certain sense of honor and tries to do the right thing. (watch the scene when he gives a dying confederate soldier a puff of his cigar - powerful, and it sums up everything that the man with no name is all about, without saying a single word.) eli wallach ('the ugly') is tuco, and he's easily the most complex - if not the best - character in the film. all impulse and rage, tuco spins wildly throughout the movie, stealing, lying, pretending to be clint eastwood's best friend in one scene, trying to kill him in another - tuco truly represents 'the ugly' side of people. the movie is long, but there's not a wasted scene in the film. each one slowly lets the film unfold with a certain style and grace, revealing more about each character and what's going on. the pacing is incredible, as is the direction - sergio leone manages to build a lot of uncomfortable tension in the film, keeping the film from ever getting predictable. any typical western cliche that you can possibly think of is either given a unique twist or utterly destroyed by leone's masterful storytelling. of special mention is ennio morricone's score, which is absolutely perfect. two scenes - one in a union prison camp, one in the climatic gunfight in the cemetery at the end of the film - are amazing on their own, but they become absolutely astonishing with combined with morricone's powerful score. this movie is absolutely brilliant. if you haven't seen it yet, i strongly urge to do so. immediately. (and then, go watch 'unforgiven' . . . in a way, i think that 'unforgiven' is the sequel to 'the good, the bad, and the ugly - it's the story of what eventually happened to the man with no name.)

327;donuthaters12;"the good, the bad and the ugly is the final film of sergio leone's the man with no name trilogy. this film is recognized by most as the best film from the trilogy, some argue that it's leone's best film overall. i, on the other hand, found this film great but it did have it's flaws. i also cannot say this film is the filmmaker's best as i found this film to be equally as good as for a few dollars more. this film was mainly written by leone and luciano vincenzoni. both also collaborated in writing the previous film. i'll start by saying the great things about the film's screenplay. the film is huge in comparison to the previous film and even more when you compare to the a fistful of dollars. the best part of the film in my opinion are the characters as leone and vincenzoni have created people that are very focused on their goal, but at the same time keeping them interesting by adding personality with these characters which clearly defines them. though i do wish that lee van cleef's character was written more screen time to allow us to understand more about the character, which leone did incredibly well for gian maria volonte in for a few dollars more. the film's title is ironic because each one of the main characters are just as ugly as the other one, being driven by greed and will do whatever they can to get the gold, even if breaks the partnership between characters. the bad part, nothing ugly, about the film's story is the middle part of the film which at times can become a bit too draggy and doesn't keep me on my toes as it does on leone's previous films. that is just a minor nitpick as it's still tolerable and it only affects me a few times during my many viewings of the film. leone's direction and vision for this film is much bigger and concrete. the man knew what he wanted to do for this film and since his other two films he has gained a major boost on his confidence. this made the film feel very patient, showing shots that take it's time in moving on to the next shot or scene. the scope of the film has drastically expanded, showing huge location shots with actors looking very miniature on screen, which at times juxtaposes with the extreme close ups that are also abundant of this film. i think leone was influenced by david lean, as moments feel like something that came off from lawrence of arabia or at least similarly. leone is known for creating a memorable climax, and this one may be the most memorable one. the film's director of photography is tonino delli colli who would then work with leone later on his future films. i wished that massimo dallamano came back for this film, the previous film's cinematographer, as he has created a particular style that suited leone's direction and vision, but colli didn't do a bad job for this film as he still kept it like a western and increased the scope of leone's previous films. his work here has definitely become iconic but personally i felt that his best work was once upon a time in america. leone and colli's photography shines specifically on moments like the scene with the open desert and the graveyard climax. ennio morricone comes back for this film and is definitely his best work. morricone's score here is much bigger in comparison to his previous work. morricone's score for this film is much more complex and diverse than his first film with leone. leone has created a particular melody and created three styles of delivering it, relating each to a character. morricone's score stood out the most during the climax as it felt like a throwback to his previous score but interlacing it with his current score. a moment in the pow camp where the prisoners are playing music to drown out torture noises was a moment that showed so much emotion; this was achieved with great acting, beautiful photography, but mostly due to the music. this was the first time i felt that leone can create something emotional and dramatic, which was not really present on his previous films. the acting spotlight here is equally shared by eastwood, van cleef and wallach. eastwood plays it darker in this film, due to his character being very driven to obtain that gold and will do whatever he can to ensure that he'll get it. at the same time, eastwood is given moments in this film that showcases a humanitarian point of view, which i thought was a nice touch. van cleef's character was a little underused in this film as wallach and eastwood had a wider screen time, but when he comes on screen (like the introduction of the character) he plays it cool and at times a bit dark. van cleef definitely surprised me because i never really saw him as a villain due to his fantastic performance from his previous film. eli wallach was like breath of fresh air, his humor and style of acting really drove the film forward and kept the tone light. leone has brought back familiar faces from his previous films, kind of like a cameo and a treat for people who are fans of his work. the good, the bad and the ugly is a very well made film but it's minor flaws prevent it from being perfect. it currently ties with for a few dollars more but this is just my opinion of the film at the time of writing. i may end up loving this film a lot more as i grow older and with repeated watching. the film has definitely stood the test of time and remain feeling like a fresh and unique in comparison to the many western films of that era.";3 October 2013;10;['bad', 'ugly', 'final', 'most', 'good', 'good', 'other', 'great', 'good', 'good', 'few', 'more', 'previous', 'great', 'huge', 'previous', 'good', 'focused', 'same', 'interesting', 'more', 'more', 'gian', 'few', 'more', 'ironic', 'main', 'ugly', 'other', 'bad', 'ugly', 'middle', 'draggy', 'previous', 'minor', 'tolerable', 'few', 'many', 'big', 'other', 'major', 'patient', 'next', 'huge', 'miniature', 'extreme', 'close', 'abundant', 'least', 'memorable', 'memorable', 'delli', 'future', 'massimo', 'previous', 'particular', 'suited', 'bad', 'western', 'previous', 'iconic', 'good', 'open', 'good', 'big', 'previous', 'complex', 'diverse', 'first', 'particular', 'most', 'previous', 'current', 'much', 'great', 'beautiful', 'first', 'emotional', 'dramatic', 'present', 'previous', 'dark', 'same', 'humanitarian', 'nice', 'little', 'underused', 'wide', 'cool', 'dark', 'fantastic', 'previous', 'fresh', 'familiar', 'previous', 'bad', 'ugly', 'minor', 'perfect', 'few', 'more', 'old', 'fresh', 'unique', 'many', 'western'];0.1176630434782609
328;SebMoz;where do i even begin talking about this movie? this is the movie that made me interested in movies in the first place, and to this day i've not been able to find a movie that resonnates better with me. i'm astonished how well this movie holds up, even after 50 years, and it's almost a bit depressing when you think about how unappreciated it was at the time of its release. fortunately, it has since then gained more recognition, and is widely regared as one of the greatest movies ever made, and in my opinion, the single best movie ever made. from the opening credits you know you're about to watch something special. the iconic theme combined with the visuals that tell their own tale make for arguably one of the most entertaining opening credits. then, we're immediately thrown into the action, as three bounty hunters try to hunt down tuco, the ugly, after a tense scene where they walk towards each other, leading you to believe that a duel between them is about to commence.. speaking of which, tucos introduction is practically perfect. in just one shot, we know almost everything there is to know about the character, by looking at his expression and the things he carries in his hands. angel eyes's (the bad) and blondie's (the good) introductions are also incredibly good, quickly establishing the nature of the characters and how we will come to view them throughout the movie. one of the things one must keep in mind when watching this movie, is that sergio leone prioritizes the individual scene instead of an intricately crafted story. what this results in is that every single scene is a work of art, complete with suspense, it's own pacing and most important of all: the gorgeous cinematography that defines this movie. this means that every scene in this movie is iconic in some way, and it is in my opinion the movie's greatest strength. the characters in this movie are very cleverly constructed in my opinion, and while i can understand people complaining about some being bland, i think they work perfectly for this movie. blondies backstory is left ambigous, though one can't help but wonder what other adventures he has been on. he isn't very outspoken, and this gives him that iconic feeling of mysteriousness. tuco is given a rich backstory, expressed both in his conversation with his brother and his hanging scene at the beginning, where the sheriff lists up everything he has done. he's by far the most entertaining character in the movie, constantly talking and goofing around. then there's angel eyes, which similar to blondie doesn't have a backstory, but his tenacity and charisma as the ultimate villain more than makes up for it. the side characters are also generally very good, even though they rarely get more than one scene. the themes of this movie generally revolves around morality and greed, and i love how it's not shoved in your face with unnecessary dialogue, but rather subtly shown through how the characters approach different situations. i also like how the three main characters are very similar in the beginning, but start to show their differences once they experience more and more of the civil war and its cruelties. angel eyes, being truly evil, uses it for profit and to satisfy his need for violence and money. tuco's approach is similar , but he doesn't have the charisma needed to benefit of the war, and so chooses a more pacifistic way of dealing with it. the difference is clearest with blondie, who start the movie as an immoral bounty hunter, but through seeing the cruel reality of the war he becomes a more merciful man, which culminates in how he spares tuco's life at the very end, despite everything tuco did to him. if there has ever been a movie in which the director and composer has worked together in perfect harmony, this is it. as opposed to regular movies, leone and morricone sat down before filming to create the themes, before adjusting the actual shots to the music. this is in my opinion the movie where morricone transformed into a composer god. every theme is perfect, from the iconic main theme, to the story of a soldier, to the ecstasy of gold and the trio. the music and action blends together perfectly to the point that the movie becomes an entirely different one without the score. it's time to talk about the finale, the climax, the peak of tension. the entire movie has been building up to this: tuco arrives at the cementary, and for 4 minutes the only thing happening is him looking for the grave he believes the 200.000 dollars in gold is buried. this scene is carried entirely by the score, the iconic ecstasy of gold theme. then blondie and angel eyes show up to the cementary. as it's revealed that tuco's information about the spesific grave is false, they realize that only blondie knows which grave it's buried in, and so begins the single best climactic showoff in any movie. three men, all exceptionally skilled with their guns, stands in a circle, and for 5 minutes the only thing moving is the score, morricone's the trio, which builds suspense as it rises in power and greatness. there is no dialogue, yet the facial expressions and the editing still tells a compelling story in which the characters all try to figure out who will shoot first. as the music suddenly stops, angel eyes draws, only for blondie to shoot him first, but only to injure. as angel eyes attempts to shoot blondie again, he is shot and killed, and so ends the story of the bad. tuco and blondie then digs up the gold, and we get a final showcase of blondie's character arc: after ordering tuco to put his head in a noose and riding off, he reappears and severs the rope, leaving tuco alive. then he rides away, the good, the man with no name, to the iconic theme that introduced the movie in the first place.;28 October 2020;10;['interested', 'first', 'able', 'depressing', 'unappreciated', 'more', 'great', 'single', 'good', 'about',

330;EyeDunno;"watch films and tv shows to this day and you'll see how deeply influential that ""the good, the bad, and the ugly"" has been. sergio leone's masterpiece, to be sure. just as influential, is the musical score by ennio morricone. yet it's so interesting to note how leone's style was greatly influenced by the work of john ford. gbu is an essential film, and anyone reading this understands it. how many people, who don't like westerns, recognize that high-pitched wail that plays at the beginning and very end of the film? it's amazing that the film is 161 minutes long in its original theatrical release, but so many people are so satisfied with it from beginning to end. most people generally root for that scoundrel, tuco benedicto pacifico juan maria ramirez - known as the rat! what i enjoyed was that blondie was never *too* good, while angel eyes was so good at being oh, so bad. tuco, being the ugly? you understand why he resorted to his ways as his character developed, and you tend to actually root for him. but you still never want to turn your back on him. one of my favorite intimate scenes was blondie, taking a pause from a pursuit, crossing paths with the soldier. not one word is said, but the moment between them is truly touching. the only person we truly don't get too close to, is angel eyes, but you simply don't feel cheated by that. the cinematography is exquisite. whether it was the dp, tonino delli colli, or the vision of sergio's direction, you find a depth to the film like never seen before. the deep focus, using wide angle lenses to maintain focus from, say, a shoe in the foreground to people yards away, to the truly extreme closeups of only shifting eyes, is cinematic genius. there is not one actor that's off in this film. and the writing - three men pursuing a hidden treasure, through the back yard of the civil war - is outstanding work, with just enough comic relief to give you a chance to relax from the countless number of climaxes throughout. ""the good, the bad, and the ugly,"" is the benchmark of not only westerns, but of filmmaking in general. this film, released in 1966, stands at #5 of the top 250 films, which says volumes, especially with over a quarter million votes. and gbu only won one award?";6 September 2012;10;['influential', 'bad', 'ugly', 'sure', 'influential', 'musical', 'interesting', 'essential', 'many', 'very', 'amazing', 'original', 'theatrical', 'many', 'satisfied', 'most', 'good', 'good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'favorite', 'intimate', 'touching', 'only', 'close', 'exquisite', 'delli', 'deep', 'wide', 'extreme', 'cinematic', 'civil', 'outstanding', 'enough', 'comic', 'countless', 'bad', 'ugly', 'general', 'top'];0.1361764705882353

339;YellowManReanimated;"with his ""dollars trilogy"", leone virtually single-handedly reinvented the western. the old formula of civilised white heroes valiantly battling native savages, or po-faced lawman struggling to establish order in their immediate domain were replaced with an ironic, stylish, sui-generis swagger. the good, the bad and the the ugly was the apotheosis of this reinvention. it was a western but not as anyone had ever known it, it was a western for a new generation: a more self-aware, savvier generation. clint eastwood is the face of this swagger. he is cool, calm and effortlessly heroic. a man of few words and no name, he represents the rugged charm of the old west. and is there any cinematic image more iconic than eastwood squinting into the middle-distance, toothpick or cigar clenched between ivory teeth, muttering a laconic witticism to his unsuspecting, uncultured victim. eastwood's persona was clearly drawn from the morally ambiguous heroes of classic film noir: think humphrey bogart from films such as ""the maltese falcon"" or ""the big sleep"". what's possibly even more impressive, however, are the number of archetypes this character was able to inspire: from 1980s action movie heroes, to more recent marvel superheroes, there is a nod to one of cinema's most enduring influences: the original man with no name. one, of course, also has to mention ennio morricone's soundtrack: once heard it is never forgotten and even those who haven't watched the film will recognise it. it's pure genius in its simplicity and effectiveness. it reaches out and pulls you immediately into the action and atmosphere of the film. personally, despite the above, i don't believe this film to be either leone's or morricone's best work, both would come with leone's next film in my view. yet it would be ridiculous to argue that this was not their most iconic cinematic offering. it's burned into popular consciousness to this very day: a testament to this lingering, enduring cinematic treat.";22 July 2021;8;['western', 'old', 'civilised', 'native', 'immediate', 'ironic', 'stylish', 'bad', 'ugly', 'western', 'western', 'new', 'aware', 'savvy', 'cool', 'calm', 'few', 'rugged', 'old', 'cinematic', 'iconic', 'middle', 'laconic', 'unsuspecting', 'uncultured', 'ambiguous', 'classic', 'such', 'maltese', 'big', 'impressive', 'able', 'recent', 'original', 'pure', 'good', 'next', 'ridiculous', 'iconic', 'cinematic', 'popular', 'very', 'cinematic'];0.1424682088744588
340;Aomalle27;"a truly magnificent 3 hour long tale of three bandits, on the trail of half a million dollars in stolen confederate gold. clint eastwood is blondie, a mercenary gunman who partners up with the mexican bandit tucco (eli wallach) to play a con on several different western towns. tucco plays the part of captured bandit, blondie the part of bounty hunter who has captured the wanted criminal. subsequently he collects the reward, and tucco is to be hung. but being a con, naturally blondie just shoots tuccon down off the hangman's rope, and into the sunset they ride to their next con job. into the fray rides angel eyes (lee van cleef playing the role to menacing perfection), a ruthless killer on the trail of the stolen gold after two of the thieves turn on each other, both hiring angel eyes to murder the other. he may be a ruthless killer, but he does have a perverted sense of honor, and thus fulfills both contracts, but not before one of the men tells him the story of the stolen gold, and whom he should seek out to get it, another thief in on the heist, who has now joined up with the confederate army. as the broad backdrop of the civil war rages on, we are given a microcosm of the conflict with not two, but three competing sides. what's interesting here is the dichotomy of the characters being almost mirror images of one another. each a skilled gunman, and proficient killer. however, what separates the three is the degree of morality each has; blondie killing only when necessary, when he's confronted with no other choice. tucco kills for convenience, his life of crime has made him many enemies, so he's often faced with the end result, those out for revenge. but tucco has a softer side, and we see several revelations about his upbringing that place him in a somewhat more heroic light than he first comes across as. finally, there's angel eyes, a demonic killer with no empathy, sympathy or moral direction. he's out to get everything in life for himself, and will sell out anyone that tries to stop him. he delights in torture, but seldom sullies his own hands. he prefers to let others do the dirty work, and enjoys the spoils. i really think he's a representation of the devil. someone that enjoys manipulating, killing and causing chaos. a being totally involved with the pleasures of life regardless of the cost to others. the film's climax with a mexican standoff is priceless, and the entire film is a enjoyable, riveting experience that should be on the beginners list for western film viewing. interestingly enough, it is so deep and nuanced, it can easily go onto an experts list for western viewing as well.";30 April 2008;10;['magnificent', 'long', 'confederate', 'mercenary', 'several', 'different', 'western', 'wanted', 'next', 'ruthless', 'other', 'other', 'ruthless', 'perverted', 'confederate', 'broad', 'civil', 'interesting', 'skilled', 'proficient', 'necessary', 'other', 'many', 'out', 'soft', 'several', 'heroic', 'demonic', 'moral', 'own', 'dirty', 'mexican', 'priceless', 'entire', 'enjoyable', 'riveting', 'western', 'deep', 'nuanced', 'western'];0.0979166666666666

349;Ismaninb;"with more than 40 pages of reviews, what can i add? let me focus on a few sides i haven't read about. the first one is philosophy. movies, which aspire to be philosophical usually are boring and pompous. probably leone did not have such ambitions. still philosophy - together with myth and religion, as pointed out by others - plays an important role. since the antique times of the greeks and romans philosophers ask themselves the question: how can one lead a virtuous life in difficult circumstances? the good, the bad and the ugly is leone's answer. there is no doubt about the bad (lee van cleef). his name angel eyes must refer to the fallen angel, as he represents evil. i don't know italian, but i would not be surprised if the correct translation of il brutto should have been the hypocrite. tuco's (eli wallach) ways are ugly, only doing good when it is in his own interest. but what about the good (clint eastwood)? his name, blondie, refers to medieval characters like the lady in the tower with the golden hair, or siegfried from the nibelungen saga. blondie certainly does not represent good the way all religions would like to see it. he is cynical, mean, ruthless, violent. he only shows compassion when he can afford it. i think the final scene of the movie gives the answer: in a lawless world being virtuous means being in a position of power and then apply a rudimentary kind of justice. can anyone assume, that tuco will have nice memories of blondie? we can turn this argument around. if blondie is good, what kind of world is he living in? i guess, we all must be grateful to live in an orderly society and not in a free for all. wagner developed the concept of gesamtkunst, something like total art, for opera. he meant, that every element of the project should cooperate in harmony to achieve the final result. leone has realised this concept with his gbu. read the other reviews: every single detail contributes to the movie. the close ups already have been mentioned many times. they demand superb underacting, as we must read the emotions of the characters by small changes in their facial expressions. luigi pistilli as the monk and tuco's brother deserves to be mentioned especially. he is the voice of religious morals and gives us a ray of hope in a very dark world. pistilli is excellent, like in for a few dollars more and death rides a horse. still gbu is not the best movie ever imo. i'd like to mention seven samurai (kurosawa), le clan des siciliens (verneuil), le samourai (melville), a clockwork orange (kubrick), monsieur klein (losey), autumn sonata (bergmann) and la dentilliere (goretta). note that three of these see alain delon; i think there are several similarities with clint eastwood. you will probably ask: how can you compare? you are right, it's just my personal taste. gbu still falls in the categorie extra-ordinaire, with the aforementioned movies and titles like lola (fassbinder), vertigo (hitchcock), smiles of a summer night (bergmann)and for a few dollars more (leone). as leone has directed another few very good ones, he is one of the directors, who have proved that a movie can be a piece of art.";25 December 2006;10;['more', 'few', 'first', 'philosophical', 'boring', 'pompous', 'such', 'important', 'antique', 'virtuous', 'difficult', 'bad', 'ugly', 'bad', 'italian', 'surprised', 'correct', 'ugly', 'own', 'good', 'medieval', 'golden', 'good', 'cynical', 'mean', 'ruthless', 'violent', 'final', 'lawless', 'virtuous', 'rudimentary', 'nice', 'good', 'grateful', 'orderly', 'free', 'total', 'final', 'other', 'single', 'close', 'many', 'superb', 'small', 'facial', 'religious', 'dark', 'excellent', 'few', 'more', 'good', 'imo', 'several', 'right', 'personal', 'categorie', 'extra', 'aforementioned', 'vertigo', 'few', 'more', 'few', 'good'];0.0405357142857143
350;Lt_Coffey_182;"by a fair margin, the greatest out of the spaghetti western films, the good, the bad and the ugly is a cinematic triumph that will always be remembered most of all for the legendary score and stand off scene. what surprised me most of all was that a long film with quite a slow pace to it actually appeared to move quite quickly; this is thanks to leone's superior direction and the frequent change of locations within the film. clint eastwood's iconic status was firmly established in this film as a bad ass desperado with compulsory cigar attached, blondie makes dirty harry appear meagre in comparison! whilst the characterisation provided by the supporting cast was over the top to an almost comic book standard, their performances and characters were still memorable and enjoyable as they provided a stark contrast to eastwood's quiet loner. where a lot of westerns fall short is the plot, they tend to become a victim of style over substance but this film is an exception as it provides us with a fairly intricate plot. the way tuco's (wallach) murderous intentions regarding blondie are quashed by the fact that blondie knows the secret of the treasure, leading to tuco fighting to keep him alive rather than kill him, is very commendable. the tie in with the american civil war is very enjoyable and provides some further tension and heightens the predicament that the main characters are in, especially considering angle eyes (cleef) is a high rank in the unionist regiment that eastwood and wallach have infiltrated. the tension is built up fairly well, even though it requires patience. the final stand off, for instance, takes a matter of minutes for the main characters to get in their positions with the camera ranging from extreme close ups to the characters' eyes to shots that appear to be a mile away. whilst this sounds potentially frustrating, it induces overwhelming anticipation and once again, the music comes in to play, setting up a true piece of cinematic history. whilst there are no award winning performances on show, the leads are very good. eastwood played greatly on his tough guy image and manages to tell us a lot about the character despite not saying much. eastwood illustrates fantastically, a character devoid of trust and sentiment but also a character of great honour. it is plain to see that blondie is world weary and he knows that it's kill or be killed. eli wallach is very good, probably the best performance in the film. his animated performance brings his character to life as a thoroughly dislikeable loudmouth who is too stupid to avoid trouble but greedy enough not to let his desire to kill blondie stopping him get the treasure. lee van cleef is even more dislikeable because where wallach's tuco is untrustworthy, cleef's angel eyes is brutally honest with ruthlessness to match. the interrogation scenes in the union camp really highlight this nature and makes sure that the audience knows he means business. the best thing about these characters is that they all flawed, it's not all black and white. even eastwood's 'the good' is not all that good. laced with brilliant set pieces and memorable performances, the good, the bad and the ugly is very memorable and definitely a classic. watching wallach hunt eastwood with his cigar stubs proves the film had a sense of humour but that didn't take away the fact that the film depicts a life of brutality where not even women and children are safe when they stand between power hungry men and their goal. effective story telling mixed with macabre imagery assures this films place in cinema history and possibly even the title of the best western ever made.";9 February 2007;8;['fair', 'great', 'spaghetti', 'western', 'bad', 'ugly', 'cinematic', 'most', 'legendary', 'most', 'long', 'slow', 'superior', 'frequent', 'iconic', 'bad', 'compulsory', 'dirty', 'comic', 'memorable', 'enjoyable', 'stark', 'quiet', 'short', 'intricate', 'murderous', 'alive', 'commendable', 'american', 'civil', 'enjoyable', 'further', 'main', 'high', 'unionist', 'final', 'main', 'extreme', 'close', 'frustrating', 'overwhelming', 'true', 'cinematic', 'good', 'tough', 'much', 'devoid', 'great', 'plain', 'weary', 'good', 'good', 'dislikeable', 'stupid', 'greedy', 'dislikeable', 'untrustworthy', 'honest', 'sure', 'good', 'black', 'white', 'good', 'brilliant', 'memorable', 'bad', 'ugly', 'memorable', 'safe', 'hungry', 'effective', 'good', 'western'];0.1766981390257252

358;jerome_horwitz;"the good, the bad, and the ugly, stars clint eastwood as blondie, eli wallach as tuco, and lee van cleef as angel eyes. this movie is a masterpiece, and represents the qualities that good movies should exhibit. it's written with an interesting story, great character development, great character interaction, and great production values. this movie is about 3 gunslingers who at times work together, or against each other in search of a bountiful treasure hidden in a secluded cemetery. at different points of the movie, blondie and tuco work together, then betray each other, then come to work together again. at other points of the movie, angel eyes works together with blondie, leaving tuco as the out man. the story begins before tuco and blondie meet up. after meeting, they then work together to collect bounties on tuco who is worth $1000s. the team can split the bounties as they move territory to territory scamming the law. with each new town, blondie collects the bounty, then saves tuco from actually being put to death, then they divide up the bounty. problems begin as greed sets in. with in a short time, blondie abandons tuco after rescuing him, even after tuco warned him to never betray him and leave him alive. eventually, the roles are reversed, and it is tuco who abuses blondie and nearly causes his death. but this is where the story takes a major twist, as a run away wagon with a nearly dead passenger reveals secrets of a treasure, but each tuco and the half dead blondie only learn a vital part of the secret from. so now tuco must save blondie to get to the treasure. the story continues from there, and we get to learn quite a bit about the characters. especially tuco, in my opinion leone purposely allowed us to see that indeed there were no defined roles as who was ""the good"", ""the bad"", and ""the ugly"". greed is very powerful, especially when life is such a struggle to begin with. the final showdown is unbelievable. it is epic, and is absolutely worth anything to see. it's the pinnacle of movie making, the showdown, the movie, the characters, the drama building. truly a masterpiece. this movie is great, it's a cinematic masterpiece. as of this writing, it's #16 in the top 250 movies on imdb, and deserves to be. any western fan must see this movie, no excuses. any fan of movies in general must see this movie, no excuses. thank you sergio for making this movie. 10/10";2 June 2005;10;['bad', 'ugly', 'tuco', 'good', 'interesting', 'great', 'great', 'great', 'other', 'bountiful', 'different', 'other', 'other', 'out', 'worth', 'new', 'short', 'alive', 'major', 'dead', 'half', 'dead', 'vital', 'good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'powerful', 'final', 'unbelievable', 'epic', 'worth', 'great', 'cinematic', 'top', 'western', 'general'];0.0926423324150597

360;thatfilmperson;"if you liked: the mandalorian the magnificent seven for a fistful of dollars the good, the bad, and the ugly is one of the best movies of all time. it's an epic story of adventure, war, murder and betrayal set in the wild west, with a score by ennio morricone that became literally legendary over the years. it follows three cowboys in civil war era america all looking for buried treasure worth an estimated $17 million in today's currency. this is one of these movies which i had in my watchlist for about 5 years, you just keep postponing it because from what you've heard it should be incredibly good, and that brings certain pressure for a person like me, who tries to analyze films. i have seen a couple of classical westerns before (the magnificent seven; ouati the west), so i had certain expectations for this film. i was happy that the film turned out to be not at all what i expected, in all the good ways. i don't want to say that this is the only western you ever have to watch in your life; but from what i can tell this is like michelangelo's ""david"" in the world of westerns; if you do end up seeing only the one, you will get a good idea of what the whole genre has to offer, because that there - is the finest of the finest. people often say that the director sergio leone (oiati the west; ouati america) redefined the western genre with this film. the so-called ""spaghetti westerns"" (cowboy movies produced and directed by italians in the 60-70s) were so profitable and popular at the time, that they soon became virtually the same story copy-pasted over and over again (kinda like some marvel films nowadays). if the recipe works, why change it, right? that led to the inevitable decline and foreseeable death of westerns as a genre, but sergio leone had one last word to fit into this story. what differentiates ""the good..."" from other westerns of it's era is the accurate representations of it's characters and war. the three rogue characters, apart from being traditionally ""cool and extremely skilled loners"", a reoccurring image we still see in today's mandalorian and witcher, are insanely well-developed. each has short but extremely impactful scenes that show the essence of the character, explaining their motivation and, sometimes, background. they are brutal, murdering for the sake of murder and betraying for the sake of personal gain; but they are also lovable and unforgettable, and after all, this is the wild west. the other thing about war is a reoccurring theme in all of my reviews on war films. you can't call this one a war film, but leone makes his characters go through the battlefields of the ongoing warfare on their quest for a hidden treasure, and that gives the film a life-contemplating dramatic twist. war is not shown as cool, it is shown for what it really is: ""a daily slaughter"" and a terrible, unnecessary waist of good men. the first time i've seen war viewed like this in an old movie, it was a pleasant surprise. the film is also widely considered cinematically perfect, and although it didn't occur to me first, i must agree on that. leone embraces the cinematic elements of filmmaking; he carefully composes each widescreen like he's painting a great landscape; and the extreme eye-level close-ups have become his trademark. just like with most of other great ""top-rated"" movies, ""the good, the bad and the ugly"" had an undeniably profound effect on cinema and our collective thinking. antiheroes is a common trait in modern films, and the final mexican standoff scene has become deeply ingrained in our culture and became one of the most parodied scenes in motion picture history. the film's legacy continues to last long after it's release.";18 November 2020;10;['bad', 'ugly', 'good', 'epic', 'wild', 'legendary', 'civil', 'good', 'certain', 'classical', 'magnificent', 'certain', 'happy', 'good', 'only', 'western', 'good', 'whole', 'fine', 'fine', 'western', 'profitable', 'popular', 'same', 'marvel', 'right', 'inevitable', 'foreseeable', 'last', 'other', 'accurate', 'cool', 'skilled', 'short', 'impactful', 'brutal', 'personal', 'lovable', 'unforgettable', 'wild', 'other', 'reoccurring', 'ongoing', 'hidden', 'dramatic', 'cool', 'daily', 'terrible', 'unnecessary', 'good', 'first', 'old', 'pleasant', 'perfect', 'cinematic', 'widescreen', 'great', 'extreme', 'close', 'most', 'other', 'great', 'bad', 'ugly', 'profound', 'collective', 'common', 'modern', 'final', 'mexican', 'ingrained', 'parodied'];0.1639880952380953

363;silva-w-pius;"the good, the bad and the ugly produced in italy and spain in 1966, is to western fans and cinephiles, as harry styles is to teenage girls; as soon as we hear one note of the sensational score and catch one glimpse of our heroes squint of an eye. instantly our pulses quicken, heart races and we must try our hardest to suppress a squeal of joy. following on from two film predecessors; a fist full of dollars and for a few dollars more, in a inherently sergio leon way, the good, the bad and the ugly opens up with a series of intercutting close ups of sun beaten faces looking out towards the horizon, and wide shot of the setting, which appears to be an old rundown little town. but just as you would expect from the spaghetti western master, we are given very little information from the start. we don't know who these men are at first or what their intentions are, but from the looks of them, they don't seem all that two friendly. but what the opening shots do reveal, in particular leon predilection for wide and close up paring, is that leon was avid art collector; the close ups where reminiscent of goya, while the vast unyielding landscapes where an allusion to surrealist painting style leon was a fan off. as the men make their way down into what appears to be a salon, we don't follow them in instead we hear a shoot out occurring, then all of a sudden the camera pans to focus on a window in which 'the ugly' leaps out with wine in one hand and a half eaten pigs leg in the other, this is tuco (eli wallach), and those two items some him up best, he is a bear drinking, untrustworthy swine. but on the other hand he does phenomenally inject a whole lot of humour and wild edge to the film. next we find ourselves with a little boy riding a donkey; he looks to the distance where he sees a lone man riding a horse towards him, we then passes him with little regard. little does that boy know that man will go on to mercilessly shoot and kill both his brother and father, for that man is 'the bad' also known as angel eyes (lee van cleef from john ford's high-noon). then last but not least, we return again to the ugly we find himself in a tricky situation, involving three gun slingers. but cue the introduction of the man with no name (technically he does have a name, its blondie in the film and clint eastwood in real life) who saves tuco only to return him to a nearby town to cash in on his bounty, justifying his title 'the good' . but not everything is what it seems, it soon turns out the both men are in collusion and turning tuco in is merely a trick to get the bounty, save tuco from getting hanged and then gets the heck out of there. the plan is so genius that they could continue getting away with the same trick, oh wait they completely hate each other and can trust each other as far as they can throw. the relationship between the leads make for a great stand up duo; tuco the loud mouth and blondie the silent brooding one, similar to famous magicians pen and teller. eventually for the rest of the film the good, the bad and the ugly must unite in search for $200,000 loot stashed inside a person's grave, but only the ugly knows where the grave site is, while the good only knows which name it is buried under, but of course they can't trust each other with that information. while other western director like to cut to the chase and draw out the scenes violence such as howard hawks and sam penkinpah, instead on the other hand , something i particularly love most about leon is how he always extends all precursors before a shot out or a act of violence which eventually end rather quickly . it's better that why, because we invest ourselves deeper into the characters, whilst also allowing the tension in the scene to build up to almost excruciating levels even before the first bullet is fire. what i also love about the good, the bad and the ugly, is the moral ambiguity that runs thick throughout the film, never are the lines between good and bad really competently drawn through. i guess that it down to the decision to keep back stories and exposition rather low. but what it does offer you is the freedom to choose what side you cheer for because there isn't any real distinct good guy in the film, which makes it all the more exciting. at a lengthy 2hrs and 50 minutes, gbu is almost david lean and lawrence arabia-esk in terms if scope and grandeur, and you can also drew comparisons between the two films in the deployment of the incessant use of panoramic shoots of the vast scenery and man insignificant compared to it. as long as gbu is, not once to i find the film meandering or tedious, despite its length it was able to move a furious pace, so it felt that we the audience were ourselves almost sucked into the action by an almighty whirl wind. but in a largely dead genre, we can look back to the good, the bad and the ugly with great nostalgia and affection, for it a shinnying beckon of what great film making is.";11 April 2014;10;['bad', 'western', 'harry', 'teenage', 'sensational', 'hard', 'full', 'few', 'inherently', 'bad', 'ugly', 'close', 'wide', 'old', 'little', 'western', 'little', 'friendly', 'particular', 'leon', 'wide', 'avid', 'close', 'reminiscent', 'vast', 'unyielding', 'sudden', 'ugly', 'other', 'tuco', 'untrustworthy', 'other', 'whole', 'wild', 'little', 'lone', 'little', 'little', 'bad', 'high', 'last', 'least', 'ugly', 'tricky', 'real', 'nearby', 'same', 'other', 'other', 'great', 'loud', 'silent', 'similar', 'famous', 'bad', 'ugly', 'ugly', 'grave', 'other', 'other', 'western', 'such', 'other', 'well', 'excruciating', 'first', 'bad', 'ugly', 'moral', 'thick', 'good', 'bad', 'low', 'real', 'distinct', 'good', 'exciting', 'lengthy', 'incessant', 'panoramic', 'vast', 'insignificant', 'tedious', 'able', 'furious', 'whirl', 'dead', 'bad', 'ugly', 'great', 'great'];-0.0733690476190476

368;TheFilmConnoisseur;"****excellent ***good **fair *poor the good when 'for a few dollars more' (which is superior to fistful of dollars) was released it was the turning point in the trilogy. clint eastwood and director sergio leone had turned this man with no name into there creation. giving him new characteristics and setting. after the success of that film they needed a back story to there creation. a prequel was made, possibly the first ever or the first successful prequel ever made. it is rare for a sequel to surpass the original and it is even rarer that the third one surpasses them all. this is how the notion that leone gets better with time started. i am one who strongly disagrees. not only is this leone's best picture but possibly the greatest film ever made! here the character of the man with no name ( or blondie as he is nicknamed by tuco) has an interesting origin. he is not the hero we met in the first two installments, he is conceivably a criminal. he journeys the hills as a bounty hunter, captures bandits and helps them escape so he could get more money in another town. one day he has the misfortune (or fortune) to capture the wrong bandit, tuco. 'such ingratitude after all the times i saved your life.' the bad 'i'll ask the questions!' lee van cleef made a career of playing villains. in 1965 he had the opportunity to play an hero in for a few dollars more, most likely his finest performance. here he proves why he made a career of playing a villain. he is a menacing, ruthless paid assassin who always seeks his job through. he is after bill carson who hid $200, 000 in gold coins somewhere and angel eyes is determined to find it. 'but you know the pity is that when i'm paid i always follow the job through.' the ugly 'i'll give you a good idea where you can put it.' the character of tuco, played perfectly by eli wallach is the man who steals the show. he is a bandit with 115 counties of crimes. he like blondie has the misfortune (or fortune) of meeting one another. his character is unique, not in a paul newman and robert redford type of unique but unique in the sense that he's a religious man. there is a fabulous scene in the film where tuco confronts his brother, who's a priest and they have an argument on how one had the choice of a being a priest or a bandit. that is one of the best scenes in the film because leone is showing us the portrait of life in those times. how being a poor immigrant left you with little or no opportunity. 'if you're gonna shoot, shoot don't talk!' the blue the yankees portrayed in this film are not like any other captured on film before. they symbolize america in the '60s. they are reluctant to fight yet they have no choice but because of it they are depressed and want this whole war to end and live in peace. the drunk general is such a great character because it shows how drinking is the only thing that has kept him alive, for a while that is. the grey since this film takes place in the west it is obvious that the confederates are the ones mostly depicted. they are shown as a weak and dying race. leone actually makes you feel sorry for them. like in the scene where wallace is beating up tuco and the young confederates soldiers are playing the story of the soldier. beautiful scene. 'more feeling!' the civil war to understand the civil war in this film you must understand leone's past. he grew up during mussolini's empire and world war ii. he is familiar with the tortures of war and you can see it here. the war is brutal, sad, and chaotic, something the generation of the '60s could relate with. in addition most of the soldiers are young and perhaps poor. another reality of war. the questions, the answers, and the showdown as the film progress clint eastwood slowly acquires his trademark outfit. the irony in it is that during the whole picture tuco is the star of the picture and then in that scene in the cemetery when eastwood first appears in his poncho he shows who's the real star of the movie. there for the first time we see the man with no name we fell in love with in the first two films. but how did he turn that way? the war, the war had a lasting impression on the man. at first he didn't seem very concerned but after witnessing the event for his own two eyes it has an impact on his life and he decides to use his talent for good instead of his selfish needs. the title, the good, the bad, and the ugly has become a cliche but there is meaning. the good and the bad are simple but the ugly has more meaning then meets the eye. we have a man who's good at heart and had the opportunity to be good in life but because of society and the way non-anglos were treated in those days he was forced into a life of crime. that's one of the reasons why blondie doesn't kill him at the end of the film. the partnership between blondie and tuco is humorous in the sense that we love there partnership and it is obvious that they enjoy one another but they still at the end screw each other up. film critic roger ebert once said that a real movie lover's favorite film was a film that reflected there own life. while i myself still haven't found that film this is the closest there is. hence why this is my favorite film of all-time and such an influential film in my life. it is a real shame that the hollywood community have underrated this film. just like leone's other projects. this deserved every oscar there is. the picture is outstanding, equally outstanding is the direction, writing, music, cinematography, costume, sound effects, editing, special effects, and above all the acting. especially from mr. wallach. it is great that moviegoers have discovered this masterpiece and have given it the respect it deserves. rating: 4 stars (****) ""you stinking son of a aaaahhhh!";3 July 2003;10;['fair', 'poor', 'good', 'few', 'more', 'superior', 'fistful', 'new', 'back', 'first', 'first', 'successful', 'prequel', 'rare', 'original', 'rare', 'third', 'well', 'good', 'great', 'interesting', 'first', 'more', 'wrong', 'such', 'bad', 'few', 'fine', 'menacing', 'ruthless', 'gold', 'determined', 'ugly', 'good', 'unique', 'unique', 'unique', 'religious', 'fabulous', 'tuco', 'good', 'poor', 'little', 'other', 'reluctant', 'depressed', 'whole', 'drunk', 'great', 'only', 'alive', 'obvious', 'weak', 'sorry', 'young', 'beautiful', 'more', 'civil', 'civil', 'familiar', 'brutal', 'sad', 'chaotic', 'most', 'young', 'poor', 'whole', 'real', 'first', 'first', 'lasting', 'concerned', 'own', 'good', 'selfish', 'bad', 'ugly', 'bad', 'simple', 'ugly', 'more', 'good', 'good', 'humorous', 'obvious', 'other', 'real', 'favorite', 'own', 'close', 'favorite', 'influential', 'real', 'other', 'outstanding', 'outstanding', 'special', 'great'];0.1350021377799155

373;ewarn-1;"when i was a kid, nobody liked westerns. our fathers had fought in the korean war, and the astronauts were racing in space. cowboys seemed old, dusty, and boring. then along came three guys to change all that. one was good, the other bad, the other ugly. or maybe they all had those three characteristics in them. but they arrived at one hell of a showdown, and it changed things. this is not just an action filled western, but a sweeping commentary on the american character, as witnessed by an objective outsider. his aim was true. by the mid 60s, the western formula, and perhaps the action film itself, had become too stale and conventional to evoke any enthusiastic response. leone gave us not just a new perspective on film violence, but for the first time a director blended the most fascinating elements of american history, both mythical and real, into a traditional western story. the storyline, involving three untitled men propelled by avarice into uncivilized territory, could serve as a fable for the expansion of the american frontier. against the sun-blasted background we see the elements that have shaped, in different ways, the essential american character: warfare, technology, weapons, hardened individualism. previous western films might have explored related themes, but never with the exciting visual style shown in this one. the characters are men we really have never seen before. they are enigmatic, inscrutable, and fascinating to look at. leone leaves their pasts unmarked so we can eagerly fill in their backgrounds on our own. as their journey in pursuit of lucre ends, we are presented with the best showdown in the history of the western. the quest, exciting as it was, culminates in one of the best endings in movie history. the score of course is famous in itself but welded to the fascinating visuals and characters it becomes one for the ages. amazing it took an italian director filming in spain to make the essential ""american"" western film. you don't like westerns? i urge you to try this and see things from an outsider's point of view. his aim was true.";14 February 2007;10;['korean', 'old', 'dusty', 'boring', 'good', 'other', 'bad', 'other', 'ugly', 'western', 'sweeping', 'american', 'objective', 'true', 'western', 'stale', 'conventional', 'enthusiastic', 'new', 'first', 'fascinating', 'american', 'mythical', 'real', 'traditional', 'western', 'untitled', 'uncivilized', 'different', 'essential', 'american', 'hardened', 'previous', 'western', 'related', 'exciting', 'visual', 'enigmatic', 'inscrutable', 'fascinating', 'own', 'good', 'western', 'exciting', 'good', 'famous', 'fascinating', 'amazing', 'italian', 'essential', 'american', 'western', 'true'];0.1005964405964405

379;tonynworah;"ask any nigerian movie fan his best western movie(in nigeria we call the genre the more unpretentious ""cowboy movie"") and nine out of ten will tell you without hesitation the good, the bad & the ugly. in a country where cowboy movies are at the bottom of ladder in the scale of movie genres, it is amazing that the good remains an evergreen classic in nigeria. but then, the good, the bad & the ugly is an amazing film and with each viewing, the film simply becomes better and better. the plot is a bit lacklustre and maybe a bit confusing, with countless other sub plots that may or may not drive the main narrative and is too long with paced out scenes. but despite all this-or maybe because of it-the film is a three hour spectacle of shameless thrills that will glue you to your seat. the film revolves around three crooks searching for $200,000 in stolen gold. it is not ""good guys against the bad guys"", but who will win among the bad guys. don't expect morality tales like dancing with wolves, shane or john wayne movies. all the protagonists are mainly selfish opportunistic greedy killers wanting to steal the proceeds of a heist by another bunch of killers. clint eastwood is ""the good"", an anti-hero, a crook who masquerades himself as a bounty hunter. he is the man with no name (nicknamed blondie by his mexican ally) who has his own code of honour. he does not hesitate to kill without mercy when threatened but is not a sadist. in fact, he shows little acts of kindness like when he shares his cigar with a dying confederate soldier. he does not talk much, using his eyes and his gun to do the talking for him. in all of eastwood's strong silent roles, i consider this his most riveting. lee van cleef ""the bad"", paradoxically named ""angeleyes"" is the opposite of clint. he is a gun for hire, a soldier of fortune(literally) and one ruthless bad ass. he relishes his killings and indulges in sadistic torture to get what he wants. in a brutahl scene, he kills two men who hired him to kill each other. one was a cripple with a family, the other a sick old man in his bed. cleef played this bad ass role with an aplomb that will always make him a powerful screen presence in all his movies. his menacing evil and ""don't mess with me"" attitude is obvious even when he is motionless. eli wallach in the role of ""tuco the ugly"" is not much better than angeleyes, except that angeleyes is more refined in his crimes. he is a mexican bandit whose list of crimes include robbery, murder, rape, and having sexual relations with a ""female member of a white race"". he is the most complex of the characters who oscillates between being blondie's friend/ally, and his deadliest enemy. eli wallah was born for this role. even though he has third billing, he is the most recognizable character and effortlessly stole every scene he was in with his garrulous comic antics. and that makes us perversely love him, even more than blondie. worthy of mention, is ennio morricone's score. check out the incredibly haunting score during tuco's mad dash in the cemetery or the mournful score in the prison camp. they were amazing but both pale to nothing in comparison to the film's incredible score in the credits. it will stick in your mind forever. it is easily the most recognizable film score in the world. sergio leone delivered a masterpiece and none of his films can hold water to it. in fact no western can be compared to leone's masterpiece. he captured the grit of that era like no mainstream hollywood western can achieve. the barren landscapes, the deserts, the bleak depressing environment, the hard characters with their lined faces and hard eyes. the gun duels are exaggerated but beautifully executed and the last triangle duel had a touch of spiritual poetry which is hypnotic. this film is stunning and remains one of my favourite film and definitely my favourite western.";8 March 2012;10;['nigerian', 'good', 'western', 'unpretentious', 'bad', 'ugly', 'cowboy', 'amazing', 'evergreen', 'bad', 'ugly', 'amazing', 'well', 'lacklustre', 'confusing', 'countless', 'other', 'main', 'long', 'shameless', 'good', 'bad', 'bad', 'selfish', 'opportunistic', 'greedy', 'anti', 'hero', 'mexican', 'own', 'little', 'confederate', 'much', 'strong', 'silent', 'riveting', 'bad', 'ruthless', 'bad', 'sadistic', 'other', 'other', 'sick', 'old', 'bad', 'powerful', 'obvious', 'motionless', 'ugly', 'well', 'refined', 'mexican', 'sexual', 'female', 'white', 'deadly', 'third', 'recognizable', 'garrulous', 'comic', 'more', 'worthy', 'mad', 'mournful', 'amazing', 'pale', 'incredible', 'recognizable', 'western', 'mainstream', 'bleak', 'depressing', 'hard', 'hard', 'exaggerated', 'last', 'spiritual', 'hypnotic', 'stunning', 'favourite', 'favourite'];-0.0852944862155388

384;ikizdevran-882-254684;"""the good, the bad and the ugly"" is the 3rd and the last film of sergio leone's dollars trilogy which is also known as the man with no name. it is one of the best western films of all time, in my opinion the best. after this film, clint eastwood began to be recognized as an international film star. the film opens with a very familiar theme song composed by ennio morricone. i have heard this soundtrack a lot of times in other films, commercials and games. this instrumental soundtrack is one of the most iconic scores in the film history. when this theme song is combined with the presence of clint eastwood, as blondie, it is even more meaningful. after the two films of the trilogy, i became familiar with sergio leone and his directing style. he uses extreme facial close-ups to express the feelings of a person without using conversations. he also uses long shots for the same purpose. just by looking at the face of the actor from up close, you get to understand how he feels. in his films you get to see a lot of silent but expressive scenes. take the last scene in the cemetery as an example. before shooting starts, camera moves from one face to another, from one pistol to another. this scene starts with full long body shots and ends with extreme close ups to the eyes. this takes more than 4 minutes, and creates one of the most iconic scene of the film. when i watch a film, i don't pay much attention to the technical details. i like to write about how a film makes me feel and why. but here, it was impossible not to talk about his directing style, which changes the course of the film completely. once again, the soundtracks including not only the theme song, are all over the story, which makes the audience feel the tense of a particular scene. sergio leone is one of the directors who uses soundtracks as a power over the story. with all the struggles during the filming of the trilogy, after ""the good, the bad and the ugly,"" he managed to put his name as one of the best directors of all times. the film was made with a budget of $1.2 million and grossed over $25 million. while i am writing this review, ""the good, the bad and the ugly"" stands on the 9th place in imdb's top 250 films of all times. the story is intense, the performances are amazing and the atmosphere is real. this film has everything that a film must have in order to be considered a masterpiece ""the good, the bad and the ugly"" opens with three different scenes, where we get to meet the ugly, the bad and the good respectively. all three scenes take around 30 minutes, and if i haven't counted wrong, a total of 9 people die, three per character. sergio leone uses first scenes of his films to introduce us the main characters of his story. he uses this storytelling technique in all his three films. by doing this, he prepares us to the real plot, and creates a credibility over his main characters. the role of the ugly, tuco, is played by eli wallach. at first, i found this choice surprising, and if i wouldn't have seen the actors, i would have named gian maria volonte, as the bad, clint eastwood as the good and lee van cleef as the ugly. but, in the end of the film, i have seen that the casting choices are exactly how they are supposed to be. tuco is the most distinctive character of the film and lee van cleef couldn't have performed well in this role. in the first two films, gian maria volonte was the main villain of the story. when you look at ""the good, the bad and the ugly,"" there is actually no villain in it, therefore it makes sense why he was left out. ""the good, the bad and the ugly"" has an easy plot. it is about three gunmen who go after 200k dollars buried in a cemetery. the story takes place during the civil war in america. even though the main characters have nothing to do with it, the story of ""the good, the bad and the ugly,"" evolves around the civil war. the adventures of these gunmen, on their journey to the cemetery, are interrupted a lot of times because of the war. in these scenes, sergio leone shows us the real effects of the war on people. destroyed towns, lost lives and killed people are focus points of the story. it is fascinating, how you get to see the realities of the american civil war, in an italian made film. from all points of views, ""the good, the bad and the ugly"" is a masterpiece which all cinema fans must see.";4 August 2018;8;['bad', 'ugly', 'last', 'good', 'western', 'good', 'international', 'familiar', 'other', 'instrumental', 'iconic', 'meaningful', 'familiar', 'extreme', 'facial', 'close', 'long', 'same', 'silent', 'expressive', 'last', 'full', 'long', 'extreme', 'close', 'more', 'iconic', 'much', 'technical', 'impossible', 'particular', 'bad', 'ugly', 'good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'top', 'intense', 'amazing', 'real', 'bad', 'ugly', 'different', 'ugly', 'bad', 'good', 'first', 'main', 'real', 'main', 'ugly', 'tuco', 'surprising', 'bad', 'good', 'ugly', 'distinctive', 'first', 'main', 'bad', 'ugly', 'bad', 'ugly', 'easy', 'civil', 'main', 'bad', 'ugly', 'civil', 'real', 'fascinating', 'american', 'civil', 'italian', 'bad', 'ugly'];-0.0608072916666666

392;MacBalthus;"3 hours of film are a lot, no matter what genre but especially for a western. there are two kinds of filling 3 hours: long, stylish scenes and lots of twists in the plot. this movie here has both. after watching it, i felt like i was on a roller-coaster. so much happens throughout, it is hard to remember every last bit of it, which doesn't mean you wouldn't feel it. i'm always in fever when tuco runs around on the cemetery, with morricone's unique music in the back. a truly haunting moment. it was a smart way leone let blondie develop. he's starting of as a great gunfighter and always shows a little bit of different sides coming up on his harsh surface. and in the end, he gets his poncho. what a moment! and it makes sense. after having seen all this, it is clear, why he is so cool in the other two dollars: this one here was just way much more of a challenge. lee van cleef does a terrific job, especially after having played the hard but good colonel in the movie before. it shows some great quality as an actor to create so much sympathy in one movie and so much horror in the next. eli wallach brings up a character, you can compare with jack sparrow. you never know, what he really is up to, but everything he does is a circus and you love to watch him being the greedy underdog of this trio. the plot is the greatest quality in this movie, if you ask me. so many twists, settings, side characters and events are unique in the western genre, probably in every one. it is impressive to compare once upon a time in the west and the good, the bad and the ugly. since leone was forced by the studio to make once upon according to the great success of the first three western movies, it is surprising that he didn't produce another one of his ""nameless"" tales but the epic itself within the westerns. when you don't know that, you could easily think the two movies were shot by different directors. i like once upon better, just because i felt more emotions watching it. but still, the good, the bad and the ugly is a terrific achievement. they had almost ten different languages being spoken on the set. the bridge was first blown to ribbons accidentally with no camera rolling. eastwood and leone had their conflicts. leone couldn't speak more english than ""look"" and act what he wanted. it must have been a mess. and yet, such a fine picture came out. it also wins the price for the most haunting melody ever created. people who haven't seen nor heard about the movie whistle the theme. i wouldn't know of any other piece of music being honored like this. maybe beethoven's 5.";23 December 2006;9;['long', 'stylish', 'hard', 'last', 'tuco', 'unique', 'smart', 'great', 'little', 'different', 'harsh', 'clear', 'cool', 'other', 'more', 'terrific', 'hard', 'good', 'great', 'much', 'much', 'next', 'greedy', 'great', 'many', 'unique', 'western', 'impressive', 'bad', 'ugly', 'great', 'first', 'western', 'surprising', 'epic', 'different', 'more', 'bad', 'ugly', 'terrific', 'different', 'english', 'fine', 'haunting', 'other'];0.1427529761904761

399;Flyer78;where do i start? good bad and ugly was such an awesome, awesome film. from the second it began, i was glued to the screen, continuously wondering exactly what would happen next. having watched it for the 2nd time last night, i am still unable to get this amazing piece of art out of my mind. there is no way possible that sergio leone is not the greatest director of all time. but enough of me rambling, let me give a reason for my madness..... this film has some of the best acting you will ever find from an allstar cast. clint eastwood returns in his role as the man with no name, or as he is referred to in this particular film, blondie, and he plays the role flawlessly, supplying lots of memorable quotes in the process. and then there is eli wallach playing the comical bandit called tuco. tuco is one of the most hilarious characters ever in movie-making, and there are plenty of scenes where he makes an absolute fool of himself, as well as making others look like idiots in a very funny manner. finally, there's lee van cleef playing the role of ruthless hit-man angel eyes. van cleef does superbly in getting the audience to really despise the character he plays because he obviously puts so much emotion into playing the merciless angel eyes, who doesn't hesitate to kill anyone.....for the right price, that is. but it has been proved numerous times that good acting alone will not make a movie a classic. and fortunately, leone's masterpiece features one of the most clever plots ever. the story revolves around gunslingers blondie, tuco, and angel eyes looking for a treasure of gold buried by confederate troops in a remote cemetery. but here's the interesting part- none of them are able to find the gold without one of the two others. see, each of the three men know a vital fact about the location of the gold that the others need in order to find it. tuco knows the name of the cemetery, blondie knows the name of the grave the gold is buried under, and angel eyes, like tuco, knows the name of the cemetery. with an innovative story like that, a director like sergio leone, and a stellar cast of actors like eastwood, wallach, and van cleef, you know ahead of time you are going to see something special. everything unfolds at such a smooth pace throughout the film, and there are lots of interesting twists that keep you guessing. but there are two things about this film that stand out to me, even above the acting and story. and those two things are the musical score done by ennio morricone and the ending climax of this film. i won't say anything other than they are two things that need to be heard/seen by everyone. awe-inspiring stuff. so going back to my original statement, sergio leone's the good, the bad, and the ugly is without a doubt the greatest film ever made. 10/10;28 July 2009;10;['good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'awesome', 'awesome', 'second', 'last', 'unable', 'amazing', 'possible', 'great', 'enough', 'good', 'particular', 'memorable', 'comical', 'hilarious', 'absolute', 'funny', 'ruthless', 'much', 'right', 'numerous', 'good', 'clever', 'confederate', 'remote', 'interesting', 'able', 'vital', 'innovative', 'stellar', 'special', 'smooth', 'interesting', 'musical', 'other', 'original', 'bad', 'ugly', 'great'];0.2006715506715506
400;Sonic_Ocean;what makes 'the good, the bad and the ugly' iconic ranges from many things such as ennio morricone's memorable score not only defining this movie, but spaghetti westerns, to its unforgettable scenes, depicting beauty and grit in the world created by sergio leone. watching the movie feels like listening to a long musical composition, watching it build and build into a heart pounding crescendo, at the same time basking in the scenes where time feels like it slows down so we could soak in the beauty that this ugly, fragile world has to offer. what i love about this film, is how it can be light-hearted and fun, yet still feel deep, heavy and contemplative at times. we don't get to know the characters at all (except a bit about tuco), but we get to know them through their actions, and we truly find out the nature of why these three characters have these titles of 'the good,' 'the bad,' and 'the ugly.' to see these characters interact is a treat to watch, but what captivated me about the film was the great clint eastwood and his performance at 'the man with no name' or 'blondie' as tuco would address him as. he is the definitive embodiment of the stoic, anti-hero with an air of mystery as to where he comes from and his motives, which is what kept me in suspense through out the movie. from his strategic thinking in outsmarting tuco, he is basically floating through a world of chaos, adapting to any unexpected messy situation these characters get thrown into. then, when we finally get to the ending, we don't know what will become of the characters and that unpredictability is what makes this one moment in the movie one of the most intense scenes in cinema. without spoiling anything, all i could say is that i felt the ending was clever in a way i didn't see coming at all. with a great setting, a great score, great performances and a simple, but very great story, this is a western film i highly recommend you should watch, if you have never watched any westerns before. on that note, this is not only a great western film, but a wonderful piece of art from sergio leone. from the films i've watched by him, everyone of those films possess that layer of depth to them that feels like that feeling of bliss in life that comes once in a blue moon. even with a film as dark as 'once upon a time in the west' or 'once upon a time in america,' leone still manages to emit a feeling of warmth through his stories, and with all its guns and grit, 'the good, the bad and the ugly' is pure beauty on film.;26 May 2013;10;['bad', 'ugly', 'iconic', 'many', 'such', 'memorable', 'unforgettable', 'long', 'musical', 'same', 'ugly', 'fragile', 'light', 'hearted', 'fun', 'deep', 'heavy', 'contemplative', 'bad', 'ugly', 'great', 'definitive', 'stoic', 'anti', 'strategic', 'unexpected', 'messy', 'intense', 'clever', 'great', 'great', 'great', 'great', 'western', 'great', 'western', 'wonderful', 'blue', 'dark', 'bad', 'ugly', 'pure'];0.1105820105820105

'the good, the bad and the ugly' (1966) is a very popular western about... you know what? i won't even summarize the plot for you. everybody needs to watch this classic by going in completely blind! let me talk about our 3 main actors. the ""good"": clint eastwood plays ""blondie"", a professional gunslinger trying to earn a few dollars. the ""bad"": lee van cleef plays the hitman ""angel eyes"" who doesn't mind going the dirty route when it comes to making money. the ""ugly"": eli wallach plays tuco who is a wanted outlaw. all 3 men have very different personalities, yet they share a common goal: making a ton of money! before i start talking about the specifics, i would like to clarify that my expectations for this film were enormous! i was expecting a specific type of western and i got something else. keep that in mind as you read my review. of course i will rewatch the film and if my thoughts change in any significant shape or form, i will let you know with an update. as someone who is a huge fan of 'for a few dollars more' (and literally calls it their favorite western of all time), it was especially hard for me to accept seeing lee van cleef play the bad guy. having said that, he did a wonderful job as the villain of the story! eli wallach did a really good job at capturing the behavior of someone who is desperate for money as well as revenge! he is a very unpredictable character since you never know what he is going to do next! finally our great western hero clint eastwood who is charismatic as always and seeing him smoke a cigar has still not worn off one bit! this is a film that will never get old! it will always prevail through the test of time! i really cannot see people ever discrediting it! 'the good, the bad and the ugly' might just be the most complex western in history! the thing about this film that really threw me off guard was that it isn't your traditional western film (which i was expecting), but instead it goes the extra mile and gives us a little history lesson for the time of the 'civil war'! at times, i did think that a few of the scenes were a tad bit long, but nothing too major. the most important thing is that i never got bored and instead my eyes were glued onto the screen in anticipation of what would happen next! i find it absolutely fascinating how this 3-hour-epic has managed to keep my attention at its highest level for such a long time! rarely any movie can do that! but this isn't like any other movie, this is a really special one! i would obviously be remissed if i didn't at least mention the unbelievably genius climax (the final 25 minutes of the film)! everything that happens during that climax is pure perfection! the music, the cinematography, the acting, the stakes, the insane level of tension! speaking of the music, ennio morricone perhaps gave us the greatest soundtrack he ever created! there are so many jaw-dropping musical moments in there that clearly dominate on-screen and leone lets the music shine in its pure and sheer excellence! morricone has the ability to make you feel uplifted, motivated or to make you feel really unsettled! there is a reason why i consider him one of the best musical composers, arguably the best, in history! his music will always live on forever in the same way that leone's movies will forever be relevant! i also find it really interesting that, out of all 3 'dollar' movies, 'the good, the bad and the ugly' is the most emotional film! i genuinely love how the audience has no idea what will happen next. this film is completely unpredictable! sure, you can take a guess at what might happen and you might even get lucky, but you do not see these things coming from a mile away like with a lot of other movies! overall, 'the good, the bad and the ugly' was a real game changer in the entire film industry. leone proved the world that you don't need to be an american or be a hollywood director to make a great film! you can make a great film from no matter where you are in the world! this film is long, yet well-paced, complex, yet comprehensible! it is rewatchable, iconic, beautiful and strong! an epic, grand masterpiece! 8/10";4 October 2020;8;['bad', 'ugly', 'third', 'final', 'few', 'more', 'bad', 'ugly', 'popular', 'western', 'blind', 'main', 'good', 'professional', 'few', 'bad', 'dirty', 'ugly', 'wanted', 'different', 'common', 'enormous', 'specific', 'western', 'significant', 'huge', 'few', 'more', 'favorite', 'hard', 'bad', 'wonderful', 'good', 'desperate', 'unpredictable', 'great', 'western', 'charismatic', 'old', 'bad', 'ugly', 'complex', 'western', 'traditional', 'western', 'extra', 'little', 'civil', 'few', 'major', 'important', 'bored', 'fascinating', 'high', 'long', 'other', 'special', 'least', 'final', 'pure', 'insane', 'great', 'many', 'musical', 'pure', 'sheer', 'uplifted', 'motivated', 'unsettled', 'good', 'musical', 'good', 'same', 'relevant', 'interesting', 'bad', 'ugly', 'emotional', 'unpredictable', 'lucky', 'other', 'bad', 'ugly', 'real', 'entire', 'american', 'great', 'great', 'long', 'complex', 'comprehensible', 'rewatchable', 'iconic', 'beautiful', 'strong', 'epic', 'grand'];0.0211560846560846

405;keuhkokala;"(may contain minor spoilers) the good, the bad and the ugly is just about as good as a movie, that's meant to be pure entertainment can be. the movie also contains a deeper message, concerning the cruelty of war and the value of the human life. although the small-budget film-making, like in the two previous movies of the dollars-trilogy, has its own attraction, director sergio leone really shows what he's made of this time. there are some epic war scenes, huge explosions and realistic sets, that leone no doubt could have been able to make with the minimal budget of a fistful of dollars. the movie is set sometime in the american civil war. as before, clint eastwood stars. he's the man with no name, which is this time named blondie. he still doesn't talk very much and he'll still do anything for a fistful of dollars. although he's namely the good he's not really a hero you can look up to. in fact he's only the least bad of the three main characters, who are all greedy and ruthless men, who are prepared to kill anyone who stands in their way. the ugly is blondie's best friend, partner in crime and also the worst enemy. he's the mexican bandit named tuco. eli wallach is wonderful as tuco, he almost steals the show from clint, being a cruel, stupid, vengeful, greedy, two-faced, but somehow also a very lovable character. the same can't be said about the bad, the assassin angel eyes, who is played by the greatest of western crooks, lee van cleef. he's a ruthless man, who'll not only kill a wanted man, but also his family and take their money when he only needed to get was one name. when he gets paid, he'll kill his employer, because he reckons, the previous body wanted to hire him to do so. angel eyes also works as a deputy leader of a southern pow camp. he's almost the complete opposite of col. mortimer from a few dollars more. they are on different sides of the war, but the southern colonel is a much more honorable man. the movie contains an anti-war message. although the civil war only seems to be the set-up for the gold hunt which covers the movie's plot, war is criticized all the time. the pow camp could as well be a concentration camp, as prisoners get beaten near death as the choir is forced to sing, so the voices of the beating couldn't be heard. you are put to the camp for simply rooting for the wrong side. also watching a big fight at the river, the usually very little-talking blondie notes that he's never seen men wasted so badly. later he even gives his coat and cigar to a dying soldier. he seems to be the only character in the movie capable of some sort of empathy. who would've thought! the modern action film directors should take a good look at the good, the bad and the ugly (some do, but to no avail). at least many movie villains should remember tuco's unforgettable line: ""when you got to shoot, shoot, don't talk!"" ***** (10/10 the top ten movies i've seen #4) the best part (major spoiler): many to choose from, but there's never been a dual scene quite like the one at the cemetery in the end. while ennio morricone's wonderful music plays, the camera goes around to show us the whole scenery and tuco's and angel eyes's emotions (blondie is so calm i can't really say the same about him). tuco is very scared, almost in panic and waits for the tension to trigger off. angel eyes, however is bubbling with hatred and greed. blondie is still squinting calmly as ever. never has a movie showed emotions so good without words.";14 December 2004;9;['minor', 'bad', 'ugly', 'good', 'pure', 'deep', 'human', 'small', 'previous', 'own', 'epic', 'huge', 'realistic', 'able', 'minimal', 'american', 'civil', 'good', 'least', 'bad', 'main', 'greedy', 'ruthless', 'prepared', 'ugly', 'good', 'bad', 'wonderful', 'tuco', 'cruel', 'stupid', 'vengeful', 'greedy', 'faced', 'lovable', 'same', 'bad', 'great', 'western', 'ruthless', 'wanted', 'previous', 'southern', 'complete', 'few', 'more', 'different', 'southern', 'honorable', 'anti', 'war', 'civil', 'gold', 'wrong', 'big', 'only', 'capable', 'modern', 'good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'least', 'many', 'unforgettable', 'top', 'good', 'major', 'many', 'dual', 'wonderful', 'whole', 'calm', 'same', 'scared', 'good'];0.0346130952380952
406;utku_kamil_ozen;after finally having watched this masterpiece, i felt the urge to write this review for young audiences like myself who have little or no interest in the western genre. because if you haven't seen one of those films before, there is an intimidating side of them, you just feel apprehensive. to an outsider, they all look similar, as if every image you have seen about any western film belongs to one single film. they look kind of boring. and now that i have seen this film, i can tell that it was a great experience. of course, i cannot make general statements about the genre just because i've seen one film. but seeing this broke my prejudice. and even if you feel like you can never enjoy western, you should make an exception to see this one. having said that, i must warn you it is a slow burner. first half hour was a challenge for me, but after that it started to get interesting. so i advice patience. i also want to say a few things about the film itself. i don't know a lot of actors from old films, this may be the first time i've watched eli wallach. he is great in this film. it was his performance that caught my attention for the film after the aforementioned difficult half hour. i can't tell the same thing about clint eastwood though. i don't know if it was part of the character or something, but his acting consisted of a lot of squinting, grimacing and whispering his dialog in a monotonous speech. story was the strongest part of the film, it reminded me of quentin tarantino's films, though it is not a coincidence, tarantino is known to be influenced by a lot of western films and he named many of them as his favorites. but the dialogue is not as powerful and interesting as tarantino's, though it is not a weakness of the film either. the main plot is complicated in the most positive way and there are a lot of details that touches your heart, like when tuco meets with his brother and the union captain that wanted to hear that bridge blown up before he passes. i don't think i should talk much about ennio morricone's music. it is just awesome and the soundtrack is so iconic it is recognized by almost everybody regardless whether they've seen the film or not. such a powerful music, it gives you an adrenaline rush. i am pretty sure i'll re-watch this film many times again. and because of this film, i might delve into other westerns. and i'll also look into eli wallach's filmography for i am much impressed with his performance. one last thing, a bizarre sensation came upon me during watching the film. i wonder if these films will get more and more irrelevant and even awkward perhaps for the future audiences. when some guy from the year, say, 3017 watches this, will he feel utterly perplexed? and not just because of what's happening, too. his frame of references will be so different than ours, he might not even get the simplest dialogues...;29 September 2017;10;['young', 'little', 'western', 'apprehensive', 'similar', 'western', 'single', 'great', 'general', 'western', 'slow', 'half', 'interesting', 'few', 'old', 'first', 'great', 'aforementioned', 'difficult', 'half', 'same', 'monotonous', 'strong', 'tarantino', 'western', 'many', 'powerful', 'interesting', 'main', 'positive', 'tuco', 'awesome', 'iconic', 'powerful', 'adrenaline', 'sure', 'many', 'other', 'impressed', 'last', 'bizarre', 'more', 'irrelevant', 'future', 'perplexed', 'different', 'simple'];0.1811907338693053

408;louiss;the absolute best western ever made. my admiration and pure love for this film grows as the years pass. i've seen this at least 50 perhaps more times and never tire of it. i love red river, the searchers and the wild bunch but as great as they all are they're a distant second. to start with the score is mesmerizing haunting and beautiful. this film is funny, sentimental and very unique in its style and mood. clint eastwood and lee van cleef are the coolest antagonists ever matched in cinema however it is eli walach who steels the film in a very much underrated unforgettable performance. like all of sergio leone films there is a very thin line that occasionally is crossed on both sides of good and evil. tuco ' walach ' is the center of three of the most greedy ruthless characters you will ever see yet you care about him and feel his pain when he is scorned by his brother for the path he has taken in his life. only in the extended italian version does angel eyes ' cleef ' show any humanity as he enters a confederate hideout and displays compassion for badly wounded soldiers otherwise he is a bloodthirsty killer. if blondie ' eastwod ' is truly good were all going to heaven. it's not only a great western but it is my favorite civil war film as well. aside from the spanish terrain the costumes, uniforms, buildings and weapons are the most historically accurate i've ever seen on film. leone does a great job of creating the look and mood of the time even better than any american production. its beyond my comprehension how this film was produced for only a million dollars of which 250k went to clint. if there is anyone left out there in the world that has not had the pleasure of seeing it i envy you the thrill of seeing it for the first time. below are spoilders of my favorite scenes in the film. the order does not represent preference. angel eyes riding at the opening of the film & morricone's background score. the announcing of crimes as tuco is about to be hung ( hysterical ) done twice tuco robs a gun shop (hysterical) if you're going to shoot, shoot don't talk!

421;DemonKiki;"the beginning of the film is the vast desert. the three cowboys are silent and close to each other. the lens is pulled very close, and it is basically a close-up of the face. this distance is uncomfortable and produces a sense of depression. there are no lines here, only background sounds, rendering a strong tension, a precursor to the war. a large number of close-up close-ups are one of the features of this film. the director intends to highlight the character's character through body language and expression close-ups. from the beginning to 10:37 seconds, there is no line at all, i thought it was a color silent film. this shooting technique that only uses music, body language and expression is full of ritual and a little stage drama feeling (here i am also picking up teeth). ""the ugly"", ""the bad"" and ""the good"" characters appeared on the side with subtitles. this is also very classic in the history of movies. there are no lines in early movies. when the characters and plots are not rich enough , the director needs to add subtitles in the post-editing to illustrate the character identity and enrich the character image; when he was a child, he often saw it in the martial arts movies that watched the shaw brothers movie. in this audio film, we already know the characters (the director used a large amount of ink to describe the three people). why should we use subtitles to show their identity? this way of emphasizing precisely expresses the sense of ritual. it can be said that in this rough ore-like western film, there is a hint of literary art. cross-cutting is another major feature of the film. when ""the ugly"" took three little brothers to find ""the good"" revenge: the army stepping outside the house, the cowboy who quietly went upstairs, the ""the ""good"", in fact, these three things happen at the same time, the film advances the plot through the conversion of three scenes. another example is the climax of the film. at the end, the three men confront each other. the camera continuously switches between the faces of the three people, and then the switching speed becomes faster and faster. this single and pure expression is now rarely seen in the film. from the simplification, now seeing this pure thing is rather exciting.";18 April 2020;8;['vast', 'silent', 'close', 'other', 'close', 'uncomfortable', 'strong', 'large', 'close', 'close', 'close', 'silent', 'full', 'ritual', 'little', 'ugly', 'bad', 'good', 'classic', 'early', 'rich', 'martial', 'audio', 'large', 'rough', 'like', 'western', 'literary', 'cross', 'major', 'ugly', 'little', 'good', 'good', 'same', 'other', 'fast', 'single', 'pure', 'pure', 'exciting'];0.0499458874458874

425;Kynde;what can i say. this is my favorite movie of all time. there is no contest. i still remember the first time i saw this masterpiece. i was about 15 years old, and it was on tv one night. i sat down ready to watch, and then there where a technical problem, and a 10 minute delay. but i stayed up and waited, and that was my luck. because the music, the pictures, the slow pace, the good, the bad and the ugly, sergio leone's direction and the fantastic story just swept my of my feet. i usually say that the shawshank redemption is the best movie made in the last 20 years. there are several people who will agree with me on that. luckily that doesn't conflict with my firm belief, that there will never come a movie that can compete with this one. i know many will agree on this, but certainly not as many as with the redemption. there is nothing wrong with this movie. everyone is cool, snake eyes is evil, and the whole thing is wound perfectly together under leone's direction with the fantastic music by ennio morricone. the only reason that i haven't written a comment before, is that i was sure that i would never be able to write good enough to express the way i feel for this fantastic movie. i'm still sure that i can't, but now i gave it a try. i hope that they one day will show it in a cinema close by, so i can get the ultimate experience. because this movie was supposed to be watched at the big screen, and i long for once again to hear the ugly's final scream turn into the first tone of the main theme, and just let the music take me away...

445;vgamerdc;"the good, the bad and the ugly is the greatest spaghetti western ever made, and may just possibly be the greatest western ever made. it is a perfect film, and would easily win a fight against the godfather. if you look up ""perfect"" in the dictionary, you first see meryl streep's oscar nomination record, then the good, the bad and the ugly. but what could possibly be so good about this western? the film begins with the most jarring cinematography i have ever seen to start a film. after the intro theme, this man, elam, pops his head into the screen. this not only sets up the rest of the film's cinematography, with the camera either super close or super far away, but also gives us a face to remember, as in an hour and a half or so we will meet this character again. in this scene we meet the ugly. later the bad. then the good. this contrasts from the title, the good, the bad and the ugly, as we show the characters in the opposite order from which we may expect. the ugly runs off after attacking elam and two other outlaws. the we turn to an arid section of the desert where we meet angel eyes. we know that he's up to no good as everyone nearby quickly hides. except for this guy, who keeps eating his soup. this probably because he knows its his last meal. we learn that angel eyes is looking for a man by the name of bill carson. he is searching for carson because there is a lot of money behind his name, and because he was hired to help baker, the man who hired angel eyes to take out this soup man. however, by the end of the meal, we have not only set up an objective, but also some character development. soup man knows that he is going to die, but pays angel eyes to kill the man who paid to kill him. angel eyes accepts the job, and the cash, but still kills soup man as, ""once i'm paid, i always see the job through."" he goes through with his new job kills baker, the man who hired him originally. this shows that although angel eyes is the bad he has honor. if the ugly were to be in angel eyes' situation he would have taken the money from soup man and not have gone through with the job. so now we have to think. who is the better man, a scoundrel or the bad? finally we meet the good. we find out that he is working with the ugly and that the two are con men. what they do is this: the good turns in the ugly for a reward. he takes the money and then frees the ugly. then they split the cost and repeat. now we must once again start to question morals here. the good is not literally ""good,"" as he does bad things. however, deep down he has a heart of good and in the end will usually choose the wiser, more moral route than the other characters we meet. one thing i love about this film is how even though there are three separate characters doing three separate things--the good and the ugly eventually split off--they all coordinate with each other in the end. one thing that happens in the beginning of the film at one location may come back to haunt certain characters later in the film at a completely different location. let's take elam for instance. in the very beginning of the film he and his two partners are shot by the ugly. then two whole hours later elam find the ugly and tries to kill him. this doesn't work out too well as the ugly apparently bathes with his gun. other moments like this occur throughout the film which adds realism to the story. the most critical point of joining these three together by chance is when the plot is revealed to our trio. we already know that the bad is after a certain amount of gold, but the good and the ugly don't know about this gold or bill carson until an hour into the film and the only reason this happens if because of great character development. see after the good has left the ugly in the desert to die, the ugly finds the good and gives him the same punishment. whilst doing so we begin the absolutely hate the ugly as he torments the good. while in the desert they find bill carson, the man who the bad is looking for. the ugly is told the location of where the treasure is hidden, a cemetery. the good is told the name of the grave. now the tables have turned as the ugly must keep the good alive in order to find the treasure. shortly after the bad, who by the way is a army captain, finds the two and the ugly poses as bill carson. soon the bad tortures the ugly and we once again question our thinking. we saw the ugly earlier being just awful to the good but now we are sympathizing toward him because of the bad. from here i will reveal no more of the plot, as this is a movie you need to see and i do not want to have it spoiled for you. the good, the bad and the ugly is a masterpiece. not only is it a brilliant western but also a film. it has an outstanding plot, cinematography, acting, music, and directing. for all of these reasons i give the good, the bad and the ugly a 10 out of 10.";6 December 2014;10;['bad', 'ugly', 'great', 'western', 'great', 'western', 'perfect', 'perfect', 'oscar', 'bad', 'ugly', 'good', 'western', 'jarring', 'close', 'ugly', 'bad', 'bad', 'ugly', 'opposite', 'ugly', 'other', 'arid', 'good', 'last', 'new', 'bad', 'ugly', 'well', 'bad', 'ugly', 'good', 'ugly', 'good', 'bad', 'good', 'wise', 'more', 'moral', 'other', 'separate', 'separate', 'good', 'ugly', 'other', 'certain', 'different', 'very', 'ugly', 'whole', 'ugly', 'ugly', 'other', 'critical', 'bad', 'certain', 'good', 'ugly', 'only', 'great', 'ugly', 'ugly', 'same', 'ugly', 'bad', 'ugly', 'ugly', 'good', 'alive', 'bad', 'ugly', 'bad', 'ugly', 'ugly', 'early', 'awful', 'good', 'bad', 'more', 'bad', 'ugly', 'brilliant', 'western', 'outstanding', 'bad', 'ugly'];-0.1646803196803196

447;polos_are_minty;"the good: there is a lot about this film which is absolutely 10/10. the film is very enjoyable. from what i remember of the last time i saw it, which was in french with english subs, i enjoyed it a hell of a lot more. one of the key parts of what made the film entertaining was the score. 99 times out of 100 it fitted the scene in question perfectly, and added to the feeling of the moment perfectly. the camera work was actually surprisingly good too, the use of cameras created tension and build up with out the use of massivley expensive special effects. the one particular scene which i feel sums up the film is the amazing showdown scene in the cemetry. the use of music, cameras and the brilliant acting of our three leads. the scene is awesome, it keeps your eyes stuck to the screen and makes you feel a part of what's taking place. even if you've seen the picture before and know what's going to happen, you still think it could turn out differently... that is the brilliance of the film. the bad: whilst there is a lot of good in the film there are a number of things which dampen the film for me. one of which is the lack of details or explanation to a lot of situations which occour. like one minute the leads are in one place, and the scene changes and they are in a completely different situation several months later with no intervening details. the ugly; again there is little which is awful about the film. i would moan about the length, but i feel this is a touch hypocritical, considering i have moaned about lack of details. what i will say though is, some of the film could be used to better effect in advancing the plot. it does feel at times as if were stuck in a permanent rut which the film struggles to pull ou of. overall the film is very good, and its positives far outweigh any negativity in the film. it's fun, a bit silly, and different from the majority of westerns in existence. so i'm unsure where this film lies in terms of score, somewhere between a 7 or an 8. i believe i'm going to give it the benefit of the doubt, having read what i have just written 8 seems the fairer score. 8/10";28 March 2010;8;['enjoyable', 'last', 'english', 'more', 'key', 'good', 'massivley', 'expensive', 'special', 'particular', 'amazing', 'brilliant', 'awesome', 'bad', 'different', 'several', 'ugly', 'little', 'awful', 'hypocritical', 'well', 'permanent', 'good', 'fun', 'silly', 'different', 'unsure', 'fair'];0.1233178053830228

457;Cherubin;"i saw ""the good, the bad, and the ugly"" when i was still in my early teens and didn't like it much then. i thought it was like an action movie but without the comforting elements usually associated with action movies like moral clarity and extremely spectacular fight scenes. however, recently, i saw it again on video and liked it for this exact same reason and more. the movie begins with a credit sequence of gun shots, grainy photos from the movie, and great music by ennio morricone that already tells you to expect a trip that's exciting and fun. then it rushes straight into a set of fight scenes which introduce the three main characters very dramatically (complete with titles to let you know which adjective in the title each character represents). each of these characters is a morally flawed person who makes a living off of death. the ""bad"" angel eyes makes his living as a soldier and a mercenary. the ""good"" blondie makes his living by making a travesty of hangings by always freeing the convicted men he turns in for reward money just before the rope should kill them. his ""goodness"" is only relative. the ""ugly"" tuco basically makes his living any way he can and his list of crimes is absurdly varied (ranging from all kinds of violence to statutory rape). he is a true opportunist without overriding morals but not entirely without a conscience. played by eli wallach, tuco actually steals the show from his 2 more famous costars because while they are almost superhuman in their skills, he is strikingly human in all his flaws. all three of these men, on individual terms, eventually come to know of a fortune buried in a graveyard and constantly keep fighting each other for knowledge of its exact location since each man only knows a different hint of where it is hidden and not the whole story. while such a plot does not seem too great, sergio leone choreographs every scene (violent or otherwise)to make it as suspenseful and expertly made as possible. the film also gets a lot of its entertainment value from tarantinoishly holding nothing sacred. the three heroes scheme against other characters with a joyfully effortless malevolence, and not even the american civil war is held sacred as the men try to manipulate the ""senseless"" conflict full of hopelessly drunken soldiers to make their quest for the treasure easier. the result of all this is that although ""the good, the bad, and the ugly"" is more than 3 hours long, there is never a dull moment, making it seem about an hour or so shorter than it actually is. what's most important, though, is that it is a thinking person's action movie which unpretentiously demonstrates the absurdity of real life and helps us to laugh at it. if there is such a thing as a perfect western, this is the one. 10 stars out of 10 !";15 November 2001;10;['bad', 'ugly', 'early', 'comforting', 'moral', 'spectacular', 'exact', 'same', 'more', 'grainy', 'great', 'exciting', 'fun', 'main', 'complete', 'flawed', 'bad', 'good', 'relative', 'ugly', 'varied', 'statutory', 'true', 'famous', 'superhuman', 'human', 'individual', 'other', 'exact', 'different', 'whole', 'great', 'violent', 'suspenseful', 'possible', 'sacred', 'other', 'american', 'civil', 'sacred', 'senseless', 'full', 'drunken', 'easy', 'bad', 'ugly', 'more', 'dull', 'short', 'important', 'real', 'perfect'];0.0623983739837398

464;Dillypogo;once every few years, a movie pops up that thousands or maybe even millions consider to be one of the best films ever made. the good, the bad and the ugly is definitely one of those few. blondie (clint eastwood), tuco (eli wallach) and angel eyes (lee van cleef) are three men who are in search of gold coins that are buried in a cemetery. however, each man only knows a certain amount of information as to where the gold is and are therefore dependent on each other. the good, the bad and the ugly is an incredibly suspenseful movie and will have you on the edge of your seat throughout. the action scenes are top-notch and really kick in the tension. the famous showdown at the cemetery seriously had me guessing as to what the hell was going to happen to the point of being wide-eyed and i'm sure that it's the most suspenseful scene in cinema history. although clint eastwood gives an excellent performance as blondie, it's eli wallach who shines as tuco. the audience has a strange, ever-changing relationship with his character. at some points (mainly early on) we hate his guts and at other points we love him and can't get enough of him. he actually had me laughing quite a few times such as when he takes a desperate but brilliant measure to break free from his handcuffs. i won't ruin it for you, but it involves a train. even if you haven't seen the movie, you will recognise its theme tune. ennio morricone's music is one of the best things about the good, the bad and the ugly and its theme tune is certainly among the greatest of all time. the thing that amazed me about the film is that it keeps you entertained and interested throughout its three hour length. films this long tend to get boring after a while and you eventually just lose interest, but tgtbatu will make you ask for more. anyway, more to love. i haven't seen the movie's predecessors a fistful of dollars and for a few dollars more. i've heard good things about them, but i have to say that it would take a lot for them to be better than this cinematic masterpiece. the good, the bad and the ugly is one of the best movies ever made and is also one of my favourite films. i give it 10/10.;27 August 2008;10;['few', 'good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'few', 'certain', 'dependent', 'other', 'bad', 'ugly', 'suspenseful', 'top', 'famous', 'eyed', 'sure', 'suspenseful', 'excellent', 'tuco', 'strange', 'other', 'enough', 'few', 'such', 'desperate', 'brilliant', 'free', 'good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'great', 'entertained', 'interested', 'long', 'more', 'more', 'few', 'more', 'good', 'well', 'cinematic', 'bad', 'ugly', 'good', 'favourite'];0.0530075187969924

473;ed_zeppelin;"although i had wanted to see sergio leone's dollars trilogy for a long time, it was the ""cinematically perfect"" quote from quentin tarantino on the front of the box that got me to shell out for the new special edition dvd (in the uk) of the good, the bad and the ugly. and i can tell you now-tarantino wasn't wrong! a fistful of dollars and for a few dollars more are excellent films in their own right, but the good, the bad and the ugly is more than just an excellent film-it is a major artistic achievement. the reasons for this permeate every aspect of the film. starting with the obvious, the acting is wonderful, both on the parts of the actors themselves and also the voice artists. clint eastwood has come under some criticism for his supposedly ""wooden"" portrayal of the man with no name, but the character description is of a laconic, taciturn mystery man and there's only so much you can do with that. lee van cleef is one of the coolest and scariest villains of all time, while eli wallach's ""lovable rogue"" portrayal of the mexican bandit tuco makes a welcome change from the ""psychopathic killer"" that gian maria volonte had played in the two prequels. special mention at this point goes to the voice artist used to dub the scenes starring lee van cleef that weren't dubbed while he was still alive, having been added for the special edition. he gets the voice absolutely spot on. also of note is the alcoholic union captain who strikes the perfect balance between wry humour and despair. the cinematography is breathtaking. leone's trademark style was to mix extreme close ups with extreme long shots, which is taken to a spectacular extreme here and gives the film a huge sense of scale. the very first shot of the film, in fact, is both a close up and a long shot at the same time. the faces leone chooses to zoom in on are, shall we say, interesting to look at, as well. while the build up to scenes of violence is long and intense, the violence itself is for the most part short and sharp. the film is therefore extremely tense. the one extended scene of violence, tuco's torture, is transformed by the juxtaposition of the orchestra playing a slow lament outside-the sight of the young musician crying in the knowledge of what is happening behind closed doors is a haunting moment. the rather flashy cinematography comes to a head at the film's climax in the graveyard, culminating in the single most perfect shot in cinema history. i won't reveal it as i loathe spoilers, but it's there. good scenes are made better by a wonderful score by the ever-dependable ennio morricone. the rousing 'ecstasy of gold' transforms tuco's sprint through the graveyard into a scene so beautiful it hurts, and 'the trio' does the same for the climax. as for the title theme...well, everyone's heard it so i won't waste time talking about it, except to say that even if you thought you hated it you'll end up loving it. ennio morricone stated that he tried to reflect the film's ""larger-than-life"" quality. indeed, there are some moments that are somewhat surreal. these range from the obvious (""the good"", ""the bad"" and ""the ugly"" appearing in brightly coloured letters next to the characters' faces) to the subtle (the insane fight over the bridge and the state of the soldiers). the film is at the same time unreal and grittily realistic, to great effect. several questions have been asked about the film. firstly, there is the question of whether or not clint eastwood plays the same character throughout all three films. i say no: looking at it like that causes continuity problems. plus, if eastwood is the same character in all three films, then what about the other actors who appeared in the other films like lee van cleef, luigi pistilli and especially mario brega, who dies in all three films? ""the man with no name"" is a marketing exercise, post-modernism before the term was invented. one thing i do agree with is the softening of eastwood's character-although you have to do more than play with a kitten to come across as a goodie in my book, the tending to a dying soldier and the famous quotation ""never seen so many men wasted so badly"" make blondie much more human than either joe or monco. also, some have said that the film is a christian allegory. there are scenes to support this, such as the prisoner being made to carry his coffin to his place of execution, but these scenes are unconnected both to each other and to the main plot and thus this claim is a somewhat dubious one. the film has entered my top ten at number two, not quite dislodging pulp fiction. nevertheless, it is a beautiful piece of work and anyone who worked on it should feel justly proud. if you don't believe me, believe quentin tarantino.";2 June 2004;10;['long', 'perfect', 'new', 'special', 'bad', 'ugly', 'wrong', 'few', 'excellent', 'own', 'bad', 'ugly', 'more', 'excellent', 'major', 'artistic', 'obvious', 'wonderful', 'wooden', 'laconic', 'taciturn', 'cool', 'scary', 'lovable', 'welcome', 'psychopathic', 'special', 'alive', 'special', 'alcoholic', 'perfect', 'extreme', 'close', 'extreme', 'long', 'spectacular', 'huge', 'first', 'close', 'long', 'same', 'interesting', 'long', 'intense', 'most', 'short', 'sharp', 'tense', 'extended', 'slow', 'young', 'closed', 'flashy', 'single', 'perfect', 'good', 'well', 'wonderful', 'dependable', 'beautiful', 'same', 'large', 'surreal', 'obvious', 'good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'coloured', 'subtle', 'same', 'realistic', 'great', 'several', 'same', 'same', 'other', 'other', 'post', 'more', 'famous', 'many', 'human', 'christian', 'such', 'unconnected', 'other', 'main', 'dubious', 'top', 'beautiful', 'proud', 'tarantino'];0.1678879664639158

491;notevenwordshere;"for the uninitiated, ""spaghetti western"" is the nickname given to a series of films by emergent directors who originated from italy after world war ii. also, they were westerns. but there's nothing distinctly italian about spaghetti westerns... except maybe the flair for spectacular overacting. as a genre, it reached its peak in the mid-60s, even though it was still relatively young at the time. today it's misunderstood, made fun of, or loved. which is okay: that makes it like just about every other genre of film, thus validating its cultural significance. none of the spaghetti westerns are more significant, though, than sergio leone's. his man with no name trilogy is much beleaguered and loved today, as is the underwhelming once upon a time in the west, a film most memorable for featuring henry fonda as a villain. but of the trilogy, the good, the bad, and the ugly -- the third installment that is actually the most basic of the three -- is something miraculous. the movie's tagline was ""for three men, the civil war wasn't hell -- it was practice!"" while that may seem like a silly tagline, the movie is not: the good, the bad, and the ugly, dr. strangelove, and pulp fiction each go down in my book as the greatest cool movies of all time. but you may be asking: how does a western, shot in spain with an entire cast speaking only spanish except for the principle three stars, directed by an italian with a fetish for the civil war, with hardly any dialogue and a plot with more holes in it than the fishnet your local deli makes its employees wear -- well, how does that work? quite simply... i don't know. i just know that the good, the bad, and the ugly is one of the best times i've ever had watching a movie. the plot revolves around $200,000 in gold coins. blondie (clint eastwood, and ""the good"" in the title) is after it, as are angel eyes (lee van cleef, ""the bad"") and tuco (eli wallach, ""the ugly""). that's the plot. yeah, really. sergio leone is famous for his camera direction, his quick cut close-ups with alternating wide shots. here is no different. in fact, it's remarkable to note how few regular shots are used -- or, if they are more common than i perceived, how well the close-ups and wide shots are executed so as to draw attention to themselves. equally famous is the way in which leone could drag out a showdown. while nothing in this film quite matches the incredible 15-minute standoff from once upon a time in the west, it is still fun to watch the final sequence, as the three square off to see who would live long enough to find the gold coins. but more than these trademarks -- how about that score? ennio morricone, whose work is vastly under-appreciated and is pigeonholed too easily, created a theme here that is simultaneously catchy, memorable, and chilling. so maybe that's it. what makes the good, the bad, and the ugly work is the expressive combination of the genius of each individual, wildly-varying ingredient of this pasta gumbo. it looks awful on paper, but, heh, so did the white album, and we all know how that turned out.";29 August 2008;10;['uninitiated', 'western', 'emergent', 'italian', 'spectacular', 'young', 'okay', 'other', 'cultural', 'significant', 'beleaguered', 'memorable', 'bad', 'ugly', 'third', 'basic', 'miraculous', 'civil', 'silly', 'bad', 'ugly', 'great', 'cool', 'western', 'entire', 'spanish', 'principle', 'civil', 'more', 'local', 'bad', 'ugly', 'good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'famous', 'quick', 'close', 'wide', 'different', 'remarkable', 'few', 'regular', 'common', 'close', 'wide', 'famous', 'incredible', 'fun', 'final', 'more', 'catchy', 'memorable', 'chilling', 'bad', 'ugly', 'expressive', 'individual', 'awful', 'white'];-0.0043333333333333

498;deadclowncollege;"sergio leone's 1966 sprawling western epic the good, the bad, and the ugly is, to me, undeniably epic. people define epic in all sorts of ways: it can mean it's ambitious, it can mean its running length is long, it can mean it's a visual spectacle, it can mean its anticlimactic, etc. and although i think the good, the bad, and the ugly are all those things, that's not why it's epic to me. for a movie to be epic to me, it has to not only be ambitious, but pay off greatly; so great that after the film, i wish i could've been in the mind of that filmmaker when they thought up that film. and imperfect as it can be, the good, the bad, and the ugly is certainly that. the good is clint eastwood, a nameless drifter who goes by the name blondie. i like him because he's certainly cool, but no to the point of ridiculousness. the good is pursued by the ugly (eli wallach), a greedy bandit who seeks revenge on blondie for leaving him out to hang dry. however, his motives eventually change when blondie tells him he has been told by a man the graveyard that holds enough gold to last someone for the rest of their lives. eli wallach does a superlative job in disgusting us with his character, only letting his human side spill out in a confrontation with his priest brother. the bad (lee van cleef) is also aware of the money, but only blondie supposedly knows where the gold is hiding. lee van cleef doesn't get much time to be more than the ""bad guy"", but he's ably menacing. ""the man with no name"" trilogy to which the good, the bad, and the ugly belongs is considered the seeds of the spaghetti western genre, and it also marks a beginning of less admirable western heroes. while the good is still likable and we root for him, his motive, like the bad and the ugly, is the gold. he isn't the old western hero who stands up for the woman and throws material possessions away. clint eastwood will not go to the lengths of greed the bad and ugly sink to, but it's not like he doesn't want the gold. sergio leone often takes the western out of its conventional definition over the nearly three-hour length of the film by often going in new places. although the first half-hour or so is slow (the biggest flaw of the film), it quickly picks up after that, with the ugly dragging blondie across the desert, visits to a church and a civil war prison camp, and on the front lines of a civil war battle. it all leads up to the final three-way shootout, which manages to still stay tense by some well-handled editing that cuts rapidly to suspicious eyes and hands nearing pistols. it's a great ending, and certainly one of the coolest of all time. also worth noting is ennio morricone's score. the opening theme is still classic even after thirty-eight years have gone by, and ""ecstasy of gold"" (the song playing as the ugly runs across the cemetery searching frantically for the grave) is nothing short of swelling. the whole score plays like a tumbleweed rolling across a sandy town.";13 March 2005;9;['western', 'bad', 'ugly', 'epic', 'epic', 'ambitious', 'long', 'visual', 'bad', 'ugly', 'epic', 'epic', 'ambitious', 'great', 'bad', 'ugly', 'cool', 'ugly', 'greedy', 'enough', 'superlative', 'human', 'bad', 'aware', 'much', 'more', 'bad', 'menacing', 'bad', 'ugly', 'western', 'admirable', 'western', 'likable', 'bad', 'ugly', 'old', 'western', 'bad', 'ugly', 'western', 'conventional', 'new', 'first', 'half', 'slow', 'big', 'ugly', 'civil', 'front', 'civil', 'final', 'tense', 'suspicious', 'great', 'cool', 'worth', 'classic', 'ugly', 'short', 'whole', 'tumbleweed', 'sandy'];-0.1564118271665441

501;AgentDice;everything about this film is brilliant. the directing, characters, acting, story and the theme score is excellent. the best western i have ever seen. a three hour journey of excitement that leads you to the long awaited and explosive climax. i can honestly say that the last twenty minutes or so of this film is the best twenty minutes of film i have ever seen. absolutely phenomenal. sergio leone's directing with the three leading actors makes this one of the best films i have ever seen... perhaps the best. actually yes, this is my favorite movie of all time and i don't see that ever changing. what makes 'the good, the bad and the ugly' iconic ranges from many things such as ennio morricone's memorable score not only defining this movie, but spaghetti westerns, to its unforgettable scenes, depicting beauty and grit in the world created by sergio leone. watching the movie feels like listening to a long musical composition, watching it build and build into a heart pounding crescendo, at the same time basking in the scenes where time feels like it slows down so we could soak in the beauty that this ugly, fragile world has to offer. what i love about this film, is how it can be light-hearted and fun, yet still feel deep, heavy and contemplative at times. we don't get to know the characters at all (except a bit about tuco), but we get to know them through their actions, and we truly find out the nature of why these three characters have these titles of 'the good,' 'the bad,' and 'the ugly.' to see these characters interact is a treat to watch, but what captivated me about the film was the great clint eastwood and his performance at 'the man with no name' or 'blondie' as tuco would address him as. he is the definitive embodiment of the stoic, anti-hero with an air of mystery as to where he comes from and his motives, which is what kept me in suspense through out the movie. from his strategic thinking in outsmarting tuco, he is basically floating through a world of chaos, adapting to any unexpected messy situation these characters get thrown into. then, when we finally get to the ending, we don't know what will become of the characters and that unpredictability is what makes this one moment in the movie one of the most intense scenes in cinema. without spoiling anything, all i could say is that i felt the ending was clever in a way i didn't see coming at all. with a great setting, a great score, great performances and a simple, but very great story, this is a western film i highly recommend you should watch, if you have never watched any westerns before. on that note, this is not only a great western film, but a wonderful piece of art from sergio leone. from the films i've watched by him, everyone of those films possess that layer of depth to them that feels like that feeling of bliss in life that comes once in a blue moon. even with a film as dark as 'once upon a time in the west' or 'once upon a time in america,' leone still manages to emit a feeling of warmth through his stories, and with all its guns and grit, 'the good, the bad and the ugly' is pure beauty on film.;1 April 2014;10;['brilliant', 'excellent', 'good', 'western', 'explosive', 'last', 'good', 'phenomenal', 'good', 'good', 'favorite', 'bad', 'ugly', 'iconic', 'many', 'such', 'memorable', 'unforgettable', 'long', 'musical', 'same', 'ugly', 'fragile', 'light', 'hearted', 'fun', 'deep', 'heavy', 'contemplative', 'bad', 'ugly', 'great', 'definitive', 'stoic', 'anti', 'strategic', 'unexpected', 'messy', 'intense', 'clever', 'great', 'great', 'great', 'great', 'western', 'great', 'western', 'wonderful', 'blue', 'dark', 'bad', 'ugly', 'pure'];0.2104554865424431

503;errol1909;the good the bad and the ugly is one of the most overrated movies ever made. it's considered a classic because of ennio morricone iconic theme and because it has clint eastwood in it. the plot what plot. there is not consistent plot. only action scenes upon action scenes pieced together to create a three hour long bore fest. i think i would rather take the three hour tour in gillian's island and get shipwrecked on a island then watch this turd again. it's as if sergio leone who made a masterpiece with once upon a time in the west and another great film in fistful of dollars went to his screenwriter and said lets make a film with many showcased action sequences and piece them together with our twenty page screenplay. the result a paper thin, very thin story with no solid characterization or development. the movie is more like the adventures of the man with no name and his annoying nerdy partner tuco who can't shut the hell up. the pair play one another in con games, shootouts, duels, and other antics. they both happen to fall upon a deserted stage wagon full of dead men where they learn the secret to ones fate of hidden gold. they both end up in a civil war prison camp, right in the middle of a civil war battle and other clueless adventures in a story that might have been written by a couple of adolescents. just one adventure after another that has nothing to do with telling a strong story. this film is like a clumsy, sloppy serial with no motivation by any of the characters involved. the one thing that make sergio leone films so great is the style and action. the action sequences in the film are dull and not the least bit engaging. the civil war battles look way too much like a world war battle. the duels and showdowns that were so thrilling and fun to watch in the previous two films i mentioned are drawn out here in very long and tiresome sequences. especially the duel climax which is almost laughable which consists of endless and endless shots of eyes, guns, expressions. the whole thing last for a total of 5 minutes and after it ends the viewer like me is not excited, but more relieved that it's over. any longer i would of fast forwarded it. other sequences such as showdowns in western towns are mere cartoonish and over the top. even leone's style of film-making isn't impressive. there are some shots that amuse me, especially the desert sequence which had artistic look to it. however, because of so many drawn out long boring sequences i really start losing focus on the art of film-making and really don't care anymore about this shot or that shot. that's not the case in once upon a time in the west or fistful of dollars. as for the characters in the film. clint eastwood's portrayal of the man with no name is no longer mysterious or cool like he was in fistful of dollars. i've never seen the second man with no name film. in this film he's more of a spoof. talks very little, but he's way to silly and not serious enough. as for elliah wallach his role of tuco is way too comic and not the least bit intimating. he's also extremely annoying and he's also ugly. as for lee van cliff his turn as angel eyes is the only character that i somewhat enjoyed. he played the part well with his narrow eyes, but he was in far too little of the film. too sum it all up i'm extremely disappointed at the final result of this film. so many people love it. i don't know why. my theory is that the ones who love it are too dumb to realize why they like it and don't know what a great film is. once upon a time in the west is a great film and so is fistful of dollars. i've seen the good the bad and the ugly three times now and every time i watch it i hate more and more. a masterpiece i think not. more like a turdpiece!;17 August 2008;3;['good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'overrated', 'morricone', 'iconic', 'consistent', 'f', 'great', 'many', 'thin', 'thin', 'solid', 'annoying', 'nerdy', 'other', 'deserted', 'full', 'dead', 'civil', 'civil', 'other', 'clueless', 'strong', 'clumsy', 'sloppy', 'great', 'dull', 'least', 'civil', 'thrilling', 'previous', 'long', 'tiresome', 'laughable', 'endless', 'endless', 'whole', 'last', 'excited', 'relieved', 'other', 'such', 'western', 'mere', 'impressive', 'artistic', 'many', 'long', 'boring', 'fistful', 'mysterious', 'cool', 'second', 'more', 'silly', 'serious', 'comic', 'least', 'annoying', 'ugly', 'only', 'narrow', 'little', 'disappointed', 'final', 'many', 'dumb', 'great', 'great', 'fistful', 'good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'more'];-0.03260582010582

521;naysbaghai;"one of the biggest regrets i hold to this day is not having seen the good, the bad and the ugly many years ago. i've been well aware of its revered reputation amongst moviegoers, but i had no idea just how mesmerising it is to watch, no matter who you are or what you know about cinema, nor how quickly it would pop into my list of perfect movies. set in the unforgiving environments of new mexico, the good, the bad and the ugly tracks the three eponymous bounty hunters racing to find confederate gold. the narrative is original, unpredictable, and meticulously constructed throughout the three- hour runtime. the context of the american civil war is used as a setting rather than a subject so we can focus on the story. the script, bereft of dialogue in most places, slowly builds up to one of the best endings in all of cinema. picture a desolate cemetery with the three leads in a tense mexican standoff, contrasted by ennio morricone's blazing score, and polished by a memorable quote - ""you see, in this world, there's two kinds of people, my friend: those with loaded guns and those who dig. you dig."" despite the language barriers between the american actors and the italian crew, coupled with leone's alleged perfectionism, he executes his vision to perfection, utilising a wide variety of camera angles and real locations to further captivate the audience. however, clint eastwood (the good), lee van clef (the bad) and eli wallach (the ugly) combine leone's direction with their own aptitude in acting to elevate the material. leone veteran ennio morricone establishes himself as a god in film scoring, combining conventional instruments with whistling, gunfire and the iconic two-note whistled motif that forever changed film music. if there's one thing i'll remember the good, the bad and the ugly for, its the enormous similarity it bears to the work of one of my biggest filmmaking idols: the self-professed, highly knowledgeable and irrepressible quentin tarantino. it's easy to see how the smooth dialogue, punctiliously crafted tension, genius orchestration of music, varied cinematography and the overall epic and grandiose experience of this movie are replicated effectively in films like pulp fiction, kill bill and inglorious basterds. i should also mention how the good, the bad and the ugly, like tarantino's films, instigates almost every type of response from the audience, including laughter, anger, anxiety, confusion, etc. tarantino sure wasn't joking around when he declared the good, the bad and the ugly as ""the greatest achievement in the history of cinema"".";12 December 2015;10;['big', 'bad', 'ugly', 'many', 'aware', 'revered', 'perfect', 'bad', 'ugly', 'eponymous', 'confederate', 'original', 'unpredictable', 'american', 'civil', 'bereft', 'most', 'good', 'desolate', 'tense', 'mexican', 'memorable', 'loaded', 'american', 'italian', 'wide', 'real', 'bad', 'ugly', 'own', 'conventional', 'iconic', 'bad', 'ugly', 'enormous', 'big', 'knowledgeable', 'irrepressible', 'tarantino', 'easy', 'smooth', 'varied', 'overall', 'epic', 'grandiose', 'inglorious', 'bad', 'ugly', 'tarantino', 'sure', 'bad', 'ugly', 'great'];-0.0601190476190476

533;gluttony14;"this movie is a classic. it's spectacular, it's thrilling, it's beautiful. you won't find anything like this now-a-days, no matter how hard you try. anyone who hasn't seen this movie should be ashamed of himself. the plot is simple - blondie (clint eastwood), the good, tuco (eli wallach), the ugly, and angel eyes (lee van cleef), the bad, are all after a stash of confederate gold, holding 200,000 dollars in gold, during the american civil war. seems like a pretty simple plot for 1 and a half hours, let alone 3. so what drives this movie? style. cinematography. atmosphere. let me explain. the first scene in the movie is the (rather unappealing) face of a bandit. it then switches to a wide shot of the small town he and his two companions are entering. a few more shots of the bandits. they enter an inn, and gunshots are heard. out the window comes charging tuco, clutching a gun in one hand and meat in the other. the image freezes while he's in midair, and the writing ""the ugly"" appears on the screen. the first half hour or so serves to introduce the three main characters in similar fashion. no plot progression whatsoever, merely introduction. most movies would fall with a start like that, but not this one. it takes more than an hour before the rush for the gold begins, and by that hour you already know everything you can and need to know about the three anti-heroes: blondie is the good. he is not good at all under normal standards, as he is an outlaw, a killer and he betrays his ""friend"". but he seems good in comparison to the other slime-balls in the movie: tuco is a villain, pure and simple. he steals, murderers, rapes, and does a bunch of other nasty things. but he is still fun and amusing, while the sinister angel eyes stands in comparison - a menacing figure in black clothing with an evil mustache, who kills and double-crosses without blinking for a few more dollars. and the movie doesn't follow a plot. the plot is just a background for the amazing scenes that come one after another and construct the movie - you go from one scene to the other. and there are many memorable scenes in this movie: the first time blondie shoots the rope before tuco is hanged to death. blondie's march through the desert. tuco and blondie's capture by the yankees. tuco's torture. tuco's gunfight in the tub and the classic line that follows. the showdown in the deserted town. the bridge being blown up. tuco's search for the grave. and of course, the amazing climax. but i'll get to that later. we've covered the style, but i also mentioned cinematography and atmosphere. and the cinematography is amazing. wide shots of towns and deserts zoom to close-ups of desperate and rugged men. the effect is amazing, especially during gunfights. it creates tension and suspense, and that leads me to the second point i mentioned: atmosphere. this feels like the west. the people look dirty and hard-working. the buildings look rickety. and when time is spent looking at each other before the guns are drawn for a few short seconds when the men fire at each other, you feel what it's like to be there. and finally, as i mentioned before, the climax. possibly the best climax in a movie ever. a mexican standoff between the three main characters in the film - blondie, angel eyes and tuco. the good, the bad and the ugly. minutes pass as they stare at each other, each bringing their hand a bit closer to the gun. the music becomes more and more dramatic as time passes. you wait, and then... they fire, and it's over. a duel as a duel should be. it's mind-blowing. few movies can reach the level of this masterpiece. fewer still can surpass it. they don't make 'em like this anymore, and it's a damn shame.";19 January 2006;10;['spectacular', 'beautiful', 'ashamed', 'simple', 'good', 'ugly', 'bad', 'confederate', 'american', 'civil', 'simple', 'first', 'unappealing', 'wide', 'small', 'few', 'more', 'other', 'ugly', 'first', 'half', 'main', 'similar', 'most', 'more', 'good', 'normal', 'good', 'other', 'villain', 'pure', 'simple', 'other', 'nasty', 'fun', 'amusing', 'sinister', 'menacing', 'black', 'evil', 'double', 'few', 'more', 'amazing', 'other', 'many', 'memorable', 'first', 'classic', 'deserted', 'amazing', 'amazing', 'wide', 'desperate', 'rugged', 'amazing', 'second', 'dirty', 'other', 'few', 'short', 'other', 'good', 'mexican', 'main', 'bad', 'ugly', 'other', 'close', 'dramatic', 'few', 'few', 'damn'];0.0072710622710622

540;aldinchova;"to me, movies from ""dollars trilogy"" and after them, final movie ""once upon a time in the west"" are the best westerns ever made. the question is, will anything exceed them ever if we are talking about westerns. unlike mainstream hollywood westerns from 1950s and 1960s that were showing us idealistic picture of wild west of 19th century, with lots of patriotism and propaganda,these sometimes called ""spaghetti westerns"" are something completely different. somebody said-""john wayne would never shoot to a guys back. clint eastwood would never have a problem with that."" this main difference between typical representatives of these two different kinds of westerns is what sets them apart. it began with ""a fistful of dollars"" and continued with ""for a few dollars more"". with each next movie they were getting better and better. ""good,bad,ugly"" is crown of all of them. story about three men searching for 200.000 dollars in gold and without choosing ways to get them. this is a real story about wild west, story about real people without make up. people without almost any moral barrier, instead of idealistic characters shown in hollywood westerns of that time who were unrealistic. in ""dollars trilogy"" everything is based on interest- association,rivalry and fighting for money. allies and enemies change over night depending on current interests. characters of clint eastwood and lee van cleef were allies in ""for a few dollars more"" but enemies in ""good,bad,ugly"". that was all based on interest. man without name or good (clint eastwood) is typical anti-hero,but you somehow feel that he is a good one. we know nothing about his past (that gets revealed in ""once upon a time in the west"" with charles bronson) but there is something in him that makes us wish to be the way he is. he is ready to take the punch,but when he strikes back no one stays alive. and he always manages to outflank them. like the rest he does everything from interest, but he is iconic figure because of what he is. bad (lee van cleef) is real bad guy who chooses no way to find out where the money is. he is calculated and ready to do everything necessary to satisfy his greed.man without any moral brakes. and ugly (eli wallach) known as tuco benedicto pacifico juan maria ramirez also known as rat is comical in his greed and lack of any moral barriers. slave of his own ego and instincts. his life credo is-""when you want to shoot,don t talk,just shoot"". if he wants something, he wants it now. man of revenge (""if someone double crosses me and leaves me alive,he understands nothing about tuco.nothing""). but he forgets about revenge if it comes to interest. in the end he is left with half of the money but stiff,scarred and angry which perfectly represents his personality. all three characters are allies and enemies depending on current situation and their interests as we see throughout the movie. the question remains until the end-who is going to outsmart who? and when they found a money there comes that final scene of gunfight between all three of them. camera shows us their faces and eyes-we see what they feel and their personality. good-cold blooded and self-confident knowing that he controls the situation and with advantage because he knows that ugly has no bullets in his gun (because he put them of from his gun when they were sleeping) and he can concentrate on bad, but bad and ugly know nothing about that so they have to concentrate on each other and good, which puts them in difficult situation in favor of good. bad-calculated and moving around thinking who is he going to shoot first-good or ugly? ready to fire in any moment. and ugly-scarred and also thinking who to shoot first. he is in most difficult situation. such a dramatic psychological scene. and everything is over in seconds,good fires first and kills bad,ugly has nothing to fire with as he discovered in that moment with feel of anger about good. what a perfection in filming. good leaves with half of the money and leaves ugly with another half to continue to hate him for the rest of his life. film has excellent soundtrack-opening melody, melody when ugly runs on graveyard searching for money and the best melody-scene of final gunfight. there are also other good melodies in movie. in my opinion ""good,bad,ugly"" is second best western ever made after ""once upon a time in the west"" which is first. jim carrey once said about man without a name played by clint eastwood in ""dollars trilogy"" and charles bronson in ""once upon a time in the west"" that he is someone who we all want to be-""he has no name,so that everyone can put his own.""";18 September 2009;10;['final', 'good', 'idealistic', 'wild', 'different', 'main', 'typical', 'different', 'few', 'next', 'well', 'good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'real', 'wild', 'real', 'moral', 'idealistic', 'unrealistic', 'current', 'few', 'good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'good', 'typical', 'anti', 'hero', 'good', 'ready', 'alive', 'iconic', 'bad', 'bad', 'ready', 'necessary', 'moral', 'ugly', 'comical', 'moral', 'own', 'double', 'alive', 'stiff', 'scarred', 'angry', 'current', 'final', 'good', 'cold', 'confident', 'ugly', 'bad', 'bad', 'ugly', 'other', 'good', 'difficult', 'good', 'bad', 'first', 'good', 'ugly', 'ready', 'ugly', 'scarred', 'difficult', 'dramatic', 'psychological', 'good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'good', 'excellent', 'ugly', 'good', 'final', 'other', 'good', 'good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'good', 'western', 'first', 'own'];-0.0206959706959706
541;tsettles98;ok, so this is the story of three men, blondie (the good), angel eyes (the bad), and tuco (the ugly). they are each after treasure that is buried in a cemetery. they know which cemetery but only blondie knows the name of the grave. so basically, everyone is after blondie. it's very hard to choose who's the bad guy in this film. it could be the ugly, but he always seems to be friends with blondie (who's obviously the good guy). there's also the bad, who's obviously the bad guy, but he's nice to blondie. ?. that doesn't matter, though. this movie is amazing! it's very uncommon to find a movie that's 2hrs and 41mins of awesome action that held my attention throughout. clint eastwood's awesome and is the action hero of the sixties! character development is great and you get to know how much of a d**k the ugly can be. i am seeing the other spaghetti western once upon a time in the west soon and i am excited to do so. after this movie, all westerns are great in my book. my original favorite western was the 2010 true grit. now its this. it's not just my favorite western, my favorite movie of all time! *** out of ***, ***** out of *****, ********** out of **********.;7 April 2011;10;['bad', 'ugly', 'hard', 'bad', 'ugly', 'good', 'bad', 'bad', 'nice', 'amazing', 'uncommon', 'awesome', 'great', 'much', 'ugly', 'other', 'western', 'excited', 'great', 'original', 'favorite', 'true', 'favorite', 'favorite'];0.1123188405797101
542;dreaujyc;there are many sergio leone's movies fans in eastern asia. although we don't have a history of cowboys and rangers, but it is familiar with swordsmen who may be evil sometimes but also get rid of the cruel. i love the dollar-trilogy very much but the third one is quite different. when the bounty hunters were involved with the war and did some help to stop a bit of unnecessary casualties, it levelled up the whole movie and made itself more serious. clint eastwood was so manly and attractive at the prime of life, many of our young fellas are happily imitating his way of talking, but unfortunately, we don't have revolvers to play with. what makes it more interesting is the masterpiece of the ost composed by the great italian composer ennio morricone.i love all the osts of the dollar-trilogy but this one is the best. it is quite stirring and dramatic when tuco rushed himself among the graveyard with the bgm of ecstasy of gold. the final duet is also classic.;8 June 2020;10;['many', 'eastern', 'familiar', 'evil', 'cruel', 'third', 'different', 'unnecessary', 'whole', 'serious', 'manly', 'attractive', 'many', 'young', 'interesting', 'great', 'italian', 'good', 'stirring', 'dramatic', 'final', 'classic'];0.0776315789473684

545;matigiorgi;this is one of the first western films i've ever seen... i should probable watch it a again in a few years. i liked the movie, but it was reaaally slow. what i liked the most about the movie (excluding the soundtrack, which was terrific) is the character of tuco, and the relation he had with blondie. there were moments when i hated tuco, and a few minutes later i feeled sorry for him... he was the most balanced or more human character in the movie. he was bad yeah, but not entirely bad. blondie liked him but didn't thrust him completly, and that was the right thing to do. i loved that sometimes they helped eachother, and sometimes they wanted to kill eachother guts. i must admit that the final scene is simply fantastic. that triple duel was one of the most amazing scenes i've ever seen.;24 February 2020;7;['first', 'western', 'few', 'slow', 'most', 'terrific', 'few', 'sorry', 'balanced', 'more', 'human', 'bad', 'bad', 'right', 'final', 'fantastic', 'triple', 'amazing'];-0.0040178571428571
546;Gunmaster45;i spent all day watching all three movies and this one beats the other two and near every other western out there. (with a few exceptions...) usually, spaghetti westerns annoy me do to the cheesy noises, unrealistic shooting, and lots of bore. but this movie was different. unlike the other two, this movie had lots of simple comedy. (most from eli wallach's silliness and stupidity as tuco adds a perfect sense of comic relief and clint eastwood's slickness and intelligence as blondie makes him so.... cool. lee van cleef does a perfect job as the villain giving a sinister performance. instead of the fact that the slow parts in the first two movies were boring, this movie took advantage of long shots for suspense and to get a sense of things which is a great directing tool. (kudos to sergio leone) i can surely see why this is #4 on the imdb top 250. it feels more realistic than the other two movies. no whistling noises when things fall, suspenseful music(and very famous), stellar acting, and nice shoot outs. one of my favorite clint eastwood movies and one of my favorite westerns ever! a+. 10/10 watch this one right away. (i recommend watching the new edition dvds, the white cases, because the quality is better, the sound is great, and newer, and the dubbing is near impossible to spot.) don't miss this or you will miss one of the greatest, classic movies ever made.;8 September 2007;10;['other', 'other', 'western', 'few', 'unrealistic', 'different', 'other', 'simple', 'most', 'perfect', 'comic', 'perfect', 'sinister', 'slow', 'first', 'long', 'great', 'realistic', 'other', 'suspenseful', 'famous', 'stellar', 'nice', 'favorite', 'favorite', 'white', 'well', 'great', 'new', 'impossible', 'great', 'classic'];0.1775171065493646

554;antoniocenteno-87266;"the good, the bad and the ugly, where to begin reviewing this movie?. this is one of those movies that you can speak for days and not be over with all the many good things it did, is almost crazy to belive that this movie was panned by critics at the time, probably a response to a product of it's time but from another country, we should agree. however critics where proved wrong with this movie and had to appreciate a western that in many ways was more revolutionary and arguably better than anything produced in hollywood. sergio leone direction for this movie is iconic and now one of the things that distinguish this type of movies, with beautiful and slow cinematographic long shots, extreme close ups, the storytelling he used and how graphich it was visually (at the time), but most iportant the build of tention he did in so many scenes, when you know something gonna happen but you have no idea when would happen, but when does happen it marks the movie and your life. the acting in this movie is very underaprecciated in general, the main trio has so much presence by them selves that they stole every inch of screen they are in, ellie wallach as tuco is funny yet ragging, charismatic and just enbodies ""the ugly"" as a word better than anyone has done; lee van cleef as sentenza ""angel eyes"" is so menacing, there's no scene including him that make you think contrary, his incarnation of ""the bad"" is just that, someone that appears to have no soul and would kill twisting his own rules at bennefit; and finally clint eastwood as blondie, ""the good"" that isn't exactly good, a bounty hunter that has dubious moral codes, he is so unpredictable in what he is gonna do and how he is gonna do it, yet has some good in him and is the smartest of the trio, not to say the better gunslinger (in all movies arguably). the rest of the supporting cast does a good job at it, never outmatching the main charachters but doing really good carachterization and making the film have more weight, the shop owner, the soldiers, the generals, the killers, all of them have a poruse on the film and add something special to the film. the score is another big one of this film, ennio morricone is a genius mind and there's no better man to writte music for this genre of film than him, he easly outmatches most composers of western movies and composers in movies in general. his score really put you in the mood of the scene, in how you are supossed to feel the film, in how raw the life was back then, the main theme, eacstsy of gold, the trio, the sundown are great pieces of music, that's how movie themes should work and how they have to make you feel. this movie really broke the rules of typical film making as well, is one of those movies that don't really care that much about the plot, wich in any other movie would feel wrong, but this one makes their scenes so heavy and so much happens on screen at the same moment that the plot becomes almost a non factor for the film, is a movie about circumstances that happen to their carachters and how they deal with them in that exact moments not really caring when it would get to the end of the plot, is much more about their stories and what they leave behind, however there is a plot but the film don't rushes into it, it takes it's time to get there and is so satisfying. we already talked about the acting, but it's worth talking about how this movie was one that popularized double sided charachters, specailly with tuco and blondie, it really don't let you make up your mind about what you feel about them, the only thing you know is that they might be bad or good any moments, specailly that of the man with no name, altough wallach's acting stole the show, eastwood is one fo those presence actors that just need to put a cigar in his mouth and he will change movies forever and his charachter in this movie, cold, smart, few words spoken, and overall bad ass really changued movies to this very day, there's so many movies that stole that concept and implemented into their own, not only in westerns but in action movies and sci-fi, there would not be han solos, snake pilskims or even indiana jones withouth the grandad of dirty players wich was blondie. there's too much to talk about this movie again and most of all is positive to excelent, so whenever you have the chance go and watch it, is the final instalment of the dollars trio or the man with no name trilogy, yo surely won't be dissapointed.";25 January 2020;10;['bad', 'ugly', 'many', 'good', 'crazy', 'wrong', 'western', 'many', 'revolutionary', 'well', 'iconic', 'beautiful', 'slow', 'cinematographic', 'long', 'extreme', 'close', 'iportant', 'many', 'underaprecciated', 'general', 'main', 'much', 'ellie', 'funny', 'charismatic', 'ugly', 'well', 'sentenza', 'menacing', 'bad', 'own', 'good', 'dubious', 'moral', 'unpredictable', 'good', 'smart', 'well', 'good', 'main', 'good', 'more', 'special', 'big', 'well', 'most', 'western', 'general', 'raw', 'main', 'eacstsy', 'great', 'typical', 'much', 'other', 'wrong', 'heavy', 'much', 'same', 'non', 'exact', 'more', 'satisfying', 'worth', 'double', 'sided', 'only', 'bad', 'good', 'altough', 'cold', 'smart', 'few', 'overall', 'bad', 'very', 'many', 'own', 'dirty', 'much', 'most', 'positive', 'final'];0.0898263195138195

562;atitu3;"*cool and menacing gunslingers, interesting plot, thought provoking scenerios, stylistic gunfights, epic music with mexican standoff and treasure hunt! - the greatest western ever made in the history of cinema! *""the good, the bad and the ugly"" is a 1966 italian epic spaghetti western film directed by sergio leone. based on a story by luciano vincenzoni and sergio leone. starring clint eastwood as ""the good"", lee van cleef as ""the bad"" and eli wallach as ""the ugly"". main theme of the film is greed. also it has cruelty, violence, anti war theme. and as the story progresses, the line between good,bad and ugly becomes blur and with some gray shade the characters become more like anti heroes. nobody is totally good or bad or ugly, maybe lee van cleef's character is totally bad but you get my point. as leone noted that like many of his films, this is also a satire on western genre, more like satire on old west romanticism. it shows the more violent, more complex old west. it has been called the definitive spaghetti western. *the plot revolves around three gunslingers, a cynical and confident bounty hunter only known as blondie, a ruthless, sadistic mercenary called angel eyes and a fast-talking cunning mexican bandit called tuco. set in 1862, during the american civil war, the three of them compete to find fortune in gold buried in a cemetery. the plot is very simple. as the story go forward, they land in many difficult situations and gunfights. the character development of the movie is perfect. every scenes of tuco and blondie is just great and funny. some scenes like tuco meeting his brother, tuco buying revolver, angel eyes torturing tuco with the music in the background, tuco and blondie meets the alcoholic union captain in the ongoing war on the bridge, the mexican standoff between the trio are just epic. every scene and dialogue of the movie is great and i love every bit of it. the cinematography was great too with the use of classic leone long shots and close-up. *sergio leone is the master of western films. by his films, he expanded the spaghetti western genre and became an international sensation. this film is the third of the ""dollar trilogy"" or also known as ""the man with no name trilogy"", starring clint eastwood as the titular hero. although the story is not related in the trilogy, the films are - 1) a fistful of dollars 2) for a few dollars more 3) the good,the bad and the ugly. i love the trilogy but this is my most favorite films of all time. as i said earlier, this is the greatest western ever made, with ""once upon a time in the west"" comes as close second, another one of sergio leone. i also love his less popular ""duck, you sucker"", it was a great western too. american westerns didn't come close to this, but ""the magnificent seven"", ""stagecoach"", ""rio bravo"", ""high noon"" were some great competitors. *the actors - clint eastwood, lee van cleef and eli wallach did a phenomenal job. nobody will ever forget their acting,character after watching the film. clint eastwood is the most stylish, cool western hero ever. his mannerisms, quiet behavior, menacing look, cigar-smoking gunslinger is immortalized. lee van cleef also acted in many westerns as positive and negative characters, but this is the most great character he ever played. as everybody that saw the film, will agree with me, that eli wallach stole the show as tuco! he also had the most scenes to work too and he nailed it perfectly as the comical but cunning bandit. the supporting casts did great too, specially aldo giuffre as alcoholic union captain, mario brega as corporal wallace, luigi pistilli as father pablo ramirez. *the music was composed by the legend ennio morricone. so as a result some legendary scores were created. ""the good, the bad and the ugly main theme"", ""the story of a soldier"", ""the ecstacy of gold"" are just to name a few. every background score of this movie is epic. *i am a great fan of the western genre and i think everybody should watch this film. it's old but it's an epic film. it is also one of the best film ever made in the history of cinema. a cinematic masterpiece.";13 September 2020;10;['cool', 'menacing', 'interesting', 'stylistic', 'epic', 'great', 'western', 'bad', 'ugly', 'italian', 'epic', 'spaghetti', 'western', 'bad', 'ugly', 'main', 'anti', 'good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'blur', 'gray', 'anti', 'good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'bad', 'many', 'western', 'old', 'violent', 'complex', 'old', 'definitive', 'western', 'cynical', 'confident', 'ruthless', 'sadistic', 'cunning', 'american', 'civil', 'simple', 'many', 'difficult', 'perfect', 'great', 'funny', 'alcoholic', 'ongoing', 'mexican', 'epic', 'great', 'great', 'classic', 'long', 'close', 'western', 'western', 'international', 'titular', 'few', 'bad', 'ugly', 'favorite', 'great', 'western', 'close', 'popular', 'great', 'american', 'magnificent', 'high', 'great', 'phenomenal', 'stylish', 'cool', 'western', 'quiet', 'menacing', 'many', 'positive', 'negative', 'great', 'tuco', 'most', 'comical', 'cunning', 'aldo', 'alcoholic', 'corporal', 'legendary', 'bad', 'ugly', 'main', 'few', 'epic', 'great', 'western', 'old', 'epic', 'good', 'cinematic'];0.0578099173553719

565;steven-f-freeman;"after many years of barely watching any movies, i treated myself to several classics recently. and this was the best. that i so enjoyed this movie so much came as a shock to me. i literally never before have been able to even sit through a western, which (in my admittedly limited experience) was schlock action starring john wayne as the taciturn all-american good guy being tough and beating up the outlaws. watching gbu, i was enthralled for the entire three hours. twice. and if i had time, i would have watched it a third time. the setting is typically western: a dry, dusty panorama in which men barely co-exist with each other; few wasted words; and lots of action, horses, and gunfighting in a wild west barely governed by incipient institutions of law & order all shrouded within a morality play of good vs. bad. but what i liked so much is exactly what i hate about john wayne westerns the seriousness and honesty with which moral context is considered. in hollywood, good vs. bad is as thoughtlessly superscripted as the protagonists' white and black hats. in gbu every remnant of moralizing has been ruthlessly cut. good, bad, and ugly are personified in the form of three characters: bad (""sentenza"") is the easiest to understand. he is *very* bad, perhaps not so different from other villains, but much more sharply developed; murderous, sadistic, traitorous, and remorseless. good (""blondie"") and ugly (""tuco"") are more puzzling, but their labels are the key to the movie. both blondie and tuco are outlaws and killers with only the barest hint of morality, but they're not evil in the same way that sentenza is. tuco is demonstrative, emotional, loud, wild, and unpredictable; but driven by survival rather than satanic urges. blondie is cool, calm, rational and controlled in many ways similar to sentenza but whereas sentenza tortures, maims, kills, and lies for the hell of it, even apparently enjoys it, blondie simply goes about his business coolly, and shows several poignant hints of empathy, decency, and a sense of justice. gbu takes place during the civil war and strips away the high-level political struggle of history books, leaving us with the soldier's vantage point of brutality, pointless death, and some individual decency. the politics are indecipherable from this vantage point. gbu hits this point home when our protagonists wind up in a prison camp because the oncoming gray cavalry uniforms turn out to be dust-covered blue. later, they encounter an army fighting over a worthless bridge, suffering countless pointless deaths and casualties. because leone has so rigorously excised traditional off-the-shelf morality, the few instances of humanity are remarkably poignant. one such instance is when blondie shares his coat and cigar with a dying soldier; another is when prisoners are forced by sentenza's orders to play music to cover up the screams of the tortured. sentenza apparently enjoyed the irony of beautiful sounds used for such ends; the musicians are, of course, pained by it. that was one of many extraordinarily striking scenes. the honesty of the moral context was what i liked best about the film, but i liked everything else too. indeed the same primal, ruthless honesty that characterizes the character development pervades the film. the music is unlike anything i'd ever heard it's an audible version of the arid west and the tensions and lawlessness that characterize the film. underlying the entire score is one instantly memorable theme starting off with what sounds like a screaming hyena. the story took place in new mexico, and even though it was filmed in spain, it really does look like new mexico; and just as in life in the american west, the wide, breathtaking panorama tends to subordinates dialog. indeed, it is several minutes into the film before even one word is spoken. the plot was extremely clever and never predictable. high level suspense is maintained for the full three hours. it was hard to imagine how it could unfold three uncompromising outlaws in search of one buried treasure; cooperation was not in their nature, but nothing was ever done out of character. any western cliche that you can think of is either given a unique twist or destroyed by masterful storytelling. for example there is an utterly irreverent scene in which tuco meets his brother, a sincere priest, and turns platitudes upside down. the brother begins with the standard rebuke of the criminal's behavior, but tuco punches back and says, ""where we come from there were only two ways out. you lacked the courage to do what i've done."" the movie is also irreverently funny: for example, twice tuco gained the upper hand on blondie and said: ""there are two kinds of spurs(?), my friend. those that come in by the door, and (crosses himself) those that come in by the window."" ""there are two kinds of people in the world, my friend. those who have a rope around their neck and those who have the job of cutting."" later blondie gained the advantage of tuco and observed: ""you see in this world there's two kinds of people my friend - those with loaded guns, and those who dig. you dig."" in addition to all these specific attributes, a unique and strikingly cool style infuses the entire film: long scenes of tense silences never for an instant boring; and telling, startling close-ups and transitions. most noteworthy was the film's climax. as the protagonists stand there with their fingers on their holsters, waiting for the first person to go for their gun(s), the transitions start out slowly, and speed up as the tension increases. as i write this, i wish i had my own copy of the film, just so i could see this scene again. not just a great western, but easily one of the best movies of *any* kind ever made.";26 December 2007;10;['many', 'several', 'good', 'able', 'western', 'limited', 'american', 'good', 'tough', 'entire', 'third', 'western', 'dry', 'dusty', 'other', 'few', 'wild', 'incipient', 'good', 'bad', 'much', 'moral', 'good', 'bad', 'white', 'black', 'good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'bad', 'easy', 'bad', 'different', 'other', 'murderous', 'sadistic', 'traitorous', 'good', 'ugly', 'tuco', 'puzzling', 'bare', 'evil', 'same', 'demonstrative', 'emotional', 'loud', 'wild', 'unpredictable', 'satanic', 'cool', 'calm', 'rational', 'many', 'similar', 'sentenza', 'several', 'poignant', 'civil', 'high', 'political', 'pointless', 'individual', 'indecipherable', 'oncoming', 'gray', 'worthless', 'countless', 'pointless', 'traditional', 'few', 'poignant', 'such', 'beautiful', 'such', 'many', 'striking', 'moral', 'same', 'ruthless', 'audible', 'arid', 'entire', 'memorable', 'hyena', 'wide', 'several', 'clever', 'predictable', 'high', 'full', 'hard', 'western', 'unique', 'masterful', 'irreverent', 'sincere', 'standard', 'funny', 'upper', 'loaded', 'specific', 'unique', 'cool', 'entire', 'long', 'tense', 'instant', 'close', 'noteworthy', 'first', 'own', 'great', 'western', 'good'];0.0413264099966227

567;NachoDaddie;"ok- first, as mentioned in another review, the geographic/historical errors in this film are glaring. you've got men carrying revolvers that look like old style cap-and-ball pistols, but they're loading them with metallic cartridges- historically about five years early. eastwood carries a rifle that hasn't been invented yet, tuco assembles a ""superpistol"" out of a colt, a remington, and a smith and wesson- impossible. and there was nothing of merit taking place between the north and south during the civil war in the southwest. now, that aside, i must say that this is the greatest western ever. i first saw this film when i was about ten. i'd never sat through an entire western befor, even though my dad watched them constantly. since then, i've been through film school, watched hundreds of westerns, learned to appreciate them- but nothing matches up to this. the searchers, stagecoach, gunfight at the o.k. corral, the gunfighter, high noon, shane- all great films, but saddled with the standard american western morality- the good guy never takes liberties with the eastern schoolmarm, the bad guy wears a black hat, etc. coming from italy, tg,tb &tu isn't bound by these conventions. blondie's the ""good guy""- but he's also a bounty hunter. he makes a living in a highly immoral way, but is obviously the ""good""- not because we're told, but from small acts- giving the dying soldier a cigar, making sure the captain knows to hold on till he hears the bridge blow, the genuine regret he feel for having to let shorty die. and while angel eyes may be the bad, we at least know he has prinicpals- when he's hired for a job, he always sees the job through. and tuco may be more immoral than the other two, but he's so savvy and his role so humorous that one can't bring oneself to look upon him disfavorably. in other words, historical inaccuracies aside, tg, tb, & tu maybe one of the most accurate portrayals of the west ever put on film- there are no clear-cut lines of conduct, no black and white, or even grey, but just a swirled palette of various facets of the human condition.";28 May 1999;10;['geographic', 'historical', 'old', 'metallic', 'impossible', 'civil', 'great', 'western', 'entire', 'western', 'high', 'great', 'standard', 'american', 'good', 'bad', 'black', 'good', 'immoral', 'small', 'sure', 'genuine', 'bad', 'least', 'immoral', 'other', 'savvy', 'humorous', 'other', 'historical', 'accurate', 'black', 'white', 'grey', 'swirled', 'various', 'human'];0.0603333333333333

574;starman2765;"believe the hype, this movie is all that it's cracked up to be. fortunately, that's not much! for the genre that it represents, it is excellent. as a movie, it is very, very good. the soundtrack, often imitated, never duplicated or surpassed; provides exaggerated suspense and unintentional comic relief through out the movie. it also creates an atmosphere and texture for the movie, that many other movies might benefit from. the camera work is good. there is lots of great scenery, rapid change ups from landscapes to close ups of the actor's faces; and other interesting use of the camera, at times. at other times, there is a lazy quality to the shot choice that highlights the movement or plot at the moment. the characters are archetypes, and as such, don't stray too much from their respective modes. there are moments when i wished for a bit more, but there was plenty of true to form moments from the major characters that made up for a lack of further development or dimensionality. stark, interesting, comic, tragic (if you will) and intense. good acting all around, with eastwood giving a trademark performance, later to be more fully developed as dirty harry, as a comic and merciless but just defender of his own ethic. the film has some funny scenes, and also, it has some places where it starts to drags. it's 2 hours and 45 minutes long, so it does take a certain suspension of time to sit through it all. worth it though! especially, if you happen to like rough and rugged westerns. i think that sergio leone's brilliance is overlooked in the direction and screenplay of this movie. there is something so classically cheesy and yet at the same time universally comic and tragic about the unfolding of events. as an example, i was particularly struck by the scene in the graveyard where the three men are about to dual over the sum of $200,000 in gold coins. truly a king's ransom. the interesting counter point being that it is a soldier's graveyard, and that most, if not all of those buried there died in the pursuit of much less then that. the ideas of greed, confusion and ignorance were also interestingly intermixed throughout the movie. while at the end of the movie money is given a gold star (so to speak) all the tragedy and malice throughout the rest of the movie can be tied directly to it. there is a fair amount of violence in this film, which counts against it. over all, i have a very positive response after viewing this one. thumbs up, and with the right people, those who might laugh along with me, i'd be happy to see this one again. plot synopsis. at the beginning of the film we are introduced to the three major characters who are defined as: the good, the bad, and the ugly. the might as well have been introduced as the not so bad compared to a wolf; definitely mean and the completely evil one. however, this would have robbed the movie of its pretensions to be a moral tale of some kind, or perhaps just obscured it's spiritual (?) message a bit deeper. anyway. the three characters compete with one another to see how many people the can kill, or lives that they can ruin. the good guy starts out by killing three people, so he has a good start! as the movie progresses, we see them each killing various other people, and threatening to kill one another. except for the good guy; his utterances are generally followed through with actions. anyway. they each become aware of the existence of the some of gold earlier mentioned. actually, the bad knows about the gold at the beginning of the film. well, suffice it to say that there is a lot of shenanigans, and then at the end of the movie, there is a showdown. lots of thematic mood music, and then each of the three gets their just desserts: the bad dies, the ugly get stranded in a graveyard with his hands tied behind his back with more gold then he can carry at his feet; and the good rides out of the graveyard with the other half of the gold. all the other stuff in the middle, is just plot devices, and chances for the characters to show their archetypes in action: not worth repeating, save to say that it was easy to follow, entertaining, and epic in scope as it involved the united states civil war as a backdrop. entertaining, engrossing and in the final analysis a bit over worked and long. but very, very good nonetheless. may you reading this be well and happy.";27 July 2008;8;['much', 'excellent', 'good', 'exaggerated', 'unintentional', 'comic', 'many', 'other', 'good', 'great', 'rapid', 'other', 'interesting', 'other', 'lazy', 'shot', 'such', 'respective', 'more', 'true', 'major', 'further', 'stark', 'interesting', 'comic', 'tragic', 'intense', 'good', 'dirty', 'comic', 'own', 'funny', 'certain', 'worth', 'rough', 'rugged', 'cheesy', 'same', 'comic', 'tragic', 'about', 'interesting', 'most', 'less', 'gold', 'fair', 'positive', 'right', 'happy', 'major', 'bad', 'ugly', 'bad', 'evil', 'moral', 'spiritual', 'deep', 'many', 'good', 'good', 'various', 'other', 'good', 'aware', 'bad', 'thematic', 'just', 'bad', 'ugly', 'more', 'good', 'other', 'other', 'worth', 'easy', 'entertaining', 'epic', 'civil', 'entertaining', 'final', 'good', 'well', 'happy'];0.1310813615608136

intimidation and power without even speaking a single line of dialog. in the next scene, we meet the selfish middle man tuco, played by eli wallach, who is without a doubt putting every inch of his being trying to make his character authentic and is clearly loving every second of it. as a result, he is the funniest aspect of the movie, without turning into a simple side/comic relief character. his character is one that goes through the most pain and suffering as shown when we learn about his shaky relationship with his family and an incredibly gruesome torture scene that is able to shock audiences even now, fifty years later. finally we are introduced to the lead man blondie, played by legendary actor and future director clint eastwood. eastwood's presence is the most phenomenal thing to witness on screen as he is (and believe me, there is no other way to describe him) just the coolest man who ever lived. he doesn't even need to try to look cool like most actors will do, he just seems naturally prepared for any situation. no matter what surprises are thrown at him, he just seems able to shrug it off almost like it doesn't bother him. this doesn't bring the movie down however, due to the audience believing he cannot die through his endless confidence, instead it feels more like he has accepted the dangerous world he lives and acknowledges that he can die at any second, yet it does not face or scare him, making him both an incredibly respectable and entertaining character simultaneously. the movie's story and script is another thing about it that is just awe inspiring. despite the basic plot of three men on a treasure hunt, the movie throws in elements of the events that actually were affecting the world they inhabit at the time, the american civil war. whether being captured and imprisoned by one side or ending up even enlisting into one of the armies, the men never forget their true goals and ambitions. while the plot gets side tracked, the characters don't and the war ends up becoming just another obstacle for them to overcome. also, because these characters stay so true to form, we are able to observe and take in some of the best suited and interesting dialog possible. watching these three completely different personalities talk, fight, and betray each other is so excellently executed and seamless, you almost forget that these men are factious. where the movie really shines however is in it's cinematography and soundtrack. while i could talk about every single scene here, instead i shall focus on one in particular where both are used to their absolute best. after deciding to double-cross blondie, tuco flees and discovers the graveyard where the gold is buried. what ensues is the greatest scene in the movie, where tuco stands up and begins to run around the yard, trying to locate the grave with the hidden gold. the song that plays is called 'the ecstasy of gold' and, as the name suggests, it perfectly encapsulates the climactic tension that the movie has been building up to as tuco almost madly runs around for the grave. every now and then, the scene will cut to a new shot, showing the situation from ""the ugly's"" perspective. to simulate his running, the camera starts to spin, slowly at first, then quickens and quickens to show tuco's desperation for the gold he yearns until a sudden halt of the spinning motion, causing the viewer to feel as dazed and confused as the character does in his state of potential madness. there are many different 'cuts' of this flawless film, all with different run times and prolonged/shortened scenes, the most common one being the longest with a run time of 173 minutes. this should not by any circumstances put off any film buff or fan of cinema as despite this hefty length, the ending is well worth the wait and while slow at times in the middle, still keeps the viewer's intrigue enough to make them want to watch it to the very end. casual movie goers however may want to prefer to search for a shorter cut of the movie if this more common run time is a little too much for them to handle. a movie that has stood the test of time strongly and firmly, being now just over fifty years old. as a result, the good the bad and the ugly deserves my immense praise for the greatest movie ever crafted.";3 February 2017;10;['good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'great', 'western',

583;andreipisces;"there is one word to define the good, the bad and the ugly. and that word is ""transcendent"". this movie is not only the pinnacle of the spaghetti western, but it transcended into the pinnacle of the western genre in itself. it's safe to say it transcends that too, and can be considered one of the greatest pieces of filmmaking ever. it counts with memorable performances by three different leads, a story that breaks the ""black and white"" concepts of morale, and an original score that can only be defined by ""epic"". directed by the man responsible for the revitalization of the western in italy, sergio leone, the film does an incredible job of introducing every character, and showing each and every one has a dubious concept of moral values. ""the bad"", sentenza, or angel eyes (lee van cleef), is shown to be a ruthless, greedy gun for hire, but also someone who lives by the mantra of always getting the job done. ""the ugly"", tuco, is a greedy backstabber, but he is also a man who comes from an extremely poor environment and family conflicts, showing a bit of determinism in the film. ""the good"", blondie (clint eastwood) is not much better himself. while he is surely the less greedy one, he also has no problem with killing and backstabbing other people. to put it in perspective, he is ironically announced as ""the good"" right after abandoning a man to die in the desert. the story follows all these three personalities as they engage in their particular gold rush: a buried treasure that is hidden in a cemetery. in order to find it, they must form an uneasy alliance, while trying to outrun each other, and claim the prized gold alone. all of this while the civil war happens around them. the performances are nothing short of amazing. it goes to show the range that lee van cleef had once this villainous role is compared to his work in the previous installment of the trilogy, for a few dollars more, as a heroic, friendly and almost fatherly figure. his presence is as intimidating as ever, and one of the best he has given in his lengthy career. eastwood is as eye-catching as one would expect: his deep stares and lines delivered in a whispery, yet gravelly voice, defined the man with no name. but the best of the bunch has to be eli wallach. his comedic timing is as precise as any bullet shot in this film. but the most outstanding part of his characterization is that while he is extremely funny, he also manages to be a credible threat for the ""hero"", blondie. the original music score for this film deserves a whole book just to talk about it, and it still wouldn't do it justice. it's simply a lesson by the maestro, ennio morricone, on how music can change a film. thanks to a track such as l'estasi dell'oro (the ecstasy of gold), a man running around a cemetery becomes one of the most epic scenes ever made. thanks to a composition such as il triello, three men staring at each other, pondering their options for seven minutes straight, becomes tense enough to have the viewer on the edge of its seat. there is simply no other way to put it: morricone crafted one of the best scores in this art's history. at the end of the day, the good, the bad and the ugly is more than just a great western film. it's a show of great acting, writing, directing and music scoring. it's a real once in a lifetime classic, that has been around for a long time, and not aged a little bit, and will still be talked about for generations of cinephiles to come. to conclude, all i can say is... there are two kinds of people, my friend. those who have watched this film, and those who have not. you watch.";20 September 2020;10;['bad', 'ugly', 'transcendent', 'western', 'western', 'safe', 'great', 'memorable', 'different', 'black', 'white', 'original', 'epic', 'responsible', 'western', 'incredible', 'dubious', 'moral', 'bad', 'ruthless', 'greedy', 'ugly', 'tuco', 'greedy', 'poor', 'good', 'well', 'greedy', 'other', 'good', 'particular', 'uneasy', 'other', 'civil', 'short', 'amazing', 'villainous', 'previous', 'few', 'heroic', 'friendly', 'fatherly', 'good', 'lengthy', 'deep', 'good', 'comedic', 'precise', 'outstanding', 'funny', 'credible', 'original', 'whole', 'such', 'epic', 'such', 'other', 'straight', 'tense', 'other', 'good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'more', 'great', 'western', 'great', 'real', 'long', 'aged', 'little'];0.1037280701754386

592;Philippe277;"i just watched this a few weeks ago for the first time on an actual tv set (as opposed to a computer), and i will tell you: it still resonates with me. i am in awe at practically everything about this movie. the story is indelible -- a chase across the wild civil war laden frontier for a supposed $200,000 of stolen confederate gold buried in a cemetery somewhere. all sorts of gunshots fired, men fallen, twists and turns of faith within the plot -- you never know what to expect next. the relationship between blondie (clint eastwood) and tuco (eli wallach) is so ambivalent that it's entertaining. each strands the other in the middle of a vast desert, each has opportunities to kill the other. but ultimately they team up with the common goal of acquiring great riches - - though you never know when someone may turn on the other. the acting is done perfectly. eastwood plays blondie to be the quintessential bad-ass, the man we all wish we could be, who's got no fear to kill but ultimately has good intentions. then wallach portrays tuco as ""the ugly"", which is convincingly done as tuco is preoccupied with material objects rather than things like faith and friendship. he rushes blondie to recovery only when blondie's survival is mandatory to find bill carson's hidden gold. tuco conceals his sins (which include greed, lust, wrath, drinking, etc.) with constant prayer and reference to the lord. i find this to be especially intriguing. it echoes the real world phenomenon where the most religious people are often the ones who are most befallen by vice. tuco wants to believe that he's as worthy as his brother (who is leading an actual catholic mission), but is committed to doing whatever it takes to satisfy himself, at no matter what cost. on that note, i find it amusing analyzing the difference between ""the ugly"" and ""the bad"" (which was spectacularly portrayed by angel eyes (lee van cleef)). at first thought, both titles seem negative, but that doesn't mean they are identical. in fact, it doesn't even mean that both are the exact opposite of ""the good"". while angel eyes may be characterized by greed, and finds it acceptable to physically assault prisoners of war and anyone that stands in his way, he is markedly more intelligent and more self-respecting and resourceful than tuco. at the yankee prison, angel eyes doesn't even bother beating blondie to get information on the location of the gold, figuring that he's ""smart enough to know that talking won't save (him)"", this just after he tortured tuco, who succumbed. angel eyes clearly views blondie as a more capable traveling companion. in other words the bad has a sharp eye for detecting and appreciating the assets of the good, whereas the ugly doesn't have much keenness of any kind, only seeking to serve himself through sensual pleasures. also at the end of the movie, just before the final showdown, angel eyes seems to understand the sporting nature of blondie's wish to duel for the rock at the cemetery's center (which supposedly bears the name of the grave where the money is), while tuco seems to merely be along for the ride, only accepting the challenge because of the possible reward. note that the bad's entertainment seems to normally arrive through mental means -- his battery of the prisoners allows him to assert dominance over them. he ""always sees the job through"", showing resoluteness and conviction. perhaps this indicates that the bad is more similar to the good than the ugly is. while the bad may utilize his assets of intelligence, strength, and persistence corruptly, at least he has them, like the good and unlike the ugly. the ugly seemingly has no hope to ever become a respectable figure, as he hypocritically worships a god yet displays insolence towards real people and ideas that are worthy of reverence. this complements the idea that being good isn't only about possessing favorable traits and abilities, but also about cultivating them through good habits. there are too many epic scenes in this film to list them all here. there are the escapes of tuco from the gallows after blondie shoots the rope that holds him aloft. there's tuco's surreptitious entry through blondie's window at the inn, the bathtub gun-pull scene, the bombing of branston bridge. the fact that the captain witnesses the explosion of that ""damn bridge"" that he wanted so badly to see annihilated, while he lays wounded and just as he dies quietly upon the neighboring hill.....still gives me chills when i think about it. a truly poetic and uplifting moment that was. but what truly ties all these great aspects of this film together is the musical score by ennio morricone. it is absolutely magnificent -- as good as any music you will ever hear. it penetrates the mind and brings the action and emotions of the set and the characters right to you, be it during the ethereal scene that features tuco's epic frolic through the cemetery in pursuit of the grave, during the three-man shootout shortly following that (which is an incredible innovation by sergio leone that makes you wonder how it had never been attempted before), or during the poignant scenes at the yankee camp when prisoners were forced to play that nostalgic sounding music against their own will. i have never heard a soundtrack so powerful as the one that guides the good, the bad, and the ugly, and perhaps that is fitting, since i can't say i have ever seen a film as undoubtedly splendid as the good, the bad, and the ugly.";22 August 2011;10;['few', 'first', 'actual', 'indelible', 'wild', 'civil', 'laden', 'ambivalent', 'entertaining', 'other', 'vast', 'other', 'common', 'great', 'other', 'quintessential',

605;bobbaxter;the basic plot of the good, the bad and the ugly has been done before. in fact, the film inverts the premise of treasure of the sierra madre. in treasure, the three men searching for the gold worked as a team. the team broke down because of external pressure (the bandits) and internal pressure (fred c. dobb's paranoia). in the good, the bad and the ugly, the three men searching for the gold never team up. they are kept apart by internal pressure (the fact that one of them is a murdering sadist) and external pressure (the ebb and flow of the civil war). in treasure, only one member of the team knew how to find gold. here, the location of the gold is a secret. two men know opposite halves of the secret. blondie (clint eastwood) knows a name on a grave. tuco ramirez (eli wallach) knows the name of the cemetery. their shared secret forces the two men into an uneasy alliance. the third seeker is angel eyes (lee van cleef), a professional killer. he has learned about the gold from one of his victims. the opening and ennio morricone's unique theme music set the tone: this will be a harsh, gritty, offbeat film. freeze-frames tell us which character will be good (blondie), which will be bad (angel eyes) and which will be ugly (tuco). the difference between the three men isn't motive, since they all want the same thing. what sets them apart from each other is what they are willing to do to get it. angel eyes will torture and kill anybody who gets in his way. tuco is a bully and a loudmouth, but he only kills in self-defense. blondie is quiet and intelligent, a planner who carefully works out every detail well in advance. the good, the bad and the ugly is set in a harsh, unforgiving landscape. the quest for the gold takes our characters through a desert, a prison camp, a war-ravaged frontier town, a civil war battle and, finally the cemetery where the inevitable showdown happens. the few outposts of civilization huddle against a vast, imposing wilderness. in such places, even the best man has to be a little bit bad and ugly to survive.;11 July 2006;9;['basic', 'bad', 'ugly', 'external', 'internal', 'bad', 'ugly', 'internal', 'external', 'civil', 'opposite', 'shared', 'secret', 'uneasy', 'third', 'professional', 'unique', 'harsh', 'gritty', 'offbeat', 'good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'motive', 'same', 'other', 'willing', 'quiet', 'intelligent', 'bad', 'ugly', 'harsh', 'unforgiving', 'civil', 'inevitable', 'few', 'vast', 'such', 'good', 'little', 'bad', 'ugly'];-0.1635416666666666

607;joberthefboom;"i've been watching a lot of classics lately and sergio leone's masterpiece couldn't be left out. i was a bit hesitant at first to watch it because i generally don't care much for westerns. but it sure was well worth the time. the story starts rather slow and throughout the movie there isn't al that much dialogue. the dialogue that is being said though, is absolute gold and the entire movie is filled with memorable quotes that will stick with you for a long time. the cinematography draws you in and combined with the slow pace makes for a unique experience. you get completely lost in the beautiful landscape and it puts you in a place you don't want to get out of. the movie can be considered long, with a runtime of nearly three hours, but you find yourself wishing for more when it is over. i also wonder if there were ever three more compelling characters put together than 'the good' (clint eastwood), 'the bad' (lee van cleef) and 'the ugly' (eli wallach). three completely different characters that work so well together on screen and bring with them a continuous tension that puts you at the edge of your seat. eastwood's 'blondie' is the most fascinating character of the three. a man of few words but everything he says and does is coolness personified. he brings with him the illusion of being the good guy and of having a moral center while killing his way to $200,000 in stolen gold. van cleef's 'angel eyes' is evil personified in the story. with those menacing eyes you sense right away that he is ruthless in everything he does. but still you're never quite sure what he is up to and he keeps you guessing as to what his next move will be. wallach's 'tuco' is a very complex character on his own. having no problem in lying and deceiving to get what he wants. yet you can't help to have a little bit of sympathy for him and he is responsible for some of the funniest lines in the movie. ""i get dressed, i kill him, be right back."" the legendary score put together by ennio morricone is absolute perfection and brings a perfect sound to the amazing images. tuco running through the cemetery whilst you hear ""the ecstacy of gold"" is one of the most memorable scenes i've ever seen in cinema. it is hard to find a more perfect half hour on film than the last thirty minutes of this western epic. how sergio leone manages to turn a stare down between three people in to one of the best and most exciting sequences put together is sheer excellence. go watch this movie if you haven't already, you'll be glad you did.";1 June 2020;9;['hesitant', 'worth', 'slow', 'much', 'absolute', 'entire', 'memorable', 'long', 'slow', 'unique', 'beautiful', 'more', 'more', 'compelling', 'bad', 'ugly', 'different', 'continuous', 'fascinating', 'few', 'good', 'moral', 'menacing', 'ruthless', 'sure', 'next', 'tuco', 'complex', 'own', 'little', 'responsible', 'legendary', 'absolute', 'perfect', 'amazing', 'memorable', 'hard', 'perfect', 'half', 'last', 'western', 'good', 'exciting', 'sheer', 'glad'];0.1665650406504064

609;gotham23;"(minor spoiler at the end of this review) americans love westerns. at least, we used to. the film era began just as the american frontier was closing, and it's only natural that the cinema took its place. without a frontier to explore, a certain part of the american identity vanished. so we turned to film. so why is it that until ""unforgiven"" won the oscar in '92, the american western had all but disappeared from mainstream film? some might tell you that sci-fi took its place (""space, the final frontier""). others might say that we simply lost interest in the subject. the truth is that leone (not even an american!) created such a masterpiece here that he practically killed the genre. he didn't just raise the bar. he lifted it into the stratosphere. is it any wonder that other filmmakers were afraid to follow in his footsteps? what makes this film so good, you ask? what doesn't??? the locales and landscapes are amazing. the set design is incredible. the score (like anything from ennicione) is a work of art. the writing is superb. the directing: masterful. the acting? out of this world. wallach, van cleef, and eastwood couldn't have been more perfect for their parts. eastwood especially. it's ironic that his character (""the man with no name"", otherwise known as ""blondie"") is referred to as ""the good"" considering that all three of them seem to lack any true morals or ethics. but that's part of what makes his performance so impressive. just like pacino did in ""the godfather"", eastwood gives us a man that brings out our sympathy and empathy without truly being a ""protagonist"" in the classic sense of the word. logically, there's no reason why we should root for him over the other guys, but we can't stop ourselves. leone knows this, and seems to intentionally drive the point home with the climax when he breaks the cardinal rule of westerns: the ""good guy"" never shoots first. every movie fan needs to see this, especially those that ""don't like"" westerns.";13 March 2004;10;['minor', 'least', 'american', 'natural', 'certain', 'american', 'unforgiven', 'american', 'final', 'other', 'afraid', 'good', 'amazing', 'set', 'incredible', 'superb', 'masterful', 'perfect', 'ironic', 'true', 'impressive', 'classic', 'other', 'cardinal', 'good'];0.305952380952381

622;michaelsjmurphy;some films must be seen on the big screen to be appreciated. the good, the bad, and the ugly is a big film, maybe best left to big-screen viewing. nevertheless, there is much to be said in a video rental. the characters might seem to be cardboard cutouts on the surface, but upon close inspection, the viewer sees amazing subtlety. the cinematography is every bit as good as anything produced out of hollywood, and the italian locations sure look a lot like the american southwest. morricone's music may be the finest of the entire western genre. leone's debt to kurosawa is obvious here, but his inventive use of close-up and cut-away to build tension in this film may be unparalleled in the history of cinema.;29 November 1999;10;['big', 'bad', 'ugly', 'big', 'big', 'much', 'close', 'amazing', 'good', 'italian', 'fine', 'entire', 'western', 'obvious', 'inventive', 'unparalleled'];0.0726190476190476
623;Wormtongue1;i have no doubt that purists would rank the good, the bad, and the ugly (gb&u) quite a way down in their list of the greatest westerns, but i consider this film easily to be in the top five, if not the top three. i don't know the genre well enough to say if gb&u was genuinely ground-breaking in its approach to the tried-and-true classic, but i am always impressed by its panache, its bravado, its earthy atmosphere, its interesting camera shots, its top-notch soundtrack, and the chemistry of its stars. one of the things that distinguishes gb&u from other westerns for me is the quest model that the film follows. after developing the characters played by clint eastwood, lee van cleef, and eli wallach, the film brings them together into a series of adventures (mostly misadventures) that tie together into a larger quest. the result makes the viewer feel that the he has been pulled into a larger-than-life tale of epic proportions, and yet the less glorified reality of gb&u is that of three men of varying levels of disreputability vying against one another for a fortune in gold coins. although i'm sure that gb&u didn't introduce moral ambiguity into the western, it does so both successfully and memorably. the central characters are all anti-heroes, the plot revolves around a fairly base motivation (i.e., greed), and the backdrop of the civil war provides director sergio leone with an opportunity to expose the inhumanity and hypocrisy of war. truth, justice, and glory are not held up as eternal values in this film, yet gb&u nevertheless shows how even morally ambiguous characters set within an amoral environment can still carve out an occasional bit of humanity or simple decency in spite of themselves. i've seen gb&u probably at least a dozen times, and each time i'm pulled in as completely as i was the last. simply put, it is a very good western--well worth the three hours of viewing time.;3 January 2000;10;['bad', 'ugly', 'great', 'top', 'top', 'true', 'earthy', 'interesting', 'top', 'other', 'large', 'large', 'epic', 'glorified', 'sure', 'moral', 'western', 'central', 'anti', 'base', 'civil', 'eternal', 'ambiguous', 'amoral', 'occasional', 'simple', 'least', 'last', 'good', 'western', 'worth'];0.1063988095238094

628;mtiller12;"""the good, the bad and the ugly"" was sergio leone's third film in the dollar trilogy and is easily the best. taking place around the civil war, the film revolves around three men, the good in blondie (clint eastwood), the bad in angel eyes (lee van cleef) and the ugly in tuco (eli wallach). all three men have knowledge about a grave of gold and the uneasy alliances formed to achieve their goal in retrieving the cash is what the film is about. ""once upon a time in the west"" is sometimes touted as the pinacle in leone's career but this film is where he will be remembered. nearly every scene in this film is a classic and defines everything about leone's skills, talents and his style of directing and story telling. cinematography is excellent with gritty locations and vast green landscapes capturing the screen. performances are perfect with wallach leading the way, playing a character who is not just the film's comic point but a complete character and not just someone to laugh at to loosen tension. eastwood's man with no name (he adopts blondie) shows new depth to his acting and his delivery never falters, playing a character now iconic. lastly van cleef plays angel eyes in one of the best villain turns in history. memorable, slick and chilling he is a person you struggle to hold your nerve around, cleef holds the character together and with little screen time shows what an effect he can have on an audience. characters in a leone film are people you will never forget, lines, stances, the eyes. characters very core are not left exposed and stay with you. morricone is genius in music and his most memorable score is here, i think ""once upon a time in america"" is his best score but this is his most unforgettable and has the greatest theme in any picture. morricone is a man on par with leone for excellence and does the film credit. now onto the greatest achievment, the directing. sergio leone made in total about seven films, this stands as his best in his field. some directors take in favour style over substance or vice versa, leone takes both into maximum consideration and is why his films are unique. what you see is as important as what you hear, this applies to viewers who dislike his observing technique. leone respects the viewer and entices them in every scene to be a part of the action on screen.

640;Cartoonyloonie;the good, the bad, and the ugly directed by sergio leone is often regarded as one of the best films ever made, well a lot of films that serve a great inspiration to movies of the same genre past it, are often labeled under that category. however, whether you have seen this picture or not, you have most likely heard its theme song in the past, even if you are not necessarily into movies. the main narrative, revolves around three men, on the search for bill carson $200,000 worth of gold buried in sad hill cemetery with each one, wanting all of the prize to themselves, or so it seems. before the release of this film, sergio was known for his work on silence motion pictures, which explains the lack of dullness and exposition present in this movie. instead sergio is more known as a director that prefers situation over story lines, the characters find out about their problems around the same time, that the audiences do which makes it feel like you are also part of the situation. the cinematography of this picture, also compliments this point, as what ever is not included in the frame of the shot, not only can't the audiences see it, but the characters within the frame will not be able to see anyone that lays outside it. this is a great technique to subvert the audiences expectations of the given moment, when the viewers see a character surrounded by an obstacle that just so happens to seem unescapable, they may never know for sure, if the character time is up until its really over for them, as their help could easily be a couple inches away from the frame of the camera. the same thing goes for when the characters appear to be in a favourable and safe position, the danger could just be a few feet away, which also subverts our expectations, as if the characters feel like they are in control, it will make the viewers go under a false sense of security, therefore if the danger does approach, it tricks both the audience and the people within the frame. sergio leone, years of silence film making, comes into play when it comes to constructing suspense prior to the hits of an action sequence. he does this by lingering around the same pattern of switching shots between the character's faces, and cutting back to the previous character several times, when ever an important battle is about to go down. this is a great way of showing the evolution of a person's thought process, during the heat of the moment, as the character's plot their strike. he is also great at visual foreshadowing, for instances, when the first character to make a move, is about to strike, during that specific character thought process evolution, he would have multiple shots cut to that person's weapon, which shows the person that is going to deliver the first blow. however, what separates the tension developing process in this film, over other movies is the score by ennio morricone, without his theme, it wouldn't sell the importance of a situation as much as he did. every time it plays, it comes off as like a ticking time bomb, where if one of the characters don't take the proper steps fast enough, they wouldn't come out alive. in conclusion this film is one of the best movies ever made, there are never any moments that feel dull or to drag the runtime, each scene has a reason for being there. however a nitpick that i would have with this film,(a small thing) is that sometimes there are moments that come off as way too convenient, like when two characters split up without plaining to meet each other at a certain time, somehow find each other again in a matter of minutes without supposing to. also there was a scene where, just before a character is about to be finished, get saved by a cannonball from out of no where, that just so happens to land into the exact house that this person is in. overall through, this film is a masterpiece, it feels much less than 2 hours and 58, there are so many intense moments from start to finish, with some of the best cinematography of all time considering the time it was made. this film is a gift to cinema, and has accomplished many aspects of film making and beyond, that no other western film can replicate to this day.;27 August 2021;10;['bad', 'ugly', 'good', 'great', 'same', 'main', 'sad', 'present', 'known', 'same', 'able', 'great', 'unescapable', 'sure', 'same', 'favourable', 'safe', 'few', 'false', 'same', 'previous', 'several', 'important', 'about', 'great', 'great', 'visual', 'first', 'about', 'specific', 'multiple', 'first', 'other', 'proper', 'alive', 'good', 'dull', 'small', 'convenient', 'other', 'certain', 'other', 'about', 'exact', 'less', 'many', 'intense', 'good', 'many', 'other', 'western'];0.1308170995670995

644;freddymeister;"growing up, there are certain things that you identify with, perhaps sounds, images, or smells; things that make you smile. for me, the one thing that does it all the time, is the musical score for ""the good, the bad, and the ugly"". every time i hear it, all i can think about is eli wallach's great grin, clint eastwood's stoic gaze, and lee van cleef's evil eyes. all in great fun, director sergio leone's western epic marked the high point for this genre, and showed that you could do a classy movie in which the leading characters do awful things such as: 1) double-cross each other constantly; 2) kill more than their share of men; 3) condone greed at its fullest form. the movie has the three main characters, eastwood, a.k.a. ""blondie"", as the good (if you can consider him the good guy in this role), wallach, a.k.a. ""tuco"", as the ugly, and van cleef, a.k.a. ""angel eyes"", as the bad. all three of them are going after the gold, as blondie and tuco, while they were settling some scores between them, happened to have a casual meeting with a moribund soldier, who told them about it, and head in one of the most entertaining journeys in cinematic history. the fact that leone chose the civil war as the backdrop for his story, only created a sort of ""irony"", as there they were, young american men dying for something that they believed in, and here we have our three main characters weaseling their way through one of the battles, in order to get the gold. truly classic!!!! the score by ennio morricone is in itself a main character of the movie, and it really creates that familiarity that every movie needs to have, in order to make a connection with its audience. the showdown at the end of the movie, has got to be one of the best climax moments ever shot, and ever seen on film (i only wonder how it never makes it into any of clint eastwood's highlight reels, during the ceremonies where they salute him). and the ending of the movie, only glorifies it more for its fans. i have to say, having watched more movies than i count in my lifestyle, that ""the good, the bad & the ugly"" is one of the top 5 films that i have ever seen. the movie runs over two and a half hours, and i have seen it over 20 times, yet, it never gets old. this is a true gem, and one movie that is worth watching, if only because it carries the tag of ""the best western ever filmed"". i know that it is somewhat contradictory to admit that an italian director produced the best film of this very american genre, but you gotta give leone his due, because he managed to create a true masterpiece. i love this film.";25 September 2003;10;['certain', 'musical', 'bad', 'ugly', 'great', 'stoic', 'evil', 'great', 'western', 'high', 'classy', 'awful', 'such', 'double', 'other', 'more', 'full', 'main', 'good', 'good', 'ugly', 'bad', 'casual', 'moribund', 'entertaining', 'cinematic', 'civil', 'young', 'american', 'main', 'classic', 'main', 'good', 'more', 'bad', 'ugly', 'top', 'old', 'true', 'worth', 'good', 'western', 'contradictory', 'italian', 'good', 'american', 'true'];0.0689756367663344

655;travised87;"a great many people of our current ipod generation have missed out on some of the most brilliant, daring and artistic endeavours in film during the sixties and seventies. that was a period when film still held onto its artistic impulse, when the modern day blockbuster, complete with stunning visual effects, mind-bogglingly fast action sequences, and miraculously thin story lines and characterisations was still in its infancy. over time, as some nostalgic folk of the 'then' would say, 'the world has become too fast, and kids today don't give a damn about deeper stuff'. indeed it has; through the development of film over the decades, we see - at least a glimpse of - this seemingly reductive summarisation of the vast social and cultural changes in the world. the legendary final scene of this film, where the three principal characters face, is roughly about five minutes long, from the time they implicitly agree to this 'solution' to the first 'bang' of eastwood's pistol. in these five minutes, leone uses music and recurring shots of the men to create the tension, engineering a sense of finality and fatality in the situation that could quite possibly take all their lives. at that critical moment, greater importance is given to this all-encompassing tension, where the entire film's plot and the journey must culminate in a decisive end, than to the eventual outcome, which would be revealed in all eventuality. as audience, leone wants us to participate in this tension, to completely transport ourselves into the simmering, immoral west, and feel the presence of death as the characters do, and therefore to achieve a cinematic orgasm that involves both the intellectual and visceral, in turn immortalising it. this painstaking attention to detail, the need to go beyond the bare plot and action, and the urge to create a cinematic environment that transcends, is something that we see too little of today. indeed, we are privy to this intellectual desire from the very start. the first shot in the film, of the brusque, brutally masculine face of a minor character (who returns later) that somehow eerily seems directly born out of the harshness of the desert is wonderful example of heightened realism that epitomised films of that time. we can almost smell and feel the sweat on the man's face; we can delve into his eyes, into his soul, and through it, witness the moral degradation that leone wants us to observe. this film could easily have been given a title, with something to the effect of earning some 'dollars', as are the other two in the trilogy, but leone decides to punctuate it with an exposition on morality with the title he gives it. as any discerning viewer would infer, it is dichotomous to the nature of the pertinent characters. all three are 'ugly', and leone tries of remind us with his concluding piece that morality is a vague, invariably overlapping concept that is too often oversimplified. using the west as a setting, we realise that people are too complex, too evil to start with, and any attempt to glorify one is to shun this gruesome reality. this perfectly explains the unique collection of faces in the film, with are all polished with the desert's sweat that makes them impenetrable to scrutiny of any kind. the three adjectives that form the title function almost completely on one side of the moral boundary. and yet, no one can call the film entirely immoral or fatalistic, for we witness traces of humanity in the most absurd of circumstances. blondie offering a cigar to a dying soldier and providing him warmth is once example of this. understanding this moral equation, we can then justify the labels given to the three protagonists. unlike the other two, blondie keeps his sadistic impulses to a minimum. also, he tellingly suggests the method of resolution to decide the recipient of the money which leads to the final confrontation scene. most notably though, he underlines his seeming sense of fairness by taking his rightful share of the money, albeit making it impossible for tuco to collect his. unlike him, angel eyes shows no pretence of such selflessness, and is perfectly willing to brutalise tuco (another chilling scene) to get the secret out of him. however, even he believes in simply completing his job, and would not resort to perfidy that tuco is culpable of, making him the 'ugly' version of humanity. as we see, all three differ from one another only in degree, unlike the ironic suggestion of the title. overall, this is a complete auteur's film, where leone underscores memorable action sequences with great atmospheric detail and an underlying message that is so finely sewed beneath the more palpable layers that most of us tend to overlook it completely. this may not be the pinnacle of artistic cinema of 'that' time, but it reflects the sophistication a film can manifest beneath the superficial layers. its slowly unraveling scenes and attention to detail is reminder to all of us to stop, and sometimes look at life with a keener eye, instead of being constantly pre-occupied with our daily, routine existence.";17 December 2007;8;['great', 'many', 'current', 'ipod', 'brilliant', 'daring', 'artistic', 'artistic', 'modern', 'complete', 'stunning', 'visual', 'fast', 'thin', 'nostalgic', 'fast', 'deep', 'least', 'reductive', 'vast', 'social', 'cultural', 'legendary', 'final', 'principal', 'first', 'critical', 'great', 'entire', 'decisive', 'eventual', 'immoral', 'cinematic', 'intellectual', 'visceral', 'painstaking', 'bare', 'cinematic', 'little', 'privy', 'intellectual', 'very', 'first', 'minor', 'wonderful', 'heightened', 'moral', 'other', 'dichotomous', 'pertinent', 'ugly', 'complex', 'evil', 'gruesome', 'unique', 'impenetrable', 'moral', 'immoral', 'fatalistic', 'absurd', 'moral', 'other', 'sadistic', 'final', 'seeming', 'rightful', 'impossible', 'tuco', 'such', 'willing', 'chilling', 'culpable', 'ugly', 'ironic', 'complete', 'memorable', 'great', 'atmospheric', 'palpable', 'most', 'artistic', 'superficial', 'daily', 'routine'];0.0704861111111111

absurd. additionally blondie is unrealistically accurate with his rifle, which makes crucial elements of the plot hard to believe. the cartridges of early repeating rifles were weak so he couldn't possibly have hit that far shot to save tuco at the end, especially from a standing position. and even at close range, shooting a rope is extremely hard, yet we have to believe that he's done it reliably time and again with moments to spare before tuco chokes out or a sheriff shoots back. the civil war battle scene was silly, starting with the gratuitous use of excessively large artillery which wouldn't have a place at a new mexico river crossing and whose practical effects were equally unconvincing. and of course all the cannon shells exploded on impact, no realistic fuses or canister shot, and i don't recall a single shot of a cannon actually being reloaded - all bad movie tropes which make the scene hard to believe. i got the sense that the director was (consciously or otherwise) trying to portray civil war new mexico with the zeitgeist surrounding wwi on the western front: ruinous, explosive artillery bombardment in the trenches followed by pointless charges over the top to please the higher command. that inappropriate transposition of themes made the battle scene feel uncreative and disconnected from the historical period. additionally, the practice of two sides simultaneously charging into the bridge at each other was completely illogical, it would clearly be better to sit in the trenches and defend while the enemy bottlenecks through the bridge. i know that part of the vision of the film was to communicate the senselessness of war, but portraying both armies as having implausibly stupid leadership isn't a good way achieve that. the famous final scene was very cool with the running through the graves but then it went off the rails. first, i was able to deduce the truth about the treasure after arch stanton's grave turned up empty. the only way that blondie could know that there was a grave for ""arch stanton"" would be that the treasure clue said something about arch stanton, he couldn't have just made up a name that coincidentally belonged to someone at that cemetery. so the clue would have to mention stanton's grave, and an unmarked grave right next to it would be the obvious answer. tuco or angel eyes should have been able to figure this out and then realize that they didn't need to keep blondie alive anymore. or blondie should have been smart enough to foresee this problem and not try that plan in the first place. additionally, it doesn't make any sense why blondie pretended to write the real name onto the rock, nor does it make sense why he got the three of them into that standoff. actions which did nothing but increase his disposability in the eyes of the other two, putting him in greater danger of being killed. i think blondie is meant to be a moral or spiritual character who does things to serve a bigger purpose beyond himself, to provide some kind of lesson or poetic justice to tuco and angel eyes. yet the details of such a characterization and how it might explain his actions are totally unintelligible to me at least from a first watch. by far the most obvious explanation is that the director imagined it would be really cool to have this three-way standoff scene so he just had the main character do something to make it happen, without regard for actual logic and characterization. and once you notice that, the scene isn't so cool anymore. the movie is too long, it's a relatively simple plot with too many filler scenes which are not efficient at characterizing the trio. the tuco-blondie dynamic was good at least. one odd thing is that the movie makes a big deal in the beginning about angel eyes always following contracts, yet it never reincorporates that later in the film.";22 March 2022;5;['poor', 'sound', 'audio', 'poor', 'sound', 'grating', 'many', 'western', 'ridiculous', 'real', 'absurd', 'accurate', 'crucial', 'hard', 'early', 'weak', 'close', 'hard', 'sheriff', 'civil', 'silly', 'gratuitous', 'large', 'practical', 'unconvincing', 'realistic', 'single', 'bad', 'hard', 'civil', 'western', 'ruinous', 'explosive', 'pointless', 'high', 'inappropriate', 'uncreative', 'historical', 'other', 'illogical', 'well', 'stupid', 'good', 'famous', 'final', 'cool', 'able', 'empty', 'only', 'unmarked', 'obvious', 'able', 'alive', 'smart', 'first', 'real', 'other', 'great', 'moral', 'spiritual', 'big', 'poetic', 'unintelligible', 'least', 'first', 'obvious', 'cool', 'main', 'actual', 'cool', 'long', 'simple', 'many', 'efficient', 'good', 'least', 'odd', 'big'];0.0298809523809523

699;chrisjcousens;the good, the bad and the ugly is rightly called a classic. regardless of where you place it in your own list of the greatest films ever made, it will most likely be near the top. and that is what makes this such a classic it is more than just a damn good western. it is a damn good film. plot simple. there is some buried gold. three lawless gunslingers are after it. they continue to run into each other and this gives the film momentum during the first two hours. so much has already been written about this film that it is impossible to sum up all of its influences and innovations. the haunting whistles of the first moments of the title sequence are instantly recognisable even to those who have never seen a western. clint eastwood is instantly recognisable in a career-making role. no matter your verdict, this is an immensely important film. director sergio leone has a sense for painful irony. 'the good', eastwood's character, begins the film by double crossing his partner (eli wallach's conflicted tuco, 'the ugly') and leaving him in the desert. this irony goes to the level of sight and sound. as 'the bad' (lee van cleef's angel eyes) tortures his victims at a civil war p.o.w. camp, he orders the other prisoners to play their instruments to drown out the screams. the expressions on the faces of the musicians speaks volumes, and is more affecting to a modern audience than the scenes of torture themselves, gorged as we are on saw and hostel. it is this attention to storytelling detail in every frame of the film that makes it so rich and deep. how film-making has changed. while the film is long and slow, it has to be. the tension built up in the early parts of the film is punctuated by brief flashes of action, but it is the waiting before the action sequences that grabs you by the insides and slowly squeezes. there are ideas and emotions being played with in this film that cannot be quickly explained or unravelled, and these need the full three hours of the film to come to their conclusion. with the luxury of time, leone is able to make a shared meal as tense and troubling as the moment, hands on guns, before a shootout. even if you think the middle sections of the film dragged somewhat (philistine!) the finale is something special. in so many ways, it is the perfect climax to a film filled with moments of brilliance. there are too many parts to the film, too many special moments, to comment on any more, so i will simply say that this is a film i should have seen long before i did finally watch it. it is a film that, if you haven't seen, you should as soon as possible. and if you have seen it, a second, third or fifty-seventh viewing is in order. this film has quality that we are not given the privilege to see very often.;15 July 2010;10;['bad', 'ugly', 'own', 'great', 'more', 'good', 'western', 'good', 'lawless', 'other', 'first', 'much', 'impossible', 'first', 'recognisable', 'western', 'recognisable', 'important', 'painful', 'double', 'conflicted', 'ugly', 'bad', 'civil', 'other', 'modern', 'rich', 'deep', 'long', 'slow', 'early', 'brief', 'unravelled', 'full', 'able', 'tense', 'troubling', 'middle', 'philistine', 'special', 'many', 'perfect', 'many', 'many', 'special', 'more', 'possible', 'second', 'third', 'seventh'];0.1084821428571428
700;DaveInTheCave;"well, this is my first review, so i thought it might as well be for my favorite film. i just love everything about this film, the writing, the cinematography, the cast, ennio morricone's score, everything. even the title gives the film more depth as the film has to prove to you that blondie is the good, tuco is the ugly and angel eyes is the bad. each is proved in a different way. with blondie, we have serious doubts when we first see the title ""the good"" under his picture right after he leaves tuco in the desert. as the movie goes on we slowly come to realize that though he may not be a saint, he is certainly better than his two counterparts, this is proved at the very end when he allows tuco to keep his share of the gold, even though he could have easily taken it all for himself. this is something we cannot imagine angel eyes or tuco doing. with tuco, it's different, we first see ""the ugly"" title when we first see him and we are not even sure what it means, the best conclusion we can come to perhaps is that he certainly doesn't look very attractive in the scene. but we later see that 'ugly' is meant to mean pitiful in this situation, because although tuco is a vile character, we pity him because we find out about his past. finally there's angel eyes, with him we have no doubts about the text ""the bad"" which appears after he murders his employer, this certitude of his evil nature is reaffirmed throughout the film. so the character development in this film seems not so much to be with the characters but with our own perception of them. opinions vary about what the film really is. is it a satire of westerns? is it a an antiwar film? is it camp? is it art? is it all of these things maybe? i think perhaps leone left the film to the viewers own interpretation, and that, i suppose, is the way art is. this films does have a few small flaws: 1.the ecstasy of gold scene is a little unbelievable, could a person like tuco, who seems to struggle with reading, find the name on a grave while running through a graveyard in circles? this scene is also a little hard to watch because the camera follows tuco very fast, causing the screen to blur. this does work artistically however as it seems to have present a ""blinded with greed"" metaphor. 2. there are a few other unrealistic scenes, such as the one where tuco and blondie walk through an abandoned town and kill angel eyes men , conveniently placed cannon shots aid them and they kill men shooting from the hip, while the angel eyes men carefully aim and miss. the flaws in this film are easily outweighed by it's strengths however: 1. the characters are very well written and portrayed. 2. the pacing is superb (it seemed no longer then a fistful of dollars really). 3. the story, while not one of the films stronger aspects, is still very good. 4. the dialog is brilliant. 5. it has one of the greatest scores of all time. 6. the cinematography is stunning. il buono, il brutto, il cattivo is truly a great piece of cinema.";22 May 2011;10;['first', 'favorite', 'more', 'good', 'ugly', 'bad', 'different', 'serious', 'good', 'well', 'very', 'tuco', 'different', 'ugly', 'sure', 'good', 'attractive', 'ugly', 'pitiful', 'vile', 'bad', 'evil', 'much', 'own', 'antiwar', 'few', 'small', 'little', 'unbelievable', 'little', 'hard', 'tuco', 'few', 'other', 'unrealistic', 'such', 'superb', 'strong', 'good', 'brilliant', 'great', 'stunning', 'great'];0.0988425925925925

705;wizzardSS;and so concludes the spaghetti western dollars trilogy. following a fistful of dollars and for a few dollars more, the good, the bad and the ugly is the final film in sergio leone's trilogy that redefined the traditional american western. many people have described this film as the best western ever made. without a doubt, as a standalone film, the good, the bad and the ugly is simply superb. the complex relationships between the three protagonists had me on the edge of my seat throughout the film, never knowing if they were going to work together or kill each other in cold blood. the soundtrack too is utterly iconic. while i associated the predecessor's tones with cowboy music, i often associate the whole western genre with the good, the bad and the ugly's backing tune. it has also become quintessential as the accompanying music to any stand off, whether it be in a parody or simply on the school playground. any fan of the series will know that eastwood's character appears alongside van cleef's character in for a few dollars more. this would be my only criticism of the good, the bad and the ugly, as this previous relationship has been forgotten (or is cleverly disguised in the fickleness of the characters) as they both appear to not know the other exists. as a result of the latter paragraph, i have literally spent days deliberating over whether to mark the film down. it did make the film more confusing for me - but only as i'd seen the previous two films in the trilogy. but, crucially, sergio leone's trilogy is rarely marketed as a trilogy set piece and the films can be watched standalone. anyone who watches the good, the bad and the ugly by itself will happily watch the film in sweet ignorant bliss of my character confusion. so, as a standalone film, the good, the bad and the ugly is the pinnacle of sergio leone's western renaissance. simply brilliant.;8 August 2012;9;['spaghetti', 'western', 'few', 'bad', 'ugly', 'final', 'traditional', 'american', 'many', 'good', 'western', 'standalone', 'bad', 'ugly', 'superb', 'complex', 'other', 'cold', 'iconic', 'cowboy', 'whole', 'western', 'bad', 'quintessential', 'few', 'more', 'only', 'bad', 'ugly', 'previous', 'other', 'latter', 'confusing', 'previous', 'standalone', 'bad', 'ugly', 'sweet', 'ignorant', 'standalone', 'bad', 'ugly', 'western', 'brilliant'];-0.1414414414414414

711;pandeyharsh-87822;"it was a pretty good film. as it has been throughout the trilogy, morricone's music is phenomenal yet again. it gave me chills when the trio entered the final circle thanks to an iconic score. although i enjoyed the last two hours more or less i can't help but notice the flaws in the plot and how it is progressing. first of all the first hour drags a lot, it is whole exposition, establishing relationship between the good, the bad & the ugly and giving us a proper context for the three characters. but some scenes there felt unnecessary and dragged on for too long. i was bored by that first hour but it really picks up after that till the end. the plot seems too convenient and dumb at times. although i liked another theme of the civil war being introduced in the film, i didn't liked how the cannon shots were conveniently dropping around ""the good"" as he just can't die. it was like he didn't just had skills but also a lot of luck on his side. the bridge exploding scene is also not executed very well. they just carry a giant box with ""explosives"" written on it and nobody even questions it. they were able to plant those and get back to safety and then survive the canon shower afterwards pretty easily, very convenient again. some of the characters also seem pretty dumb in the choices they make. i felt like it took me out of the film, because either the characters are too naive & dumb or it is manipulated just to keep the three characters alive. i think for a few dollars more is the best of the trilogy. i agree that the camera work, scenes and themes are much better and more complex in this one. the characters, the music, and the plot is much better in the second film of the trilogy in my opinion. this film was missing the organic devlopment or progression of character and plot and it seemed a bit manufactured. after all this it may seem like i hated the film but since it is heralded as one the greatest films of all time i had to point out why it was not so for me. i still enjoyed the film especially for all the action, music and those epic shots of the final sequence, and that one of the whole graveyard with tuco running was so reflective and touching for me. i also appreciate the complex themes it tries to cover which has been a great progression in this trilogy and in the work of sergio leone.";31 January 2022;7;['good', 'phenomenal', 'final', 'iconic', 'last', 'less', 'first', 'whole', 'bad', 'ugly', 'proper', 'unnecessary', 'first', 'convenient', 'dumb', 'civil', 'giant', 'able', 'convenient', 'dumb', 'naive', 'dumb', 'alive', 'few', 'good', 'well', 'complex', 'well', 'second', 'organic', 'great', 'epic', 'final', 'whole', 'reflective', 'complex', 'great'];0.0469444444444444

truly awesome. eli wallach is also great as the rude, dirty and humorous tuco, who provides the bulk of the comedy in the film, especially when interacting with eastwood. lee van cleef as angel eyes is also superb, truly pulling off a great villain. he's calm, ruthless and brutal and always has a presence when he's in the shot, standing out with his piercingly calm eyes. each character has great dialogue, with memorable phrases and one-liners and each have their moment in the film to shine. their personalities, dialogue and looks, portrayed by a great cast, provides some of the coolest, most unique characters ever put to film. the cinematography in this movie is astounding. leone as a director is exceptional, always favouring the extreme long shots to get a feel for the location. the film is continuously breathtaking with its large, epic shots that capture the beauty of the west. every frame of this film, is indeed a painting. not only is the cinematography exceptional in the travelling and dialogue sequences of the film, it also excels in its action segments. a variety of long sweeping shots and precise close ups to eyes and guns brilliantly conveys tension in these scenes. nothing is boring, everything is riveting. the quick cuts are never done during the action, but only leading up to it to effectively build the atmosphere of the showdowns, which are shot in a way in which doesn't confuse the audience and prominently displays the violence of the film. it feels gritty and real mixed with the myth-like invincibility of the main characters that lead them through showdowns and war-scale battles to a final showdown of epic proportions. it really gives the film an epic scale and never shies away from the drama and violence within the film, effectively capturing action and character emotions to portray a brilliant visual story. and how can i not talk about the score. ennio morricone, my favourite composer and easily one of the best, provides an astounding western score to solidify this film into history. it's epic and atmospheric and fits the movie so well. the movie's theme is brilliant and iconic, unique and memorable earning its place with the likes of jaws, star wars and terminator. morricone's score fits in beautifully with the excellent cinematography, which really helps to further add to the atmosphere of the setting. it's an iconic and brilliant score, suitable for the greatest western film of all time. overall, everything in this film just comes together perfectly. everything. sure, it's 3 hour run time isn't everybody's cup of tea but you should at least treat yourself to this epic at least once before you die. it's characters, cinematography, music, etc is all perfect. it is a perfect film. it has stood the test of time and will continue to do so for many more decades. a cinematic masterpiece. the western to rule all westerns. and not a bad pick for the greatest film of all time if i do say so myself.";4 July 2016;10;['old', 'many', 'epic', 'insignificant', 'great', 'western', 'good', 'simple', 'simple', 'typical', 'bad', 'funny', 'bad', 'good', 'unique', 'simplistic', 'great', 'other', 'dark', 'sinister', 'amazing', 'memorable', 'simple', 'same', 'western', 'open', 'bloody', 'civil', 'entire', 'epic', 'simple', 'great', 'memorable', 'simple', 'epic', 'wild', 'great', 'good', 'bad', 'like', 'awesome', 'great', 'rude', 'dirty', 'humorous', 'superb', 'great', 'calm', 'ruthless', 'brutal', 'calm', 'great', 'memorable', 'great', 'cool', 'unique', 'astounding', 'exceptional', 'extreme', 'long', 'large', 'epic', 'exceptional', 'long', 'sweeping', 'precise', 'close', 'boring', 'quick', 'gritty', 'mixed', 'like', 'main', 'final', 'epic', 'epic', 'brilliant', 'visual', 'favourite', 'good', 'astounding', 'western', 'epic', 'atmospheric', 'brilliant', 'iconic', 'unique', 'memorable', 'excellent', 'iconic', 'brilliant', 'suitable', 'great', 'western', 'least', 'least', 'perfect', 'perfect', 'many', 'more', 'cinematic', 'western', 'bad', 'great'];0.2255768286696121

""the good, the bad and the ugly"" is one such ageless piece of work, beautiful to behold. after ""a fistful of dollars"" and ""for a few dollars more"", it is the third part in a series of movies featuring eastwood as ""the man with no name"". the basic story of ""the good, the bad and the ugly"" is actually a simple treasure hunt, but still leone allows himself almost three hours to develop all its details. it is a plot with endless, unexpected twists and turns, making this movie a highly entertaining experience. clint eastwood became an western icon through those movies and we still tend to remember him as ""the man with no name"", even though he left this role behind over thirty years ago. his charismatic, enigmatic, dry portrayal of the laid-back ""blondie"" is stunning and it carries the movie. it is eli wallach, however, who makes the biggest impression as the somewhat dense tuco. he puts so much character in this personality that, no matter how bad he is, we always care and sympathize for him. crowning it with the right amount of humor, slyness, and humanity, wallach puts in one of the most memorable performances in this movie probably everyone has heard ennio morricone's brilliant musical score to ""the good, the bad and the ugly"" at some point or another. its ferocious, war-cry-style main theme is as memorable as it is effective. beside ""once upon a time in the west"", this score is probably his best work ever and helped to stylize the unique image and appeal of italian westerns. it is a magnificent score that perfectly accompanies the movie's many twists, always finds the right note, and helps the audience experience every single scene more fully. the disc has a monaural dolby digital soundtrack, and comes fully dubbed in english, french, and spanish. subtitles are also supplied in english, french, and spanish. ""the good, the bad, and the ugly"" is an exceptional movie for its richness and the peculiarity of being a western set against the violent background of the american civil war. the picture are fantastic and its a real cinema art to the eyes. the way leone timed the music and the pictures are perfection. it is a serious, infectiously humorous movie with striking images and a clever plot. the quality of the dvd is remarkable and makes this movie an all-time favorite of mine. you have to own this. eric. s sweden 7/01-06";7 January 2006;10;['legendary', 'unmatched', 'visual', 'extensive', 'dramatic', 'extreme', 'close', 'complete', 'italian', 'bad', 'ugly', 'such', 'ageless', 'beautiful', 'few', 'third', 'basic', 'bad', 'ugly', 'simple', 'endless', 'unexpected', 'entertaining', 'western', 'charismatic', 'enigmatic', 'dry', 'stunning', 'big', 'dense', 'much', 'bad', 'right', 'memorable', 'brilliant', 'musical', 'bad', 'ugly', 'ferocious', 'main', 'memorable', 'effective', 'good', 'unique', 'italian', 'magnificent', 'many', 'right', 'single', 'monaural', 'digital', 'french', 'spanish', 'french', 'spanish', 'bad', 'ugly', 'exceptional', 'western', 'violent', 'american', 'civil', 'fantastic', 'real', 'serious', 'humorous', 'striking', 'clever', 'remarkable'];0.06375

763;Heimdal_88;'buono, il brutto, il cattivo, il' was at its release in 1966 a very unconventional western epic that follows the travails of three gunfighters looking for $200,000 in stolen confederate gold. also known as 'the good, the bad and the ugly', it was italian-born (rome, 3 january 1929) sergio leone's third so-called spaghetti western after 'per un pugno di dollari', aka 'for a fistful of dollars' (1964) and 'per qualche dollaro in piu', aka 'for a few dollars more' (1965). it is generally considered one of the best films of its kind ever made, a masterpiece, one that almost inexplicably continues to get better with each viewing. in a way, it's a morality play, weighing the consequences of good and evil, but it does so in its realistic portrayal that sometimes, crime does pay, at least in the short term, and sometimes good does go unrewarded. this film ushered in a new concept of a previously all too oft told western story, probably tolling the death knell for the traditional american-made, good guy/ bad guy, white hat/ black hat western that was so prevalent before it. the three main characters of the film are as powerful as leone's brilliant vision of the civil war era america, he used as their backdrop. lee van cleef ('the bad') is evil in the flesh. beedy-eyed and totally ruthless, he believes it only takes one thing to be successful: whatever is necessary. clint eastwood ('the good') is the now legendary 'man with no name', but 'good' only in a western concept of non-traditional good. he has a sometimes detectable and occasionally observable sense of honor that motivates his behavior and conduct from time to time. eli wallach ('the ugly') is tuco, and he's easily the most colorful character in the film. impulsive and full of barely suppressible rage, tuco gyrates wildly throughout the movie, stealing, lying, pretending to be a best friend in one scene, trying to kill in another. tuco truly represents 'the ugly' side of human behavior. at two hours and forty-one minutes, the movie was lengthy for its day, but there's neither a single scene that seems unnecessary, nor does the film seem lengthy while viewing it. the film unfolds with a charismatic style and grace, slowly revealing more and more about each character and the film's story. the pace of the film expertly captures the flavor of the time, giving the viewer a rare peek into a page of american history come alive on film. director sergio leone (who contributed to another epic of note: 'ben-hur' as an uncredited second unit director in 1959) manages to build a lot of sometimes unsettling tension in the film, thus preventing the longer than usual movie from ever getting uncomfortable or predictable. every typical western cliche possibly imaginable is either given a unique twist or utterly destroyed by leone's masterful storytelling. of special honorable mention is ennio morricone's original music score, which is about as masterful and complementary as it gets, culminating in the climatic gunfight in the cemetery at the end of the film. the music is so rich and powerful it easily stands on its own merits, and is one of the biggest selling original movie soundtracks to date. it is impossible to imagine the film without it. 'unforgiven' may well have been the sequel to 'the good, the bad and the ugly', the story of what eventually happened to the 'man with no name', and won oscars for best picture and best director, and the nomination for best actor for eastwood in 1992 (the film also was nominated in six other categories and won in three of those). eastwood dedicated this movie to sergio leone who died 30 april 1989 in rome, and who had believed in him early in his career. call it 'buono, il brutto, il cattivo, il' or call it 'the good, the bad and the ugly', but after seeing it you'll call this movie absolutely brilliant at many levels, including the one mentioned above by kitchener. it is a classic like no other, and is easily one of the best westerns and films of its kind ever made.;26 March 2006;10;['unconventional', 'western', 'bad', 'ugly', 'third', 'western', 'few', 'more', 'good', 'well', 'good', 'evil', 'realistic', 'least', 'short', 'good', 'unrewarded', 'new', 'oft', 'western', 'traditional', 'good', 'bad', 'white', 'black', 'western', 'prevalent', 'main', 'powerful', 'brilliant', 'civil', 'bad', 'evil', 'eyed', 'ruthless', 'successful', 'necessary', 'legendary', 'good', 'western', 'non', 'traditional', 'detectable', 'observable', 'ugly', 'colorful', 'impulsive', 'full', 'suppressible', 'good', 'ugly', 'human', 'lengthy', 'single', 'unnecessary', 'lengthy', 'charismatic', 'more', 'more', 'rare', 'american', 'alive', 'uncredited', 'second', 'unsettling', 'long', 'usual', 'uncomfortable', 'predictable', 'typical', 'western', 'imaginable', 'unique', 'masterful', 'special', 'honorable', 'original', 'masterful', 'complementary', 'climatic', 'rich', 'powerful', 'own', 'big', 'original', 'impossible', 'unforgiven', 'bad', 'ugly', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'other', 'bad', 'ugly', 'brilliant', 'many', 'other', 'good'];0.0747520412077374

793;SaunaFinland;"a young man enters a movie theatre with a bowl of popcorn and a big coke. after all he was going to see the good the bad and the ugly, an epic 3 hour movie. the movie starts, it blows the young man's, my, mind and suddenly it ends. 3 hours have gone and i haven't touched my popcorn and only once sipped from my soda. this movie changed my perception of the art of film. the good the bad and the ugly is not only the greatest western ever made, it's one of the best and epic pictures ever. still in my opinion probably the most underestimated movie. while watching this masterpiece you can enjoy it with all senses. the scenes are beautiful in many ways, the music is spectacular in itself and really carries the film into new dimension, the story itself is grand and ambitious and the characters revolutionary for their time played by fairly good actors. it seems there are not enough adjectives to describe the greatness of this movie. sergio leone had a very unique style in his movies, which i think culminates in the good the bad and the ugly and in this film you can see this style has grown mature to its true glory. there is something unbelievably beautiful in those wide screen shots of rough plains and desert terrain, the close-ups of faces time after time and long drawn scenes where tension can grow. sometimes it almost seems leone was testing how long he can hold on a single scene. the visual art itself tells a million stories without any words needed. for example it takes almost 10 minutes in before anyone says anything at all. still you can sense the film and the tension. another one is the final ""triello"" where the main characters stare at each other for what at first seems like an eternity, but before you know it, one of them lies in a grave dead. what other director has the guts to extend his scenes to the ultimate? and all the worn faces? they all have a story of their own to tell about their scars and wrinkles and adds to the epicness. the desert scenes are like from a surreal and captivating painting. a glorification of visual art! the music by il maestro ennio morricone is epic itself, bold and different. the score of this film is not like any other. at times it makes you cry, at times it makes you excited. it sometimes adds to the visual of the movie and sometimes supports and carries the viewers through those long scenes making sure you will not be bored for even a second of those 179 minutes, making it an experience you will not forget. not only the main theme, but any piece of music played is a symphony of its own e.g. ""the ecstacy of gold"", ""la storia di un soldato"" and ""il triello"" just to mention a few. the work of a genius! the story about three greedy renegades searching for a case of gold coins is a good story in itself, but it certainly doesn't end there. the story has many levels. for one there is the civil war and when you start to dig deeper into the story you can truly see the anti-war reflections and symbols. for one condemns concentration camps in ww2 and other wars and also shows how brutal the trench wars of ww1 could have been for the gain of nothing. the film also shows how towns get filled with veterans without legs or arms and cemeteries grow gigantic in days. the crimes of the good, the bad and the ugly suddenly seem minimal in scale in comparison with the war. another thing is, we really don't seem to get any information about the lead characters and only tuco seems to have a background. still we see these three know each other from a long time ago as they refer to each other as ""old friends"". there is some serious tension going on between the three of them. the ugly is a criminal of the worst kind who cheats everyone and has an obscene language. the bad is pure evil incarnate and seems to have no feelings at all. he calmly shoots everyone in his way in search for the gold. the good you cannot really figure out. he is a mysterious and obsolete character who seems to be above all moral, but in the end shows he has some feelings after all. you can't really say he is a good person though, being a quite controversial character. in a sense i think it is, or at least was, the most underestimated movie of all. at the time it was made critics hated it. it's not a hollywood production, leone was at the time unknown in the world, so was eastwood just being in the beginning of his career. eli wallach wasn't that famous either and lee van cleef was a forgotten movie veteran. it contained brutal violence and it was dubbed and worst of all, westerns was a dying genre. but this movie only grows with time. not only did it solely revive the westerns, it recreated the movie hero to its modern shape: the controversial clint eastwood character. its score was revolutionary and has affected to modern film score probably more than any other. still it remains unique. no one has been able to copy the style of sergio leone. to me the good, the bad and the ugly truly is the greatest movie ever made in almost any aspect you can measure it in. the works of at least two recognised geniuses and men with visions. a piece of gold shining brighter every day!";12 January 2012;10;['young', 'big', 'good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'epic', 'young', 'good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'great', 'western', 'good', 'epic', 'underestimated', 'beautiful', 'many', 'spectacular', 'new', 'grand', 'ambitious', 'revolutionary', 'good', 'enough', 'unique', 'bad', 'ugly', 'mature', 'true', 'beautiful', 'wide', 'rough', 'close', 'long', 'single', 'visual', 'final', 'main', 'other', 'dead', 'other', 'ultimate', 'worn', 'own', 'surreal', 'visual', 'epic', 'bold', 'different', 'other', 'excited', 'visual', 'long', 'sure', 'bored', 'main', 'own', 'few', 'greedy', 'good', 'many', 'civil', 'anti', 'war', 'other', 'brutal', 'gigantic', 'bad', 'ugly', 'minimal', 'lead', 'other', 'long', 'other', 'old', 'serious', 'ugly', 'bad', 'obscene', 'bad', 'pure', 'incarnate', 'mysterious', 'obsolete', 'moral', 'good', 'controversial', 'least', 'underestimated', 'unknown', 'famous', 'brutal', 'bad', 'modern', 'controversial', 'revolutionary', 'modern', 'more', 'other', 'unique', 'able', 'bad', 'ugly', 'great', 'bright'];0.0456950456950457

803;DarthRater;"""the good, the bad, and the ugly"" is one of the earliest films i can remember and is probably the only film i would never get sick of watching over and over. imo, it's not only the best 'western' ever made, but one of the best films of all time. not for the picture quality... as it can be a little rough and grainy. not for the dialog over-dubbing, which is often out of sync due to the range of languages spoken when it was shot. and not for the historical inaccuracies or feasibility of the physical burdens endured by the characters (it's way more realistic than james bond anyway). those are what give the film its charm and retro appeal! personally, i think this film is great because of the overall 'mood' it creates, both visually and audibly. it has, by far, one of the most unusual and recognizable music scores in movie history, blending the traditionally-used orchestral brass section with human whistles, cackles, grunts, and an electric guitar, to create a tapestry of sound that strangely fits perfectly (even though the time period depicted predates the electric guitar by more than half a century). then, in the spaces, the wind-blown desolation in the sound track really gives you the sense of being there with the characters in that barren desert. it's the dynamic range in both the soundtrack and the pacing of the story that sets such a great undercurrent for the talented trio to do their magic. all three seasoned actors with impressive credits both before and after this film seemed to cross paths at just the right time in their careers to face off in their most memorable performances to date. and rather than a typical western--one wronged man against a whole town; a masked hero and his trusty sidekick; or a rag-tag posse banding together only to get killed off one by one by bandits--this is three distinct personalities going head to head to head, each with a little good, a little bad, and a little ugly in them to varying degrees. on the script side, it's really more of a human interest story than an action film. and it poignantly bullet-points (no pun intended) that often the ""good guy"" really only needs to be the ""least bad"" of the bunch to obtain that moniker, which has all sorts of parallels in all walks of life. to fully rave about all the intricacies of this masterpiece would take a novel. but these are just a few aspects that make it a timeless classic and well worth watching.";4 August 2014;10;['bad', 'ugly', 'early', 'only', 'sick', 'good', 'western', 'good', 'little', 'rough', 'grainy', 'historical', 'physical', 'realistic', 'great', 'overall', 'unusual', 'recognizable', 'orchestral', 'human', 'electric', 'electric', 'more', 'sound', 'dynamic', 'great', 'talented', 'seasoned', 'impressive', 'right', 'memorable', 'typical', 'whole', 'trusty', 'distinct', 'little', 'little', 'bad', 'little', 'ugly', 'more', 'human', 'good', 'least', 'bad', 'few', 'classic', 'worth'];0.088095238095238

805;nikolacringeking;"i've chosen to review a very amazing movie whose directors, players and music artists are pure legends, i am talking about the sergio leone, eli wallach, lee van clef, clint eastwood and ennio morricone and the movie ""the good, the bad and the ugly"" (italian: il buono, il brutto, il cattivo, lit. '""the good, the ugly, the bad""'). first, i would like to stress out the movie setting and its history. in the 1960's western movies were becoming very popular, the hollywood westerns included heroes that were often well groomed, had nice clothing, had charismatic voices and shiny new guns, often times very good gunslingers that fought the bad guys and always won. the spaghetti western on the other hand was usually a low budget movie recorded in italy, most often in sicily, hence the name. spaghetti westerns were usually very violent and included not heroes but anti-heroes who usually worked for their own personal gain, this made the movies appear way more realistic. it is also noteworthy to say that that the music in the hollywood westerns was much simpler, chilling and relaxing, the music of the spaghetti westerns was almost always really energetic, took a lot of effort and increased in tone and frequency as the time went by. the last thing i would like to add is that we often think that the us civil war was an entirely moral war, with the north being the good guys and the south the bad ones but even though most hollywood westerns' timeline happened in 1860's, the us civil war was almost entirely ignored, this is contrasted by the spaghetti westerns who saw the neither side as good, they would show that both sides were bleeding each other dry and both sides committed atrocities, denying the enemy basic human rights. in this movie we find 3 main characters, the ""good"", we do not know his name but he is often called ""blondie"" by the ""ugly"" who's known as ""tuco"". the third character, ""the bad"" is known by his alias ""angel eyes"". all of these 3 characters are excellent gunslingers and have 1 goal in life; personal gain. all the characters interact with each other in the movie, sometimes working together and sometimes trying to kill each other, often times by outwitting instead of using blunt force. the characters in the movie often don't use too much dialogue, but say more by saying less thus stressing out the important part. lastly, i would like to talk about this movie's scenography and music. the music was mostly composed by 1 man; ennio morricone. the music rarely overlaps with the dialogue, which leaves the viewer to listen to what the characters say better. the director and the music artist had a talent of working together, there are scenes in the movie where the music is used primarily to build up tension and to incite action, for this reason the music is only used when the characters are or are acting silent for example: when characters are sneaking or are under threat. overall, the movie is widely recognised as a masterpiece and i agree, every single moment is either deeply embedded to the storyline or is action based, one can start watching this movie from any timeline and still find it interesting. for all these unique factors the movie offers i can do nothing but recommend it for everyone to watch.";24 January 2021;10;['amazing', 'pure', 'bad', 'ugly', 'italian', 'ugly', 'bad', 'western', 'popular', 'nice', 'charismatic', 'shiny', 'new', 'good', 'bad', 'western', 'other', 'low', 'violent', 'own', 'personal', 'realistic', 'noteworthy', 'simple', 'chilling', 'relaxing', 'energetic', 'last', 'civil', 'moral', 'good', 'bad', 'most', 'civil', 'good', 'other', 'dry', 'basic', 'human', 'main', 'good', 'ugly', 'tuco', 'third', 'bad', 'excellent', 'personal', 'other', 'other', 'blunt', 'much', 'more', 'less', 'important', 'silent', 'single', 'interesting', 'unique'];0.0490844155844155

875;shaynecaboor;"most of what comes to mind when i hear the words ""the good, the bad and the ugly"" has already been addressed in prior reviews below. there are few words that describe the brilliance of such a movie, but considering as how this film remains (to this day) to be one of my all-time favorites, i thought i should compose a few to express my fond opinion about it for anyone who has not yet experienced the pleasure of seeing it. to put it simply, this movie is utter perfection; the endless landscapes, the classic gun skirmishes, the solid performances, the incredible soundtrack... no western has even caught glimpse of the heights to which this film soars, let alone reached them. this is not just the greatest western, it is one of the best films ever made, with almost no notable exceptions. the music is utter brilliance. the theme song will be playing through your mind for weeks, if it has not already. ennio morricone is at his all-time best here, delivering one of the most poetic and outstanding soundtracks for any western (or, arguably, any film), period. and yes, metallica fans, this is the true way that ""the esctasy of gold"" is meant to be heard: in its original version. the camera-work is also of high notability. from the huge wide-angle shots of the walloping scenery to the close-and-tight views of the characters' narrowed eyes, the contrast in camera shots will turn even the slower scenes into sheer excitement. storywise, this film is without equal. the beautiful simplicity of a bounty hunter-turned-treasure hunter, his unlikely bandit partner and their evil rival racing to find $200,000 in confederate gold is truly spectacular; but what makes it even more memorable is the broadness and scope on the jarring reality of the civil war. in truth, this story isn't just about three men, but rather three men and their journey amidst the brawling past of a struggling nation, which is depicted fantastically. and the finale of the trio duel has got to be one of the most cinematically and musically excellent sequences ever captured on camera. some may cringe when they learn that the film lasts a good 2.5 hours, but nowhere has a film of this length felt more fitting. to describe the cast is nearly impossible. lee van cleef puts up one of his greatest performances here--he seems born to play ""angel eyes"". his presence on-screen is truly what drives the story and conflict. eli wallach delivers an outstanding role as tuco; his hilarious dialog and occasional brawls with blondie make him by far one of the most memorable characters to graze any form of theater. clint eastwood is truly something to behold. although clint is definitely one of my favorite all-time actors, this is not quite my absolute favorite performance of his (admitedly because he's not quite as bad-ass as in, say, a fistful of dollars); however, this point is hardly worth mentioning, because his role as blondie adds the perfect contrast to the others' personalities. while angel eyes and tuco are considerably violent-natured, blondie is much more passive; he rarely partakes in conflict except when he absolutely has to, but when he does he delivers the ultimate punishment to anyone dumb enough to stand in his way. in some ways, i think the movie wouldn't have been nearly as effective if clint's character had stolen the show. either way, every character is simply rounded and chiseled to perfection; there is no room for improvement here. to sum it all up, this movie is simply breathtaking. it's absolutely fantastic; it's utterly brilliant. the music, the plot, the characters, and the incredible direction of sergio leone make this ""spaghetti-western"" hardly just a spaghetti-western and hardly worth any point of criticism. i have rated this movie a 10 because, unfortunately, there is no higher number available to select (believe me, i would rate this film a 200 if i had the chance). if you have yet to see this film, you must make it an objective to watch it--regardless of whether you like the genre or not. if you've been searching for a film that you could finally term ""the best movie ever,"" then look no further. it is right here, and it's called: the good, the bad and the ugly.";4 December 2011;10;['most', 'bad', 'ugly', 'prior', 'few', 'few', 'fond', 'utter', 'endless', 'classic', 'solid', 'incredible', 'western', 'great', 'western', 'good', 'notable', 'utter', 'poetic', 'outstanding', 'western', 'true', 'esctasy', 'original', 'high', 'huge', 'wide', 'close', 'tight', 'slow', 'sheer', 'equal', 'beautiful', 'unlikely', 'evil', 'confederate', 'spectacular', 'memorable', 'jarring', 'civil', 'excellent', 'good', 'fitting', 'impossible', 'great', 'outstanding', 'hilarious', 'occasional', 'memorable', 'favorite', 'absolute', 'favorite', 'bad', 'worth', 'perfect', 'violent', 'natured', 'passive', 'ultimate', 'dumb', 'effective', 'breathtaking', 'fantastic', 'brilliant', 'incredible', 'spaghetti', 'western', 'western', 'worth', 'high', 'available', 'good', 'bad', 'ugly'];0.186021978021978

887;aakostar;"the good, the bad and the ugly is a movie par excellence. not only does sergio leone in close cooperation with ennio morricone and his groundbreaking score manage to create a masterpiece of modern movie history. he also revolutionizes the western by shifting the clean and glorified image of the west that existed so far and changing it into a dirty, often ugly and very brutal face. furthermore he underlines some of the motives that kept this era going as they do today. greed, violence and the absolute fight for survival and sometimes the strongest one revenge (which is a dominant factor in his movie once upon a time in the west). however his characters which carry this movie all along give it a much more human and realistic feel. lee van clef, clint eastwood and above all eli walach make their characters become very vivid and the viewers sometimes catch themselves identify with them although they probably would not have expected it earlier. the twists and turns that bring the characters into situations that no one would have expected moments earlier are truly what life is all about; you never know what will happen the next moment. with a little twist of fate (and it twists a lot in this movie) the character that is on top on the one moment is the one who looks into a barrel of a gun the very next moment. the allegories that leone uses in his move seem almost endless. let's mention just two examples. the truly inspired and masterful invention of the amphitheatric setting of the cemetery which has a center stage that is surrounded by crosses and almost looks lice an ancient theater. it is there where tuco, the ugly (who is notably the most ""human"" character in this movie) runs full of anticipation like a little child trying to find a familiar face. however he just searches for the grave that contains what everybody is hunting after in this movie, the treasure. it almost seems like the dead are watching these three characters as they aspire to become rich or ... just become another cross in this cemetery. inside this ""arena"" the final shootout takes place with leone producing an editing with his ultra close ups that are breathtaking. in this theatrical surrounding the high point of the story (that has elements of an ancient drama) is reached. another really astonishing moment is the final scene with tuco, his neck in a rope, balancing on a cross with 100.000 $ in gold dollars lying before him but he is not able to do anything with that money since he is on the verge between life and death and all the money on earth not being able to help him. a truly ironic picture and leone manages to produce a lot of such irony in his movie. before the liberating shoot from the good (played by clint eastwood who almost acts as a character who is responsible for divine justice) that cuts the rope, the viewer is for a moment exposed to the paradox of life and death. this movie is an absolute must see! although some might think it is just a spaghetti western its influence remains unparalleled even today!";23 December 2004;10;['bad', 'ugly', 'close', 'modern', 'western', 'clean', 'dirty', 'ugly', 'brutal', 'absolute', 'strong', 'dominant', 'human', 'realistic', 'vivid', 'next', 'little', 'next', 'endless', 'masterful', 'amphitheatric', 'center', 'ancient', 'ugly', 'human', 'full', 'little', 'familiar', 'rich', 'final', 'ultra', 'close', 'high', 'ancient', 'astonishing', 'final', 'gold', 'able', 'able', 'ironic', 'such', 'liberating', 'responsible', 'divine', 'absolute', 'western', 'unparalleled'];0.0271296296296296

905;DaikengoX;"before watching this movie, i have seen a fistful of dollars and for a few dollars more and i was quite impressed with both. however, after i have seen this, leone instantly became one of my favorite directors. leone has a distinct style in his films and this movie pulls it out 150%. the cinematography in this film is incredible. his use of extreme long shots and extreme close ups are unsurpassed. the film opens with the close up of a man with an expressionless face creating a sense of mystery and excitement. what will this guy going to do? what's going to happen? then we are introduced to two new unknown men and the three walk towards the entrance. silence. then suddenly, the 3 bust in, guns are shot and tuco busts through the window and escapes with a half eaten chicken (or pork) leg. one of the men is injured, tries to make a futile final attempt to kill him and falls to the floor; the other 2 are already dead. just in that one scene, we are introduced to tuco and can already guess his character, his background info, and skill... without a single spoken line of dialogue. as a matter of fact, nobody speaks until about 10 minutes into the film. it is all visual. we, the audience, are forced to imagine what the characters are thinking, what might be taking place. leone gives the viewers a chance to guess what might happen. even in once upon a time in the west, we see his mastery at the no-dialogue introduction. i also believe that this is his way to introduce the character's personality traits without the viewers actually knowing that they know it. a subtle technique so when they see a character do something later in the movie, the viewers can accept the character's actions. however, leone would not be as great as he is if it wasn't for his partner ennio morricone and his unique and memorable soundtrack. the coyote-like music sets the mood for this film like no other western. it is something you must listen to and experience it to retain the full appreciation of it, and know why it has become the trademark music for the western genre. these techniques go on throughout the film and bring us to the ultimate scene in film history, where leone's style shines to it's full extent. his incredible use of long shots to set the stage, close ups to catch the expressions, music to set the mood, montage to create the tension, expand it and finally when you are at the edge of you're seat, the scene goes off like lighting in the incredible climatic ending. leone is not just any director. he is one of the best, and this is his western!";15 October 2006;10;['few', 'impressed', 'favorite', 'distinct', 'incredible', 'extreme', 'long', 'extreme', 'close', 'unsurpassed', 'new', 'unknown', 'half', 'futile', 'final', 'other', 'dead', 'single', 'spoken', 'visual', 'subtle', 'great', 'unique', 'memorable', 'like', 'other', 'western', 'full', 'western', 'ultimate', 'full', 'incredible', 'long', 'close', 'incredible', 'climatic', 'good', 'western'];0.1948366149979053

922;andrealoquenzi;"it's a dirty, wonderfully shot movie full of sweaty scumbags scavenging the land in search for dollars - possibly made of gold. men who have nothing to lose, lost at the border of a manifest destiny which is bigger than them, split in half by a filthy civil war that nobody wants to win and nobody wants to lose. men who are so much different from each other, that they end up equals. men with no morals, hunting down men with morals so low they are almost diabolical. it's the story of three sons of b*tches, quick with their guns as well as their wit, who would rather die than splitting the gold in three equal parts, as if 66.600 dollars were not enough at that time. we watch the good, the bad and the ugly to look for america. a vivid america that only ever existed in our dreams. although, it looks like it could have existed in reality, too. it doesn't really matter, as leone really hit the nail hard on the head this time. each and every character has his own reason for doing what they are doing, but at the end of the day it's just pure greed. tuco (the ugly), is probably the most humane character of them all, even though it may look like he's the scummiest. look closer. angel eyes (the bad) is implacable, while blondie (the good) is just a cynic of the worst kind, he couldn't care less about anything. blondie is just a tad less evil than the other two, but it's probably just because he doesn't want to be bothered. is it out of pure generosity that he spares tuco at the end, or perhaps it's because he knows that if he doesn't kill him, tuco will haunt him forever? or maybe it's just a case of old habits dying hard, since he saves tuco in the usual way: by shooting the rope after having forced him to to put his head in the loop. which, incidentally, it's the same method they used to make money in their wicked ponzi scheme business. maybe it's a combination of all the three elements, but what goodness has to do with this? this movie is all about sarcasm and irony. blondie isn't blonde, but that's why they call him that, it's a tease. the wild west is a frontier, but it seems like you wouldn't want to know what's on the other side. bullets save people. tombs are the source of a new life. friends are foes and sometimes they make good allies. southern soldiers dust off their coats and they are northern soldiers now. monks slap you in the face. this movie wouldn't be the same without morricone's omnipresent soundtrack. you take it for granted, somehow. as if something like that happens everyday. the soundtrack is the movie and vice-versa. ecstasy of gold. arguably, this is actually the most appropriate soundtrack ever created. it sounds as if the devil himself wrote it. ""the good, the bad and the ugly"" is now more than fifty years old. you couldn't tell by looking. watching it today is a bitter-sweet experience. it's wonderful, but you know nobody is ever going to make a movie like this once again. times are changing. in this politically correct era, you'd have to use at least a couple of actresses and that would ruin the whole thing, of course. look at ""godless"", the western tv series: you just can't stand the presence of merritt wever as mary agnes: a strong, independent feminist who also happen to be lesbian! every line she says is out of tune with the west. every time she opens her mouth to speak she shatter your suspension of unbelief. she is so annoying and preposterous! and when she shows everybody that she can draw quicker than a man! hahahah. laughable. there was no such a thing as a strong, independent, lesbian in the wild west simply because a woman like that wouldn't have lasted a day. feminists, indeed, can propagate their ideology precisely because men have died building our society, while they were hiding someplace safe. the tough they get going, when the going gets tough. and that's the reason why leone's vision of the wild west might not be 100% accurate because it's too cynical, but at least it's not politically correct, which is way more than any modern western can do today. we miss these sorts of movies, like we miss the old wild west.";14 October 2019;9;['dirty', 'full', 'manifest', 'big', 'filthy', 'civil', 'different', 'other', 'low', 'diabolical', 'quick', 'equal', 'enough', 'bad', 'ugly', 'vivid', 'own', 'pure', 'ugly', 'humane', 'close', 'bad', 'implacable', 'cynic', 'bad', 'evil', 'other', 'pure', 'old', 'tuco', 'usual', 'same', 'wicked', 'blonde', 'wild', 'other', 'new', 'good', 'southern', 'northern', 'same', 'versa', 'appropriate', 'bad', 'ugly', 'more', 'old', 'bitter', 'sweet', 'wonderful', 'correct', 'least', 'whole', 'western', 'strong', 'independent', 'lesbian', 'annoying', 'preposterous', 'quick', 'laughable', 'such', 'strong', 'independent', 'wild', 'safe', 'tough', 'tough', 'wild', 'accurate', 'cynical', 'least', 'correct', 'more', 'modern', 'old', 'wild'];-0.0416049899920867

965;sebanano;"simply perfect in any way. the film addresses the story of three people who intertwine with each other, although it seems cliche sergio leone gives it in an unmatched way. the relationship that occurs between blondie and tuco is entirely natural, at no time is forced because one must be with the other, it is that humanism that there are between them two that is reflected throughout the trip, where with small actions it shows how well built the characters are, there is enough solidity in the lines and by god! boy, no one demeans the characters, even the prostitute says consistent lines. the first scene of the bad is incredible, his great willingness to get what he wants is reasonable, he does not seek to dominate the world or defeat the good, only someone who has a goal in mind. the re-enactment of the war of succession is avant-garde, it shows both leaders that there are no good or bad, only people who die for something that has no logic, we can see how those generals who are not in the history books saw the war as a suffering, a pain, a destiny to fulfill where the only thing there is death. the film rejoices in the best photographs of the landscapes of europe, the framing of the characters has the reason why it turns to the right, left, up or down, there is a reason and reason why go towards the character, because looking from afar, because take the horse's legs. the music is sublime, of the best songs in the history of cinema ennio morriconne is the only one who can compose for a confrontation in broad daylight and with sergio leone doing each take prolongs the sequence and still have that emotion about what will happen. the edition as well as the art design do not remain relegated to the wardrobe, you can see the great quality and commitment that is in every detail. not to mention the performances, eastwood, wallach and van cleef manage to withdraw from themselves, forget who they are, that there is a camera in front and they do it like no one else can, they make art with their performances, of course tuco does laughing, as it changes from solemnity to sarcasm in a few seconds is worthy of applause. angel eyes manages to make a very organic antagonist, he does not need to scream, kill everyone, he knows when to shoot and at no time does he feel pretended. bolndie is such an endearing character, even if he is from the old west you manage to feel his fear, his thirst, his kindness and his solidarity, and boy did he have to work hard to hold a rifle with his hands and they didn't shake. i could talk more about the film, to notice how it influenced many directors such as tarantino, scorsese, depalma, kurbick, spielberg, lucas, fincher, nolan until the russo but i will let you see it yourself and note that a dialogue with many is not necessary lines, a stellar and choral cast, great special effects and the best sound, you just need to have an idea, love and passion for your work, let yourself be overwhelmed by the creativity of a soundtrack and show that with little you can do a lot and that you cannot it is the ""what"" but the ""how"".";1 June 2020;10;['perfect', 'other', 'unmatched', 'natural', 'other', 'small', 'enough', 'consistent', 'first', 'bad', 'incredible', 'great', 'reasonable', 'good', 'garde', 'good', 'bad', 'only', 'good', 'sublime', 'good', 'only', 'broad', 'great', 'few', 'worthy', 'organic', 'endearing', 'old', 'more', 'many', 'such', 'tarantino', 'scorsese', 'lucas', 'nolan', 'many', 'necessary', 'stellar', 'choral', 'great', 'special', 'good', 'little'];0.2690136054421769

978;francescosaadatjoo;"introduction not so long ago sergio leone was only a cult figure. the italian western was often thought to be a parody in itself, and leone just happened to be the most skilful of those western making italians. today even people who are unfamiliar with the western genre know his name. he is considered by many as the greatest director of western movies in history, eclipsing even the names of a ford or a peckinpah. his movie the good, the bad and the ugly is on top of most people's lists with favourite westerns, and quentin tarantino has called it the best directed movie of all time. the title has been referred to in fashion, construction, baseball, politics, pop music and god knows what more. ennio morricone's theme music has been used (and misused) so often, that it has become instantly recognisable to people of all ages in all corners of the world. # looking for the ugly according to dario argento, who interviewed him at the time for an italian newspaper, sergio leone had several films in mind after completing the second dollar movie, among them a biopic about calamity jane and wild bill hickock (with sophia loren as calamity jane) a remake of viva villa! (a romanticized biopic of pancho villa), and an adventure movie set in war times. some think the good, the bad and the ugly originated in combining ideas for the remake and the adventure movie set in wartime. leone wasn't really fascinated by the mexican revolution (unlike some of his colleagues), nor in the historic figure of pancho villa, but had been impressed by wallace beery, who had portrayed the revolutionary as the typical, ebullient latin character. he wanted to keep the character, but use it within a different context. the background for his movie, wouldn't be the mexican revolution, but the american civil war, his main character not an altruist who was concerned with the destiny of his people, but a good-for-nothing who tried to survive in war time by using the hostilities to his own advantage. leone's original choice for this 'ugly character' was gian maria volonte, but he was afraid the character would become a neuropath when played by volonte, and that was not what he had in mind. but then he saw eli wallach (some say in how the west was won, others say in the magnificent seven) and all of a sudden he knew he had found the right actor: a dramatic actor with a natural talent for comedy, who reminded him of both wallace beery and charlie chaplin. the anchor point the good, the bad and the ugly is the third and most ambitious part of sergio leone's so-called dollar trilogy, and also his third movie starring clint eastwood, the man who made himself a name by becoming the man with no name. eastwood had been a cynical opportunist in a fistful of dollars and a bounty hunter in for a few a dollars more. in the good, the bad and the ugly he's an opportunist again. in the triptych 'good-bad-ugly', he represents the good. but don't be fooled: like the opportunist and the bounty hunter from the previous two movies, the good is basically interested in money. in for a few dollars more, no name had appeared alongside a second protagonist, colonel mortimer, played by lee van cleef, and the newcomer had stolen the movie away from the veteran. now a third character was added, and again this newcomer would walk away with the movie. eli wallach's ambiguous character is the anchor point of the story, with two other characters, one good, one bad, contrasting with his 'ugly' nature. neither of them was to be defined in traditional terms of morality. blondie is only 'good' because he isn't as ugly as tuco, and tuco is only 'ugly' because he isn't as bad as angel eyes. but all three are rather merciless opportunists, ready to kill if necessary, and 'villains' in the traditional good/bad polarisation of the western movie. leone wanted to demystify the adjectives, and at the same time show the absurdity of war. he was, in his own words, pursuing a theme chaplin had exposed in monsieur verdoux, a study of a 20th century bluebeard, operating on the eve of ww ii, who confuses the people who have sentenced him to death with questions about the true meanings of good and bad. the plot the plot is relatively simple. tuco, a mexican outlaw, teams up with blondie, an american bounty hunter. the american will turn the mexican in, collect the reward money, but rescue him from hanging by shooting through the rope. as a couple of illusionists, they travel from town to town, repeating the same trick everywhere. angel eyes, on the other hand, is a hired gun who is looking for a confederate soldier named bill carson, who knows of the whereabouts of a load of gold. the two stories intertwine when tuco, who was double-crossed by blondie, leads his former partner into the desert to kill him. they meet a moribund bill carson, who tells them about the gold, hidden on a cemetery: to tuco he tells the name of the cemetery, to blondie the name on the grave. the two dress up like confederate soldiers, but they're captured by the union and brought to a prison camp. tuco has taken the identity of bill carson, and attracts the attention of angel eyes, who works in the camp as a sergeant. after a long series of incidents, with endless double-crossings and changing alliances, the three men arrive at the cemetery ... ecstasy on the altar of death the good, the bad and the ugly is an assured work, made by a film maker at the peak of his art. the movie has been called a comical nightmare as well as a study of the horrors of war. it is deeply rooted in the tradition of the picaresque novel and the commedia dell'arte, two latin literary traditions. the picaresque story of three adventurers chasing the same treasure is punctuated by brief but poignant images of the war. we catch glimpses of executions, humiliations and torture, and it all culminates in this protracted scene of the trench war at langstone bridge. the cruelty of the war also defines the morality of the movie, and the characters involved in it. the three men can be real bastards, but the war is shown as an inferno of destruction and pain. ironically the war also intervenes to save lives: a mysterious confederate death wagon appears from nowhere when tuco is about to kill blondie, a mortar shell breaks the beam from which blondie is about to be hanged, etc. this is the true absurdity of the war, and of life. blowing up the bridge, basically a selfish act (""if those idiots stop fighting, we can cross the river""), also becomes an act of mercy: thanks to blondie and tuco the sympathetic union officer, the 'philosopher' of the movie, can rest in peace. this idea of life by destruction, is mirrored in the famous 'ecstasy of gold' scene, with a greedy and ecstatic tuco running in circles, looking for a name that can change his life in the midst of this altar of death, the cemetery called sad hill. conclusion funny, violent and meaningful, the good, the bad and the ugly is probably as close to perfection as a film can get. a few jokes may be a bit insipid and i don't really like this shootout in a ghost town between tuco and blondie and angel eyes' men. there are also a few problems in regard to angel eyes' character: his appearance in a northern pow camp is a bit suspicious (how did he get there, and how on earth did he become a sergeant in no time?). but some scenes, like the triello, the mexican standoff on the cemetery, and the ecstasy of gold, tuco's run around the graves of sad hill, belong to the most beautiful ever filmed. the langstone bridge sequence is almost a movie within a movie. morricone's score is one of the best of his impressive career. if you haven't seen this film yet, you

1007;AlexanderFiske;"what's so delightfully enduring about this epic adventure is that every single sequence is so endlessly entertaining and carefully choreographed. it's hard to pick a favorite scene, for every rewatch there's a different one. of course, the film's climax with the immortal 'ecstasy of gold' and the unbearable suspense of the last standoff are its most celebrated moments, and the two-and-a-half-hour journey to get there could easily be a drag. only, it isn't. the character introductions. blondie and tuco's chemistry and scheming. angel eyes' pursue for the cash box. a half-soldier. tuco assembling his own gun. the desert sequence. tuco and brother ramirez. the pow camp. digestive music. wallace beating the crap out of tuco. blondie and angel eyes teaming up. six men, six bullets. bathtub scene. ""when you have to shoot, shoot. don't talk."" the street shootout. the drunk union captain and the bridge. sad hill cemetery. those are some of the treats this classic has to offer, and i think it makes it one of the most rewatchable movies ever made. but what else is there to enjoy? the soundtrack: thinking of sergio leone is to think of ennio morricone, and this may be is magnum opus if you had to choose one. from the iconic whistling theme to the epic final standoff and the aforementioned 'the ecstasy of gold' (which if you've ever been to a metallica concert, they always opens their shows with). but there are also the small bits between - trumpets, acoustic guitar and harmonica tunes breaths life to the backdrop that is the american civil war (at least leone's vision of it). the cinematography: shot in spain, posing as the american southwest, italian cinematographer tonino delli colli fills every frame with gorgeous composition and gritty detail. there are so many iconic shots that are burned into cinema history and for this rewatch i finally got to enjoy it on blu-ray in hi-def. il buono, il brutto, il cattivo: as the title suggests, this story revolves around its characters. lee van cleef as the villainous angel eyes is both cold and charismatic. clint eastwood as blondie is the definition of cool. he always keeps his calm and doesn't speak unless he's got something badass to say. he also smokes cigar, has superhuman aim and he blows hats off people's heads. and there's eli wallach as tuco - the unsung hero of this whole story. he's the shifty bandit you can't trust for a second. he's also got superhuman aim and i just love his swagger. he always makes me laugh, even when he's not talking, just his facial expressions cracks me up. he's also the character we get most backstory on, besides being the clown of the company, and you just can't help to feel sorry for him in the end. perhaps my favorite character of all time. those are the three mains which the story revolves around, but leone had a talent for creating memorable minor roles as well - the alcoholic union captain in particular, who appears more than two hours into the film, heavily drunk and heavily dubbed, is downright hilarious. the charm: it's about america, made by italians, shot mainly in spain. apart from the three american leads, most of the dialogue is dubbed, as the rest of the cast were either italian or spanish. but it doesn't mean the performances are bad or that it feels out of place - no, it just further enriches the everlasting charm of the spaghetti western and leone's cinematic world. it's also a very unrealistic film - with comedically accurate gunslingers, revolvers sounding like cannons and the whole 'historical' setting. i've always regarded it as a borderline fantasy film, and i love it for it. it is plain and simple movie magic. love it or hate it, 'the good, the bad and the ugly' is undoubtably one of the most iconic films of all time and a big part of cinema history. for me, it's three hours of pure escapism and one of the most enduring adventures ever made for the big screen.";27 May 2020;10;['epic', 'single', 'entertaining', 'hard', 'favorite', 'different', 'immortal', 'unbearable', 'last', 'celebrated', 'half', 'half', 'own', 'digestive', 'rewatchable', 'magnum', 'iconic', 'epic', 'final', 'aforementioned', 'small', 'acoustic', 'american', 'civil', 'least', 'italian', 'delli', 'gorgeous', 'gritty', 'many', 'iconic', 'villainous', 'cold', 'charismatic', 'badass', 'superhuman', 'unsung', 'whole', 'shifty', 'superhuman', 'facial', 'most', 'backstory', 'sorry', 'favorite', 'memorable', 'minor', 'alcoholic', 'particular', 'more', 'drunk', 'hilarious', 'american', 'most', 'italian', 'spanish', 'bad', 'everlasting', 'western', 'cinematic', 'unrealistic', 'accurate', 'whole', 'historical', 'plain', 'simple', 'bad', 'ugly', 'iconic', 'big', 'pure', 'big'];0.0637542517006803

""$200,000 is a lot of money, we're gonna have to earn it."" that line is definitely one of the greatest lines in the movie, as well as one of the most masculine. the final scenes from tuco's ecstasy of the treasure to the mexican standoff (which is one of the most creative and unexpected end to an epic western)left me in awe, along with ennio morricones ultimate score. people argue that this movie is just about a greedy treasure hunt, and can't live up to something as captivating as a revenge story, like once upon a time in the west. first of all it is not just a greedy treasure hunt, as i said before it is a trip into human nature, adventure and masculinity. secondly, what it comes down to is your taste in movies. if you're a more masculine, adventurous person, you'll admire the good the bad and the ugly, but if your into revenge, and honor then once upon a time in the west is your movie. you can learn a lot about people by the movies they enjoy. its just a shame that people today cannot enjoy this fantastic movie. im 16 years old and every time i try to show my friends they always shoot it down, or end up not understanding it. it is a terrible shame how movie making has turned from an art to just a quick get rich scheme.";23 November 2009;10;['good', 'perfect', 'memorable', 'great', 'more', 'simple', 'iconic', 'memorable', 'ugly', 'selfish', 'apathetic', 'faced', 'right', 'cold', 'hearted', 'sociopathic', 'typical', 'good', 'amoral', 'greedy', 'many', 'same', 'good', 'realistic', 'good', 'quick', 'able', 'human', 'amoral', 'amoral', 'certain', 'great', 'epic', 'great', 'most', 'final', 'mexican', 'creative', 'unexpected', 'ultimate', 'greedy', 'greedy', 'human', 'more', 'adventurous', 'good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'fantastic', 'old', 'terrible', 'quick', 'rich'];0.2312015503875969

1032;DongfeiChen;i saw this movie on amazon instant video. this movie is excellent and its story has a lot of ups and downs, the movie also has the famous western movie star clint eastwood. so i was mesmerized by the movie and recommend others to appreciate it. the movie has three leading roles which has different characters. the good person is called blondie. the bad person is called angel eyes. the ugly person is called tuco. the story happened during american civil war, and developed gradually among the three western cowboys. along with the story developing, a man tells the ugly man that there has a huge government wealth worth $200,000. the man tells the region of secret wealth, and the region named sad hill cemetery has thousands of graves. however, the man does not tell the ugly man what the name of the grave which conceals the wealth, but tells the good man. thus, the good man and the ugly decide to find the wealth jointly. meanwhile, the bad man who disguises as a union soldier also begins to find the huge wealth, and the three people meet in battle coincidentally. then, they against each other by fist and gun fight intensely. finally, after a lot of fights, the good man and the ugly man find the way to sad hill cemetery. however, the way is blocked by the war between union and confederate, and the two forces fight constantly in order to occupy a bridge. finally, the good man and the ugly man destroy the bridge by bombs. in the end, the bad man arrives in the region of secret wealth at the same time. the three cowboys decide to gun duel and the winner can get the wealth. finally, the good man kills the bad man in the duel and releases the ugly man. the good man separate the wealth with the ugly man, and the good man leaves the ugly man in the desert. the final scene is that the good man rides his horse and disappears in the distance. the movie uses third person view to describe the fantastic story. the story depicts three different people deeply. they have different dispositions and distinguish each other brightly. the movie has a strong western atmosphere. for example, the whole story develops in the desert, and this is the typical character of the west of america. the three people have classic cowboy's appearance and trait. they have cowboy wear, especially the classic hat. they have a cool handgun and good gun skill. so they can hit a thin rope from a long distance. they judge other people with narrow eyes. this movie is different with former western movies. people do not divide to good or bad clearly. there is no a totally good person or a totally bad person. the good man also wants to gain the wealth and more money by fighting with others. the ugly man can be touched by some sorrowful things and help others by his own way. all people have two sides, good and bad. this idea in the movie causes big change in future western stories and movies. this movie also uses huge scenes to describe the most destructive of wars. hundred thousand people die in the war and their bodies fall apart on the desert. this is a big satire of three people shuttle between two armies just in order to find the secret wealth. the movie also uses fierce gun fight to make the story ups and downs. for example, in the end, three people duel each other. they stare each other last 5 minutes and no one open the fire without careful thought. this scene makes audiences feel nervous and exciting. personally, the good, the bad, and the ugly is a very legendary movie and shakes me a lot. thus, i saw the movie 3 times and think it is very wonderful. this movie not only is a lot of intense gun fight, but also reflects people's inner thoughts vividly. the three people have the same purpose but have different characters, so there are a lot of conflicts in the story. in the whole story, many scenes impress me a lot. for example, a command of union is wounded in the war and will die soon. after the good man and the ugly man destroy the bridge between two armies, the command smiles and dies in happy. this sorrowful fragment reveals that people do not want to battle in war and they want to pursue peace. another scene is that before the good man and the ugly man arrive in the destination, the good man meets a nearly dead soldier of confederate. the good man puts his clothes on the soldier's body and gives his cigar to the soldier. the soldier smokes the final cigar and dies. this story tells us how the cruel is in the war. the movie also reflects the spirit of the wild west. like in the course book, the three cowboys are strong and do things without the law. they kill people cold and unconcerned. they are individual in most of time and there is no woman to accomplish them. they solve problems by dangerous fight or duel and do things what they want to. they are uncontrolled and use unscrupulous divisive tactics. they pursue the material wealth and have can-do spirit. i love this movie is also because of its wonderful music. in intense gun fight, the music is strong and curse. in sorrowful environment, the music is slow and emotionally. especially before the end of movie, the ugly man run between thousands of graves to find the right name of the grave which conceals the wealth. the music describe the situation coordinately and becomes classic until today. you cannot miss this excellent movie, despite the language in the movie is italian, but this does not block you to understand the story.;28 November 2011;10;['excellent', 'famous', 'western', 'different', 'good', 'bad', 'ugly',

1036;tandyandbrian;"the effects of the music in the film the good the bad and the ugly by brian coatney the good the bad and the ugly made its indelible imprint in 1966 as the third of the spaghetti western trilogy, and it remains a piece of cultural lore even today for its inimitable synchronization of music and acting that produce dramatic tension neither the music or acting alone could generate. with a script that violently veers from traditional western themes, sergio leone's artistic classic changed american culture as much as woodstock did. only a book could detail all the interesting aspects of the film, but here, i will comment on the music. music is universal and sometimes music strikes us in a way we're not even conscious of, and it draws us with a power and mystique we can't yet identify and probably don't give that much thought to at first. don't we often respond first by liking or disliking something before we know how to analyze why? so it was with the music in the good the bad and the ugly. all i knew was that the music created an alluring mood in a mysterious and enticing way, giving the sense of what film critic bill warren calls an ""astonishing score."" the music is, in fact, exceedingly more than mere background or accompaniment to the film's action; its ""lonely, mournful scores are inseparable from the film"" (ebert). critic vince leo says that morricone's score enabled the film to go from ""good film to masterpiece."" not only that, ""unlike most films, where the composer would create the music based on what happens on the screen, it is said that leone worked the opposite way, constructing scenes to fit the pieces of music"" (leo). one might say that with the good the bad and the ugly, we enjoy a film made for its soundtrack rather than a soundtrack made for a film. if asked to describe the music of the film without reference to research, i would have described it like this: full of melody, a whistle pipe sound, rattle snake clicking at times, escalating tension on some kind of stringed instrument, slightly orchestral sounds, chorallike chanting voices, dramatic and paced buildup of tensionall of which was not overpowered with bass, rhythm, and vocals, meaning therefore not a band trying to create a full sound at high amperage. somehow the music linked to the action, or shall i say non-action; for the music came into presence most it seemed when the characters stopped, spoke little, and hovered on the verge of a new twist in the drama: someone was about to draw, see an ominous presence, or experience an encounter of deep pathos and random violenceviolence random to the victim but part of the consuming scheme of getting the gold buried in the graveyard somewhere. the famous signature score for the film came to signify in popular culture, a dramatic moment with peril in the air, a kind of pop icon score tied to antiheroes and subjugation of one person's dreams to those of another. a look at the critics fills in the detail that clarifies exactly what morricone did. max garrone calls the film ""balletic violence,"" with its ""grand arias of whoops, whistles, jew's-harps, gunshots and other errata."" also, we learn that the sound comes from a ""blend of guitars, drums, and hyena-like cries from the singers"" (leo). getting more precise, warren points out that morrricone, ""blends elements of mexican mariachi music with contemporary jazz, sweeping orchestral passages, choral voices, and an overall vividly distinctive approach."" the music so much penetrates the film that it ""incorporates the howl of a coyotethe first thing we hear in the movie itselfinto the themes he creates for each title character, though the wail is orchestrated very differently each time"" (warren). director, serge leone, then must mean for us to hear the coyote's pathos in each character, whether good, bad, or uglya wail that gives us the prime musical elixir that penetrates and binds together the film's tone of deep pathos. works cited ebert, roger.

1051;vincentrizzo;having watched this film originally in the early 70's it was easy to distinguish this as a serious attempt at a spaghetti western unlike the comical trinity movies with henry fonda. there are so many scenes that are interwoven masterfully with one of the best musical scores from legend morricone. the cassette tape of the score made excellent driving music in its time. i did see this in italy in the 80's where it has always been intermittently screened since its original release but was a tad disappointed at the condition of the print. the new double disc dvd finally does this film justice as it blows up well in a big screen ht. they added stereo to the mono soundtrack and even managed to tune up the picture quality a bit from the previous anamorphic dvd.

1076;samkeogh86;"this classic western film by legendary director sergio leone remains to this day as one of the greatest westerns of all time. the characters, story and filming itself still to this day hold up against modern film making and storytelling and considering this was made in the mid 60's that is quite a feat, with special effects not quite coming into their own yet. the film is the third and final installment to the leone spaghetti western trilogy with the star of each film in clint eastwood, the famed outlaw of no name. in this film he takes on the character of blondie, ""the good"", working with eli wallach's character tuco, ""the ugly"", until of course the partnership they hold falls apart when tuco a wanted outlaw reaches the peak of his value to blondie, a partnership of money grabs from sheriffs of different towns by pretending to hand in tuco to the authorities to be hung before blondie after receiving the reward sets tuco free at the hangers rope. finally there is the character of lee van cleef, ""the bad"" who is a cruel sadistic bounty hunter, a killer in every respect whose tag line is ""when i'm paid i see the job through"". these men all come together in the pursuit of hidden gold, when soldiers fighting the civil war, tell tuco and blondie of a cemetery with $200,000 of hidden gold, they again form a begrudging alliance after tuco has tried to kill blondie. meanwhile angel eyes, ""the bad"" is searching his confederate connections where he learns of the hidden gold, and in-turn intercepts tuco and blondie as a yankee in disguise in a prison camp where tuco and blondie have been taken, when they dress in confederate army uniform and are captured. this then brings us to angel eyes forming somewhat of an alliance with blondie after he frees him of his capture in the prison camp after he sends tuco to be killed. yet again however , alliances fail with tuco escaping his yankee captor and blondie staying defensive of angel eyes, fully aware of his dangerous potential. tuco meets up gain with blondie in a small town where they together kill angel eyes's men, with angel eyes escaping and the pair making off together in pursuit of the gold. before they reach the cemetery the final hurdle for the good and the ugly comes with them running into the heart of the civil war, the bridge over the river is the final obstacle with fierce fighting taking place in order to protect it, so blondie and tuco go forth and destroy it after they agree to tell each other's part of the secret, which cemetery and which grave, yet once across the river tuco makes a break for it, but the composed blondie with classic eastwood cool again meets up with tuco at the supposed grave site, where too angel eyes again appears making for an epic showdown in the centre of the cemetery over discovering the name of the grave, with blondie being the only one with actual knowledge of said grave. the epic showdown accompanied with the epic score of ennino moriconne to back it up like was done throughout the film, see's angel eyes taken down by the quick drawing blondie and tuco again beaten by blondie who emptied tuco's gun barrel the night before, allowing for blondie to be the one with all the advantage. the final scene is where blondie with gold on horseback with tuco strung up in a tree like he did to blondie, blondie like he always has done shoots the rope freeing tuco for the last time to have his share of the money and to have blondie ride off into the distance unbeaten and victorious. the 3hr long epic is to this day one of the best ever films and one of if not the best western ever made, it was made in the golden era of westerns which extended into the 70's with other classics many of which starred eastwood himself. the actors, the writing, the filming and the music all make for the most unforgettable western ever made and like i said, despite its age, and the quality of film at the time, everything about this film all the way down to the sets and costumes is accurate to the time portrayed in the film and holds up against modern films and indeed modern westerns. after watching the film many times over it is fair to say they simply don't make movies like this anymore, movies with character, movies that are in so many ways imaginative and inventive in style and structure, the acting and scenarios never seem forced the actors never seem insincere and the tone of the film is entirely engaging throughout the film. the greatest scene of course is the final shootout, but like most westerns it is the proper conclusion of the film, though you may think it typical, i guarantee the final scene is anything but typical, it is dramatic it is tense and the music that carry's it completely immerses you into the fear and focus of the characters and i personally believe that few other westerns achieve such an intense and engaging finale and indeed an intense and engaging film throughout.";9 July 2016;9;['classic', 'western',

1077;Negotiation-835-30714;"this is the third,and arguably the best, of the so-called ""spaghetti western"" trilogy. it is ironic that, at the time the three sergio leone westerns were released, they were largely panned by critics as being poor and even laughable imitations of american-made westerns. the fact that they were filmed in italy and spain resulted in them receiving their amusing nickname which was intended to degrade them at the time. somehow, over the quarter century or so since their release, the critics have tended to change their opinions, and now these movies are generally regarded as classics. perhaps this is because clint eastwood was principally known only as the second banana, rowdy yates, in the television series ""rawhide"" when the films were produced but since then has achieved super stardom. but i also think it goes beyond that. i believe the critics decided to take another look at these films and realized that they had been premature in writing them off. actually, i believe the three films were considerably better than most of what hollywood produced. in fact, i think that tgtbatu ranks among the best westerns ever produced bringing to mind the magnificent films of john ford, the undisputed master of that genre, and his protege, the incomparable john wayne. i have nothing but praise for this film. in fact, i rank it as one of my favorite films of all time. i could write volumes of what is good about this film. but since its qualities have been oft repeated in other viewer reviews, i will focus on what others didn't like about it. most of the imdb reviews had only one major complaint: the film is too long. i disagree. in fact, in spite of its nearly three hour length, i was disappointed that it ended. i was so absorbed in the film that i was disheartened to have to return to reality. the combination of story, cinematography, acting and musical score left nothing to be desired other than more of the same! the sequences that seemed to drag on in the opinion of other reviewers were necessary to fully create moods and to drive home important points. for example, the opening sequence might be regarded as needlessly long as angel eyes taunts a hapless man over a leisurely meal. but to me, scenes like that are what makes the movie great! the time allows the viewer to fully appreciate the amazing replication of the primitive home and the pitiful life of its dirt-poor inhabitants. i felt as though i was sitting there at the table; i was half tempted to reach for a bowl and spoon to partake of the meal. and all the while the suspense was building towards the inevitable climax. you know it's coming but not when and the length of the scene drives you crazy but makes it all the more satisfying when it does happen. another example is when tuco punishes joe by forcing him to walk through the desert. this is possibly the only time that one might become bored with the film. but again, i think the time for the scene was justified in that we are able to receive the full impact of that experience and enjoy the haunting music at the same time. joe's subsequent predicament might not have had much credibility had this sequence been abbreviated. in my opinion, one of the essential elements of a great film is creating moods that absorb our attention. this often takes time, lots of time. for example, many of the scenes in the magnificent film ""dr. zhivago"" were almost painfully long but they were necessary to create those startling surrealistic moods, and the film would not have been great without them. in many ways, tgtbatu has this same sort of greatness. it is a sweeping epic with very compelling characters and magnificent settings that draws the viewer in and doesn't release him until the closing credits begin to roll. when it's over, you feel that you've been on a long and exciting journey. such a journey takes time. in summary, if you haven't seen this film, buy it right away. don't rent it because you will not want to part with it once you've seen it. then curl up with it on a cold, rainy sunday afternoon when you are in no hurry to do anything.";2 February 2014;10;['third', 'good', 'western', 'ironic', 'poor', 'laughable', 'amusing', 'second', 'rowdy', 'super', 'premature', 'well', 'most', 'good', 'magnificent', 'undisputed', 'incomparable', 'favorite', 'good', 'other', 'viewer', 'most', 'major', 'long', 'disappointed', 'musical', 'other', 'more', 'same', 'other', 'necessary', 'important', 'long', 'hapless', 'leisurely', 'great', 'amazing', 'primitive', 'pitiful', 'poor', 'inevitable', 'crazy', 'satisfying', 'tuco', 'joe', 'only', 'bored', 'able', 'full', 'same', 'subsequent', 'much', 'essential', 'great', 'many', 'magnificent', 'long', 'necessary', 'startling', 'surrealistic', 'great', 'many', 'same', 'sweeping', 'compelling', 'magnificent', 'long', 'exciting', 'cold', 'rainy'];0.1718005952380952

1092;shanecaseya;"the movie ""the good the bad and the ugly"" was written by incrocci agenore, furio scarpelli, luciano vincenzoni. sergio leone directed the western. the film is set in the south western desert area of the united states during the civil war. there are three characters all of which are outlaws but some are at times much more brutal and violent than the others. frist there is blondie (clint eastwood) the there is angel eyes (lee van cleff) and finally pablo (eli wallach). in an abstract way this is a classic story of good versus evil, but as all three are outlaws and bandits at times it is hard to tell who is good, bad or ugly. this trio fight and taunt each other across the war torn south west in search of buried union gold. during this quest they stack bodies everywhere. until the final show down and yes you guessed it blondie wins and kill angel eyes and holds pablo at gun point and makes him dig the gold up for him. then he rides off into the sunset as it were. it seems that this is a western explanation of yin and yang as in this movie nothing is 100% bad or 100% good. it seems that most of eastwood's movies follow this path. i found strong story ties between this movie and ""a fist full of dollars"". a scene that stands out as a picture of good versus evil and the yin and yang theme is at one point blondie and pablo wonder on to a battle field and talk to a union captain and then watch a battle where the killing is no stop. during a lull in the fight these two, who could have went around the battle sneak onto it and blow a bridge so that the two sides cannot get to each other to fight. the wide angle camera angles and photography by tonino delli colli that show the landscaped some the best i have ever seen. then it would be snapped instantly to an extreme close up. these scenes were incredible as it would put an exclamation point on the feelings and emotion of the scenes. the biggest down point he allowed some stereotypical elements enter and were pushed too hard. probably the biggest one of these was pablo. one aspect that truly sets the film and adds an element that if it were not present the film would be far less. that is the haunting and captivating ability of the musical score by ennio morricone that is present though out the movie.";4 February 2015;10;['good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'western', 'south', 'western', 'civil', 'brutal', 'violent', 'abstract', 'classic', 'hard', 'good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'other', 'final', 'western', 'bad', 'most', 'strong', 'full', 'other', 'wide', 'delli', 'good', 'extreme', 'incredible', 'big', 'down', 'stereotypical', 'big', 'pablo', 'present', 'less', 'musical', 'present'];-0.0723090277777778

1114;kartikpandey-77852;the movie is long, but there's not a wasted scene in the film. each one slowly lets the film unfold with a certain style and grace, revealing more about each character and what's going on. the pacing is incredible, as is the direction - sergio leone manages to build a lot of uncomfortable tension in the film, keeping the film from ever getting predictable. any typical western cliche that you can possibly think of is either given a unique twist or utterly destroyed by leone's masterful storytelling. of special mention is ennio morricone's score, which is absolutely perfect. two scenes - one in a union prison camp, one in the climatic gunfight in the cemetery at the end of the film - are amazing on their own, but they become absolutely astonishing with combined with morricone's powerful score.;28 June 2017;6;['long', 'certain', 'more', 'incredible', 'uncomfortable', 'predictable', 'typical', 'western', 'unique', 'masterful', 'special', 'perfect', 'climatic', 'amazing', 'own', 'astonishing', 'powerful'];0.339360119047619

1118;habde;"recently i saw ""the good, the bad, and the ugly"" (or ""il buono, il brutto, il cattivo"" in italian), a film directed by sergio leone and starring clint eastwood, lee van cleef, and eli wallach. it is a western-and probably the greatest western i've seen-that takes place during the civil war (1862). in the beginning of the movie, eastwood's unnamed character dubbed by wallach's character ""blondie"" (usually credited as ""joe"") meets and partner's up with the mexican tuco ramirez (wallach). soon blondie double crosses tuco and tuco swears revenge. while he is getting revenge by making blondie walk through the desert with no water for miles, they stumble upon a dying man who in return for a promise of water tells them where $100,000 is buried. the only problem is that he tells tuco what cemetery it's in, and tells blondie the grave just before dying. they once again are partners and their future wealth depends on the other. unfortunately, a notorious bounty hunter, who will do anything for money, sentenza (lee van cleef) nicknamed ""angel eyes"" knows of the money and tries to find it. along the way the three run into the civil war and our two heroes even get taken in as prisoners. the actors were well chosen. all three are/were amazing actors able to portray the characters perfectly. it's not often that a jewish actor from brooklyn is as convincing of a mexican as wallach. he was able to give amazing life and character to the greedy, dirty, yet humorous, and somewhat lovable tuco that i don't think the best actor of today could top. eastwood played the type of tough, gun slinging, cowboy that he was so good at and i think he was born for. it seemed as if it were him just being his natural self the way he played blondie, he was kind and showed compassion just with the expression on his face with the slightly squinting eyes and his constant offer of the only thing he could give to comfort someone, a cigar; and smart and reasonable, yet he was ready to kill anyone who started trouble or was in his way. finally, lee van cleef plays the bad-ass angel eyes, showing complete greed, and evil. his character is as cruel as can be and doesn't care who he kills or what happens to others just as long as he gets it his way, as he always does. even the small characters played their part well from the drunk union captain to the old storekeeper whom gave me a few laughs to father ramirez (tuco's brother) to even the poor fellow whom angel eyes kills in the beginning. and all actors gave a realistic look to it by the way they acted. they were not like some others in westerns that had completely clean and well shaven faces. they had visible sweat and dirt on their faces, their hair was not always well combed (especially tuco) and they were ragged when needed, they were more truthful, you can't go across the desert without getting dirty and sweaty. you could look at their faces and say ""wow, look at tuco, he's dirty and unkempt"" and ""wow, blondie's face is all messed up not the condition you expect the main character to be in"" or ""not only does angel eyes have a dirty, cruel personality, but he looks so too."" another phenomenal thing about this movie was the soundtrack made by the ingenious ennio morricone. to call it amazing would be an understatement. the opening credits alone which is where that great music first graces the ears of the audience with its beauty are amazing. even without seeing or hearing of the movie, you know the music, weather you've seen the movie or not. it has been in so many places, imitated so many times you could start playing it to someone who never saw a second of the movie and they'd whistle along to the familiar tune. in parts it is strong and in other parts it is soft as a kitten. in parts it bears the feeling of adventure and excitement, and in others through the air vibrates music more solemn and serious. in many parts, the movement of characters is done to the music. it is a famous and historic soundtrack and is most definitely the most famous of morricone's work. leone directed it fantastically too. firstly, he uses the widescreen in a way unlike any other except akira kurisawa. every inch of the screen is important to him, and he either fills it all with people and action, or makes it empty to create an emptier effect. he also does many great camera angles and shots. for example, a sequence of cannon fire looking straight at the mouth of the cannon or from the side or some slanted angle. he quickly cuts between the firing cannons to show pandemonium and to make it seem like heavier bombardment than it could if he simply showed the land being hit. he also deserves great credit (along with luciano vincenzoni) for writing such a great story and script. it is also worthy to mention how he went about the scene in which the characters blow up a bridge. he hired men to build a huge bridge and then rig it up with dynamite. knowing that he only had one chance at this scene, he set up cameras all over the place to make a great moment in the movie and capture such a great image. i highly recommend seeing this movie and others with these actors and leone. this movie alone has changed my life and influenced me with ideas. there is so much to enjoy, observe, and learn from this film. anyone who sees this movie can see that the actors are amazing, that leone is an auteur, and morricone a musical genius. no one but these men could have created such a great classic western.";11 October 2005;10;['bad', 'ugly', 'western', 'great', 'western', 'civil', 'unnamed', 'double', 'tuco', 'only', 'future', 'other', 'notorious', 'civil', 'amazing', 'able', 'jewish', 'convincing', 'able', 'amazing', 'greedy', 'dirty', 'humorous', 'lovable', 'good', 'tough', 'good', 'natural', 'kind', 'constant', 'only', 'smart', 'reasonable', 'ready', 'bad', 'complete', 'cruel', 'small', 'old', 'few', 'poor', 'realistic', 'clean', 'shaven', 'visible', 'truthful', 'dirty', 'dirty', 'main', 'dirty', 'cruel', 'phenomenal', 'ingenious', 'amazing', 'great', 'amazing', 'many', 'many', 'familiar', 'strong', 'other', 'soft', 'solemn', 'serious', 'many', 'famous', 'historic', 'famous', 'other', 'important', 'empty', 'emptier', 'many', 'great', 'slanted', 'heavy', 'great', 'great', 'worthy', 'huge', 'great', 'great', 'much', 'amazing', 'musical', 'great', 'classic'];0.1796719576719577

1126;Diegbl;clint eastwood. lee van cleef. eli wallach. sad hill cemetery. hidden gold. with these five elements, sergio leone and ennio morricone build what for many of us is the best ending in seventh art history. but before talking about the ending, it is essential that we review the events that have led us to such a situation and, what is even more important, the characters who, in one way or another, are predestined to face each other. on the one hand, we have tuco, played by eli wallach, who is probably the character that viewers will most easily sympathize with. his motivation is simple: making money, and he has no problem about crawling on the floor or being humiliated to get it. sergio leone is in charge of constantly emphasizing these personal traits, summarized in the following sentence: where we were born, in order not to die of hunger, we had to choose, be a priest or a bandit. next to him, we have blondie, played by clint eastwood. no one doubts that his main motivation is to earn money, but it is undeniable that he is a character with greater pride, it means that he is not willing to take the money if he must kneel for it. he is a cold, calculating and intelligent character, and those adjectives are also useful when talking about sentenza, played by lee van cleef, who is not much different from rubio, but with an even more evil and perverse background. the construction of characters throughout the film is simply wonderful, the picture shows us different scenes and situations in which we can draw conclusions about the behavior of each of the protagonists. the photography follows a very similar style to that of leone's other films, with its characteristic zooms to the faces of the characters, which somehow help us to understand the emotions they express even more easily. leone is also capable of managing the narrative tempo and tightening the dramatic chord in certain scenes, without forgetting that we are watching a spaghetti western and that, by definition, it should be entertaining for the viewer. the soundtrack should not even be commented, because ennio morricone once again creates one of those soundtracks that remain in the public's head for centuries, being part of popular culture and representing an entire cinematographic genre such as the spaghetti western. however, and although it is undeniable that the first two hours and twenty minutes of the film are of impressive quality, it is the last twenty minutes that make it one of the greatest classics in seventh art history. the ending is so good that we don't have to talk deeply about technical topics to understand and analyze its greatness, i think it seems unfair to have to talk about photography, editing, performances, music, etc. when talking about this ending. and the thing is, i truly believe that the magic of the ending is that, unlike in many other so charged with drama endings, the characters end up behaving as planned, just as the script has shown us throughout the film, being faithful to the script and, consequently, to the viewers. in that instant, you realized that the good behaves as good fellows do, the bad ends as bad guys end, and the ugly ends up depending on the honor of good men. it is at that moment that clint eastwood looks at eli wallach and says: it seems just like old times. it is at that moment that you understand that everything fits, and then the music, photography and editing merge into a same element, and each character ends as the title of the picture suggests: the good, the bad and the ugly.;14 September 2020;10;['hidden', 'many', 'good', 'seventh', 'essential', 'important', 'other', 'simple', 'personal', 'following', 'main', 'undeniable', 'great', 'willing', 'cold', 'intelligent', 'useful', 'different', 'evil', 'perverse', 'wonderful', 'different', 'similar', 'other', 'characteristic', 'capable', 'narrative', 'dramatic', 'certain', 'western', 'entertaining', 'popular', 'entire', 'such', 'western', 'undeniable', 'first', 'impressive', 'last', 'great', 'seventh', 'good', 'technical', 'unfair', 'many', 'other', 'faithful', 'good', 'good', 'bad', 'bad', 'ugly', 'good', 'old', 'same', 'bad', 'ugly'];0.1047857142857142
