0;TheLittleSongbird;i do love all three films of the lord of the rings trilogy, all are visually stunning with wonderful music and strong narratives. the two towers is my personal favourite of the three for several reasons. for one thing it is less talky than fellowship of the ring, and the pace is a little more secure here. also the final battle is just breathtaking in the action, direction and in its scope, and very compelling and epic. and some of the characters are developed more here than they were in fellowship of the ring primarily frodo and aragorn, who were played very well there but a little bland in comparison to here. when it comes to the scope the two towers is possibly the biggest in the trilogy. the cinematography is one of the strongest assets, while the scenery, costumes, lighting and make up(the orcs look amazing) are all gorgeous. you can tell a lot of effort went into this and it showed. the music is also darker and perhaps more complex, the story is richer and compelling and the dialogue is thought provoking. people may disagree, but i think the two towers is the best directed of the trilogy too. the acting is very good. elijah wood is likable enough with a stronger-written character, while sean astin's bumbling persona suits sam really well. viggo mortensson is as strong and charismatic as ever. ian mckellen, christopher lee and bernard hill are also perfectly cast, but the real revelation in my view with this movie is gollum. here gollum is designed superbly, and andy serkis's performance is absolutely phenomenal and oscar-nod worthy. in conclusion, a fine film and for me my personal favourite of the trilogy. 10/10 bethany cox;8 March 2011;10;['stunning', 'wonderful', 'strong', 'personal', 'several', 'talky', 'secure', 'final', 'compelling', 'epic', 'little', 'bland', 'big', 'strong', 'amazing', 'gorgeous', 'dark', 'complex', 'rich', 'compelling', 'good', 'likable', 'strong', 'charismatic', 'real', 'phenomenal', 'oscar', 'worthy', 'fine', 'personal'];0.295216049382716
1;Leofwine_draca;"well, i'll be darned if this isn't one of the best epic movies i've ever seen in my life. and am ever likely to see in my life. following in the footsteps of the fellowship of the ring, peter jackson's second instalment of the trilogy ups the ante tenfold, offering one amazing movie packed with heart, action, romance, dazzling effects, and brilliant characters. thankfully free of the time-consuming introduction needed to begin the first part of tolkien's trilogy, jackson now has time to focus on developing characters, perilous quests, and, of course, out-and-out action. i'm an action lover at heart so i was in seventh heaven watching this movie. everything you could want from the second book is here, up on screen and even more amazing than tolkien could render. plus, jackson has done his magic and inserted a few memorable scenes of his own so there are plenty of surprises even for those who know whats coming. where to begin with such a film? the characters, i guess. jackson takes the option of cross-cutting repeatedly between the three different sets of principal characters and his method pays off nicely, offering a well-rounded film that never lets up with the drama (i was astonished that three hours had passed by the time this was over it felt more like just one hour). merry and pippin's encounter with the ents is awe-inspiring stuff. of course, a walking tree is a hard thing to portray, but with the aid of some outstanding special effects jackson does it and does it so superbly. then we have frodo and sam crossing the dead marshes (complete with creepy corpse ghosts the horror imagery is strong in this movie folks, and jackson doesn't skimp on the splatter either) and meeting up with totally cgi-created gollum. gollum is fantastic, a breath of life straight from the book; andy serkis does wonders with his voice and movements and helps to craft the flawed, schizophrenic psychology of the ugly but hugely sympathetic creature. the main action, of course, comes from the whole aragorn/legolas/gimli storyline, mixing in plenty of incident and nasty creatures along the way. the bear-like whargs are violent and unpleasant; the oliphants are amusing and breathtaking in equal measure; the nazgul and their winged demons are fantastic to behold. visually, the film is always spectacular, splendid and sweeping; it makes even better use of the varied new zealand countryside than the last film which is no mean feat. howard shore's sweeping score is better than before and highlights the evocative nature of the movie, often threatening to overwhelm us with the sheer wonder of it all. this is tolkien. of course, the movie finishes off with the battle of helm's deep, a forty-minute non-stop barrage of carnage and destruction, explosions, mayhem and might. it's easily one of the best battles ever put on film and the special effects are entirely convincing (as they are throughout). i'll confess that i was close to tears at a couple of points the white light streaming onto the battlefield, the breaking of the dam at isengard these flawless moments just choked me up and made me glad to be able to appreciate the true wonder of cinema. the cast is flawless exemplary performances from the recurring cast members, kudos to newcomers brad dourif, miranda otto, and karl urban, and especial mention to bernard hill. nothing more can be said. a modern classic i'm only too privileged to have seen on its opening night.";19 August 2016;10;['good', 'epic', 'likely', 'second', 'amazing', 'dazzling', 'brilliant', 'free', 'first', 'perilous', 'seventh', 'second', 'amazing', 'few', 'memorable', 'own', 'different', 'principal', 'rounded', 'hard', 'outstanding', 'special', 'dead', 'complete', 'creepy', 'strong', 'cgi', 'fantastic', 'flawed', 'schizophrenic', 'ugly', 'hugely', 'sympathetic', 'main', 'whole', 'gimli', 'nasty', 'violent', 'unpleasant', 'amusing', 'equal', 'winged', 'fantastic', 'spectacular', 'splendid', 'sweeping', 'well', 'varied', 'last', 'mean', 'sweeping', 'well', 'evocative', 'sheer', 'deep', 'non', 'stop', 'good', 'special', 'convincing', 'close', 'white', 'flawless', 'glad', 'able', 'true', 'flawless', 'exemplary', 'brad', 'especial', 'modern', 'privileged'];0.2088690476190475
2;SnoopyStyle;the fellowship has scattered. frodo baggins and samwise gamgee, on their journey to mordor, encounter a vile creature named gollum. aragorn, legolas, and gimli are chasing the kidnappers of merry and pippin. merry and pippin manage to escape and befriend tree shepherd ent treebeard. aragorn, legolas, and gimli encounter gandalf reborn as gandalf the white. they go to rohan to find king theoden under the control of evil saruman. the story and the characters get split up into basically three groups. that back and forth can scatter the tension a little bit. it's a small drawback. i would consider doing frodo and samwise in the first half leaving the others to the second half. that would keep continuity flowing. the cgi is world class and nothing is more impressive than gollum. the movie is able to keep the story compelling in all aspects.;28 September 2016;8;['samwise', 'vile', 'gimli', 'gimli', 'evil', 'little', 'small', 'first', 'second', 'impressive', 'able', 'compelling'];0.0765625
3;Hitchcoc;this is the war. this is the necessary part of the film to set up the finale. because it's the middle child, it doesn't get the attention or respect. once one has all three films in hand, he can begin to view them as a single entity. still they are considered to be separate. the arising of the gollum. the series of battles that make up this film are so incredible. though made at the same time, the tales gain the advantage of advances in production techniques and graphics. there is not much exposition here, though new characters are made available to us. it is rather to get from point a to point b and make way for the final book. the rocky relationship between frodo and sam continues, frodo fixated on the ring and all that it implies. then there are the magnificent battle scenes with the unlikeliest of creatures forming alliances. i read reviews by people who are so into these books that they nitpick over every aberration from the original works. this is a movie. it's accessible to anyone, including those who will never make their way through the novel. the novels aren't for everyone. they are filled with long introspective meanderings and a good deal of poetry (hardly any of which is in any of the three films). like with trekkies, it's hard to talk with these people because of the obsessiveness about a single piece of literature--the betrayal they feel. just enjoy what peter jackson was able to do. it will live forever in film history.;16 March 2006;9;['necessary', 'middle', 'single', 'separate', 'incredible', 'same', 'much', 'new', 'available', 'final', 'rocky', 'magnificent', 'unlikeli', 'original', 'accessible', 'long', 'introspective', 'good', 'hard', 'single', 'able'];0.2438649891774891
4;Horst_In_Translation;"""the lord of the rings: the two towers"" is the middle piece of peter jackson's ""lord of the rings""-trilogy. awards-wise the least successful, i would also classify this film inferior to 1 and 3. it starts with the plot twist that gandalf is actually alive and we see gollum for the first time, the visual description of what the ring does to people. for the most part, we follow sam and frodo (group 1) and aragorn, legolas and gimli (group 2) after boromir's death. sam's behavior towards gollum stood a bit in contrast to his warmheartedness with frodo, but apart from that i liked these two story lines and also the introduction of gollum (possibly the most interesting character from the trilogy). i really was not impressed at all with the storyline of the king who obeys to his evil snake servant and the whole family business of the king. aragorn looking at the traces and seeing that the two hobbits must still be alive was complete nonsense. the tree creatures (on which the hobbits spend pretty much the whole film) were quite nice though. however, there were some problems with these too. the tree promised gandalf nothing would happen to the hobbits. so how come these hobbits climb right that tree who vowed to protect them? he sure did not follow them. he was even sleeping before they woke him up. and why does he think they are orcs at first? and when did the other hobbit duo become brave enough to scream at the trees to get them to help? they were just fools before all that and i just cannot see them transforming into credible heroes. nonsense, i say. also they don't even ask if gandalf is still alive. another thing i wondered was how aragorn knew that sam was with frodo. but that's just a minor criticism. one hour into the movie, frodo and sam are at the gates of mordor. so what would happen the next 2.5 hours. well.. the kingdom story happened and it did nothing for me. you can say yes it was in the book, but still you can cut the uninteresting parts and maybe make this an hour shorter and avoid the dragging. and that guy's name was wormtongue? really? that sounds like it would be the villain from a children's film. or harry potter maybe. anyway, the character was played by brad dourif, roughly three decades after his most significant role in cuckoo's nest, an interesting snippet in my opinion. also the farewell song for the king's son did not move me at all. the whole story of miranda otto's character and aragorn i could have done without. it added nothing really. saruman stays the main villain here just like in the first film, so it is a bit surprising as everybody keeps talking only about sauron when it comes to lotr-villains. the creatures in this movie were top-notch, just like in the first, especially the wolves of isengard. gimli provided comic relief again and it helped a lot that he had bud spencer's dubbed voice. great fan here of the spaghetti westerns. that scene in which he asks aragorn to throw him and not tell ""the elf"" was very funny. the main characters keep surviving under the most difficult circumstances that you sometimes wonder if they are actually immortal (aragorn here in particular, and gandalf early on as well). liv tyler looks pretty nice and so does orlando bloom, but the latter did not do really much for me. his character is so interesting, but acting-wise and story-wise it was all very underwhelming about legolas. back to frodo and sam, i liked the issue if frodo's friendship with sam could survive frodo's ring connection with gollum. which of the two is stronger? you may need to wait for film 3 for a final decision. and please disregard frodo's constant visions and deliria. these were not done convincingly at all. the big problem this film has that despite its stunning visuals, it is fairly uninteresting from an emotional standpoint. neither the kids having to go to war as soldiers nor all the groups of fighters spectacularly coming to help our heroes at helm's deep i found particularly captivating (except the trees maybe, that was slightly intimidating). the second half of the film was weaker than the first i felt, mostly thanks to gollum's introduction and presence early on. at least gollum gets the final scene, so we can look forward to him in the final film. random note: why is smeagol not naked and why does he wear a slip if he cares about nothing but the ring. we will never know. after that scene, we hear the closing credits. and while i liked enya's song from the fellowship, this one is a disappointment. it sounds much more like a bond song and brings none of the fantastic aspects of the film to the table. i recommend this film to fantasy lovers. if you somehow enjoy the very overrated ""game of thrones"" and still have not seen jackson's lotr trilogy, it is high time. they will enjoy it, but i cannot call this film an epic, let alone the entire trilogy.";1 December 2014;6;['middle', 'successful', 'inferior', 'alive', 'first', 'visual', 'most', 'gimli', 'interesting', 'evil', 'whole', 'aragorn', 'alive', 'complete', 'whole', 'nice', 'gandalf', 'other', 'brave', 'credible', 'alive', 'aragorn', 'minor', 'next', 'short', 'wormtongue', 'significant', 'interesting', 'whole', 'main', 'first', 'surprising', 'top', 'first', 'gimli', 'comic', 'great', 'aragorn', 'funny', 'main', 'difficult', 'immortal', 'aragorn', 'particular', 'nice', 'much', 'interesting', 'wise', 'underwhelming', 'strong', 'final', 'constant', 'big', 'stunning', 'uninteresting', 'emotional', 'deep', 'second', 'weak', 'first', 'least', 'final', 'final', 'random', 'naked', 'more', 'fantastic', 'overrated', 'high', 'entire'];0.1851488095238095

6;classicsoncall;"""the lord of the rings"" continues it's epic quest in this second installment of the trilogy, as the original fellowship is disbanded and it's various members must continue the good fight. while frodo and sam pursue their mission to mordor, pippin and merry manage to escape the uruk hai into the fangorn forest and their own adventure with the ents. aragorn, legolas and gimli traverse the riddermark into the realm of rohan. the one ring begins to deepen it's spell over frodo who questions his worthiness and stomach for the mission. this facet of his character allows sam (sean astin) to portray his devotion and loyalty to his master, particularly when gollum makes his appearance and becomes their guide. gollum's looks are rivaled only by his treachery, and the duality of his personality is given emphasis in the tortured conversations he has with himself. i was a bit surprised at the way gollum was portrayed in ""the two towers""; his cameo appearance in the first film as a slinky black cave denizen more closely resembled tolkien's description and corresponded to the mental image i took away when reading about it. at the same time though, there was almost a comic element to it, whereas his physical features presented here more accurately allowed for a menacing but tortured creature. even more fantastic creatures find cgi life in the film; i found the presentation of the ents to be masterfully done. the ""olyphants"" were a neat touch and i was happy to see them included. of course the orcs, wargs and uruk hai all personify the evil that befalls middle earth in this dire time, and their presence instills fear and dread for the heroes all along the way. there's a lot going on in the film, and repeated viewings are helpful, along with an understanding created by reading tolkien's story. though not entirely necessary to enjoy the movie, i feel it grounds the viewer in the rich background of the characters and locations. actually, the books and the film complement each other nicely, even though the movie of necessity must leave out some elements. there is no doubt that ""the lord of the rings"" has earned it's reputation as one of the greatest epic films of all time and the best fantasy film of them all. at the same time, it does a wonderful job of examining such themes as honor, loyalty, friendship and love as it's characters interact with each other and find common ground against a threat to their very existence.";28 December 2005;10;['epic', 'second', 'original', 'various', 'good', 'uruk', 'own', 'gimli', 'surprised', 'cameo', 'first', 'slinky', 'black', 'mental', 'same', 'comic', 'physical', 'menacing', 'tortured', 'fantastic', 'neat', 'happy', 'uruk', 'middle', 'dire', 'helpful', 'necessary', 'rich', 'other', 'great', 'epic', 'good', 'same', 'wonderful', 'such', 'other', 'common', 'very'];0.1701149425287356

16;Theo Robertson;don't you just hate cinemas ? no matter where you sit you always end up surrounded by people who spend their time chatting amongst themselves as to the events on screen 30 seconds before they happen . if we're after a running commentary we'll buy the dvd thank you very much . add to this unattended mad mental kids running around wild . in fact many years ago our local newspaper saw a no holds barred letter of complaint about a screening of 3 men and a little lady which referred to foul mouthed juvenile delinquents in the audience . and on top of all this i'm a chainsmoker and cinema chains don't allow patrons to poison themselves or others with nicotine so as a rule i don't visit cinemas . but it's a rule i broke in order to see the two towers because i was literally dying to see it . so i booked my ticket well in advance for the premier screening in rothesay on the 26th of january , popped into the cinema that night and demanded to be entertained ****** spoilers ****** i was entertained and more , but i later had some reservations . on a technical level ttt not only does not disappoint but it outdoes fellowship in terms of both scope and scale but this doesn't automatically make it as some people have claimed a better film . the battles of helms deep and isengard are truly breath taking and out do anything hollywood has done , but ironically by concentrating on spectacle ttt feels more like a hollywood film than fellowship . and all this spectacle causes a problem for peter jackson - how does he finish all these impossibly epic set pieces ? the simple answer is he can't ! as several reviewers have mentioned the fractured storyline comes to the rescue of the director in much the same way as gandalf rides to the rescue of helms deep : cut to the most breath taking calvary charge in the history of cinema , cut to the ents attacking isengard and then cut back to helms deep where our heroes have snatched victory from the jaws of defeat , except they did so mainly off screen . it's as if the director has used the fractured storyline in order to get himself out of a corner . likewise reviewers on this site have noticed the story telling technique hides several plot holes involving characters appearing and disappearing to and from the story . of course you don't notice these flaws at the time due to the awesome onscreen visuals but there is one major criticism you can level at ttt as soon as the credits roll and that's a lack of an emotional impact . yes you'll gasp and cheer and feel your heart race but you won't burst into tears . remember the scenes in the first film where the fellowship escape into the mountains after gandalf has confronted the balrog or the departure of boromir ? remember how your throat tightened and you nearly had a tear run down your face ? of course you do because these two scenes are amongst the most moving and heart wrenching in cinema history . unfortunately there is no similar equivalent in ttt . and the film also cries out for a flawed but noble ambigous anti hero like boromir in a story where everyone is either good or evil and no in between , though this is almost certainly the fault of tolkien rather than jackson who does manage to get the best out of his cast in film lacking in character development . special mention goes to andy serkis who alas seems to have missed out on nominations for best supporting actor , brad dourif who plays a very slimy villain , and bernard hill who made me forget that this is the same actor who played yosser hughes in boys from the blackstuff 20 years ago . but i couldn't help but miss sean bean and i suppose casting him as faramir twin brother of boromir would have been just too obvious but despite my criticisms i enjoyed ttt immensely and for three magical hours i forgot all about my nicotine addiction and the world outside . no doubt the audience at the rothesay cinema felt the same way as me as we watched this film in a hushed silence . we laughed at the right bits , gasped at the technical achievements , but no one cried which means i can only award the two towers 9 out of 10;27 January 2003;9;['unattended', 'mad', 'mental', 'wild', 'many', 'local', 'little', 'foul', 'mouthed', 'juvenile', 'more', 'technical', 'well', 'deep', 'epic', 'set', 'simple', 'several', 'fractured', 'same', 'gandalf', 'most', 'calvary', 'fractured', 'several', 'awesome', 'major', 'emotional', 'first', 'moving', 'similar', 'flawed', 'noble', 'ambigous', 'anti', 'good', 'evil', 'good', 'special', 'good', 'slimy', 'same', 'twin', 'obvious', 'magical', 'rothesay', 'same', 'right', 'technical'];0.1233193277310924

19;Boba_Fett1138;"watching this movie is like watching a 179 or 223 minutes long action sequence. the pace is incredibly high. alright i have to admit that the extended edition of the ""the lord of the rings: the two towers"" takes an awful lot of this pace away and make some of the scene's unnecessary long and the scene's with treebeard are also a bit dull and long but still...especially compared to the first that was just too slow at times this is an huge improvement! luckily there also are some welcome additions in the extended edition. best addition are the scene's with boromir, faramir and denethor in osgiliath. there also are some newly great characters and actors. david wenham is a surprisingly talented young actor and i think it's great that they actually have cast someone that really looks like sean bean. bernard hill also impressed me, he probably is best know for his role as the captain in ""titanic"" in which he also already impressed me. viggo mortensen probably still is the best actor of ""the lord of the rings"" movies. yes sure ian mckellen and christopher lee are also more than great but mortensen really puts some passion and effort in his character. i know sean astin is always being praised a lot but i seriously don't think that he is such a good actor in any of ""the lord of the rings"" movies. andy serkis also was really good as gollum/smeagol and i wouldn't had mind seeing him get an oscar nod. strange thing is that the gimli and legolas suddenly changed into some comical sidekick characters. it was odd to see but it works! they provide some good comical relief at times. most fantastic thing about the movie is that it's really action filled. the battle of helm's deep truly is fantastic to see. still favorite and most powerful moment of the movie is when the ent's march to war. also the scene's with the riders of rohan are a true spectacle. i've never been really a big fan of the editing of ""the lord of the rings"" movies and this one is no exception. problem is that peter jackson shot way too many hours of footage with as a result that the editors have difficulties picking the right scene's and the length of them. but ""the lord of the rings: the two towers"" is one of those movies were the pluses make more than up for the minuses. a spectacular adventure action experience. 10/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/";19 March 2005;10;['long', 'high', 'extended', 'awful', 'unnecessary', 'treebeard', 'dull', 'long', 'first', 'slow', 'huge', 'welcome', 'extended', 'good', 'great', 'talented', 'young', 'great', 'good', 'titanic', 'good', 'great', 'good', 'good', 'strange', 'gimli', 'comical', 'odd', 'good', 'comical', 'most', 'fantastic', 'deep', 'fantastic', 'favorite', 'powerful', 'true', 'big', 'many', 'right', 'more', 'spectacular'];0.3253346203346204

23;neil-476;the central part of peter jackson's 3 part adaptation of lord of the rings suffers, inevitably, from the fact that it doesn't have a proper beginning (unless you watch fellowship of the ring immediately beforehand) or end (unless you watch return of the king immediately afterwards). what it does have, however, is gollum, an extraordinary creation to the joint credit of voice and movement artist andy serkis, dressed up on screen by the amazing work of weta digital, jackson's in-house digital effects team. what results is what, at the time, was the most convincing wholly digital on-screen character yet seen. even more extraordinary, the movie gollum acquired an element of pathos which his creator seemed unable to give him on the page. gollum's actions are driven by evil - gollum himself is tragic: tolkien said this, but i think he must have disliked gollum, because i always felt that he was unable to translate the truth of this onto paper. yet jackson and his team manage to. this film, ultimately, though, chronicles the trials and tribulations of the separate elements of the fellowship as they move onwards, introducing the riders of rohan on the way, and culminating in the epic siege of heml's deep, something of a smokescreen to conceal frodo, sam and gollum creeping quietly ever nearer to mordor. as with part 1, the casting, performances, pacing and look of the film are flawless.;28 April 2010;9;['central', 'proper', 'extraordinary', 'joint', 'amazing', 'weta', 'digital', 'convincing', 'digital', 'extraordinary', 'unable', 'evil', 'tragic', 'unable', 'separate', 'epic', 'near', 'flawless'];0.0144444444444444

26;Wuchakk;"released in 2002 and directed by peter jackson, ""the lord of the rings: the two towers"" adapts the second part of jrr tolkien's popular fantasy trilogy about adventures on middle-earth. the surviving 'fellowship' of the first film has been divided into three small groups for this one: the hobbits frodo and sam (elijah wood and sean astin) team-up with the mad gollum (andy serkis) to make their way to mordor, but are captured by faramir (david wenham), the brother of the deceased boromir. aragorn (viggo mortensen), legolas the elf (orlando bloom) and gimli the dwarf (john rhys-davies) encounter the once-great king theoden (bernard hill), who has fallen under the spell of saruman (christopher lee) via his devious minion grima wormtongue (brad dourif). meanwhile the hobbits pippin and merry (billy boyd and dominic monaghan) try to enlist the help of huge tree creatures. gandalf is also on hand (ian mckellen). these story threads culminate in the great battle at helms deep in the third hour. this three-hour fantasy/adventure starts out more engaging than the first film, which was laden by its overlong, convoluted and (for the most part) unnecessary prologue. like that movie, the characters are colorful, the tale is imaginative, there's a lot of brutal action rounded out by quieter moments and everything looks and sounds great. unfortunately, after the first act, jackson opts for cgi porn (excessive use of cgi with the corresponding dizzying visual effects). the first film did this too, but this one ups the ante and so there's not as much spectacular new zealand cinematography (i.e. real forests, mountains, rivers, etc.). if cartoony cgi is your thang then you'll likely appreciate this installment more than me. there are other problems: while the characters are imaginative, they're also shallow and rather dull, at least for mature people who require more depth to maintain their interest. also, the wide-spanning (meandering) story with numerous characters and hard-to-remember names tends to be disengaging. i was never much captivated by the characters and their causes, although uber-fans of tolkien might be. another problem is the lack of prominent female protagonists. we have miranda otto as eowyn, theoden's niece, who falls in love with the noble aragorn and that's about it, except for cameos by liv tyler as arwen and cate blanchett as galadriel. ""mythica: a quest for heroes"" (2014) cost less than $100,000 to make, which is a mere fraction of the $94 million it cost to make this blockbuster and the filmmakers knew enough to include a couple of prominent babes as key protagonists in the story. despite these negatives, ""the two towers"" was an ultra-ambitious undertaking and is a must for fantasy/adventure aficionados who liked the first movie. the movie runs 2 hours 59 minutes and was shot in new zealand. grade: b-/c+";10 March 2018;6;['second', 'popular', 'middle', 'first', 'small', 'mad', 'deceased', 'aragorn', 'gimli', 'great', 'devious', 'dominic', 'huge', 'great', 'third', 'engaging', 'first', 'laden', 'convoluted', 'most', 'unnecessary', 'colorful', 'imaginative', 'brutal', 'great', 'first', 'excessive', 'corresponding', 'dizzying', 'visual', 'first', 'much', 'spectacular', 'real', 'more', 'other', 'imaginative', 'shallow', 'dull', 'least', 'mature', 'more', 'numerous', 'prominent', 'female', 'noble', 'less', 'mere', 'prominent', 'key', 'ultra', 'ambitious', 'first'];0.1642276422764227

28;zetes;i found the first installment of this series pretty good, but ultimately sloppy. it was just too repetitive, with the characters doing nothing but travelling forward, stopping sporadically to fight battles against forces of faceless monsters which ridiculously outnumbered them. the second installment, of course, picks up right where the first one ended, although it has broken into three narrative tracks. the cutting between the three makes the first half of the film rather uneven. the plotline of aragorn, gimli, and legolas defending the people of rohan is especially slow, and there isn't enough exposition to explain what the heck is going on. i'm actually glad for that, as i'd rather sit through incomprehensible plot than have to listen to twenty more minutes of explaining who the heck these people are and what the heck is going on. i turned to my friend, a long-time lover of the novels, and asked him and he quickly caught me up. pippin and merry, the two hobbits who were captured by orcs at the end of the first movie, escape and run into a sacred forest and are captured by a giant talking tree called an ent. this plotline is slow, too, but the tree monsters were neat enough to hold my attention. the third plotline, the one with frodo and sam, is by far the most interesting. gollum, the former owner of the ring, now obsessed with it, attacks them and is captured. he soon becomes their guide when frodo begins to sympathize with his downfall. gollum is by far the most interesting character in the film, like yoda in the empire strikes back. this is the first computer-generated character to work completely. except for his eyes, i'd accept him as a physical entity. and his story and performance are just so tragic that these parts were nearly overwhelming at times. it's too bad they don't award voice characterizations (and i can't find who did it on imdb). the special effects guys really, truly deserve to win an oscar for their work here. he was so interesting, i wanted the whole movie to be based from his point of view for a lot of the film. fortunately, the other two stories do begin to work after a while. there's a great, kinetic battle scene with some wolves that was apparently not in the novel, which, of course, angers all the nerds. this leads to some material about liv tyler's character which was also not in the book. my lotr nerd friend admitted that these scenes were good, and, in my mind, that was the first real scene that got me to give the slightest care for aragorn, who seems so important but, to me, seemed so uninteresting in the first movie and a lot of this one. the elf and dwarf also begin to come into their own, although the dwarf is often used solely for comic relief, and it's not especially funny. a lot of the movie focuses around a huge battle fought by these characters. they have armies now, so this battle scene is much less ridiculous than the ones in the first film. it's actually enormously entertaining. pippin and merry also become more interesting, although they're never going to be, i fear, as interesting as anyone else. the ents whom they hang around with are really cool, though. the ents' attack on one of the towers (i do have to admit that i didn't even realize there were two myself) makes for a very neat scene. my biggest complaint is about the same as my biggest complaint about the first film. why are the villains so boring? the orcs and their kin are just dull, faceless villains. they're fodder for the good guys' armies. they run around and yowl, and that's about it. why can't there be a few generals or something that have interesting things to say? christopher lee, who did make a bit of an impression in the first film, is totally shafted in this one. he does little more than sit in his tower and watch his troops march away. there's also a new villain, an ozzy osbourne-looking guy named wormtongue, who is controlling the king of rohan with magic. do you really believe that they would allow a guy named wormtongue to come into their palace, let alone advise the king? despite this film's numerous flaws, i can't think of another film of 2002 that really entertained me more than this one. 8/10.;5 January 2003;9;['first', 'good', 'sloppy', 'repetitive', 'second', 'first', 'narrative', 'first', 'aragorn', 'gimli', 'slow', 'enough', 'glad', 'incomprehensible', 'more', 'long', 'first', 'sacred', 'giant', 'slow', 'neat', 'third', 'interesting', 'former', 'interesting', 'first', 'physical', 'tragic', 'overwhelming', 'bad', 'special', 'interesting', 'whole', 'other', 'great', 'kinetic', 'good', 'first', 'real', 'slight', 'important', 'uninteresting', 'first', 'own', 'comic', 'funny', 'huge', 'ridiculous', 'first', 'entertaining', 'interesting', 'interesting', 'cool', 'neat', 'big', 'same', 'big', 'first', 'boring', 'dull', 'good', 'few', 'interesting', 'first', 'new', 'ozzy', 'numerous'];0.1495864254792826

30;MovieAddict2016;"""lord of the rings"" continues to disappoint. the entire trilogy has never had any real effect on me; when i saw ""the return of the king"" in the cinema it was the closest i came to loving the series -- the last hour was really gripping stuff... then the conclusion went overboard and i couldn't wait for it to end. before i saw ""rotk"" i thought ""the two towers"" was going to be my favorite from the series -- it's certainly more entertaining than the first film, even if it doesn't contain as nice scenery and cinematography (it's not as lush). my concerns in regards to this trilogy (and specifically ""the two towers"") is that it tries too hard to be an epic, creating far too much overblown, dramatic material that fails to equate into poignancy. case in point: i'm sure the entire trilogy contains about an hour of footage entirely of frodo and sam crying in each other's arms. there's a certain point where too much is simply too much and i grew weary of the constant drama-queen syndrome. put a female's wig on frodo and he's a transvestite. i mean, seriously. he cries more than halle berry at an awards show. the better parts of ""the two towers"" follow aragorn's story, but then there's too much exposition: ""i ride at dawn to minis tirith in search of the mighty plot macguffin!"" just do it already! half the film is wasted because the characters tell us what they're going to do, and then we spend more time watching them do it. once is enough. example: ""i'm going to kill that monster!""

32;Red-Barracuda;"some people prefer this second part in the lord of the rings trilogy to the first. i am not one of those people. where the first movie's strength was in its exploration of a magical fantasy world, this one is albeit necessarily more gloomy. i would guess that it's primarily thought highly of for two main reasons. firstly, for its epic recreation of the battle for helm's deep and secondly for the character gollum. these are two pretty persuasive reasons to be honest. the battle scene is truly massive in its scale and execution, with a lot of painstaking detail; while the character of gollum is even more revolutionary in cinematic terms. andy serkis famously played the character with motion-capture devices all over his body but gollum was a fully cgi created creature. it's pretty remarkable, therefore, that this character has so much believability and empathy. it's a testament to both serkis acting and the artists who created him that this is so. other than this, for me, the two towers suffers a little from neither being the start nor the end of the story. it doesn't have the variety of tones and locations of the first film, and overall it did get a little tedious at times. but this is in no way meant to be a criticism of peter jackson's efforts. this was after all merely a recreation of what was actually in the book; it's just that my sensibilities are not so in line with this one. but it's pretty obvious that this is another loving recreation from jackson and his team; and, like before, it has a great ensemble of actors to do it justice.";2 October 2012;6;['second', 'first', 'first', 'magical', 'gloomy', 'main', 'epic', 'deep', 'persuasive', 'honest', 'massive', 'painstaking', 'revolutionary', 'cinematic', 'remarkable', 'much', 'other', 'little', 'first', 'little', 'tedious', 'obvious', 'great'];0.1481481481481481
33;Pjtaylor-96-138044;while 'the lord of the rings: the two towers (2002)' initially seems like an improvement upon its predecessor due to an almost instant start, to the point of totally leaving anyone not already on-board with the story behind, and constant 'in-the-moment' feel, the piece soon becomes a baggy and generally slow affair that does, in itself, seem like the so-called 'extended version' (how an actual 'extended version' exists, i'm not sure i'll ever fully understand). this middle instalment falls victim to its transitional status, which is essentially a kind way of saying that not all that much happens - at least not considering its bloated three hour run-time - while it ties the knot between the first and last part of its larger tale. it also suffers from a meandering narrative that opens up its world in a way that seems unfocused, taking away from the core - and, incidentally, most interesting - story of our protagonist and his journey to destroy that which would seek to destroy the world at every opportunity. there's still a lot to like, including a clarity of vision most prominent in the brilliant battle sequences - which are some of the largest in scale seen in cinema (only to be bested in size by its follow-up) and yet still retain a remarkably tangible quality - and smaller character moments - mainly surrounding its landmark 'motion capture' character. indeed, this character is a groundbreaking achievement that did almost as much for the industry as the rest of the effects combined, being the premier creation of this kind essentially still to this day. he has some of the best moments in this feature, moments which are only slightly less interesting because of all the apparent 'filler' which surrounds them. it's made out to be essential perhaps because it sits in the source novel, but trimming sequences shouldn't be discouraged even in something based on a beloved book. this flick ends up perhaps the weakest of the trilogy. in the end, though, there are enough stand-out scenes and it's entertaining enough to make it more than worthwhile. 7/10;24 June 2018;7;['instant', 'constant', 'baggy', 'slow', 'extended', 'actual', 'extended', 'sure', 'middle', 'transitional', 'kind', 'much', 'least', 'bloated', 'first', 'last', 'large', 'unfocused', 'interesting', 'prominent', 'brilliant', 'large', 'tangible', 'small', 'groundbreaking', 'much', 'premier', 'good', 'interesting', 'apparent', 'essential', 'beloved', 'weak', 'enough', 'more', 'worthwhile'];0.1927248677248677

35;ElMaruecan82;"i called ""the fellowship of the ring"" the first instant classic of the 21st century and one of the many accomplishments the film achieved was to be listed as the 2nd best fantasy movie by the american film institute and to be the most recent film to make it in the afi's top 100 greatest movies of all time. what i forgot to mention is that it wasn't the most recent to be listed in any afi's film for this privilege goes to its successor ""the two towers"" listed in afi's top 100 movie quotes. do i need to mention which line made it in the top 100? the line says a lot about the key element of ""the two towers"", it introduced one to one of the most emblematic characters of the trilogy, the creepy yet weirdly cute in his childlike attitude: gollum. in less than ten minutes, gollum is as fully developed a character as all the members of the fellowship of the ring put together, from his voice and speech mannerisms to his elastic moves and constant crawling as if he was constantly looking for something one might have accidentally dropped, something of high value, that he'd call, with his raspy and ominous voice, ""my previous"". and if it wasn't for the introduction of gollum, i'm afraid the second opus of the trilogy might have only been a continuation. and even being the continuation of a classic full of so many characters and based on the rich, dense and labyrinthine plot of tolkien's book isn't enough to grab you by the eyes and hook you to the story, unless you're hardcore tolkien's fan, and even then. a second opus isn't just the 'what-goes-next' but also the second offering of a director, and apart from the hypnotic presence of gollum and his mysterious and fascinating split personality, i must admit that sometimes, throughout the film, i stopped paying attention to the screen. i know everything looked great, and everyone did justice to their roles. but it seemed like the novelty was gone, and the plot dragged on for too long. ironically, the tolkien purists complained that five chapters were abandoned and the story went too fast. i trust their perception but i think this says a lot more about the difficulty to adapt a story of such epic scale. at one point, there were new characters every ten minutes, and they all looked the same: dressed with medieval fashion, long hair, bearded, noble looking or close enough. so i tried to focus on the faces i knew, the ones i could name, and eventually, i could spell, i felt secure as long as i had frodo in the screen, and sam, gollum who won me instantly, araghorn, legolas and gimli (whose height relegated him to the rank of comic reliefs after the two side- kicks hobbits were gone). but by the second third of the film, even these characters couldn't carry the story. there came a moment where frodo's wide-eyed expression started to annoy me, where i didn't much care for the talking tree subplot and when even the return of gandalf left me perplex. ""the two towers"" confronted me to the one reality that the first installment miraculously prevented; i'm not into fantasy movies. not to be pedant or cynical, but i'd say the problem of fantasy is that it has too much fantasy indeed, it is so virtually full of possibilities that even death loses its realism, anyone can kill but anyone can be saved, i knew gandalf would survive and was i glad to see him back on the screen, but when you have a character falling to a certain death in a mountain of lava and coming back triumphant, you know the notions of odds is relative. it's like the entire storytelling is governed by the primitive pattern that good guys will win, inevitably, because they're good by essence not because of some powers or skills. inversely, the enemy contains so many hideous creatures that you know they're like naturally inept to win, on the long term. the film was great in every technical aspect, the production design, the special effects, the battle sequences, but the offering was nothing new once you've digested the first part. the film certainly works as a link between the introduction to this magical universe and what will be the climactic confrontation of the end, but that's what it is, an in-between movie highlighted by the introduction of gollum, which is the equivalent of master yoda in ""the empires strikes back"", but ""two towers"" is no ""empire"" equal. ""empire"" is a classic on its own, not a continuation. besides, the ""star wats"" trilogy was built on a three-year span between the movies while ""the lord of the rings"" provided each opus one year after another, the first one was the immersion, the last one was the farewell. the second was probably the one that had the least time to be appreciated. and maybe peter jackson knew it and you can tell some unusual hastiness in the storytelling, the one pointed out by the tolkien fans. maybe this is why it focuses more on the human characters and on more conventional war/history movies tropes, while the hobbits are left in the background. somehow, anyone would get the feeling that the third one will be better, so perhaps the merit of ""two towers"" lies on the frail shoulders of gollum, the first cgi character played by an actor, andy serkis. the combination of electronics and real acting, seven years before ""avatar"" is the one milestone, the film achieved. not that bad, after all.";11 November 2016;7;['first', 'instant', 'many', 'good', 'recent', 'top', 'great', 'recent', 'top', 'top', 'key', 'emblematic', 'childlike', 'less', 'elastic', 'constant', 'high', 'ominous', 'previous', 'afraid', 'second', 'classic', 'full', 'many', 'rich', 'dense', 'labyrinthine', 'enough', 'second', 'next', 'second', 'hypnotic', 'mysterious', 'fascinating', 'great', 'more', 'such', 'epic', 'new', 'same', 'medieval', 'long', 'bearded', 'noble', 'secure', 'araghorn', 'gimli', 'comic', 'second', 'wide', 'eyed', 'much', 'first', 'pedant', 'cynical', 'much', 'full', 'glad', 'certain', 'relative', 'entire', 'primitive', 'good', 'good', 'many', 'hideous', 'inept', 'long', 'great', 'technical', 'special', 'new', 'first', 'magical', 'climactic', 'equal', 'own', 'first', 'last', 'second', 'least', 'unusual', 'more', 'human', 'conventional', 'third', 'well', 'frail', 'first', 'real', 'bad'];0.1809947433518862
36;paul2001sw-1;"'the lord of the rings' is a much liked, but also widely derided book (aactually three books, just as it is now three films). it's not hard to see why both opinions are held. the narrative has epic sweep, but the moral motivations of the characters are simplistic in the extreme. they may be torn between good and evil, but these are presented as primeval, opposing forces: the concept of mixed motive scarcely exists. the much noted absence of sex from the book typifies this: it's not that the book would benefit from sexual content per se, rather that the heroic model of its universe cannot accommodate anything as challenging as the fusion of love and lust. yet i actually like the book, with its rich descriptive language. in fact, the monsters and landscape so described were long considered unfilmable; but with the aid of modern computer graphics, peter jackson has achieved a visually perfect reconstruction of middle earth, with almost everything looking exactly as you imagined it from the text (though the orcs seem to be a little influenced by the 'alien' with their ferocious, flashing teeth). the virtual gollum is perhaps the most skillfully animated character of any yet rendered on screen. yet there was another reason why the book should have been tricky to film, and this is the relationship of its the characters to history and time. the novel's best point, in my opinion, is the way that it conveys a sense of a vast, slow journey, one that criss-crosses the routes of a thousand past journeys that collectively have brought the present to pass. stories are told, often in fragmentary form; and the end of the quest represents not just the end of the foregrounded tale, but the end of an fictional era, and the end of the reader's quest to understand that era as well. this is all essentially wordy stuff, narrative and dialogue, that does not just fill the spaces between the action points, but provides them with their context. and in spite of making his movie over nine full hours, jackson seems to have been unable to find time for this, and the first film, as well as the first part of this instalment, precede as an unbroken series of fairly meaningless happenings, all spectacular but pointless. for example, when frodo (the hero) visits the dead marshes, he needs to know how they came to be; otherwise, the fact he sees corpses lying below the water is just empty decoration. in osgilliath, we see just a random ruined city, not understanding it was once the capital of gondor. and so on. jackson has been generally very faithful to tolkein's plotting (though he takes a few liberties in the second half of this film), but this faithfulness takes the form of completism: almost every image from the book needs to be rendered, but if you don't already know the story, you might struggle to work out why. so although the description of travel was one of the very best things in the novel, this film actually improves in its second half, when the travelling slows or stops, and the story starts to feel less sequential. the changes to the plot, however, are not so successful, because where jackson should have cut selectively, he has instead largely embellished the action, usually adding more melodrama than was present in the original. so all the heroes need to nearly die in battle; farmair must be tempted by the ring, just as his brother boromir was, and the heroes must join him when he fights his rearguard action in osgilliath; pippin and merry must trick the ents into helping out, and so on. quite why jackson considered the story needed more incident is hard to fathom, especially as there's a shallow obviousness to this extra material. the emotional impact is further deadened by the decision to play every scene with music. the music is not awful or ill-chosen, but there's no contrast, and one cannot stay in state of heightened arousal for three hours at a stretch. this is a film for which you could make a terrific trailer; but when every scene is played as a climax, the cumulative effect is lessened, not increased. indeed, the battle with saruman is given an apocalyptic tone that seems to pre-empt the final part of the story; but this second movie two ends short of the second book, ignoring the potential of tremendous, pessimistic cliff-hanger with which tolkein concluded his second part. in conclusion, the visuals are great. but the film misses what allows the book to transcend its peculiarities. if you like 'the silmarillion' (tolkein's more literary, sophisticated prequel), then this probably isn't for you.";19 November 2005;5;['hard', 'epic', 'moral', 'simplistic', 'good', 'evil', 'mixed', 'noted', 'sexual', 'heroic', 'challenging', 'rich', 'descriptive', 'unfilmable', 'modern', 'perfect', 'middle', 'little', 'ferocious', 'virtual', 'tricky', 'good', 'vast', 'slow', 'past', 'fragmentary', 'fictional', 'wordy', 'full', 'unable', 'first', 'first', 'unbroken', 'meaningless', 'spectacular', 'pointless', 'dead', 'empty', 'random', 'faithful', 'few', 'second', 'good', 'second', 'sequential', 'successful', 'more', 'present', 'original', 'more', 'hard', 'shallow', 'extra', 'emotional', 'awful', 'terrific', 'cumulative', 'apocalyptic', 'final', 'second', 'short', 'second', 'tremendous', 'pessimistic', 'second', 'great', 'literary', 'sophisticated', 'prequel'];0.0810956790123457
37;Robert_duder;i feel almost bad giving this film any sort of flack after reading other people's reviews because people truly are very passionate about this film. after re-watching fellowship of the ring and truly being enchanted by it i anxiously watched the two towers and it just didn't quite captivate me the way that fellowship did. many trilogies stumble during their second installment because it's almost a necessary drawl between the first and the third...beginning and end and you have to fill in all the important information to join the two. certainly the climax of the two towers is very important and that's the battle of helm's deep and that is really what the two towers is all about and it just continually builds up to that and it drags while it's getting there. the characters don't give near the same effort to the expanding story and the action is minimal compared to the original. yes it has the epic helm's deep battle but it's just a different all around feel to it. much has changed and there is a lot going on but it's almost too much. i mean the two towers spans a lot of information from the book (no i have never read them) so it does have big shoes to fill and i respect that but i just didn't get the same epic feel from it. the entire cast returns for the second and adds some new faces as well, including one of the most infamous movie characters of all time. i won't spend too much time on the original cast because i did that for fellowship but they all do a good job. however it feels like they've lost a little something with this second installment. part of this may be because some of the characters change so dramatically. elijah wood's frodo baggins goes through an intense change as the ring begins to catch hold of him and almost turns him. wood's performance is a little more subtle than fellowship but still very good. also sir ian mckellen returns as gandalf having fallen through the earth and returned as gandalf the white. this new version is less emotional and a little more rough around the edges and i miss the old gandalf and it really took something away from the character for me because mckellen was amazing in the original. the addition of one of the most famous movie characters is that of computer generated gollum based on the expressions of movements of andy serkis, a very talented character actor (also contributed his movements to king kong.) i personally found gollum annoying and overused to the likes of jar jar binks and felt more the same way about him that sam did in the film. bernard hill is good as the determined and concerned king theoden, and miranda otto is alright as eowyn, the niece of the king but i have my issues with her storyline. the addition of treebeard and the trees of the forest was also a very cool addition and i love their part in the story. one of the most annoying and frustrating aspects for me in the two towers is this strange and completely unnecessary pseudo-romance that is established between aragorn and eowyn. they spent so much time making us feel the incredible, life altering love between aragorn and arwen in the fellowship and it only infuriates the movie watcher to see him contemplating love with someone else although he never acts on it. it seems to diminish the power of their romance. for the small minority that do find the lord of the rings films 'boring,' it's almost understandable with the two towers. i mean don't get me wrong, it still has it's breath taking moments and the special effects and the direction and cinematography is brilliant but it moves at a much slower pace and takes much longer to fill in all these gaps that are required to get the fellowship to the return of the king. so you can't not watch the two towers and it is a must see for it's value but it isn't the best in the series by a long shot. 7/10;16 September 2007;7;['bad', 'other', 'passionate', 'many', 'second', 'necessary', 'first', 'third', 'important', 'important', 'deep', 'same', 'minimal', 'original', 'epic', 'deep', 'different', 'much', 'much', 'big', 'same', 'epic', 'entire', 'second', 'new', 'infamous', 'much', 'original', 'good', 'little', 'second', 'intense', 'little', 'subtle', 'good', 'new', 'emotional', 'little', 'rough', 'old', 'amazing', 'original', 'famous', 'talented', 'annoying', 'same', 'good', 'determined', 'concerned', 'alright', 'cool', 'annoying', 'frustrating', 'strange', 'unnecessary', 'much', 'incredible', 'small', 'boring', 'understandable', 'wrong', 'special', 'brilliant', 'slow', 'long', 'good', 'long'];0.0590514711277423

39;bowmanblue;it's unlikely that many people will decide to enter the 'lord of the rings' world in the 'middle' of the story. the 'rings' books numbered three, therefore it was always known that the films would follow suit. most people (whether fans of the book, or those just interested in the hype of the first installment 'the fellowship of the ring') started with 'fellowship' and watched 'the two towers' to see where the story went next. for them - the majority - they wouldn't really need much of a 'recap' to the plot. for anyone else, they may be a little confused. personally, i'm a huge fan of both the books and the big screen adaptations, therefore i loved 'the two towers' and 'got' every reference. however, if it does have one major flaw it is that it relies on the audience knowing what's come before. it doesn't really spend much time reminding everyone of the events leading up to what's happening now. it continues the tale of a fictional land known as 'middle earth' and a dark lord trying to retrieve his magic ring so that he can become whole again and rule all. luckily for the free folk (such as elves, men and dwarfs) the ring has been sent to the one place it can be destroyed by two pluckly little creatures known as hobbits. basically, if you enjoyed the first film, this one is the (almost - and i'll get to my personal gripe with this one) 'perfect' continuation with the epic middle earth journey. all the characters you loved from the original return for this one, even the ones who died are given their screen time due to flashbacks and minimal sub-plots, but, due to the members of the 'fellowship' taking separate paths throughout the land, now you have three different stories to follow. all of which are skilfully woven together as the characters interact with new and interesting people. all the new cast are great, but if there's one reason to watch this film it's for the computer-generated creation of the - much troubled - 'gollum.' andy serkis 'plays' him thanks to his skills in a 'motion capture' suit, plus he does the voice and, if you ever wanted to see a 100% computer generated character steal every scene, then this is it. gollum is definitely the high-point for me and the special effects used to create him still hold up to this day. i criticised 'fellowship' (mildly) for its effects looking a little 'green-screen ish' some twenty years on and the same can be said for a few scenes in 'the two towers,' but - again - the scale of the film and how it's all put together totally overshadows any minor gripe like that. most people (or those i've spoken to!) seem to either like the first book/film or the last the best. for some reason 'the two towers' was always my favourite. which was why i was always a little annoyed to see that - in my opinion - this was the film version that had the most liberties taken with its story. there are a couple of scenes towards the end which are definitely not based on j. r. r. tolkien's work and make absolutely no sense to me. in fact, they even go as far as to totally fly in the face of the concept of the point of the movie, i.e. keeping the ring's whereabouts a secret. these scenes still irk me to this day, but the rest of the film is so good i can hardly claim not to enjoy it. if you haven't seen it, watch 'the fellowship' first. i'll be surprised if it doesn't make you want to watch this one, too.;10 January 2020;9;['unlikely', 'many', 'middle', 'most', 'interested', 'first', 'much', 'little', 'confused', 'huge', 'big', 'major', 'much', 'fictional', 'middle', 'dark', 'magic', 'whole', 'free', 'such', 'pluckly', 'little', 'first', 'personal', 'perfect', 'epic', 'middle', 'original', 'minimal', 'separate', 'different', 'new', 'interesting', 'new', 'great', 'much', 'high', 'special', 'little', 'green', 'same', 'few', 'minor', 'most', 'first', 'last', 'good', 'favourite', 'little', 'annoyed', 'most', 'good', 'surprised'];0.1463270240397899

44;Thanos_Alfie;"""the lord of the rings: the two towers"" is the second movie of the trilogy of the lord of the rings. in this movie we wait to see a big fight between the army of gondor and saruman's army of uruk hai against the allies who joined aragorn, gimli, legolas, pippin and merry. they have to defend rohan and attack isengard. frodo and sam continues their way into mordor to destroy the ring. the cast of this movie is about the same from the previous movie ""the lord of the rings: the fellowship of the ring"", but we have some additions. peter jackson makes a very good direction once again. the sound and the music of this movie once again is perfect such as the previous movie was and that was something that it's not gone unnoticed because of its nominated for the oscar of best sound and won the oscar of best sound editing. it also won the oscar for the best visual effects and nominated for the oscar of best picture, best art direction-set decoration and of best film editing. all these are based on the novel of j.r.r. tolkien.";16 August 2013;9;['second', 'big', 'uruk', 'gimli', 'same', 'previous', 'good', 'perfect', 'such', 'previous', 'unnoticed', 'nominated', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'visual', 'good', 'good', 'good'];0.3354166666666667
45;Bored_Dragon;"""one ring to rule them all, one ring to find them, one ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them"" tolkien's ""the lord of the rings"" is a book that has introduced me to the world of epic fantasy and, while no longer in the top of my favorites, will forever hold a special place in my heart. i will never forget how i eagerly awaited this movie trilogy, as well as the thrill of the movies when i first saw them in the cinema. and with each new viewing, enjoyment is no less. although i don't like movies this long, the twelve hours of ""the lord of the rings"" just fly by. it is far from being the perfect movie, as many seem to perceive it. i find many changes to the book to be unnecessary hollywoodization. elijah wood never felt right in the role of frodo, and his latently gay relationship with sam will never stop poking my eyes. it may be up to me, but i've never experienced it in a book. there are a lot more of all sorts of minor complaints, but in spite of them, the overall impression of this epic trilogy in every respect is an unforgettable experience. a very well adapted story, camera, directing and effects that take your breath away, mostly excellent cast choices and ingeniously blended music that greatly enhances the already perfect atmosphere, make this film a masterpiece of the genre and, in my opinion, one of the best film achievements of all time. 10/10";11 October 2016;10;['epic', 'special', 'new', 'less', 'perfect', 'many', 'many', 'unnecessary', 'right', 'gay', 'more', 'minor', 'overall', 'epic', 'unforgettable', 'excellent', 'perfect', 'good'];0.3766233766233766
46;callanvass;"the two towers does something incredibly rare these days,that's outdo the 1st in every way possible. while fellowship of the ring is technically good,and very well made,it wasn't very fun to watch at all. the two towers manages to grip you for the whole 170 minutes or so and that's quite a feat to pull off,because often for me that's way too overlong. the battle sequences are quite a sight to be hold,it honestly never stops,it's just so action packed you won't have time to catch your breath. everyone seemed so much more comfortable this time around,they all seemed to know there roles this time around,unlike the last time where everyone seemed all tense. i've never read the novels so i can't compare them to the films,but what i liked most about this film was the growing tension of gollum's obsession with the ring. he is frighteningly unpredictable and managed to make my skin crawl. i hadn't felt that much growing tension in a long,long time with gollum and frodo it was really harrowing stuff. while not quite the extent to ""return of the king"" you start to see the pressure frodo has of being the ring holder. you slowly start to see him have a growing obsession for it,it just created a great storyline if you ask me. i also must mention how frightening christopher lee was as saruman. he really gave me the creeps often and was the perfect foe. the two towers is everything fellowship is not,it's exciting,tension filled and downright gripping. performances. elijah wood is perfect this time around. he is often a complete revelation. we feel for him,we feel his pressure,we also see how strong his friendship with sam truly is. sean astin continues to grow as an actor. he is even better as sam this time around,he has more to play with,his charisma with elijah is even better this time around,if that's even possible. ian mckellen is pure class all the way. he put on an intense show,ian can do no wrong in my mind. viggo mortensen as i've mentioned before in my reviews is not a favorite of mine,but he is much better this time around as aragorn. he is strong,charismatic and only had a few wooden moments,good job!. billy boyd&dominic monaghan provide decent comic relief and make a likable tandem. christopher lee plays one of the most frightening villains in years as saruman. his banter with mckellen is a treat to watch. miranda otto is pretty cute and was quite likable as eowyn. bernard hill carries quite a strong presence with him. i enjoyed his character as theoden. brad dourif is always great as slimy characters,so it's only fitting he played grima. orlando bloom is once again too cool for school. i normally despise elves,but he is simply a bad ass. cate blanchett is ok,like the 1st. john rhys-davies is less annoying then in fellowship,but really that's not saying much. liv tyler is quite wooden this time around,i often felt her scenes were worthless. hugo weaving is also wooden,unlike the 1st where he was a required presence. rest of the cast do there jobs fine. bottom line. two towers is excitement like no other. i am usually not a fan of this type of genre,but two towers is so exciting,i will make an exception in this case. you won't find excitement like this in a lot of place,so it's only right i give two towers my highest recommendation,i can possibly give. 10/10";21 December 2009;10;['rare', 'possible', 'good', 'fun', 'whole', 'overlong', 'comfortable', 'last', 'tense', 'unpredictable', 'much', 'long', 'long', 'harrowing', 'great', 'frightening', 'perfect', 'exciting', 'perfect', 'complete', 'strong', 'well', 'more', 'well', 'possible', 'pure', 'intense', 'well', 'aragorn', 'strong', 'charismatic', 'few', 'wooden', 'good', 'decent', 'comic', 'likable', 'frightening', 'cute', 'likable', 'strong', 'theoden', 'great', 'slimy', 'fitting', 'cool', 'bad', 'ok', 'annoying', 'much', 'wooden', 'worthless', 'wooden', 'required', 'fine', 'bottom', 'other', 'exciting', 'right', 'high'];0.1982986111111111
47;tabuno;22 december 2002. i'd say 8 stars out of 10 for this movie. the scenery was spectacular and the overall appearance is of epic proportions. the were a few distractions however and perhaps the dvd (and i'm assuming even longer version will help fill in the gaps). frodo's internal conflict as the ring-bearer doesn't come across the screen as personal to the audience, we get to see more from an observer standpoint without getting the feelings and the emotions and the actual pull to the dark side was one might get from star wars. the rohan king's son is a person we never really get to know and to feel the bond between the king and his son and again we're left to see the king's emotions from outside, never getting to emote with him. gollum is perhaps the most amazing character of all in this movie and i'd say should earn an oscar nomination for something. except for the ending scenes which seem to suddenly turn the gollum in another direction from the prior scene which doesn't seem smooth and consistent in character, the gollum and frodo's and sam's interaction was the highlight, brilliant, and intimate creative genius of the whole series to date. another strange figure is the 10,000 warriors that march to defeat helm's deep and king rohan. but even the vietnam war, the american civil war, the russian revolution, the numbers offered as to the size of the massed army in this epic fantasy don't seem to conform to the gigantic clash between good and evil of the massive size of tolkien's novel - i'd think that 100,000 soldier army would be the minimum size to defeat any fortified fortress in the lord of the rings. the battle seemed to be awful fast and the feeling of lingering doom, the seige over days (more in line with most fantasy battle scenes) is missing in this movie. however, overall, lord of the rings brings to the screen images that have been waiting a long time for fantasy fans and almost (not quite) capture the essence of middle earth. a great attempt, a near perfect success, but there is even better movies to come if this significant benchmark is any indication of the future of fantasy movies.;26 January 2019;8;['spectacular', 'overall', 'epic', 'few', 'long', 'internal', 'personal', 'more', 'actual', 'dark', 'amazing', 'oscar', 'prior', 'smooth', 'consistent', 'creative', 'whole', 'strange', 'deep', 'american', 'civil', 'massed', 'epic', 'gigantic', 'good', 'massive', 'minimum', 'fortified', 'awful', 'most', 'long', 'quite', 'middle', 'great', 'near', 'perfect', 'well', 'significant'];0.1741666666666666
48;paulclaassen;"when watching the lord of the rings films, one has to keep in mind they were filmed simultaneously. therefore the good cinematography and groundbreaking visuals are consistent. the same applies to the good performances. 'the two towers' is my least favorite of the lotr films for a number of reasons. firstly, they deviate too much from the original premise. the attention shifts away from frodo on his quest, and he is absent for large parts of the film. a lot of new characters are introduced, and i felt the cast became somewhat cluttered. with so many new characters and story lines, i found myself easily losing track of the story. one of the new characters is treebeard - a boring, uninteresting character. yup, talking and walking trees abound!! (*insert wtf here*!!). the film revolves mainly around the kingdom of rohan, under threat from saruman. but what does this have to do with everything? why is rohan so important? they loose focus on the matter at hand; that being frodo on his mission to mordor. at least the attack scene on helm's deep in rohan was exciting! the black riders are also back, although only for a short while. they no longer ride horses; they now ride on giant birds that look like pterodactyls - or are they dragons?? who knows? unfortunately, as a result, they are no longer creepy. the film's highlight - by far! - was the gollum, smeagol. he is an entirely cgi character, yet unbelievably realistic. and he steals the show!! he is the most interesting character with his split personality, and devious grin. 'the two towers' is significantly slower paced than 'fellowship of the ring' and not all that interesting either. there are way too many back stories and characters that the film really has no need for. unlike 'fellowship of the rings', 'the two towers' feels like a 3-hour movie.";4 February 2021;6;['good', 'consistent', 'same', 'good', 'least', 'lotr', 'original', 'absent', 'large', 'new', 'cluttered', 'many', 'new', 'new', 'treebeard', 'boring', 'uninteresting', 'insert', 'important', 'loose', 'least', 'deep', 'exciting', 'black', 'short', 'giant', 'creepy', 'realistic', 'interesting', 'split', 'devious', 'interesting', 'many', 'back'];0.1219789825559056
49;ironhorse_iv;don't get me wrong, director peter jackson's lord of the ring's films are all well-done films, but the pacing of these films are just way too slow. even with two towers being the shortest of the three films, 179 minutes is a very long time, to sit down and watch a film. by the time, you get to the end of the film, you just witness, a lot of things happen on screen, but not much, if that make sense. a lot of things could be cut down, in the editing room, even more. it's like being in the middle of a mile run. you glad you went this far, but it's not done yet, you got another half mile and you're starting to feel a bit tired. since, this film is the middle of the trilogy, there is no beginning nor end, for that, reason, it's hard to say if the movie is great or just ok. in my opinion, the two towers is just alright. the two towers is the second volume of j. r. r. tolkien's high fantasy novel the lord of the rings. it is preceded by the fellowship of the ring and followed by the return of the king. it is book iii: the treason of isengard and iv: the journey to mordor aka the journey of the ringbearers or the ring goes east in the book series. the lord of the rings: the two towers arguably contains the most book to film major alterations, but the movie mostly follows the books, very close, mixing the two, but unlike the book starts, the movie starts a little bit later as 2001's fellowship took the first chapter of this book opening as its ending. instead, we get a cool new intro with gandalf (ian mckellen) fighting the balrog monster from the last movie. we come into the film, after the break down of the fellowship, with smaller groups of characters going on their own adventures and story arches intercut with each other. frodo (elijah woods) & sam (sean astin) continuing their journey and meeting gollum (andy serkis) on the way. gollum is the best new character, they introduce into this film. andy serkis is amazing actor, and he puts out the best motion cgi capture acting, i ever saw. since, there was a decision to leave shelob for the third movie meant that faramir (david wenham) had to become an obstacle for frodo and sam's journey. this change was indeed different than the book. it does add conflict, but gees... it slows the plot down. frodo is the everyman character, because he lack power, he is the best one to carry the ring throughout the film. his real challenge is to bear the ring without giving in to its temptations. this resistance is frodo's inner journey, in which his pure heart is constantly under assault by his darker yearnings for power. it had some pretty powerful symbolism here between faramir, frodo, sam and gollum. i do have a problem with frodo & sam's friendship. i have nothing against gays, but there is a huge different between friendship and being in love. it's obvious tolkien wanted to show the strength of friendship, so i don't think it was intentional, but it's still hard to ignore that it comes off as a gay relationship. while this is going on, aragorn (viggo mortensen), legolas (orlando bloom) and gimli (john rhys davies) find themselves fighting the orcs invasion at helm's deep and helping the war-torn nation of rohan. while in the book, helm's deep is a small battle. in this film, it's the big climax of the film. it's one of the best battle scenes in film, i ever witnessed. i can do without the small awful cheesy things, like the heroes mowing down hundreds of orcs without much battle scars. i can do without legolas being too perfect like, shield surfing and only speak in exposition. i couldn't stand gimli being pull into too much comedy relief role. also, glad to see arwen (liv tyler) was not in the battle scenes in the final version, as they film her earlier in it fighting alongside aragorn. i can still do without aragorn's life is now tied to the fate of the ring bit. it makes little to no sense. i understand that they (the producers) were trying to make anti-ring symbol with her character as a sign of hope, but it doesn't work. the movie is more about aragon rise to become king and presented a coming to age story for males. merry (dominic monaghan) & pippin (billy boyd) end up encountering the giant treelike ents and trying to stop saruman's (christopher lee) army at isengard. environment themes are question here. still, the whole treebeard part were a bit boring. one thing, i hate about lord of the rings are the cheap fake out deaths scenes. aragorn, frodo, and others. as much as i love seeing gandalf again, his death scene in the last movie was supposed to be impactful. for him, to come back makes it seem like you can cheat death here. i blame it on tolkien. i didn't like the whole jesus christ metaphor with his character. besides boromir (sean bean), does any main character dies in this movie. the movie lose a bit of its sense of danger without any major deaths. everybody seems nearly invincible. water seems to be a symbol of rebirth in this film. gandalf, aragorn, and frodo were save by large bodies of water. similarly, saruman's tower loses its power when its plain is flooded. like a baptized, it's free from sin. even the elves depart middle-earth on a boat and sail out to a great body of water. the film has a lot of christianity themes. the music by howard shore is amazing. overall: good visual film that can be a bit confusing. just hard to get through all the themes, and all the characters arches.;15 December 2013;8;['wrong', 'slow', 'short', 'long', 'much', 'glad', 'half', 'tired', 'hard', 'great',

51;The-Sarkologist;it is not that tolkien is original in his stories, he is not, but rather it is the way that he uses his knowledge of european literature to create such a colourful and engaging world. his characters are not shallow, nor is he strictly black and white in his characters either. granted, there is absolutely nothing good about sauron, but his better characters are not necessarily pure either. in this regard i think of gandalf. he is the closest character to what one would consider a good guy in his story, but instead of calling him good, i would say that he is incredibly wise. however it is not that gandalf is immune from corruption, it is just that he is wise enough to avoid it. now, gandalf is what is called an istari. he is one of an order of magicians who were sent by the valar to middle earth to combat sauron. the valar chose not to physically come to middle earth for fear than any war against sauron would leave the middle earth a desolate wasteland, so instead they sent agents in the form of the istari. the two major ones are gandalf and saruman. now, it appears at first that saruman is a 'good guy' but it ends up becoming very clear that he has been corrupted by sauron and has switched sides. in this part of the story saruman is the main protagonist as he raises his army of orcs to destroy the land of rohan. however it should be clear that if saruman is not beyond corruption then neither is gandalf. when we are introduced to theodren, king of rohan, he is gripped with a madness and is the puppet being manipulated by worntongue. now, wormtongue is dealt with quickly, but it is interesting how tolkien's characters show mercy. while wormtongue, a traitor allied with saruman, deserves death, gandalf causes them to hold back their wrath and let him flee. in that sense he is shown mercy, and this mercy is indicated because to act on instinct and give wormtongue what he deserves is to sink down to his level. the action in this book evolves around frodo and sam attempting to make their way to morder, and the others defending themselves against saruman. the idea is that sauron's forces are to attack the lands of men (gondor and rohan) from the east while saruman attacks from the west. sauron's army is dealt with later and the main focus of this book is the battle against saruman. however saruman is not killed. while pippin and merry trick the ents into going to war against saruman, saruman is not necessarily defeated (and we discover that at the end of the third book). i want to finish this section off exploring another of the themes that runs through these books and that is of friendship. we see the theme of friendship most clearly with frodo and sam. while frodo is innocent, sam is loyal. he refuses, point blank, to let frodo go off by himself. now this friendship is stretched at times, but sam never gives up. he is determined to stand by frodo until the end, even if it means that both of them die. another element of mercy that is seen in these books is in relation to gollum. i will say more on gollum in the next section as he is a very important character in the story. however, he is also a very pathetic and pitiful character, and while he does things deserving of death, we are reminded that he is not killed because the character's pity him. it is in this that frodo shows friendship to him, even though he is not deserving of friendship, and is also very traitorous, but more on that later.;28 October 2011;8;['original', 'european', 'colourful', 'engaging', 'shallow', 'black', 'white', 'good', 'well', 'pure', 'close', 'good', 'good', 'wise', 'immune', 'wise', 'middle', 'middle', 'middle', 'desolate', 'major', 'gandalf', 'good', 'clear', 'main', 'clear', 'gandalf', 'interesting', 'main', 'third', 'innocent', 'loyal', 'blank', 'determined', 'more', 'next', 'important', 'pathetic', 'pitiful', 'traitorous'];0.217281746031746

57;zkonedog;"i have read the lotr novel trilogy on a few different occasions. each time, i struggle a bit to get through ""the two towers"". all the names, locations, and drawn-out battle sequences always leave me in a bit of a stupor. in this film adaptation, however, peter jackson--in following up ""fellowship""--crafts an experience that is actually more enjoyable than tolkien's original. for a very basic overview, ""two towers"" is split into three intercutting narratives: -frodo (elijah wood) and sam (sean astin) continue their quest for the fires of mordor. as they approach the black gate, they make the acquaintance of gollum (andy serkis)--or is it smeagol-- the former owner of the ring whose intentions are as scattered as his mixed-up brain. -as sauron and saruman (christopher lee) unleash their armies onto middle earth, the likes of gandalf (ian mckellen), legolas (orlando bloom), gimli (john rhys-davies) and aragorn (viggo mortensen) begin their stand in rohan with the battle of helm's deep. -finally, wayward hobbits merry (dominic monaghan) and pippin (billy boyd) have quite an eventful journey of their own, meeting up with the ents (giant tree-people) and leading a motion to storm saruman's fortress at isengard. the biggest reason i like jackson's ""two towers"" better than tolkien's: whereas the latter utilizes designated chunks for the ""battle stuff"", frodo/sam/gollum, and merry/pippin, the former intersperses them all within each other, providing for a much more stimulating experience. there's absolutely no ""i'm getting bored with this narrative"" to be found. whether you are here for the battles or the ring travails, it is never too far from that ""next scene"". a quick word on those battles: some 20 years later, they still hold up as just as entrancing as the first time i saw them on the cinema screen. sure, other films have upped the ante on seamless special effects (as is always the case), but just the pure scope and spectacle of the epic confrontations here holds me in its grasp every viewing. this is perhaps another reason why i enjoy the celluloid ""towers"" over the printed page: such battles are better seen/experienced than simply read. of course, one cannot leave ""two towers"" without commenting on the performance (both in voice and motion-capture) of serkis as gollum/smeagol. when tolkien first created the character in ""the hobbit"", he painted a very horrifying picture of the sort of abominable creature gollum must be. serkis and the effects crew perfectly capture that creepiness--this is indeed the gollum of my mind's eye. also remarkable is how jackson is even able to craft a somewhat sympathetic turn for gollum, using him as a potential ""warning sign"" for what could happen to frodo if ""the precious"" is in his care for too long a period. overall, ""the two towers"" is not a letdown whatsoever from the first installment. it is different, to be sure. whereas ""fellowship"" was tasked with establishing the importance of the shire and setting everything in motion, ""towers"" simply broadens the horizons. the quest to destroy the ring continues to take new twists/turns, while viewers are also given an inside glimpse into what all the fighting is truly for...to save the great land of middle earth and all its inhabitants/creatures. there are very few films that can sustain my interest for a full three hours with no waning, but this is certainly one of them.";10 March 2017;10;['few', 'different', 'enjoyable', 'original', 'basic', 'intercutting', 'black', 'former', 'middle', 'gimli', 'aragorn', 'deep', 'wayward', 'dominic', 'eventful', 'own', 'giant', 'big', 'latter', 'former', 'other', 'stimulating', 'bored', 'next', 'quick', 'first', 'other', 'seamless', 'special', 'pure', 'epic', 'such', 'horrifying', 'abominable', 'remarkable', 'able', 'sympathetic', 'potential', 'long', 'first', 'different', 'sure', 'new', 'inside', 'great', 'middle', 'few', 'full'];0.1115245865245865
58;filipemanuelneto;"this is the continuation of ""the lord of the rings"" trilogy, based on the epic novel that j.r.r. tolkien wrote after his passage through the trenches in first world war. this film was shot by the same cast and crew of the first, ""the fellowship of the ring"", a strategy that has given a great cohesion to the entire trilogy. in this film, the plot thickens with the division of the fellowship: frodo and sam desperately trying to get to mordor while the men, grouped around the kingdom of rohan, begin the war against the orc's and uruk's of sauron and saruman. the climax of the film, the battle of helm's deep, is probably one of the most tense and epic battle scenes in history of contemporary cinema. from this point of view, this film surpasses in adrenaline the first of the saga. for the action scenes, the expertise of digital computerization was key. proof of this is the character gollum, a completely digital creation that received the voice of andy serkis, or treebeard, who has the voice of john rhys-davies (actor who also plays gimli). this film helped to increase the interest of the audience for the trilogy that until then, and despite the success of the first film, had gone unnoticed for many. in fact, if we think rightly, the trilogy has even popularize tolkien, an english writer who, until then, was an illustrious unknown to almost all those who weren't english or don't speak english as their mother tongue. suddenly, not only everyone spoke of ""the lord of the rings"" and tolkien, as well as the novels it had to be translated into new languages and were the subject of an important and positive revaluation. epic in the true word of the term, this film, and the whole trilogy, learned once again become popular this genre of cinema, that now became more affordable for studios thanks to the computerization. in fact, make an epic film in the old fashioned way, with hundreds of participants, large and elaborate scenarios etc. it's extremely expensive, more than resorting to the modern digital techniques.";31 March 2016;10;['epic', 'first', 'same', 'first', 'great', 'entire', 'deep', 'tense', 'epic', 'contemporary', 'first', 'digital', 'key', 'digital', 'gimli', 'first', 'unnoticed', 'many', 'english', 'illustrious', 'english', 'new', 'important', 'positive', 'epic', 'true', 'whole', 'popular', 'affordable', 'epic', 'old', 'fashioned', 'large', 'expensive', 'more', 'modern', 'digital'];0.1442804670077397
59;Rectangular_businessman;"even when this trilogy of movies directed by peter jackson isn't entirely faithful to the books in which it was inspired, i think that it does capture the essence of the monumental epic written by tolkien, managing to be solemn and magnificent, but keeping all the exciting fun from the original story. all the elements that made the original book a timeless work in the history of literature are present in three movies, from the epic background to the most subtle subtext elements, a quality that makes this trilogy of movies being something more complex and significant than any other fantasy movie that i had seen before in my life. the production values are superb, being able to recreate all the grandeur of the middle earth. every single scene from this movie has an incredibly level of beauty without comparison, having all of them the perfect mood and atmosphere for each part of the history. all the scenes are wonderfully directed, showing a great love for the original story and the characters from it: the music, the performances, the visual effectsevery single elements fits perfectly, creating in that way an outstanding cinematic experience that possess the timeless greatness and magnificence from the original books. while ""the fellowship of the ring"" serves as an excellent introduction to this fantasy world and the main characters of this story, ""the two towers"" works incredibly well as an inner exploration of the personalities of the characters, as they struggle against their personal conflicts. finally, ""the return of the king"" closes the story in a more than satisfying way, with a moving resolution that is happy, sad and nostalgic at the same time. those three films will always have a very special meaning for me, being not only a great trilogy which is incredibly well done and its very entertaining to watch, but also, a unique cinematic experience that, at least in my opinion, couldn't be matched. personally, i consider this trilogy the ultimate example of the genre of fantasy in the history of cinema. 10/10 (i would rate the 3 films with eleven stars if i could.)";28 May 2012;10;['faithful', 'monumental', 'solemn', 'magnificent', 'exciting', 'original', 'original', 'present', 'epic', 'subtle', 'complex', 'significant', 'other', 'superb', 'able', 'middle', 'single', 'incredibly', 'perfect', 'great', 'original', 'visual', 'single', 'outstanding', 'cinematic', 'timeless', 'original', 'excellent', 'main', 'inner', 'personal', 'more', 'happy', 'sad', 'nostalgic', 'same', 'special', 'great', 'entertaining', 'unique', 'cinematic', 'least', 'ultimate'];0.2466478696741854

61;Dr_Coulardeau;after death, severance, separation, loss and confusion, we must regroup and recoup, rejoice and return. so let's save gandolf first who shifts from the grey to the white, from powerless to finally magical. the details are all accounted for in the dvd. then the two hobbits that were captured and thought dead were only prisoners and they will manage to escape and even win the battle of the film, without anyone knowing it really. they will make friends with tree-herders and they will lead the forest against the bad wizard in his tower. and then the trio man-elf-dwarf will liberate some king in some city from the power of some middle man of a wizard and lead his people and troops to a mountain citadel, and this same man and same elf and same dwarf will have the surprise to see the king of the elves and his army arrive to reinforce the humans against the orcs. some kind of slow growing seeds of courage and commitment. some call that love too. and the battle will start, spectacular and grandiose, and many will die on both sides and the final salvaging reinforcements will arrive under the authority of gandolf the white. the orcs will be defeated. during that time the two lost hobbits and the tree-herders will start a tree war against the malicious bad wizard in his tower with his mine and giant smithy underground at the foot of his mausoleum-spire that had provided the army of orcs with all kinds of arms, weapons and armours. and it will all go drowned and soaked, overflowed and flooded. that's how a battle is won, with some courage not to feel pain, with a lot of luck not to hear the warnings of ms caution, miss prudence and mrs carefulness, the three witches of passivity, and a fair dose of blindness not to see danger. and here we are with a long film for a young audience, though the audience of the first film must have aged a little and the film is becoming a lot more human. we even have several heterosexual kisses along with quite a few man-to-man embraces. going on that way we may have a couple of weddings at the end of the third episode. and it all ends with two hobbits raiding the cellar and kitchen of the bad gloomy dangerous vicious wizard and we even find that funny, even if we are slightly worried for their waistlines. and the real end of course comes with the declaration of total trust from sam the hobbit gardener who guards no one but cultivates friendship and frodon the hobbit adventurer guardian of the ring and carrier of its powers to the final destruction site somewhere in hell. this episode though manages to leave monsters and other diabolical figures behind, which is good, and to emphasize more on the human qualities of all these characters. it even gets in a way marvelous for children with walking trees even if this is nothing but the rewriting of macbeth, but macbeth deserves many rewritings. and we recognize what is going to become one essential sign of stephen king's dark tower. the main human hero in the fellowship of the ring, even after scattering and especially after it, is the surviving son of the long ago destroyed northern kingdom. he is a ranger, a dying out category of peacemakers and justice executioners, just like roland is a gunslinger. but still, and that is going to last till the end i imagine, no bridge or door from this medieval fantasy world to our modern world and it is a shame. it is some kind of model for many sagas to come, but it stops short of real science-fiction when the fiction speaks of our own world through another layer of time or space. dr jacques coulardeau, university of paris dauphine & university of paris 1 pantheon sorbonne;11 January 2007;10;['white', 'powerless', 'magical', 'dead', 'bad', 'middle', 'same', 'same', 'same', 'slow', 'spectacular', 'grandiose', 'many', 'final', 'malicious', 'bad', 'giant', 'smithy', 'fair', 'long', 'young', 'first', 'little', 'human', 'several', 'heterosexual', 'few', 'third', 'bad', 'gloomy', 'dangerous', 'vicious', 'funny', 'worried', 'real', 'total', 'final', 'other', 'diabolical', 'good', 'human', 'marvelous', 'many', 'essential', 'dark', 'main', 'human', 'long', 'northern', 'medieval', 'modern', 'many', 'real', 'own'];0.0319128787878787

64;johnnyboyz;"i think the second lord of the rings film is more manipulating than it is entertaining or epic. it's true to say that i had only seen this for the first time very recently and did not have the previous viewing that i had going into the first lord of the rings film, (which i liked then and liked now) so to say i enjoyed this to a lesser extent may be down to those reasons; maybe it's a film that grows on you with repeated viewings. but the two towers is a somewhat bloated and manipulating film that has its moments of greatness and sheer adventure packed in amongst some shocking issues of representation and general repetition, but the film is an all round success overall. harking back to the classical hollywood days in which if someone was shot or killed, a sudden, stirring and jarring piece of music may start up to officially 'announce' the kill since you could not show the murder itself because of censorship. here, the music is playing that sort of role again but it is to the opposite sort of effect; every long shot we cut to, every establishing shot of vast mountains and hills (some of which are in cgi format) we see are accompanied by over the top, melodramatic music that brings an odd smile to my face while watching. it's the sort of cue for all of us to hold our hands to our cheeks and gasp in amazement. the film tells us when to be scared, happy, wary, who to like and dislike and when to laugh; which is a shame. sticking with the melodramatic theme, some of the situations the characters find themselves in are made all the more so when they need not be. there are numerous insert shots and several lines of dialogue surrounding aragorn (mortensen) and another female whose name escapes me as they exchange glances and lines. ""i see you're good with the sword"" he says after she gives a little teaser as to her skills before the impending doom. then there are the exchanged looks as he lies down, injured, much later on. but it is to no avail as aragorn has an off-screen love, but don't worry; she pops up to remind us (and elrond (weaving)) of the situation. but the representation and underwhelming attention to detail are the two most frustrating things of this film. i do not know how faithful to tolkien's book the film is, but from the film i can only gather that either jackson or tolkien had a massive problem with short, elderly men who have beards. i'm talking about the dwarfs here and how they are consistently the butt of every joke. the peak of this embarrassing representation occurs during the castle siege scene. rows of allies are on the upper levels, looking out at the enemy. gimli (rhys-davies) cannot see but everyone else can. ""would you like me to find you a tool?"" asks legolas (bloom). gimli's height is mocked here but it goes deeper than that. all the humour in the film is directly a result of gimli's antics, thus relegating him to the comic relief character. aragorn and legolas are in serious conversation with the king but as these two normal sized, athletic and handsome men talk; gimli is sitting at a table tucking into a drumstick, alienated from the conversation with the camera cutting to him just once; so he can belch and maybe cue some laughs. after this belch, the camera cuts back to the conversation and everything continues after the 'funny' pitstop. but it's not the weight, looks and height that is merely targeted; the pratfalls continue when gimli embarrasses himself after not correctly fixing his armour it slips off him and he is left to rue an awkward moment when aragorn and legolas stare and smirk below gimli's waist. furthermore, gimli is describing what female dwarfs look like (which is a lot like male ones) before his horse bucks and charges off; gimli is inferior enough not to be able to control the horse and he falls, while everyone laughs at him. half way through the film, there is a fight on a plain in which legolas kills many enemies and aragorn actually comes close to death to defeat the odds but gimli is relegated, once again, to the butt of the jokes. he has numerous enemies fall on top of him, rendering him incapacitated as he groans and hopes the others do the work for him. of course the film is not one long exposure; but an interesting and well un-folded tail about the tiniest of things that can do the largest of damage. the manipulation of time early on is impressive as we discover what happens after other timelines catch up and leave off. whereas i noted a whole load of bad things about the film, that does not mean i didn't like it. legolas and gimli's colloquial approach to the final siege as chaos and murder occurs around them to those of an inferior skill is in bad taste, as is making the enemy men whom ride large elephant creatures look like arabs; with their clothing and veils. gollum's schizophrenia and delusion seems a little unnecessary and do drag on but they will suffice, that is all. i do not buy into the mountains of praise the film gets; pretty to look at and reasonably fun to watch, yes, but will it hold up over time? probably not.";6 April 2008;6;['second', 'manipulating', 'entertaining', 'epic', 'true', 'first', 'previous', 'first', 'less', 'bloated', 'sheer', 'shocking', 'general', 'round', 'classical', 'sudden', 'stirring', 'jarring', 'opposite', 'long', 'vast', 'top', 'melodramatic', 'odd', 'scared', 'happy', 'wary', 'melodramatic', 'numerous', 'insert', 'several', 'aragorn', 'good', 'little', 'impending', 'exchanged', 'aragorn', 'frustrating', 'faithful', 'massive', 'short', 'elderly', 'embarrassing', 'upper', 'gimli', 'deep', 'comic', 'aragorn', 'serious', 'normal', 'athletic', 'handsome', 'gimli', 'funny', 'gimli', 'awkward', 'aragorn', 'gimli', 'female', 'male', 'gimli', 'inferior', 'able', 'half', 'many', 'gimli', 'numerous', 'long', 'interesting', 'tiny', 'large', 'impressive', 'other', 'whole', 'bad', 'colloquial', 'final', 'inferior', 'bad', 'large', 'little', 'unnecessary'];0.0305194805194805

66;leplatypus;"in a trilogy, the second part is always the most difficult to create because it loses the charm of the discovery and lacks the thrill of the conclusion. the goal is to develop the characters and conclude with a solid cliffhanger that will be resolved in the last part. thus, it's not just passing by. unfortunately, this movie is this kind. it fails to reach classics as ""star wars v"" or ""bttf 2"" and it's as dull as ""star trek 3"". nothing really fundamental happens here: it's just another steps in the journey. moreover, the fluidity of the first movie is lost because the characters are now split into three groups. i dozed two times watching it: in the rohan country and during the helm's deep battle. but the responsibility goes to tolkien because lotr aren't really three stories but a huge, colossal single story divided in three parts by the editor. and a night rainy battle will be always more exciting on a paper than on screen. to leave on a happier note, i must say that the extra are interesting and really help to understand all the passion that people have put in this trilogy. that's why the chain-maker is so funny: with his desperate and weary voice, he explains that armors needs thousands of rings, that rings come in three models and that in a day of work, he can chains as much as a big scarf!";9 January 2011;4;['second', 'difficult', 'solid', 'last', 'bttf', 'dull', 'fundamental', 'first', 'deep', 'huge', 'colossal', 'single', 'rainy', 'exciting', 'happy', 'interesting', 'funny', 'desperate', 'weary', 'big'];0.0835565476190476
67;Movie_Muse_Reviews;"""the two towers"" continues j.r.r. tolkien's epic as interpreted by peter jackson, and though it lacks the same degree of suspense as ""the fellowship of the ring,"" it delivers when it matters in the first culminating battle sequence of the series. in ""the two towers,"" the fellowship has been disbanded following the death of boromir (sean bean). having bent the great wizard saruman (christopher lee) toward his will, sauron now has armies in both mordor and at isengard (the two towers). saruman's army of uruk hai have turned their attention to the kingdom of rohan, where aragorn (viggo mortensen), gimli (john rhys-davies) and legolas (orlando bloom) venture. meanwhile, frodo (elijah wood) and sam (sean astin) set out for mordor on their own, though they quickly find themselves with another companion, the creature gollum, who lusts after the ring that once was his. the script for this middle installment involves a lot of setup and building toward the climax: the battle of helm's deep. given the rich texture and detail of jackson's middle earth, we are swept up and intrigued by the new characters and locations rather than bogged down by them. the subplot of the catatonic king theoden of rohan (bernard hill) and the treacherous wormtongue (brad dourif) makes for great theater though it complicates matters, as does all the focus on theoden's niece, eowyn (miranda otto), who becomes quite fond of aragorn despite knowing his heart belongs to another. with the fellowship divided, the narrative must bounce around and entire characters become left out for what seem like hours. the one weak limb of the story that we come back to time and time again that really sticks out in a negative way is the subplot with merry (dominic monaghan) and pippin (billy boyd), who have been rescued from a band of uruk hai by the great treebeard, leader of the ents. the film cuts back numerous times to the two hobbits riding on treebeard's back as he slowly delivers exposition and back story, and the scenes are few and far between, so they really make the length of the film stand out in a negative way. all is cured, however, at helm's deep. this is the major action payoff we've been waiting for since the opening prologue in ""fellowship,"" the first major arrival point in the series, one that the script foreshadows hours before the battle begins. the people of rohan have retreated to their refuge hoping that the fortress's high walls will allow their few hundred to pull off a miracle against the thousands of uruk hai. it's a classic greek mythology setup and the payoff makes helm's deep the most rewarding sequence in the series thus far. but what makes ""two towers"" great is not just the spectacle in the end; we also get even deeper into our cast of characters. the film really explores the relationship between aragorn and arwen (liv tyler) and their likely ill-fated romance. although they're mostly comic relief, we become closer with gimli and legolas through greater use of humorous dialogue. the acting standouts of the film, however, are once again sir ian mckellen as gandalf the white, given a renewed life for the purpose of saving middle earth, and andy serkis as the motion-captured schizophrenic creature, gollum/smeagol. mckellen continues to draw so much attention to his character and the 100 percent pure gravitas he brings to the role cannot be over-appreciated. adorned in white and given greater power this time around, he literally sparkles. gollum is a curious character who carves out a pivotal role in the series in just a few hours after hints at his relationship with the ring. the character's voice and mannerisms could drive a viewer insane, but he's such a technological breakthrough and serkis gives the pitiable and ugly thing legitimate complexity. whether frodo and sam can trust him becomes a huge piece of this movie, and ultimately it becomes about whether or not we trust him. frodo believes that gollum is capable of doing the right thing and that he's their only chance to make it to mordor, whereas sam is ever the skeptic. this thread of doubt runs through the entire frodo- sam-gollum subplot. in the end, once again the script uses such moving dialogue delivered by actors so fiercely committed to their characters' emotions to really cap off ""the two towers"" in a way that will have you forgetting how long it took to get to this point and eagerly awaiting the final chapter. sam's speech to frodo in the end is nothing short of inspiring, capturing where the narrative is from an emotional and thematic standpoint. all the characters by the end of ""two towers"" have passed the point of no return; they've stared down certain annihilation and come to the conclusion that they are too far committed to their responsibilities to not be willing to make the ultimate sacrifice. the notion that the ""storm is coming"" foreshadows the battle of helm's deep, but it's really about what lies beyond. hope is the unspoken theme in play they all have to believe in it. bridging the first and last chapters makes ""two towers"" the weakest of the series, but it's also among the most memorable for its stirring conclusion and rousing segue into ""the return of the king."" having had first exposure to this incredible cinematic vision for middle earth, it can be easy to forget the incredible production value, but that has to be noted and assures this second ""lord of the rings"" film a certain baseline of absolute excellence. ~steven c thanks for reading! visit moviemusereviews.com for more!";26 November 2012;9;['same', 'first', 'great', 'gimli', 'own', 'creature', 'middle', 'deep', 'rich', 'middle', 'new', 'catatonic', 'treacherous', 'great', 'fond', 'aragorn', 'entire', 'weak', 'negative', 'dominic', 'uruk', 'great', 'numerous', 'back', 'few', 'negative', 'deep', 'major', 'first', 'major', 'high', 'few', 'classic', 'deep', 'rewarding', 'great', 'deep', 'likely', 'comic', 'close', 'gimli', 'great', 'humorous', 'white', 'middle', 'schizophrenic', 'much', 'pure', 'white', 'great', 'curious', 'pivotal', 'few', 'view', 'technological', 'pitiable', 'ugly', 'legitimate', 'huge', 'capable', 'right', 'only', 'entire', 'such', 'committed', 'final', 'short', 'emotional', 'thematic', 'certain', 'committed', 'willing', 'ultimate', 'deep', 'unspoken', 'first', 'last', 'weak', 'memorable', 'first', 'incredible', 'cinematic', 'middle', 'easy', 'incredible', 'second', 'certain', 'absolute', 'more'];0.165356215213358
68;funkyfry;jackson and his team have managed to actually top their first feature (at least in its theatrical version) with this amazing, over the top, deep-running fantasy epic. the performances are on, with rhys-davies and bloom's comradery adding an element that was somewhat missing from the first film. the action elements are well-balanced with the dialogue, the visuals are totally stunning. but the real star of this movie, probably for all time, is the cgi creation to top all others: gollum, who comes to leave breathing and smacking his lips and seeming every bit as real as any actor on the set could be. it was truly amazing to watch this effect work on an audience that could forget, in such memorable scenes as gollum's late night conversation with himself (as smeagol), that it was not watching an actual fantastic creature. never has the suspension of disbelief been so complete in a fantasy movie, and never has a fantasy world been created with such care and attention to detail, as well as to the flow of the story and characters.;3 August 2003;10;['first', 'least', 'theatrical', 'amazing', 'top', 'missing', 'first', 'balanced', 'stunning', 'real', 'real', 'amazing', 'such', 'memorable', 'late', 'actual', 'fantastic', 'complete', 'such'];0.2
69;Anonymous_Maxine;the fellowship of the ring is one of the greatest adventure films ever made, so it's really no surprise that its successor, the two towers, falls just slightly short of achieving the same powerful cinematic experience, but it is certainly a worthy installment in what is growing to be a tremendously well-made trilogy. the film starts off a little bit slowly, as it picks up where the last film left on in true sequel form, following frodo and sam as they continue their journey that was interrupted so suddenly by the end credits of the last film. this fabulously written film, which only takes artistic liberties in clarifying points that may have grown vague from the last film (the way the best adaptation films do), may go a little too deep into the amazingly intricate storyline to keep the attention of some of the younger viewers or some of those not familiar with the novels, but the experience remains just as intense and entertaining. the war for middle earth is officially underway, and the battle scenes are some of the most impressive that i've ever seen in a film. generally, i think that a film with as many computer generated special effects as can be seen in the two towers is destined to suffer at least slightly from them, but they are so seamless and impressive here that they really do not take away from the quality of the film. the majority of the battle scenes are done almost entirely on computer, but are still incredibly entertaining and convincing. there are walking talking trees in the film, which was a little off-putting at first, but are successful adaptations from the novel and are amazingly convincing on screen. (spoilers) pippin and merry, the two characters from the original film with the insatiable appetites and the endless sources of comic relief, are back in the second film playing the same characters with very little change other than that they seem to have matured quite a bit from their original roles, quite possibly because of their increasing experience in the war for middle earth. they spend the majority of their screen time in the film with the walking trees, trying to get them to take them to the battle but having little success. but once they finally make it there, they make a surprisingly effective and creative contribution to their side's participation in the battle. clearly, a black and white movie review written by some guy you've never seen or heard of (me) cannot do justice to the breathtaking things that happen in this film, you just have to see it for yourself. brad dourif, who is most famous for his role as the voice of the lovable chucky, the doll from the child's play films, and for, i might add, his excellent contribution as the gas station attendant at the beginning of urban legend, takes on a role in the two towers that fits his iconography perfectly. this capable actor who has been acting mainly in b-movies for the majority of his career has made a seamless jump to a part in one of the greatest trilogies of all time. now all we need is a part for bruce campbell and all of the underrated b-movie actors will be back in the spotlight! the comic relief in this movie is one of its best features (aside from the startlingly brutal and convincing battle scenes, of course), and none of it is cheesy or just thrown in to get a cheap laugh. there is a delightful scene where aragorn (once again played spectacularly by viggo mortensen, in another of the best performances of his career) and gimli (the lovable but amazingly powerful dwarf played by john rhys-davies) sneak around to the outside of the castle as it is being bombarded during the battle, and gimli timidly asks aragorn to toss him to the bridge because he can't jump over the gap himself, stopping aragorn to ask him shyly not to tell the dwarf (legolas, played by orlando bloom). this is a powerful adventure film that knows when to be funny, when to be romantic, when to make you cringe, cheer, cry, and gape. it entertains even through the slow parts, even going so far as to throw in a little schizophrenia scene with the little goblin that frodo and sam enlist as a reluctant guide. this scene is reminiscent of geri's game, pixar's exceedingly amusing animated short film that precedes a bug's life, but like the rest of the comic relief, it does not dampen the effect of the rest of the movie by making it laughable, but rather allows us to relax between scenes of breathtaking scenery and cringe inducing battles. for the second year in a row, the lord of the rings is sure to be an enormous contender in the oscar race.;7 January 2003;10;['great', 'short', 'same', 'powerful', 'cinematic', 'worthy', 'little', 'last', 'true', 'last', 'artistic', 'vague', 'last', 'good', 'little', 'deep', 'intricate', 'young', 'familiar', 'intense', 'entertaining', 'middle', 'underway', 'impressive', 'many', 'special', 'least', 'seamless', 'impressive', 'entertaining', 'convincing', 'little', 'successful', 'convincing', 'original', 'insatiable', 'endless', 'comic', 'second', 'same', 'little', 'other', 'original', 'middle', 'little', 'effective', 'creative', 'black', 'white', 'breathtaking', 'famous', 'lovable', 'excellent', 'urban', 'capable', 'seamless', 'great', 'underrated', 'comic', 'good', 'brutal', 'convincing', 'cheesy', 'cheap', 'delightful', 'good', 'gimli', 'lovable', 'powerful', 'gimli', 'aragorn', 'aragorn', 'powerful', 'funny', 'romantic', 'slow', 'little', 'little', 'reluctant', 'reminiscent', 'amusing', 'short', 'comic', 'laughable', 'second', 'sure', 'enormous', 'oscar'];0.2172390109890109
70;Vartiainen;the fellowship has been broken, frodo and sam travel towards mordor alone, merry and pippin have been taken by orcs, gandalf and boromir have fallen and aragorn, legolas and gimli must make haste to save at least some of their comrades. and at the same time the threat of mordor grows as war comes to rohan, the land of the horselords. it is an epic in the every meaning of the word, and possibly one of the best second parts of a trilogy in the history of cinema. sure, all three of the movies were shot back to back, but the fact still remains that middle parts of any kind of story are often the hardest. you have already established the setting, introduced the main characters, yet you still have to hold back until the end finale. the two towers solves this by giving us one amazing opening battle in the war of the rings. the battle of helm's deep, still considered to be one of the greatest battles put on film, and for a good reason. it is cinema at its finest. the huge scale of it, the special effects, the practical effects, the pacing, the score, the fury and the stages. but we also have other good stuff to tide us until the end of the film. the movie jumps around quite a bit, juggling various plot lines, and they all work very well. and, most importantly, this movie introduces some great new characters. bernard hill plays the role of theoden, king of rohan, and he is a very fitting counterpoint to aragorn. he's an aged monarch, a warrior past his prime, and thus frailer, but also possessing pride in his status as a ruler. very good performance, one of my personal favourites. but it's gollum (andy serkis) that everyone always mention, and for a good reason. in many ways he's the most important character in the whole story. he's the tragedy under all the heroics, noble sacrifices and great deeds. he's the dark shadow, the weakness of mortals made flesh. without him frodo's struggles wouldn't mean half as much. and serkis plays him perfectly. he's a marvel of special effects and man's ability to slip into a role. especially considering that he's essentially two characters molded into one. the two towers is a great film on all levels. it transitions us from the origin stories of the fellowship towards the grand battles of the return of the king, all the while keeping the story flowing smoothly and keeping us firmly in the mood for middle-earth. masterfully done, mr. jackson.;14 September 2015;10;['aragorn', 'gimli', 'least', 'same', 'good', 'second', 'middle', 'hard', 'main', 'amazing', 'deep', 'great', 'good', 'fine', 'huge', 'special', 'practical', 'other', 'good', 'various', 'great', 'new', 'fitting', 'aged', 'good', 'personal', 'good', 'many', 'important', 'whole', 'noble', 'great', 'dark', 'much', 'special', 'great', 'grand', 'middle'];0.3196269416857653
71;jzappa;"i treated my first viewing of the first lord of the rings film, the fellowship of the ring, as an obligation as a movie buff. if a movie hits it big, i feel obligated to see it, because people don't trust your opinion once they find that you've seen so many movies, so you claim, but you haven't seen lord of the rings. before the second time i saw the first lord of the rings film, i said that fantasy and sci-fi hardly ever slay me, much less those grand epic battle films, but i liked very much the fellowship of the ring, and have cleaned my palette since then with roman epics, fantasy films, and others in that vein, especially the ones with extensive running times, because those feel bigger and more grandiose. so i decided to, extremely late in the game, complete the already classic trilogy, and upon watching this second one, with my newfound optimism with its placements in genres and subject matter, i somehow felt a mixture of my feelings upon watching the first film the first time, with great cynicism and obligation, and the way i felt the second time. i wrote in my review way back when i re-watched this film's predecessor, ""despite having never read a syllable of any of j.r.r. tolkien's work and knowing jack about elves, halflings, hobbits, and orcs, i was perfectly able to appreciate jackson's passionate adaptation. it is an epic with effective moments of suspense, atmosphere and action. no, i am not a fan of the dialogue that, to me, plagues the majority of fantasy and sci-fi films. you know, the pseudo- medieval, artificially dramatic semantics that can very easily tune me out of a film because of how wooden even the finest actor can't help but be when speaking that way. and no, the wardrobe of these films don't do much for me, either. however, these components come with the territory, and i can tell that recollection of the movie will carry on and taper off in a span of days, which is a good sign."" i should've felt that way about its sequel, but unfortunately i did not. the same old cynicism and anticipation for the final credits returned from all that time ago when i first saw the first film. the dialects and rhetoric did aggravate me this time. i could not get past them this time around. i simply couldn't reach a logical conclusion as to why people in these films speak in such ridiculous ways that i've never heard of anyone from any culture speaking before. for instance, no one uses contractions, never once saying ""didn't"" or ""can't."" this is a small example. when things like this come to mind when listening to these characters, i only begin to wonder why they speak this way. why do some characters speak in variations of english accents and others speak in american ones? is this a question answered in the books? perhaps i should've read them before seeing these films, but many fans have yet to read them, so i figured i would be fine. does one have to go through such an effort to enjoy a film? an adaptation is not meant to be delivered in a way where the audience is expected to reference the book. but, for the sake of the film's logic, i hope that there is reason given in the books for middle earth being so ambiguous in its dialect and rhetoric uses. the biggest, and perhaps most legitimate, complaint of mine is the completely unrealistic way i've spoken of but haven't yet explained. you know what they do: they begin speaking very loudly, then come very close to the listener's face and begins speaking in a whisper, then walks away as if it's not natural to expect a response from them. and the listener simply stands, studious and greatly effected by their words. i could go on and on, but in the interest of time, i'll move on. the battle sequences were surprisingly unimpressive to me. there was no intensity. the camera-work had a very point-and-shoot style. the dwarf's moments during the climactic battle, his heroic comic relief, is very corny and unneeded. as i watch, i see how everything is a soundstage mechanism. i felt that the violence in the first film was much better portrayed. what i liked about this film was the plot strand involving gollum, frodo, and sam. i felt compassion for gollum, an uneasy, not entirely entrusted compassion, and enjoyed his development as a point of mystery between sympathetic character and antagonist. i also liked the cinematography outside of the battle sequences. just as i did in the first movie, i love the atmosphere depicted in the fictitious villages and locales, and i love the gothic and extravagant use of lighting. during the climax, even though i was disappointed in how unriveted i was in the battle, i enjoyed the concept of all the culminations of all joined characters from all plot strands progressed over the course of three hours finally clashing together. i gave this movie every chance when my natural proclivities were against it. i was assuredly paying attention, which didn't help me: once faramir's party reaches anduin, one of gondor's people says mordor's seized the eastern side. so how do they get to the western side? if they use the sewer that faramir later sends frodo and sam into, why did he explain to them what those sewers were? they'd have seen them already, just like me, who doesn't have to see this movie anymore. and for that i'm thankful. i didn't dislike this film, but i would add the fellowship of the ring to my collection and refuse to allow this sequel. i simply don't think i could watch it again. i hope the third one is the astonishing achievement it's cracked up to be.";22 March 2007;6;['first', 'first', 'big', 'obligated', 'many', 'second', 'first', 'less', 'grand', 'epic', 'roman', 'extensive', 'big', 'grandiose', 'classic', 'second', 'newfound', 'subject', 'first', 'first', 'great', 'second', 'able', 'passionate', 'effective', 'dramatic', 'wooden', 'fine', 'much', 'good', 'same', 'old', 'final', 'first', 'logical', 'such', 'ridiculous', 'small', 'english', 'american', 'many', 'fine', 'middle', 'ambiguous', 'big', 'legitimate', 'unrealistic', 'natural', 'studious', 'unimpressive', 'climactic', 'heroic', 'comic', 'corny', 'unneeded', 'first', 'uneasy', 'sympathetic', 'first', 'fictitious', 'gothic', 'extravagant', 'disappointed', 'unriveted', 'natural', 'eastern', 'western', 'thankful', 'third', 'astonishing'];0.138235294117647
72;FiendishDramaturgy;"the epic saga continues, picking up right where the first left off, complete with hand sewn banners hung throughout the golden hall of rohan, hand-fashioned armor and elves! these works are perhaps the best i have ever seen. in the genre of fantasy, this series is seriously in danger of having replaced star wars as my all-time favorite movies. the direction was of the very best quality. the sets, designs, props and backdrops were realistic and without flaw. i highly recommend the extended edition, released in november 2003. the scenes fully restored to their original glory before having some of the detail and story line left on the cutting room floor, this production is as ""epic"" as they come; far larger than life. a task this formidable requires dedication, staying focused - both on the task at hand and in the creativity department. neither were lacking here. i honestly found not one moment of wasted film, not one single element which should have been edited out or omitted, not one performance which was lacking in any way. while there were adaptations made to tolkien's original literary work, i stand behind the creative decisions made, allowing that there were contractual obligations to be met, and fully and thoroughly enjoyed this darkling fantasy-filled adventure. this work, with its story set at the edge of the fall of man, was dark and twisted, yet leaving us with hope for mankind's future. i thought jackson's work to be frightfully clever and wholly engrossing. this movie (especially the extended version) is absolutely wonderful; a true credit to the whole industry. too bad for us that hollywood is not as bold. as did the fellowship of the ring, the two towers rates a full 10/10 from... the fiend :.";23 December 2003;10;['epic', 'first', 'complete', 'golden', 'good', 'favorite', 'good', 'realistic', 'extended', 'original', 'epic', 'large', 'formidable', 'focused', 'single', 'original', 'literary', 'creative', 'contractual', 'dark', 'twisted', 'clever', 'extended', 'wonderful', 'true', 'whole', 'bad', 'bold', 'full'];0.2274801587301586
73;snoozejonc;frodo and sam encounter gollum, whilst aragorn, legolas and gimli go to rohan. this is the very cinematic middle part of the lord of the rings trilogy. from the opening flyover shots of the snowy mountain peaks, 'the two towers' is fantastic to look at and full of perilous adventure. as with the first movie, if you have read the book, it will likely influence your enjoyment as it puts a lot more focus on the non-hobbit characters and turns the source material into a hollywoodised action adventure. the script moves the established characters along their journey, introduces more characters and stages some very spectacular events. to do this it splits into a number of directions as it follows different groups through various paths and obstacles. some scenes put the foundations in place for what is to come in the next movie, whilst most of it leads towards the centre piece of this movie, the battle of helms deep. this unfolds at a relatively uneven pace, but all scenes are technically well made. if you compare the battle to the various spectacles of the modern era such as those in game of thrones it feels pretty standard, but at the time of its release it was groundbreaking in terms of the scale of the set-piece and use of cgi. a huge theme in the trilogy is hope in the face of despair and the battle portrays it with some wonderful sequences. the arrival of the elves, king theoden riding out to meet the orcs, and that moment when sun rises still makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up. is there too much cgi? yes, i think there is. as epic as it makes the battle look, it is distracting when you know most of those vast orcs legions were generated by computer programmers. that being said, a major success of the movie is it's cgi depiction of the character gollum by the animators and the work of performance-capture star andy serkis. this character is central to the depiction of how the ring corrupts the souls of those who possess or seek to possess it and his scenes are some of the best in the trilogy. generally the visuals are phenomenally good. the cinematography, lighting, colours, editing, locations, set design, costuming, makeup, props, and general art design are some of the most iconic in movie history. for me the visual spectacle is so powerful it actually detracts my attention from the characters, who are good, but sometimes feel they have come along for the ride. it is a movie that could have been perfect if the characters were better and there were performances that (aside from serkis) were truly iconic. saying that there are lots of solid performances, with the best for me being bernard hill, brad douriff, ian mckellen, sean astin, and david wenham. nobody feels less than adequate for the role. however, i get the feeling that the focus was so much on the animation and the general look and feel that peter jackson might have been satisfied with not capturing that many truly memorable character moments. for me it's an 8.5/10 but i round upwards.;16 November 2021;9;['aragorn', 'gimli', 'cinematic', 'middle', 'snowy', 'fantastic', 'full', 'perilous', 'first', 'more', 'non', 'hobbit', 'more', 'spectacular', 'different', 'various', 'next', 'most', 'deep', 'uneven', 'various', 'modern', 'such', 'huge', 'wonderful', 'much', 'epic', 'most', 'vast', 'major', 'central', 'good', 'good', 'general', 'iconic', 'visual', 'powerful', 'good', 'perfect', 'well', 'iconic', 'solid', 'good', 'brad', 'less', 'adequate', 'much', 'general', 'satisfied', 'many', 'memorable'];0.2933943089430894
74;freemantle_uk;after the success of lord of the rings: fellowship of the ring exceptions were sky-high. peter jackson undertook an epic production, shooting all three lord of the rings back-to-back and making the most epic trilogy ever. here jackson makes an ever more epic film, and make it even better then the first. after the events of the first film, the fellowship of the rings has broken, boromir (sean bean) has been killed by orcs, gandalf (sir ian mckellen) has been killed by a balrog, frodo (elijah wood) and sam (sean astin) have taken the ring eastwards, merry (dominic monaghan) and pippin (billy boyd) had been captured by saruman's (christopher lee) orcs, and aragorn (viggo mortensen), legolas (orlando bloom) and gimli (john rhys-davies) are on the chase. things look bad for the free people of middle-earth, saruman and sauron have formed a powerful alliance, and the king of rohan, theoden (bernard hill) has fallen under saruman's spell. the three groups take their own paths in the quest. frodo and sam capture gollum (andy serkis), the other creature who craves the ring. he is only creature that could lead frodo into mordor, but sam has an obvious distrust for him. merry and pippen end up escaping from the orcs and hide in the forest of fangorn. they end up meeting treebeard (voiced by john rhys-davies), an ent, a peaceful treelike creature. it is up to the hobbits to help inspire the powerful ents into conflict against saruman. aragon and co. end up finding out that gandalf has been resurrected as an even more powerful wizard. gandalf leads this part of the fellowship to save theoden and to go to war with saruman's forces. the lord of the rings books are one of the best fantasy books around, with a complex story and a long history. it would have been difficult for another to convert them into films, and many people were attached, from the beatles in the sixties, to even the great stanley kubrick. but peter jackson manages it by making 3 long epic films (even better with the extended cuts), with top of the range special effects. he ensures that the films is as loyal as possible, whilst ensure that a wider film audience would enjoy them. the two towers follows the premise of book, and there are only a few scenes that are changed. jackson follows many of the key themes, like treebeard's resistance to fight, with treebeard represent nature against the tide of industrialisation of saruman. they is also gollum's longing for the ring and how it takes it's toll on frodo. there is also gollum's schizophrenia, a brilliant element in both the film and the book. jackson's direction is excellent, creating a serious tone for the most part, about the darkness that the ring brings, the tough conditions of war and travelling a medieval style world, and the excitement and dangers of adventure. this is a world where people die, a dangerous, dirty world. but jackson does know when to lighten the mood, with some moments of comment, mainly from gimli, and have brilliant actions scenes. the battle of helms deep is one of the best battles put to screen. jackson shows he is one of the best director's around, mixing, action, drama, comedy, and excellent special effects. the costumes are brilliant, and the design of gollum is fantastic. despite all this, the film does deviate from the book unnecessarily, like an action sequence when the men of rohan fight wang (wolf) riding orcs, and aragon disappears because of it. but the main problem is with the characterisation of faramir (david wenham). in the book faramir is depicted as a kind lord, a good leader and a fine warrior: he knows of the corrupting influence of the ring, so doesn't want to know anything about it. in the film he is depicted a much darker light, showing him to be a harsh person, willing to use brutal methods, and tries to claim the ring for himself. this was not needed, and the only real dark spot for the film. the cast is terrific. viggo mortensen is of course a great actor, who plays aragorn was brilliant, so was andy serkis as gollum. there are obviously talented actors like elijah wood, sean astin, dominic monaghan, christopher lee, sir ian mckellen, hugo weaving, cate blanchett and liv tyler, who all do well in their roles. sean astin grows, turning sam turns from a slightly stupid character to someone who becomes more worldly wise. the film also helped kicked-start the careers of karl urban and david wenham. a brilliant film, the extended cut is a must see.;24 February 2010;10;['high', 'epic', 'epic', 'epic', 'first', 'first', 'boromir',

75;r96sk;i might not have enjoyed it as much as the first film, but 'the lord of the rings: the two towers' is still a terrific film no doubt. visually it still looks superb, i really do love the look of these films so far. the main plot is engaging and very interesting, while things like the costumes et al. remain at a high level. there is also top action, including some noteworthy battle sequences. there are, though, a few bits i found less great - still very good in the grand overall scheme, but just comparably with the 2001 release. i found the pacing to be slightly off in moments, while a few of the new cast members didn't connect to me - e.g. bernard hill. the side story, meanwhile, with billy boyd and dominic monaghan didn't interest me at all... they spend too much of the run time just walking through a forest. elijah wood remains good though. i did enjoy seeing the journey of frodo and sam (sean astin). andy serkis also gets more screen time with that aforementioned duo as gollum, which is most definitely only a major positive - a fun character! any scene with those three = outstanding. overall, as noted, it is still an excellent film. one very much worthy of following 'the lord of the rings: the fellowship of the ring', despite a few 'issues' i have with it.;17 February 2021;9;['first', 'terrific', 'superb', 'main', 'interesting', 'high', 'top', 'noteworthy', 'few', 'great', 'good', 'grand', 'overall', 'few', 'new', 'dominic', 'much', 'run', 'good', 'more', 'major', 'positive', 'fun', 'outstanding', 'excellent', 'worthy', 'few'];0.3306723484848485
76;dfranzen70;"the lord of the rings: the two towers starring: elijah wood, ian mckellen, christopher lee, viggo mortensen, brad dourif, sean astin rating: pg-13 runtime: 2:59 there are two types of people who will watch this movie: those who read the books and wand to see the visions brought to life, and those who saw the first movie in the trilogy (the fellowship of the ring) but haven't read the books (and perhaps don't plan to do so). the latter group will be more receptive to the two towers than the former, because director peter jackson takes some major liberties with the plot. as most people are aware, there are three books (the return of the king is the final in the trilogy). there are scenes in the second book that will appear in the third movie, and vice versa. this is perfectly reasonable, in my opinion, as it would be difficult - and perhaps not nearly as entertaining - to present the movies in exactly the same order as the books. that said, there are some major plot deviations in the two towers, scenes and situations that appear in none of the books. if one has read the books, this can be quite disconcerting, as one might be expecting the movie to follow the basic plot of either the two towers book or the return of the king book. if one hasn't read the books (but did see the first film in the trilogy), this might not be so disconcerting - one might not even notice a problem. so this isn't a complaint, exactly, as much as it's an observation. the movie picks up right where the last one left off. now, i'm going to assume here that people reading this have seen the fellowship of the ring. when that movie concluded, the original fellowship had lost two (boromir was slain by orcs after attempting to gain the one ring, and gandalf fell into the abyss beneath the mines of moria), and the remaining seven were separated. frodo, the ringbearer, and his servant sam have decided to continue their quest alone and are making their way to mordor. their fellow hobbits merry and pippin have been kidnapped by those orcs that had slain boromir; the orcs are under orders to capture alive any halfling, since they don't know which one has the one ring. aragorn the ranger, gimli the dwarf, and leglolas the elf are now tracking the horde of orcs, hoping to rescue merry and pippin. the first movie clearly belonged to frodo, who unlike most of his companions is slight, timid but fun-loving, hardly the hardy adventurer. he alone is entrusted to carry the eminently corrupting ring to its demise in mount doom. but the second movie shifts focus to another character, one who was seen only very briefly in the first movie: gollum. gollum has a long history with the ring, and he's now a complete slave to it. he wants it, his precious, back in his possession. he joins up with frodo and sam to lead them to the black gate, the terrible entrance to mordor itself, home of sauron, the maker of the ring (who desperately wants it back). gollum likes frodo, but he's plagued by split personalities; one side of him wants to help the hobbits, the other side wants to kill them and eat them - and regain the ring. it's interesting to note that gollum, unlike the other major characters, is completely computer generated. this isn't all that new in and of itself, but it's gollum's emotional expressions that make you think he's as real as the actors playing frodo and sam. in fact, director jackson had andy serkis (who voices gollum) act in the scenes with sam and frodo, then had him digitally removed and replaced with a computer-generated gollum. the result is much more seamless than your run-of-the-mill computerized character. but the story's not just about frodo and his quest. sauron knows the ring's out there, and that a halfling has it, but he has other matters to attend to. his goal is to wipe out mankind forever. that might be tough in today's world, but in middle-earth man was just gaining a foothold; elves and the like had ruled for eons. saruman, as seen in the last movie, has been breeding legions and legions of superfighters, mutant orcs called uruk-hai. the uruk-hai are sent to attack the kingdom of rohan, which has already been attacked from the inside through a silver-tongued advisor to the king, a wormtongue (brad dourif). by casting a spell on the king, theoden, wormtongue is able to render him invalid; his kingdom is shortly weakened. wormtongue is working for saruman, who's working for sauron (even though he thinks he's working for himself). in addition, the kingdom of rohan has been set against that of gondor, the other remaining man kingdom. together, they might be trouble for the enemy; separate, they can be picked apart. one of the most prolonged scenes in the movie is the battle at helm's deep. after being removed from his spell, theoden takes his people there for shelter and safety, determined to fight, aided by aragorn, leglolas, and gimli. the uruk-hai, some ten thousand strong, attack. there have been many excellently staged epic battle scenes in cinematic history, but they all seem to pale to the extravagance and sheer power of this one. it's an awe-inspiring scene, guaranteed to make one cheer. now, as i said, there are some differences between the books and this movie. i don't mind if certain scenes or sequences are left out, because you can only cram so much into a three-hour movie. but when scenes appear in the movie that never appeared in any of the books, i have a problem. these books have been around for a long time, and it just seems foolhardy to add plot that doesn't need to be added, while at the same time omitting plot that seems necessary. i won't go into details here about what ""new"" scenes are in the movie that aren't in the books, but i was scratching my head after a few of them (and i had just reread the two towers a month or so ago). there's even less attention paid to female characters this time around. arwen, the elvish beauty who had a thing for aragorn in the first movie, is seen in dream sequences only - although this is indeed an important plot point, as it explains aragorn's motivations a bit more lucidly. there's a new female character as well: eowyn, the daughter of the rohan king, who (surprise, surprise) also has a thing for aragorn. there are some funny moments as well, most of them involving gimli the dwarf, who appears to be along for comic relief - even more so than in fellowship. this can, however, have the unintended consequence of marginalizing gimli's character; after all, he's a strong, steadfast, and tough dwarf, yet he's pigeonholed into a ""comic"" character. the chemistry between him and leglolas the elf is excellent, however. one thing that we must all be thankful for is that the movie does shift away from frodo himself. elijah wood continues to prove he's a terrible actor, incapable of expressing emotion adequately. as the story wears on, frodo is supposed to get weaker and more beaten - although at times he can rouse himself to complete his quest. but wood always has that scared look, that deer-caught-in-headlights look, the look that says, ""why am i here with these actors?"" the performance is flat and ineffectual. and although the focus of the movie as a whole does shift away from frodo, because his scenes basically involve just him, sam, and gollum, wood's inadequacies are that much more accentuated. luckily, these scenes are dwarfed (pardon the pun) by the battle scenes. it's never easy to make the middle movie in a trilogy - you want to build on the first movie and lead to the third. remember back to the future ii? wasn't quite as charming as the first one or as action-packed as the third one. it was just kind of there. the two towers suffers this indignity, to an extent. unlike the first one, there's no opening narration that gets everyone up to speed, and like the first one, this one just sort of .... ends. and not necessarily in the same manner as the second book did, either. this movie isn't as good as the fellowsip of the ring, but it's still very, very good. i'm giving it three-and-a-half stars out of four, but bear in mind it was a tough three and a half to get. it's not as bad as a three-star movie, but it's not quite the masterpiece of the first movie, either.";19 December 2002;8;['first', 'latter', 'receptive', 'former', 'major', 'most', 'aware', 'final', 'second', 'third', 'reasonable', 'difficult', 'same', 'major', 'disconcerting', 'basic', 'first', 'last', 'original', 'alone', 'alive', 'gimli', 'first', 'most', 'slight', 'timid', 'hardy', 'corrupting', 'second', 'first', 'long', 'complete', 'precious', 'black', 'terrible', 'split', 'other', 'interesting', 'other', 'major', 'new', 'emotional', 'real', 'seamless', 'computerized', 'other', 'tough', 'middle', 'like', 'last', 'mutant', 'theoden', 'able', 'invalid', 'other', 'separate', 'prolonged', 'deep', 'gimli', 'strong', 'many', 'epic', 'cinematic', 'sheer', 'certain', 'long', 'foolhardy', 'same', 'necessary', 'new', 'few', 'less', 'female', 'elvish', 'first', 'important', 'new', 'female', 'funny', 'most', 'gimli', 'comic', 'unintended', 'strong', 'steadfast', 'tough', 'comic', 'excellent', 'thankful', 'terrible', 'incapable', 'weak', 'scared', 'flat', 'ineffectual', 'easy', 'middle', 'first', 'third', 'future', 'charming', 'first', 'third', 'first', 'first', 'same', 'second', 'good', 'good', 'tough', 'bad', 'first'];0.091600114444942
77;dee.reid;"...i wasn't sure anyone would have ever guessed (except in a 2004 ffangoria magazine article written by mexican visionary guillermo del toro) that new zealand native peter jackson, the director behind the ""goriest movie ever made"" (1992's ""dead alive""), would have been behind the epic three-film installment of ""the lord of the rings"" saga, which include ""the fellowship of the ring"" (2001), ""the two towers"" (2002), and best picture oscar-winner ""the return of the king"" (2003). ***note*** this comment applies to all three movies, as it will be posted at each individual web page. not since ""star wars"" has this much hype surrounded films of this magnitude. but i guess such hype exists because j.r.r. tolkien's books have one of the largest devoted fanbases of any popular reading material. i've never read tolkien's original books, though several readers as well as fans of the movies have told me such knowledge is not required when viewing ""the lord of the rings"" films. ""the lord of the rings"" is the biggest movie i've ever seen, and there's a whole lot of story, 12+ hours to be exact, and i've spent the last two days viewing the extended versions of all three movies and they are breathtaking. there are many dazzling special effects shots over the course of the trilogy and epic battle sequences to put you in awe (many of which, in my view, do push the limits of the ""pg-13"" rating), not because it's action but because of how precise jackson's direction is, and how unflinching the camera becomes when it's time for battle. the rousing, epic score by howard shore helps the viewer get ""into"" jackson's vision of middle-earth, and into the characters and on-screen action. jackson has also breathtakingly transformed his new zealand homeland into tolkien's middle-earth and when you watch these movies, you feel like you're really there, with the rest of its inhabitants. it is also pretty frightening too, with many jump scenes including the frequent and violent battle sequences between our heroes and ""the enemy,"" who include the brutish orcs, moria orcs, ringwraiths, and the unreal entity sauron. and lastly, the cast does much more than bring the action to life, but instead live (""live"" is italicized) their parts. of course, i'm talking about the young hobbits frodo (elijah wood) and sam (sean astin), who come into possession of the ancient one ring and must journey to the hellish land mordor to cast the talisman into a river of lava and bring its reign of evil to an end. along the way, two other hobbits merry (dominic monaghan) and pippin (billy boyd), necromancer gandalf (sir ian mckellen), warrior aragorn (viggo mortensen), boromir (sean bean), elf legalos (orlando bloom), and dwarf gimli (john rhys-davies) aid them in their quest - together as a ""fellowship of the ring."" there are also plenty of other fantastic supporting roles from cate blanchett, ian holm, christopher lee, liv tyler, hugo weaving (agent smith plays a good guy), and andy serkis as the voice of the ever-creepy gollum. i think j.r.r. tolkien would be proud of peter jackson's take on his material, despite comments i've heard his son has made in undermining the director's vision. someone once called ""the lord of the rings"" the greatest fantasy epic ever made; they were right. 10/10";3 August 2005;10;['sure', 'goriest', 'dead', 'alive', 'epic', 'good', 'individual', 'much', 'such', 'large', 'devoted', 'popular', 'original', 'several', 'such', 'big', 'whole', 'exact', 'last', 'extended', 'many', 'special', 'epic', 'many', 'precise', 'epic', 'middle', 'middle', 'frightening', 'many', 'frequent', 'violent', 'brutish', 'unreal', 'more', 'live', 'young', 'ancient', 'other', 'dominic', 'gimli', 'other', 'fantastic', 'good', 'creepy', 'proud', 'great', 'right'];0.1812437562437562
78;ackstasis;"i've always considered 'the two towers (2002)' to be the black-sheep of the ""lord of the rings"" family; still completely amazing, of course, but perhaps less so than the two instalments that bookend it. whereas 'the fellowship of the ring (2001)' is an episodic introduction into the breathtaking world of middle-earth, and 'the return of the king (2003)' is the climax to which the entire trilogy builds, 'the two towers' has neither a concrete beginning nor end. on initial viewings, the film seemed to centre on the battle of helms deep, an epic conflict that pits a few hundred men and elves against saruman's 10,000-strong uruk-hai army. if the theatrical cut of 'the two towers' lacked the narrative depth of its siblings, then the extended edition which i watched this week for the first time rectifies any such shortcomings, breathing new life into the lands of rohan, gondor, and their human inhabitants. most significantly, faramir (david wenham) is given a back-story that makes clearer his motivations, via an extensive flashback featuring his father, denethor (john noble), and brother boromir (sean bean). the newly-introduced characters are no less three-dimensional than their more familiar counterparts: brad dourif as grima wormtongue, saruman's grovelling, serpentine apprentice; miranda otto as eowyn, a pro-feministic noblewoman lusting for glory; bernard hill as theoden, the king of rohan, and possessed by the treacherous hand of isengard. unlike its predecessor, 'the two towers' is split into three parallel story lines, but once again balances the epic and intimate, abruptly (but never jarringly) cutting between the epic battles of aragorn and co., and the slow, tortured trampling of frodo, sam and their slippery little guide (played by andy serkis in a rotoscope suit). i recall that, when the 'the two towers' was first released back in 2002, gollum was the main focus of reviewers' attention, and i was pleased to discover that the technology utilised in the cgi-character's creation remains completely authentic and convincing. serkis, despite never actually appearing on screen, brings an astonishing depth to the character, highlighting smeagol/gollum's schizophrenia by subtly altering his voice, posture and mannerisms. i'm about to take another trip down memory-lane, so bear with me again. when i first saw 'the two towers' at the cinemas in the last week of 2002 i remember telling a friend that i preferred the first instalment, because it was ""more about the ring."" while it's true that the second film somewhat relegates frodo and sam's struggles to the sidelines, one must consider the bigger picture. 'the two towers' takes tolkien's middle-earth beyond the guise of a simple fantasy world, and, with its vast scope and attention-to-detail, almost convinces us of its historical authenticity. i still recall emerging from the blackened cinema satisfied with where the trilogy was heading, but horrified at the prospect of waiting an entire year for the story's conclusion. well, i waited... but no longer than i had to. at least i'll only be waiting a week this time around.";19 July 2010;10;['black', 'amazing', 'episodic', 'breathtaking', 'middle', 'entire', 'concrete', 'initial', 'deep', 'epic', 'few', 'strong', 'uruk', 'theatrical', 'narrative', 'extended', 'first', 'such', 'new', 'human', 'back', 'clear', 'extensive', 'dimensional', 'familiar', 'serpentine', 'pro', 'feministic', 'theoden', 'treacherous', 'parallel', 'epic', 'intimate', 'epic', 'slow', 'slippery', 'little', 'main', 'pleased', 'authentic', 'convincing', 'astonishing', 'about', 'last', 'first', 'more', 'true', 'second', 'big', 'middle', 'simple', 'vast', 'historical', 'entire', 'least'];0.1315627202255109

""you'd find more cheer in a graveyard"", gimli grimly offers as they ride up... these films were made in the midst of a time of great upheaval and change, just as the characters face in the film: pippin tells meriadoc... ""maybe we don't belong here, it's too big for us, besides, we still have the shire"" - whereas meriadoc rebukes him, telling him, ""the fires of isengard will spread, the woods of tuckbourough and buckland will burn, and all that was once green and good in this world will be gone... there won't be a shire"". our choice is to make our world good or bad: so i challenge anyone watching this film to let this be a cautionary tale - how would you like your world? and ironically, weta digital also worked on another film which makes the same statement... ""avatar"". do we want to live in a world with no brazilian rain forests or african jungles or polar ice caps? we cannot live without these things, they are necessary for our survival and also the survival of our precious animals, our most valuable resource. and so we stand at a crossroads and we must go up the morgul vale to the dead city and up the secret stair through shelob's lair and right into mordor. and we can't stop there, then we have to wade through troops of orcs and then up a volcano that keeps threatening to erupt! and then it does erupt, so then we get to surf on huge rocks and then if we are lucky we can catch a ride on the next eagle that flies by... perhaps lord of the rings is a prophetic story, prophetic and representational of us today, although tolkien never wanted it that way. considering this is a landmark film using brand new mocap tech, the computer graphics meld into the practical and miniature sets perfectly. i know there is no ""warg attack"" in the book, and in the book we do not get a troop of elves showing up just in time to help defend helm's deep and legolas never takes a skateboard run down the outer steps of the deeping wall, but jackson made the best lord of the rings he was able to make and thank the lord bob shaye shelled out the money to make this, and in three films... and the story is basically intact, so please no complaining about no gandalf fighting the balrog under the mountain! peter jackson interpreted lord of the rings for us, and handed it to us on a platter. but if all you have seen is the theatrical version of all of these movies, then i can say with authority, you really have not seen jackson's lord of the rings - so go out and rent you that extended cut- soon to be released in blu-ray hd!";12 January 2011;10;['possible', 'huge', 'complex', 'theatrical', 'extended', 'extra', 'phillipa', 'fran', 'jamie', 'personal', 'favourite', 'prosthetic', 'digital', 'few', 'impressed', 'digital', 'massive', 'deft', 'professional', 'christian', 'consummate', 'professional', 'specific', 'conceptual', 'multi', 'departmental', 'insane', 'permanent', 'amazing', 'first', 'gandalf', 'aragorn', 'gimli', 'real', 'convincing', 'more', 'gimli', 'grimly', 'great', 'big', 'green', 'good', 'good', 'bad', 'cautionary', 'same', 'brazilian', 'african', 'polar', 'necessary', 'precious', 'valuable', 'dead', 'secret', 'huge', 'lucky', 'next', 'prophetic', 'prophetic', 'representational', 'landmark', 'new', 'practical', 'miniature', 'deep', 'outer', 'good', 'able', 'intact', 'theatrical'];0.1613107822410148

86;jimbo-53-186511;i must admit that i did enjoy the first film and although it perhaps was a little slow in setting up the story it still remains a fairly compelling watch overall. sadly i didn't get that same feeling when watching this second instalment for the following reasons... firstly, splitting all of the characters up and trying to show the story from various different perspectives is a risky strategy. if it's done wrong then it can make the film feel unfocused and not particularly interesting and sadly this second instalment falls into this very trap. the film flits about from character to character, story arc to story arc without giving any particular character or story arc chance to develop or grow properly. it doesn't help that sometimes there can be long gaps from one story arc to another meaning that you may have forgotten what was going on in the previous story arc? i got the feeling that jackson was trying to weave the stories together, but it seems that this isn't one of his strengths. the second thing that bothered me slightly about this film was the character of gollum - for some reason i felt that we were being teased in the first film that he was an interesting character that's shrouded in mystery. whilst his character is fun for a bit, his repetitive rantings and antics do start to grate after a while. i was also disappointed that gandalf and saruman weren't given much screen time here - the former seemed to just drift in and out of the story and the latter was only really featured towards the end. although their absences were perhaps necessary to the story i found them to be the most compelling characters and was a bit annoyed that they both weren't in the film more often. the final battle sequences are nicely staged and once again the performances from the principal cast were excellent - bernard hill's superb performance helped the film greatly when mckellen and lee weren't on screen. john rhys davies also provided some excellent comic relief which again helped to improve my overall opinion of this film. the two towers is still a worthy film that's relatively enjoyable, but i just felt that by splitting the characters up and in establishing separate story arcs that it felt a little disjointed and lacked the smooth and more simplistic flowing of the story in the first film.;7 May 2016;5;['first', 'little', 'slow', 'compelling', 'same', 'second', 'various', 'different', 'risky', 'unfocused', 'interesting', 'second', 'very', 'particular', 'long', 'previous', 'second', 'first', 'interesting', 'fun', 'repetitive', 'much', 'former', 'latter', 'necessary', 'compelling', 'annoyed', 'final', 'principal', 'excellent', 'excellent', 'comic', 'overall', 'worthy', 'enjoyable', 'separate', 'little', 'smooth', 'simplistic', 'first'];0.1116666666666666

90;noralee;"""lord of the rings: the two towers"" uses the best of contemporary and traditional movie magic for a rousing, romantic adventure tale of good vs. evil, loyalty and love. from touches of ray harryhausen's ""jason and the argonauts"" that were among my favorite movie movements as a child as the ents and a couple of the monsters are charmingly hokey, to the seamlessly multiplying armored, costumed, hairy, made-up extras to the actor/rotoscoped combined astonishment of the twisted gollum/smeagle, it's all at the service of the story. peter jackson and company are wonderful at both closely hewing to the story yet skillfully cutting judiciously and adding clarifications that are in the spirit of the original, including using the appendix explanation of aragorn's love affair with arwen (incorrectly described as ""doomed"" by one critic -- well, if an eventual mortal life of 50 years together and four kids is ""doomed"" then many of us are doomed!) the mutual attraction with eowyn is fit nicely into the ""to be continued"" cliffhanger as i think the double x chromosome viewers are left as eagerly awaiting the conclusion of what happens to arwen and aragorn as what happens to the ring. david wenham makes us almost forget sean bean as his late brother, and i just figured out that's hugo weaving with quite a hair weave as arwen's disapproving dad. and of course excitingly heroic viggo is absolutely hunky (and i've thought so since at least ""walk on the moon""). i'll take this thrilling battle of helm's deep over saving private ryan for re-watching (with the second release of the dvd for the deleted scenes). no wonder there's now tours of the places in new zealand the movie was shot because the scenery is breathtakingly beautiful, even if some of it is mattes. that's sheila chandra vocalizing in the effective music.

93;drystyx;"like most good flower children, i read the trilogy, but i cheated and read the similrilian first, which kind of gives the whole picture. first, to rate the book, because the movie does try to remain extremely loyal to the book, and in fact the director in all three movies manages to convey each character's emotions much better than jrr did, and jrr used a lot of words-three big books. tokien was not the genius some say, but the cult that followed was of genius. now the movie. in this episode, there is much adventure, but it is the odyssey of the three characters-frodo, samwise, and gollum, that really holds your interest, much as the bridge on the river kwai holds the children in us in interest with hawkins, holden, and the other guy trekking through the jungle. likewise, the scenes with the interaction of frodo and samwise with their enemy-guide gollum, captivate the viewer. the little bits of humor with characterization, such as when samwise cooks the rabbit. gollum responds ""oooohhhhh, you've ruined it!"" that whole bit is priceless. no wonder why during the 70's everyone dreamed of playing gollum if the movie ever came out. a role you could literally get your teeth into. a delightfully depraved character. the adventures of merry and pippin are also likable and well done, and much like the book. they play a minor role, and it is directed as such. the adventures of the others seems a bit overdone, but then the book was a bit overdone. it makes sense that gandalf never dies in battle, because in the book he was an equivalent of an angel sent by the gods of jrr's world from the beginning of time. one wonders why he can't actually do more. however, why some smart uruk hai doesn't just slice off aragorn's head from behind is miraculous to say the least, but most audiences are accustomed to such miracles for main characters. the battle scenes have been acclaimed, but they lack reality. never does aragorn blink, slip, get something in his eye, in all just don't look for realistic fight scenes, but a more modern choreographed look. the bit where wormtongue goes head over heels for a very pale, plain king's daughter is the hardest thing to believe. but the actress plays her part well, and in fact its hard for a pale woman to look good without twentieth century make-up. all in all, its hard to find fault with this movie. quite enjoyable.";18 April 2006;10;['good', 'whole', 'loyal', 'well', 'big', 'much', 'samwise', 'other', 'little', 'such', 'oooohhhhh', 'whole', 'priceless', 'depraved', 'likable', 'minor', 'such', 'overdone', 'overdone', 'more', 'smart', 'uruk', 'miraculous', 'least', 'most', 'accustomed', 'such', 'main', 'realistic', 'modern', 'choreographed', 'pale', 'plain', 'hard', 'hard', 'pale', 'good', 'twentieth', 'hard', 'enjoyable'];0.1347988505747126

""do not trust to hope,"" is a characteristic piece of advice offered to another party of good adventurers. ""it has forsaken these lands."" director peter jackson reshapes the problematically structured middle novel in j. r. r. tolkien's ""lord of the rings"" trilogy into a stirring centerpiece for his own epic cinematic adaption. each shot has almost a painterly quality, a classical shape and texture that informs every frame. while tolkien's source novel is the weakest of the saga, jackson's film is the best of his own trilogy. instead of long narratives, jackson and his editors, michael horton and jabez olssen, present a triple-track approach where something is always happening, often very fast. at the same time, the script by jackson and his writing team plumbs story elements for drama and tension that tolkien at times barely limned. gollum's story is the film's emotional arc, as we see in him a tortured soul not quite beyond the reach of redemption, however dangerous. his mad lust for the ring of power is not only dramatic in itself, but ominous for the lead character, frodo (elijah wood) who now carries the ring and sees in gollum the potential for similar madness in himself. ""the two towers"" does an effective job reintroducing the characters, good and evil, we met in ""the fellowship of the ring"" and investing all of them with qualities of deeper interest and humor to extend our investment in them. at the same time, ""the two towers"" broadens things with a slew of new characters, most especially gollum (serkis is never seen on screen, but he was both a voice-actor and a motion- capture artist on screen) and faramir (david wenham), brother of troubled boromir seen in ""fellowship."" both gollum and faramir find themselves tested by the very same thing, and their different reactions help drive the rest of the film. there are minor weaknesses in this film, most particularly a needless detour where the brave human leader aragorn (viggo mortensen) temporarily goes missing. some lengthy exposition elements featuring my least favorite characters, the elves, grate on my nerves. but the spectacle and storycraft overall are brilliant in the main, and even better, become more enjoyable when the film is watched again.

98;Steffi_P;"of the three pictures in peter jackson's epic treatment of the lord of the rings trilogy, this one probably takes the most liberties in adapting jrr tolkein's book. middle sections in a trilogy are often problematic, especially in the movies. tolkein would have expected his readers to work through the books chapter-by-chapter, the split into the three volumes being mainly to keep the actual tomes to a practical size. a movie however is more of a stand-alone thing, and it needs a satisfying beginning and ending even when it's the middle of a larger story. jackson, along with his co-writers fran walsh, philippa boyens and stephen sinclair have done a neat job. the two towers has an added problem in that the characters get split into three groups, and three separate narrative lines. the novel devotes half a book each to the different sets of characters. the script for the two towers must find more fluid ways of integrating the different story lines, and there is some canny balancing of pure action and 'human' themes. they insert a little episode of the romance between aragorn and arwen, which is a bit dull in itself but provides a brief moment of tranquillity to build up tension before the next burst of action. there's also an implication that eowyn slightly fancies aragorn, which as far as i recall was not in the book, but it actually works far better than the official romance because it is tied into the sense of danger at the battle. finally, the writers leave off some of the book's material for the third movie, to put more focus on the helm's deep climax and wind towards satisfactory conclusions for each of the story's strands. peter jackson is very much a craftsman of his generation, with all the pros and cons of modern filmmaking. as with the fellowship of the ring, the movie is over-edited, with shots never lasting more than a couple of seconds. but this is jackson's style and he knows how to do great things with it. he's especially good at switching between the inside and the outside of a situation. when aragorn, gimli and legolas encounter the rohirrim, the riders surge into view over the hillside, and jackson really gives us a feel of the power of this army with breathtaking shots from above and then ones inside the throng with horses towering over the camera. later he creates a mighty ""wow"" moment when the black rider appears, a gauntleted hand at first, before pulling back to reveal the massive winged steed. and the detail in jackson's close-ups is if anything more meaningful than his massive cgi crowd shots. when we see frodo's hand moving for the ring round his neck, his fingers are rough and dirty, just as they would on someone who has spent weeks travelling in the wilderness. the breaking of the fellowship into smaller groups in the two towers allows individual characters to come out a bit more, and it's the better movie for it. as before though there are a few problems with the acting. elijah wood makes a dismal and unsympathetic frodo, moaning his way across middle earth with a perpetually forlorn look. andy serkis's gollum is certainly a spirited little fellow, but i feel he's just a little too pathetic, and not convincingly cunning enough or perhaps that problem lies more in the way he's been animated. once again it is ian mckellen who brings most dignity to the proceedings, but this time he is aided by solid turns from the likes of bernard hill and miranda otto. alongside the development of characters, most of the players from the previous movie perform a little better this time around, and john rhys davis is particularly good as a loveably comical gimli. perhaps what really makes the two towers is jackson's deliberate tendency to be somewhat silly. who else would come up with a tolkein adaptation featuring an olympic torch-bearer orc or legolas surfing down the steps on a shield, unless it was a deliberate parody (which it never for one moment feels like)? above all, he seems to be having fun with what he's doing. i don't think the oliphaunts were supposed to be quite that big in the books, but jackson clearly wanted the imperial walkers from the empire strikes back in his movie. it's his ability to adapt the material with dignity but without taking it too seriously, that means generally the audience is having as much fun as he is.";7 April 2012;9;['epic', 'most', 'middle', 'problematic', 'actual', 'practical', 'more', 'alone', 'satisfying', 'large', 'neat', 'separate', 'narrative', 'different', 'fluid', 'different', 'canny', 'pure', 'human', 'little', 'dull', 'brief', 'next', 'official', 'third', 'more', 'deep', 'satisfactory', 'modern', 'more', 'great', 'good', 'gimli', 'mighty', 'wow', 'black', 'massive', 'winged', 'close', 'meaningful', 'massive', 'rough', 'dirty', 'small', 'individual', 'more', 'well', 'few', 'dismal', 'unsympathetic', 'middle', 'forlorn', 'spirited', 'little', 'little', 'pathetic', 'cunning', 'most', 'solid', 'most', 'previous', 'good', 'comical', 'gimli', 'deliberate', 'silly', 'tolkein', 'olympic', 'deliberate', 'big', 'imperial', 'much'];0.1058214285714285
99;ShootingShark;"following on from the fellowship of the ring, jrr tolkien's the lord of the rings saga continues as hobbits frodo and sam, in the company of the devious gollum, continue their quest to destroy the one ring, aragorn and his friends fight to protect the people of rohan from the evil saruman's vast army of orcs and kidnapees merry and pippin escape from their captors and befriend the ents of fangorn forest. this beautiful and breathtaking fantasy film's only flaw is that being the middle book of a trilogy it doesn't have a beginning or an end. that aside, it maintains the stunning high quality of the previous film in every aspect of production and keeps the epic story sweeping along at a magnificent pace. the performances are uniformly excellent but three actors new for this movie in particular distinguish themselves. hill as the proud but miserably oppressed king theoden. dourif as the slimy grima wormtongue. there's a wonderful moment where he says to lee, ""but we'd need an enormous army for that !!"", to which lee strides to a balcony and looks down at a colossal orc army amassed outside. and in particular serkis, who never appears on screen (gollum is computer-generated) but performed on set, motion-captured the character's moves and provided his incredible voice. for me, gollum is the key character in the movie and he is brilliantly realised, bursting with pathos, rancorous bile and schizophrenic nuttiness (""we hates bagginses !! we hates them forever !!""). howard shore's excellent score and the outstanding effects work by richard taylor, jim rygiel and randy cook (the battle for helm's deep setpiece especially is a stunning composite of live-action and effects) serve to make this film even more spectacular than its predecessor. this is a movie with too many great scenes to mention, and tells a classic story with incredible visual splendour.";21 August 2005;8;['devious', 'aragorn', 'evil', 'vast', 'fangorn', 'beautiful', 'breathtaking', 'only', 'middle', 'stunning', 'high', 'previous', 'epic', 'magnificent', 'excellent', 'new', 'particular', 'proud', 'theoden', 'slimy', 'wonderful', 'enormous', 'particular', 'incredible', 'key', 'rancorous', 'schizophrenic', 'excellent', 'outstanding', 'deep', 'stunning', 'live', 'spectacular', 'many', 'great', 'classic', 'incredible', 'visual'];0.341126893939394

102;Spleen;"one hears a lot about the overwhelming majority of people who think otherwise (as if overwhelming majorities cannot be wrong), but i don't believe that this majority exists. many of the people i talk to know full well how bad jackson's films are, and most of the rest are ambivalent; moreover, as i watch the people walking out of ""the two towers"", few are genuinely excited. most of them look as though they've been bludgeoned into submission by crude overkill and sheer boredom. i'm sure many of these poor souls come to think they liked the film, but i think they're wrong even on this point. before i launch into my attack (the film itself did nothing but attack me for three hours; now it's my turn to attack it), i'm obliged to point out that it does improve on ""the fellowship of the ring"" in some respects. it looks better. rohan really looks like rohan, or if not like rohan, at least like some place in particular (in the original, jackson mixed unrelated and mostly unattractive locations with wild abandon), the cgi is marginally less offensive, and there is one (1) effective use of imagery: the bit in which frodo's elven cloak makes him look like a rock. this is not to say that the film is on balance a visual success. the camera still swoops around too much (reminding one of a british airways ad, and composer howard shore has obligingly written music to complete the effect), and the endless hordes of nintendo creatures in the interminable battle scenes fail to look one tenth as thrilling as a real shot of a handful of real people standing on a real hill (when the camera stays still enough to let us get a good look at either, which isn't often). but let's look at some of the changes jackson has made to the story and the characters. i'd like to make it clear: i don't object to changes per se. the day i say ""the two towers"" i also saw ""treasure planet"", which (disappointment though it was) was a far more intelligent adaptation of an original work it moved the entire sequence of events centuries ahead and into outer space, yes, but it neither made complete nonsense of nor wilfully misunderstood its own story. it's the nature of jackson's changes, not the mere fact that changes were made, that show us just how inept a film-maker he really is. consider (spoilers ahead) (1) faramir in the book finds out about the ring in a private conference between himself, frodo, and sam, and has the wisdom to let it be then and there; faramir in the film decides to pounce on the ring immediately as extras run around behind, in front of and between the various parties, and he even binds the hobbits and drags them to gondorso that we are forced to sit through yet another tedious ""action"" sequence before he changes his mind. one wonders: what's the point in even hiring two actors to play boromir and faramir, rather than one, if their characters are identical? and why not have tolkein's quiet moment of truth in private, when we've already sat through more than enough sword-clashing? not content by this blunder, jackson compounds it, by letting us know that not just faramir, not just the underlings he carelessly discusses state secrets in front of, but everyone of any consequence in gondor, knows all about the ring. we're told that faramir is legally bound to seize that ring, and that his life will be forfeit if he does not. ""then it's forfeit,"" he says, thrusting out his chest and waiting for the curtain to fall. no doubt these words sound very fine to thirteen-year-old dungeons and dragons players, but if boromir was merely obeying the law on pain of death when he tried to take the ring, doesn't this make complete nonsense of all the earlier characterisation, such as it was (and destroy any sense we may have of the way in which the ring corrupts genuine goodness)? indeed it does. (2) the ents, we are told, are ""not hasty"" (and the film is concerned to make sure that this trait is played for cheap laughs). they deliberate at great length before deciding to remain neutral. then at the sight of destruction they knew about anyway it takes them five seconds to change their mind and go to war. (five seconds is the time it takes all of them, collectively, to mount an invasion. individual minds switch track more quickly still.) does jackson have the slightest clue what he is doing? i could multiply examples easily: the contrived suspense of aragorn's ""death"", the intrusion of elves into those parts of the story where their intrusion makes no sense, the fact that the elves look like the kind of stormtroopers that vampires would have used if vampires had invented fascism, the bickering between frodo and sam and between theoden and everyone. but it's not just the idiocy of these changes individually that worries me, but their effect collectively. jackson says that his version of ""the two towers"" is ""darker"" than tolkein's; for ""darker"", read bloodthirstier, more cynical, more redolent of right-wing nastiness, less variegated. his world is one in which people squabble constantly, in which nobody has an unprompted noble thought or impulse, in which the forces of good have little left worth saving and in which power has little left worth the trouble of corrupting. it's the small-minded and mean-spirited work of a director who (as we know from a thousand flat-footed errors) is unable to handle a large canvas whose mind is unable to encompass a large world containing more than one kind of thing. it's a disgrace.";2 January 2003;3;['overwhelming', 'overwhelming', 'wrong', 'many', 'full', 'bad', 'most', 'ambivalent', 'few', 'excited', 'most', 'crude', 'sheer', 'sure', 'many', 'poor', 'wrong', 'well', 'least', 'particular', 'original', 'unrelated', 'unattractive', 'wild', 'offensive', 'effective', 'elven', 'visual', 'endless', 'interminable', 'thrilling', 'real', 'real', 'real', 'enough', 'good', 'clear', 'intelligent', 'original', 'entire', 'outer', 'complete', 'own', 'mere', 'inept', 'private', 'various', 'tedious', 'identical', 'quiet', 'private', 'more', 'enough', 'clashing', 'content', 'forfeit', 'forfeit', 'fine', 'old', 'complete', 'early', 'such', 'genuine', 'hasty', 'concerned', 'sure', 'cheap', 'great', 'neutral', 'individual', 'slight', 'contrived', 'dark', 'darker', 'cynical', 'more', 'right', 'unprompted', 'noble', 'impulse', 'good', 'little', 'worth', 'little', 'worth', 'small', 'minded', 'mean', 'spirited', 'flat', 'unable', 'large', 'unable', 'large', 'more'];0.1129359490274983
103;rosscinema;this is definitely a very entertaining film and the special effects are terrific but i don't think its as good a film as the first one. we've come to know the characters already so the film dives right in with the action while the first film took its time setting up the story. i do have one major gripe in this film and its the part of the film with the two hobbits merry and pippin and those tree creatures. the film comes to a screeching halt when the scenes shift to that part. the tree creatures talk slow, walk slow and all the scenes with them crawl along like a drunk snail. another complaint i have is ian mckellen as gandolf is hardly in the film at all. and cate blanchett has only one scene! the most exciting part of the film is the battle at helm's deep of course. these scenes are not only exciting but very impressive looking as far as filmmaking is concerned. this part of the film is really an achievement. of course during the whole course of this bloody battle the character aragorn (viggo mortensen) never gets hurt. so while this is going on frodo and sam (elijah wood and sean astin) are off in another direction battling christopher lee. so they're really is three stories going on at the same time. where the first film took its time in its narrative this film plunges head first into action. the two films really are different. this is an extremely well made film and peter jackson should be proud but i don't think its a great film. impressive looking and very entertaining but i'm hoping the third film will be better.;27 January 2003;7;['entertaining', 'special', 'terrific', 'good', 'first', 'first', 'major', 'slow', 'drunk', 'exciting', 'exciting', 'impressive', 'whole', 'bloody', 'aragorn', 'same', 'first', 'different', 'proud', 'great', 'impressive', 'entertaining', 'third', 'well'];0.2577110389610389
104;Rob_Taylor;"for a start, ignore the fanboys who decry peter jackson's efforts as ""not tolkien's story"" or other such comments. of course it isn't. it's peter jackson's version of it. that's why, apparently missed by the rabid tolkien-ites, all such films, somewhere in their credits, have the comment ""based on the novel xxx by xxxx....."". so, given that it isn't intended to be a word-for-word rehash of the book, why shout it down for that? what the two towers is, however, is solid action-fantasy cinema that picks up right where the first movie finished and runs with the ball. personally, i didn't think it was quite as good as the first movie, but then, it would have had to be fantastic to be so. all sequels are ""more of the same"" to an extent, so it's hard to be as good as the original, but this one comes pretty close. there were things i wished i could see more of in this movie, like the ents attack on isengard, or maybe where gimli discovers the caves at helm's deep (which wasn't in there at all), but i'm hopeful that the extended dvd release will add little extras like this back into the story as the extended dvd of fotr did. i was a little puzzled to see the elves at helm's deep. i don't recall that from the book, but who cares really? it seemed logical that they would come to help. nice addition. gollum was a truly amazing piece of cgi. i don't think he looked that realistic, but what made him work for me was the expression that they got into his features. amazing stuff, especially the ""good smeagol, bad gollum"" internal struggle. incidentally, on a humorous note, there were people in the audience that didn't get that bit. i heard at least two people (adults) wondering out loud where the second gollum came from! i also think that it was a shame shelob didn't make it into this one. t'would have made a good cliff-hanger ending for the second film to have frodo apparently dead and sam alone. but as it was, those of us who know the story can know anticipate the appearance of ungoliant's spawn in much the same way as we anticipated gollum's appearance. if there was one thing that i'm not sure is a good idea, it's the increasingly acrobatic legolas. i almost hate to think what he'll get up to in the final installment. but i'll still go and see it! all in all, this is a worthy follow-up to fotr and well worth your time. it will certainly be making an appearance in my dvd collection as soon as the extended version is released.";4 July 2003;9;['other', 'such', 'rabid', 'such', 'novel', 'solid', 'first', 'good', 'first', 'fantastic', 'more', 'same', 'hard', 'good', 'original', 'more', 'gimli', 'deep', 'hopeful', 'extended', 'little', 'extended', 'little', 'puzzled', 'deep', 'logical', 'nice', 'amazing', 'realistic', 'amazing', 'good', 'bad', 'internal', 'humorous', 'second', 'good', 'second', 'dead', 'same', 'sure', 'good', 'acrobatic', 'final', 'worthy', 'worth', 'extended'];0.2144144144144144

106;frankde-jong;"in 2022 my plan was to review both the ""lord of the ring"" trilogy of peter jackson (2001 - 2003) and the two ""nibelungen"" movies of fritz lang (1924), the reason being that both are ultimately based on the german ""song of the nibelungs"" and / or the scandinavian ""volsunga saga"". the ""lord of the ring"" novel by tolkien (jackson) and the nibelungen opera-cycle by wagner (lang) functioned to a greater or lesser extent as an intermediate station with respect to these adaptations. as if they had heard about my plan, right at the start of 2022 dutch television broadcasted al three episodes of the ""lord of the ring"". you can only admire the courage of peter jackson, because he was taking an enormous risk. how to involve all those that had not read the book in this labyrinthine story without rousing the indignation of those that had read the book (and often loved it) about leaving out too much detail? jackson proved to be up to the task in a marvelous manner and brought the fantasy genre to the next level. twenty years ago the computer generated images (cgi) used by jackson were nothing less than revolutionary. in his review roger ebert remarked that in comparison with the novel the ""sword and sorcery"" element in the movie was emphasized too much. it was too much of ""the adventures of robin hood"" (1938, michael curtiz & william keighley) and too little of ""the wizard of oz"" (1939, victor fleming). to translate this remark to the actual characters of the story. in the novel the hobbits are realy the central characters while in the movie they are the weak spot of the group that have to be defended (in flashy action sequences of course) by the other members of the fellowship. there is a grain of truth in this comment. on the other hand, if you invest heavily in cgi and takes the fantasy genre to the next lever (as stated earlier in this review) you want some action in return, don't you? i called the story labyrinthine and indeed there are many species and races involved. the essence of the story is however rather clear. it is a story about the struggle between good and evil. the forces of the good (hobbits, elves, dwars, men) cooperate in a fellowship and are learning to appreciate each other more and more as the story unfolds. the evil as represented by the ring (lust for power) is not limited to certain characters. anyone can in principle be infected by it. in effect there are characters that are evil in the trilogy, but had been good in earlier era's of the tolkien story (not covered by the jackson trilogy). because at the end of ""the fellowship of the ring"" the fellowship has disintegrated, ""the two towers"" is a more fragmented film, alternating between the adventures of the different parts of the fellowship. it is also the film in which aragorn (viggo mortensen) and not frodo (elijah wood) finally becomes the main character. some remarks about this have already been made in the context of the trilogy as a whole, but once again it is one of the major alterations of the film relative to the book. after all tolkien deliberately made a member of one of the most insignificant and modest people of middle earth the hero of his story. the rise to prominence of aragorn also has other consequences. as a more adult character than frodo the laws of commercial cinema prescribe that he has a love interest. in ""the fellowship of the ring"" arwen (liv tyler) played that role. in ""the two towers"" it is eowyn (miranda otto), or (more accurately) aragorn is the love interest of eowyn. ""the two towers"" is darker as ""the fellowship of the ring"". this is not only because the towers from the title are two centers of evil (sauron and saruman), but also because the forces of the good are more proud and less relaxed. in ""the two towers"" not the hobbits from the shire but the rohirrim from the kingdom of rohan are central. although they have horses in stead of boats they reminded me very much of the vikings from the middle ages. ""the two towers"" becomes a film of knights in stead of peasants (hobbits) and this is most obvious in the central battle of helmsdeep in which good (among others the rohirrim and some members of the fellowship) fights against bad (the uruk hai of saruman). the battle scenes are magnificent on the one hand (reminding me of ""ran"" (1985, akira kurosawa)), but too long on the other (reminding me of ""war and peace"" (1965, sergey bondarchuk)). the star of ""the two towers"" is however smeagol / gollum: partly animated, partly played by andy serkis using the then brand new stop motion technology. it is however not only the technology that makes smeagal / gollum interesting, but also his split personality. split between smeagel (his former self from long ago) and gollum (his twisted version, influenced and enslaved by the ring). because of this split personality he is not only evil but also pitiful. because of this split personality there grows an unlikely bond between him and frodo, frodo realising perfectly well that he is in danger of becoming just like gollum. gollum being the star of ""the two towers"", his scene with frodo and sam in the dead marshes was for me on equal terms with the batlle of helmsdeep. on seeing the movie for the first time in the year of release, the scenes with treebeard seemed the more long winded ones to me. today one can not fail to associate the story of the ents with problems relating to climate change. the times they are changing!";15 January 2022;8;['german', 'scandinavian', 'great', 'less', 'intermediate', 'dutch', 'enormous', 'labyrinthine', 'much', 'marvelous', 'next', 'less', 'revolutionary', 'much', 'little', 'actual', 'central', 'weak', 'flashy', 'other', 'other', 'next', 'labyrinthine', 'many', 'clear', 'good', 'good', 'other', 'more', 'certain', 'evil', 'good', 'early', 'fragmented', 'different', 'main', 'major', 'relative', 'insignificant', 'modest', 'middle', 'other', 'commercial', 'aragorn', 'dark', 'proud', 'relaxed', 'central', 'middle', 'obvious', 'central', 'bad', 'uruk', 'magnificent', 'other', 'new', 'interesting', 'split', 'former', 'twisted', 'split', 'evil', 'pitiful', 'split', 'unlikely', 'dead', 'equal', 'first', 'long'];0.0424804362304362
107;lewiskendell;all the good things that the fellowship of the ring started, the two towers continues without a hitch. sometimes the middle part of trilogies can be the weakest, but that's not the case here. the viewer is introduced to more of the world beyond the shire, including rohan, fangorn forest, and mordor. all these locations are crafted with as much care and skill as the shire and rivendell. the best parts of the movie are gollum and the epic battle of helm's deep. gollum is still my favorite cg character in any live-action movie, even several years later. he feels just like a living, breathing character. and as for helm's deep, it's hands-down one of the most impressive battle sequences ever in a fantasy film. top notch in every way. so basically, if you liked the fellowship of the ring, you'll probably like the two towers even more.;28 May 2010;8;['good', 'middle', 'weak', 'more', 'fangorn', 'much', 'good', 'epic', 'deep', 'favorite', 'live', 'several', 'deep', 'impressive', 'top'];0.2893356643356643

(only to rise again - the superman trope, which is nietzsche's ubermensch, formerly christ's resurrection, which in turn was plagiarized from every life-death-rebirth deity that came before, from asia to akkadia.) later, aragorn is swept off a cliff by a wolf, and dwarf gimli (john rhys-davies) reports to eowyn, in a poignant moment that is moving as much for rhys-davies's throat-catching performance as for his words, ""he fell."" when gandalf is resurrected as gandalf the white and thwarts the surprise attack of aragorn, gimli and legolas (what a badass!), aragorn, dismayed, says to him, ""but you fell..."" even the ultimate fall of gollum into the lava in the return of the king, though it means the death of that poor conflicted special effect and the destruction of the one ring, signifies a ""rebirth"" of middle-earth. two towers is where ""that gangrel creature"" gollum (motion-captured performance by andy serkis) comes into his own, in a mind-blowing, pioneering special effects coup for weta digital, peter jackson's efx company. like an evil gandhi on crack, gollum allies with the two star hobbits, frodo and sam (elijah wood and sean astin) on their quest to mordor; they go to destroy the one ring, gollum goes for any opportunity to reclaim the ring, his ""precious."" thus opening a new era in effects creatures interacting with humans on screen. the sight lines between gollum and the hobbits never falter, and when they engage in physical contact, their interaction is so ""real"" we never doubt it, watching the movie completely entranced by its story rather than marveling at gollum's ""reality"" or how his scanty panty never falls off. in the two towers, all our friends from the previous film wend their separate adventures in a dynamic, kinetic story full of middles. being that towers is - ahem - middle-earth's middle film (the red-headed child of peter jackson's nonpareil rings trilogy), it very sensibly has a middle, more middle, lots of other middle, a legendary medieval battle that will stamp itself into filmic history, and more middle. frodo and sam find mordor with gollum's help, decide to backtrack and find it again from the other side; the fruity b-hobbits, merry and pippin (dominic monaghan and billy boyd) stop being carried around by orcs and get carried around by a tree; the nazgul have graduated to riding excellent bat-winged dragons with voomp-voomp! wing-beats; sexy aragorn (viggo mortensen), his blonde elfin babe, legolas (orlando bloom) and their husky child gimli, run around the countryside, presumably in search of a good hot shower; while the mighty gandalf slays a balrog, drives the spirit of saruman (christopher lee as edgar winter) out of theoden king, and leads a cavalry charge on the uruk-hai at helm's deep - what a badass! so many characters, so many strands of plot, yet jackson holds it all together with an iron grip that never flags - from its broad battle strokes to its poignant personal relationships. jackson focuses maybe a little too much on aragorn pining over his elf-boo arwen (liv tyler, with pointy ears that just scream ""do me elf-style!""); add arwen pining over aragorn in slomo and whole chariots of tiresome love butter clog this film's arteries. (and it's hard to sympathize with aragorn missing his pointy-eared woman, when eowyn (svelte miranda otto, a shield maiden of rohan) is bursting all over him like a romantic raincloud.) left for dead, when aragorn arrives solo at helm's deep, a grand, sweeping 360-degree pan frames him, in a scene befitting a resurrection, and necessitating the invention of big screen plasma tvs. there is only one way to describe the battle of helm's deep, which somehow does not lose us in its madness, conveying clearly the pitch and yaw of victories and defeats, focusing on every character involved yet encompassing the grand scope of the madding war tableau... actually, there is no way to describe it. just watch it. i don't know how he did it, but jackson keeps us hanging in suspense and excitement during every minute of what most other filmmakers usually turn into generic rumbling. a truly incredible feat of direction, editing, choreography and creativity. i wonder what a tolkien scholar would think of the lord of the rings? jackson rewrites certain plot points for drama, but cannot escape broad strokes: so 10,000 orcs are sent to decimate 300 people? if saruman just ignored this veritable ""village"" he could still rule middle-earth pretty much without any resistance. at the end, while a montage of battles cascades before our wondrous orbs, samwise gamgee gives one of those speeches that makes your flesh crawl, whereupon the hobbits share a moment so romantic we feel we shouldn't be watching them. and just like the movie, i'm going to end in the middle--";21 July 2010;8;['astonishing', 'cross', 'promotion', 'universal', 'last', 'subterranean', 'aragorn', 'gimli', 'poignant', 'much', 'aragorn', 'gimli', 'dismayed', 'ultimate', 'poor', 'special', 'middle', 'own', 'special', 'evil', 'precious', 'new', 'physical', 'real', 'previous', 'separate', 'dynamic', 'kinetic', 'full', 'middle', 'middle', 'red', 'middle', 'middle', 'other', 'legendary', 'medieval', 'filmic', 'middle', 'other', 'dominic', 'excellent', 'sexy', 'aragorn', 'blonde', 'husky', 'gimli', 'good', 'hot', 'mighty', 'edgar', 'theoden', 'deep', 'many', 'many', 'broad', 'poignant', 'personal', 'little', 'aragorn', 'elf', 'pointy', 'whole', 'tiresome', 'hard', 'pointy', 'eared', 'romantic', 'dead', 'deep', 'grand', 'sweeping', 'big', 'deep', 'grand', 'most', 'other', 'generic', 'incredible', 'certain', 'broad', 'veritable', 'middle', 'wondrous', 'romantic'];0.1264294733044733
117;pyrocitor;"the two towers - aka: ""the one that usually gets mostly skipped during a lotr marathon"". perhaps a film that was continuously mistakenly referred to as ""lord of the rings: the twin towers"" released the year after 9/11 was always going to have a bit of a rough go standing out amidst the splashier, more gratifying bookending acts of its franchise. it's obviously still a masterpiece - no one disputes that - but, being heavier on the action, hardship, and lacking major punctuations of narrative momentum, definitively the black sheep of the trilogy (notice the lack of empire strikes back comparisons from those talking' tolkien). but this marginalization isn't fair, as it overlooks how much the two towers does accomplish - arguably, the subtlest, cleverest film of the trilogy - and how indispensable it is to the meat of tolkien's triumph. if fellowship is all about ""why we fight"" with its vision of the joyful, utopian tranquility of the shire worth preserving at all costs, and return of the king is all about triumphant closure, the two towers has the tricky task of being the 'the night is darkest before the dawn' hump of the trilogy, establishing the full scope and ripple-effects of the battle for middle earth, and how crucial victory is for an increasingly fleshed-out world. jackson takes this to heart - fittingly, the two towers is literally darker, filtered through barren browns and blueish-greys. this darkness also amps up the violence in the notoriously most action-heavy of the trilogy. at the point where bilbo was extolling the virtues of pipe weed in fellowship, in the two towers, we're greeted with a pile of steaming, charred orc bodies and heads on stakes, having just waded through the massacre of a helpless village, and an interlude of orc cannibalism. yum. but two towers isn't just viscerally grim: it also delves the most into addiction subtext. andy serkis' sublime, show-stealing work conveying the schizophrenic eager puppy dog and warped spitefulness of gollum (including frodo's tearful plea regarding why he has to believe gollum can be saved) and rohirrim king theoden (proud, powerful bernard hill) withering at the hands of the seedy wormtongue (the sickeningly perfect brad dourif) allow for quieter, moving moments of pathos amidst the more grandiose macro conflicts. it's also easily the most political, with the ents vs. isengard vignette proudly hammering (ha) tolkien's anti- industrialization theme, while treebeard's entmoot conference is a deliciously sly parody of the slowness and inefficiency of bureaucracy in crisis situations, especially when intercut with the ferocious battle of helm's deep. meanwhile, the rohan refugee crisis has a distressingly topical political urgency of its own, keeping a human face on the devastation of sauron and saruman's machinations. that said, this is still the same movie where viggo mortensen makes out with a horse. astutely aware of the heaviness at play, jackson mines for comedy respites whenever he can, with many thanks to john rhys-davies' 'gimli the comic relief dwarf', while dominic monaghan and billy boyd may as well be playing harold and kumar given merry and pippin's glut of pipe weed gags. it's a testament to all their exemplary work that their characters still integrate loveably rather than feeling gratuitous. similarly, the fight scenes are as exhilarating as can be, with the warg fight and ents releasing the river each invoking cathartic roars of joy, while the rain-drenched battle of helm's deep is a classic setpiece of vintage war tension (the opening gandalf/balrog plummeting fight is also fun, but a weirdly video- game-y note to open with). jackson, now faced with cross-cutting between parallel story lines, masterfully keeps track of his overwhelming deluge of story while keeping the pace ticking. while the dour whininess of the frodo/sam segments do grate over time (perhaps the resonant work by elijah wood and sean astin conveys suffering too well), the addition of gollum and, later, faramir (the subtly magnetic david wenham) keep the dynamic interesting. the new cast all shine in their respective moments, including miranda otto's feisty, lovestruck eowyn, and karl urban's bold eomer, while ian mckellen finds interesting notes of metaphysical remove to play as the resurrected gandalf, and viggo mortensen makes every beat of his hero's journey achingly, inspiringly empathetic. all the while, middle earth is as sumptuously gorgeous as ever (a panoramic shot of rohan framed by the mountains with howard shore's soulful single violin theme in the background is arguably one of the most beautiful in the trilogy), while the cgi remains seamlessly magnificent (treebeard in particular is a gloriously detailed creation, each notch of bark and creak of movement stunningly realized, while the ringwraith's 'winged beasts' are also fearfully entertaining creatures). then comes the final payoff: a montage of triumphant victory between helm's deep and the conscientiously objecting ents turned isengard-flooding activists, coupled with a show-stopping, tearjerking speech about ""stories that really matter"" speech by sean astin. it's a long time coming, and the film's middle lags in anticipation of it, but dear god is it worth the wait - an inspiring triple-whammy that brings the house down more than almost any other moment in the trilogy. all of the immaculate, dazzlingly intricate visuals, blood-pumping combat and moving characters aside, it's these moments that really sell the soaring, larger-than-life, transcendent emotionality of the franchise. and this is why, black sheep or not, the lord of the rings: the two towers remains classic movie magic, and one of the most essential, incompatible films of all time. -10/10";8 February 2016;10;['lotr', 'twin', 'rough', 'gratifying', 'heavy', 'major', 'black', 'fair', 'much', 'subtle', 'clever', 'indispensable', 'joyful', 'utopian', 'worth', 'triumphant', 'tricky', 'dark', 'full', 'middle', 'crucial', 'dark', 'barren', 'most', 'helpless', 'grim', 'most', 'sublime', 'schizophrenic', 'eager', 'puppy', 'warped', 'tearful', 'theoden', 'proud', 'powerful', 'seedy', 'perfect', 'brad', 'grandiose', 'macro', 'political', 'ferocious', 'deep', 'topical', 'political', 'own', 'human', 'same', 'aware', 'many', 'gimli', 'comic', 'dominic', 'exemplary', 'gratuitous', 'exhilarating', 'cathartic', 'deep', 'classic', 'vintage', 'gandalf', 'fun', 'parallel', 'overwhelming', 'resonant', 'magnetic', 'dynamic', 'interesting', 'new', 'respective', 'lovestruck', 'bold', 'interesting', 'metaphysical', 'resurrected', 'empathetic', 'middle', 'gorgeous', 'panoramic', 'soulful', 'single', 'beautiful', 'magnificent', 'particular', 'detailed', 'winged', 'entertaining', 'final', 'triumphant', 'deep', 'long', 'middle', 'dear', 'worth', 'triple', 'other', 'intricate', 'large', 'transcendent', 'black', 'classic', 'essential', 'incompatible'];0.1819681002058051

129;fernandoschiavi;"a year after the release of the fellowship of the ring, all moviegoers were more than eager to continue the first masterpiece of the xxi century. the two towers comes with the huge responsibility of maintaining the fascination left by the first movie, introduce more characters and various others having to be even grander. and he does this goal perfectly. battles unthinkable, many new important events happening, new characters emerge, and even better effects finalized and dramas more pronounced, are just some of what the two towers has to offer. in the two towers, the journey continues to seek the destruction of the one ring. since the outline of the scripts, peter jackson knew that adjustments would be interconnected but would own souls. the two towers is not exactly a sequel, but the second chapter in the saga of the ring. the main difference we noticed right away when compared to the company, is the tone of the narrative. the first contained dark environments of middle-earth, but was predominantly magical, charming and fantastic weather. this is due to a specific reason: it was necessary to introduce the spectator races of beings that inhabit the world created by tokien, being required to show their worlds that have nothing to dark as the shire and rivendell. from gloomy just quick passage in the prancing pony inn and of course the long sequences in the mines of moira. however, the story is not as dark and the main concern is to tell the origin of the ring, to make clear the importance of its destruction, and setting the villains and heroes in the public mind, especially the uninitiated in the original work. unlike the first in which all of the company are together and will slowly separating, in the two towers director peter jackson wisely alternates between the three parallel stories in completely opposite places in the geography of middle-earth. still, changes of pace and scenery are beneficial contributing to the advancement of events. amid the three stories, we enjoying new characters, scenarios filled with visually stunning scenes. the movie starts directly in chapter two of the book since the first chapter of the two towers became the last of the fellowship of the ring to the first end with a climax better resolved in the script. aragorn, gimli and legolas go after the hobbits merry and pippin, who had been captured by orcs, and is meeting with eomer, the third marshal of rohan and nephew of theoden, king of rohan. eomer gives them horses and says that a group of rohirrim had attacked and destroyed that group of orcs two days before, and had not found any hobbit among them. certainly this second chapter is less detailed and faithful in the fellowship of the ring. the main changes are in the final stages of the book, but the criticisms lose some strength as some missing parts were filmed, but inserted in the next movie. in the two towers, despite the good progress the issue to join in an interesting three parallel stories (merry and pippin with the ents, aragorn, legolas, gimli and gandalf in rohan; frodo, sam and gollum toward mordor). some important parts of the book are missing for insertion into the return of the king for the sake of pace, high duration and other factors, these choices director peter jackson and editor michael horton are fully justifiable. peter jackson performs over exuberant work. the battle scenes are epic and a pleasure for the eyes. the director uses open shots to show the scale of the epic battle at helm's deep, but gives close ups and shows creative camera movements to further enhance the scenes. the momentum built from preparing for battle works fine. it is noticeable tension, hopelessness in the eyes of citizens not warriors, mostly women and children. a desperate struggle for life chances seemingly against thousands of enemies, which is modified until the arrival of gandalf and its reinforcement of troops. the scene of gandalf leading warriors gorge below toward the enemy carried out with slow motion is one of the most dazzling film of recent times. the talented director can be seen also at the bottom where the ents help fight the orcs of isengard srauman in, so as the scene of the marshes and developing the relationship of sam, frodo and gollum. the two towers fortunately surpasses the legend that the sequence never surpasses the original, staying here at the same level. the film appealed to critics and audiences, grossing over $ 920 million worldwide, with $ 341 million in the u.s. alone. some complained that the fellowship of the ring had no end, but jackson was right to leave boromir's death to the end increasing the emotional side. it would be very strange, a year later, the opening scene is the death that hung from the previous film. at the same time, jackson gives interim order in this second part, knowing leave everything open for the grand conclusion of the saga in the next chapter. the two towers is one of the great films with content and technical working together perfectly, and it serves not only to prepare for the final chapter of the series. it is a film that has a lot to tell and is a key part of the plot which will conclude in return of the king.";11 March 2015;9;['more', 'eager', 'first', 'huge', 'first', 'more', 'various', 'unthinkable', 'many', 'new', 'important', 'new', 'well', 'second', 'main', 'first', 'dark', 'middle', 'magical', 'charming', 'fantastic', 'due', 'specific', 'necessary', 'gloomy', 'quick', 'pony', 'long', 'dark', 'main', 'clear', 'public', 'uninitiated', 'original', 'first', 'parallel', 'opposite', 'middle', 'beneficial', 'new', 'stunning', 'first', 'last', 'first', 'aragorn', 'gimli', 'third', 'second', 'detailed', 'faithful', 'main', 'final', 'next', 'good', 'interesting', 'parallel', 'gimli', 'gandalf', 'important', 'high', 'other', 'justifiable', 'exuberant', 'epic', 'open', 'epic', 'deep', 'close', 'creative', 'noticeable', 'desperate', 'gandalf', 'slow', 'dazzling', 'recent', 'talented', 'original', 'same', 'right', 'emotional', 'strange', 'previous', 'same', 'interim', 'second', 'open', 'grand', 'next', 'great', 'technical', 'final', 'key'];0.1601509455456824
130;mstomaso;the two towers is the second book in tolkien's masterpiece trilogy of invented english mythology and the second film in peter jackson's film trilogy based on the original mid-20th century novels. the fellowship has physically disbanded, though through its bonds of purpose and friendship, remains intimately connected. two towers follows the members of the fellowship through their continuing, and increasingly dark and dangerous, adventures as they each do their part (whether accidental or intentionally) to try to save all that is good in middle earth from the power-hungry eye of sauron, lord of mordor. frodo (wood) and samwise (aston) are lead by their captive smeagol/golem (serkus) to mordor, but golem's intentions are, at best, suspicious. the ring has begun to taint frodo's mind and soul, and rage and hate make fleeting and uncharacteristic appearances in this previously innocent and light-hearted hobbit. he has already begun to recognize that he and golem have more in common than anybody would care to admit. his profound friendship with sam is very nicely portrayed in this film and is as central in the film as it is in tolkien's original work. smeagol/golem is also treated sympathetically and his ambiguity and the polarity of his personalities are key to his role as an unpredictable element. the story also introduces three major human characters- theodin (hill), eowyn (otto), and farromir - all of whom will play important parts in the fellowship's mission as the story progresses. two important, but less often present characters are also introduced grima wormtongue (dourif) and eomer (urban). as i discussed in my review of the fellowship, the casting and acting are perfect, and the new additions are no exception. andy serkus' and the animation team's golem becomes a major character in the two towers. serkus' contributions to the character are profound, and very nicely reflected in the special features for the two towers. i look forward to seeing more work from this performer and i sincerely hope that he does not go over-looked or remain type-cast. in the first film, during a valiant and successful attempt to prevent harm from coming to frodo, merry and pippin (monaghan and boyd) are carried off by saruman's army, narrowly escaping into fangorn forest when the uruk'hai party is slain by an exiled band of rohirim lead by eomer. the hobbits manage to wind up in the hands of an ent a wise old walking tree and steward of the forest, who they try to convince to join in the fight against saruman and sauron. aragorn, gimli and legolas continue their dogged attempt to rescue merry and pippin, and an old friend unexpectedly re-enters the story as several components of the fellowship come together to devise an improbable defense of the land of rohan against the overwhelming force of mordor. like the fellowship, the two towers manages to capture the essence of tolkien's story and characters while rearranging portions for better cinematic continuity and emphasizing interpretive connections which are not wholly obvious in tolkien's writing. two elements keep frodo from the brink of abject insanity sam and smeagol. smeagol's addiction to the ring allows frodo to sympathize with him in a way that only an addict can understand. sam's pure and clear-headed love for frodo offers a sane and reliable anchor. other members of the fellowship help each other in similar ways as gimli, aragorn and legolas prepare for battle and gandalf works hard to repair the damaged bonds between rohan and gondor. the darkest and most uncomfortable of the three movies, the two towers is also, in some ways, the most powerful. the themes are morality, sacrifice, friendship and, as always, the nature and just use of power. many have commented on tolkien's religious beliefs and their permeation throughout the lotr, but it is worth noting that the great scholar uses components of many different cultures and belief systems to create the world he portrays, and from a strict roman catholic perspective (tolkien's religion of choice) - there are many more blasphemies in lotr than there are catholic metaphors and symbols. in the two towers, the internal power struggle between good and evil gains momentum within the fellowship's principal protagonists. as with the fellowship, the art direction, score and soundscaping subtly add great depth to the entire experience. the story and its themes are in no way subordinated to the technical merit of the film, but its methods are still very noteworthy. golem is not an animated insertion who intrudes in every scene, but rather, a fully developed central character around whom frodo and sam's story arc revolves. the sets and landscapes, just like the fellowship before it, are immersive and in every way as sensually real as if they had been built thousands of years ago and weathered by exposure to the elements of middle earth. the battle scenes are exciting, dramatic and believable. and the special features on the special edition box set explain how all of this was accomplished with lucidity.;30 November 2007;10;['second', 'english', 'second', 'original', 'connected', 'dark', 'dangerous', 'accidental', 'good', 'middle', 'hungry', 'captive', 'good', 'suspicious', 'fleeting', 'uncharacteristic', 'innocent', 'light', 'hearted', 'more', 'common', 'profound', 'central', 'original', 'key', 'unpredictable', 'major', 'human', 'important', 'important', 'present', 'urban', 'perfect', 'new', 'major', 'profound', 'special', 'more', 'first', 'valiant', 'successful', 'fangorn', 'rohirim', 'wise', 'old', 'aragorn', 'gimli', 'dogged', 'old', 'several', 'improbable', 'overwhelming', 'well', 'cinematic', 'interpretive', 'obvious', 'abject', 'pure', 'sane', 'reliable', 'other', 'other', 'similar', 'gimli', 'aragorn', 'dark', 'uncomfortable', 'powerful', 'many', 'religious', 'worth', 'great', 'many', 'different', 'strict', 'roman', 'catholic', 'many', 'more', 'catholic', 'internal', 'good', 'evil', 'principal', 'great', 'entire', 'technical', 'noteworthy', 'central', 'immersive', 'real', 'middle', 'exciting', 'dramatic', 'believable', 'special'];0.1732840830666918
131;mentalcritic;"i've read the books in the same near-religious manner as christopher lee since i was about six years old (thank heavens for parents that take the time to teach their children literacy). so for the better part of twenty years, i have been immersed in the world of tolkien and his characters. the simple fact of the matter is that while this film takes a lot of liberties with the novel, for which it cannot honestly be blamed, it does so for the overall good of the story. the novel is often a confused tome. events in it take days and even weeks, and it feels so when reading the damned thing. in spite of being the shortest volume in the series, the two towers takes the longest time to read. partly because very little happens in it, but mostly because tolkien's habit of describing his characters a little less than the falling leaves is in full swing. even some of the most literate and knowledgeable people i've met who are reading the book for the first time find themselves flipping back and forth through the pages, trying to determine exactly who the hell this or that new character is. i also find it pretty amusing when people who cannot spell arwen's name, a name that is probably one of the simplest in the tolkien world, presume to critique the films for making more out of her romance with aragorn than is mentioned in the novels. this is actually a very good move. all we read about arwen is a few sentences (if that) in the fellowship of the ring, then maybe a chapter or two in the return of the king. the appendices explain a bit more (and numerous elements of them appear in this film), but tolkien erred in giving us no reason whatsoever to believe that aragorn would choose a seemingly docile elf-woman over a valiant human princess as his wife. the film fixes this by making arwen the strong, determined character she should always have been. now where do i begin in describing the film? my only problems with it are that there is a tad too much jump-cutting, and the visuals can sometimes give the viewer a headache during the battles. but aside from these problems, i was more than pleasantly surprised. elrond stops telling people ""you must do this, you must destroy that"", drops the almighty pretense, and questions himself as to whether he is doing the right thing by leaving middle-earth while it is in such peril. and where do i begin with gollum? we've all seen how all-digital characters can really distract from a film before, thanks to george lucas, but gollum is so well-made it is almost as if he really existed and the crew just photographed him. he gets the hook into the audience right from the get-go - he is so treacherous and bitter, but so sad and pathetic at the same time, that one fears seeing how he became what he is rather than what he might do to our heroes. treebeard and his fellow ents are little different. they look so real, and yet so unreal, that they completely sell the world of tolkien to the viewer. seeing the early stage of their battle in isengard, i fully understood the meaning of one of the sindarin themes in the score music. the english translation given in the lyrics sheet reads something like ""the forest has declared war"", and by the time the film is over, you will feel it is quite the understatement. speaking of the score music, gollum's song is enough to bring tears to the eyes. with lyrics like ""don't say i didn't try"" or ""we are lost, we can never go home"", it puts the viewer/listener in gollum's hobbit-feet and makes one feel how it is to shake on them for a while. you might want to skip the next paragraph if you don't want to ruin any surprises. at first i was a bit perplexed by the ending. the novel ends with shelob poisoing frodo and frodo being taken by orcs while sam takes the ring and makes a solemn vow to complete the quest, while the film simply ends with gollum muttering to himself about how ""she"" will take care of those nasty, tricksy little hobbitses. however, this is actually a great note to end the film on, as it leaves the audience hanging in anticipation - the literate ones anticipating how shelob will be realised, and those who haven't read the book wondering what gollum is on about now. and more than anything, the changes in expression on gollum's face as the halfling he used to be argues with the monstrous thing he is now sells the contrast between frodo's kindness and the monstrous cruelty shown to gollum by sam and the men of gondor. as the film ends, and the credits roll over gollum's song, there isn't a dry eye in the audience. to cut a long story short, skip the inferior imitations and take your children to see this film. they will be grateful in later years that there was a story/film that respected their intelligence and didn't just sit there saying ""goo-goo gaa-gaa"" for two and a half hours at them. who knows... after reading the novels and seeing these films, your children might even want to grow up to become linguists or the scientists who discover a way to do away with fossil fuel once and for all. yes, this story, and the film(s), really are that inspiring.";26 December 2002;5;['same', 'religious', 'old', 'well', 'simple', 'overall', 'confused', 'even', 'damned', 'short', 'long', 'little', 'little', 'less', 'full', 'literate', 'knowledgeable', 'first', 'new', 'amusing', 'simple', 'more', 'good', 'few', 'more', 'numerous', 'docile', 'valiant', 'human', 'strong', 'determined', 'only', 'much', 'surprised', 'almighty', 'right', 'middle', 'such', 'digital', 'treacherous', 'bitter', 'sad', 'pathetic', 'same', 'fellow', 'different', 'real', 'unreal', 'early', 'english', 'enough', 'next', 'perplexed', 'solemn', 'nasty', 'little', 'great', 'literate', 'more', 'monstrous', 'monstrous', 'dry', 'long', 'short', 'inferior', 'grateful', 'later', 'inspiring'];0.048154651470978

133;vip_ebriega;"my take: even better than the first. bigger and definitely better. no matter how excellent, breathtaking or expensive the original adaptation of j.r.r. tolkien's the lord of the rings: the fellowship of the ring was, it would seem like a dress rehearsal compared to its follow-up, the lord of the rings: the two towers. recalling the second of the original star wars trilogy the empire strikes back, the two towers is but a bridge connecting the original to the finale of tolkien's ""rings"" trilogy, the lord of the rings: the return of the king which was released the following year. although not everything is concluded here in two towers, it does have its beginning and end (and the flavorful inside at the middle). think of it as one breathtaking climax of an entire movie, and have yourself a great time. this follow-up continues, but not necessarily concludes, the events portrayed in the first film. frodo (elijah wood) and sam (sean astin) continue their quest to destroy the one ring in the fires of mordor, while two hobbits merry (dominic monaghan) and pippin (billy boyd) find allies with the ents (tree-like giants) in the dark forests. while looking for merry and pippin, much of the real story unfolds with aragorn (viggo mortensen), legolas (orlando bloom) and gimli (john rhys-davies) join forces with the rohan people to fight against an out-numbering army created by the evil saruman (christopher lee) bent to destroy middle-earth. the unforgettable battle climax (of a climax) is breathtakingly wonderful, made even more impressive by the fact that it's been made with combinations of miniatures, digital rendering, real people and other technology possibly available. but like the first film, this isn't all just technical advancements and special effects. the two towers doesn't water down tolkien's story into a big-budget blunder. the film also isn't just made for a limited audience. whether you know what's what or not about tolkien's trilogy, this movie will still be enjoyable and entertaining. once again, director peter jackson has made a movie for the audiences, not simply for a limited audience. the big-budget shows throughout the film, but it also shows that it's a great film with its storyline, characters and screen-writing. few of today's hollywood minds usually forget it, but jackson couldn't afford to commit those sidesteps. rating: ***** out of 5.";26 May 2008;10;['well', 'first', 'big', 'excellent', 'breathtaking', 'expensive', 'original', 'original', 'following', 'flavorful', 'entire', 'great', 'first', 'dominic', 'like', 'dark', 'much', 'real', 'aragorn', 'evil', 'middle', 'unforgettable', 'wonderful', 'impressive', 'digital', 'real', 'other', 'available', 'first', 'technical', 'special', 'big', 'limited', 'enjoyable', 'entertaining', 'limited', 'big', 'great', 'few'];0.2398995535714286

135;CitizenCaine;"peter jackson's the two towers successfully continues the epic saga that is the lord of the rings. the film introduces several new characters that play key roles in this film as well as the third film. theoden, eowyn, and faramir are the main ones. bernard hill, miranda otto, and david wenham are all effective in their roles, especially otto as the daughter trying to show her worth to her father and aragorn. the film also treats us to the two wonderful computer generated characters of gollum and treebeard. the film opens with a brief bit recapping the end of the first film. then in this film, the fellowship is split into three groups of characters. frodo and samwise continue their journey alone with gollum; pippin and merry are captured by the uruk-hai warriors before meeting up with treebeard; and aragorn, legolas, and gimli travel in search of pippin and merry, but end up being drawn into other adventures. the film blends these story lines for the duration of the film. as in the first film, the action, cinematography, costumes, crafts, score, sets, special effects, technical wizardry, and weaponry are all tremendous. the film culminates in the dramatization of helms deep, a tremendously exciting battle sequence. it ends with the realization that all of middle earth is now in great danger and faces perilous times, setting the stage for the third film. the film is not without its weaknesses. gandalf disappears for several stretches during the film and he was one of the main characters of the first film. the hobbits become more like instruments that serve the plot instead of characters that create it. frodo's and samwise's scenes with gollum are a little tedious at times. pippin and merry have little to do once they meet treebeard. aragorn is more of the main protagonist in this film, while legolas is just a skillful fighter and gimli more and more like comic relief. the great battle itself (it's progression, complications, and conclusion) is somewhat formulaic in retrospect. however, none of these things detracts from the enjoyment of the two towers and the spectacle that the lord of the rings has become at this point. it is still an outstanding film in every respect. there are also numerous scenes that one can perceive as modern political parallels in the film, including treebeard's decision to involve his friends. once again, as in fellowship of the ring, the film's pacing makes the long running time seem shorter than it is. the film won oscars for sound editing and visual effects. ***1/2 of 4 stars.";23 May 2004;9;['epic', 'several', 'new', 'key', 'third', 'main', 'effective', 'otto', 'worth', 'wonderful', 'treebeard', 'brief', 'first', 'alone', 'gimli', 'other', 'first', 'special', 'technical', 'tremendous', 'deep', 'exciting', 'middle', 'great', 'perilous', 'third', 'several', 'main', 'first', 'little', 'tedious', 'little', 'aragorn', 'more', 'main', 'skillful', 'gimli', 'more', 'comic', 'great', 'formulaic', 'outstanding', 'numerous', 'modern', 'political', 'long', 'short', 'visual'];0.1719209956709956

137;Stampsfightclub;frodo (wood) and sam (astin) continue their quest for mordor with the creature gollum (serkis) for company whilst the rest of the fellowship fight sauron's army. the sequel to the worldwide phenomenon the fellowship of the ring brought a record topping audience into theatres to see the continuation of j.r.r tolkien's trilogy, and this second instalment is equally terrific as its predecessor with peter jackson maintaining a sweeping styled directional approach and a stunning conceptual plot. jackson astounded many with his first release, being appreciative of the story whilst containing some of the fiercest fantasy sequences to grace our screens since george lucas' star wars, and here he arguably beats his previous release. the two towers brings out the first major battle of the series with the battle of helm's deep that reinvents the concept of war and the power the new zealander has. zack snyder's strongly choreographed battle sequences in 300 brought an altogether new concept to cgi battle sequences which, brilliant as they were, didn't have that vigour of jackson's conceptual approach. for example, these battles encoded are strongly realistic, for seeing everything as it should be. though there is heavy amount of computer input, there are by far greater approaches and efforts to make this appear as if we are right there in battle. there is so much happening from heavy marching and formations to strong battering boulders, entwined with heavy character drama and political concepts that balance this 2002 smash into consistent realism. the beginning is wildly a strong part of jackson's game. the fellowship opened us up sweetly with explaining a sombre and mystical legend with the third film opening with gollum's arrival. here we have a stunning twist that reawakens the biggest dramatic event of its predecessor that instantly grabs our attention and puts us in high anticipation as familiar faces once more grace our screens. we see frodo and sam continue their journey to mordor and the initial interplay between the pair is repetitive conceptual dialogue from the previous release but once the pair admit to being stalked does the temperature change, and what a change. andy serkis was knocked back for an oscar nomination as his character gollum is a cgi creation despite serkis' heavy input but there is no denying the presence of the englishman in this picture, winning fans with his two faced character ranking up the tension and interest. the manipulation and dark desire are beautifully intriguing. the plot is consistent, if not quite as springy as the fellowship. there is a heavy amount of politics encoded as we dive deeper into the story which gives great appreciation for the novels as jackson once more proves he was the man for the job.;22 June 2009;9;['creature', 'worldwide', 'second', 'terrific', 'sweeping', 'directional', 'stunning', 'conceptual', 'many', 'first', 'appreciative', 'fierce', 'previous', 'first', 'major', 'deep', 'new', 'new', 'brilliant', 'conceptual', 'realistic', 'heavy', 'great', 'heavy', 'strong', 'heavy', 'political', 'consistent', 'strong', 'sombre', 'mystical', 'third', 'stunning', 'big', 'dramatic', 'high', 'familiar', 'more', 'initial', 'repetitive', 'conceptual', 'previous', 'oscar', 'heavy', 'faced', 'dark', 'intriguing', 'consistent', 'springy', 'heavy', 'great', 'more'];0.1701767676767676

140;stamper;"i must start by saying, that at the end of this review you will get two ratings from me. one for the first time i saw the film (december 19th) and a second one for the second time i saw it (january 12th). i watch films like this (and star wars films) two times in the cinema, because i feel that i am too overwhelmed by the visuals at the first time to really capture the whole film. another reason, why i do not enjoy the lord of the rings as much at my first view, is that i've read the books. this means that i (while watching the film) start wondering how they've done this and that and ask myself: 'what came next?'. this of course prevents me from 'getting deep into' the film, but unlike other films it does not totally spoil my viewing experience. the fellowship of the ring and the two towers (together with a limited number of other films) are the only ones, that can make me shed a tear, even when i'm not that able to plunge 'into' the story. after the big success and the quality adaption, that the fellowship of the ring was, the expectations for the two towers were enormous. not only for the general public, but for me also, even despite the fact that i thought that the two towers was the 'worst' book of the trilogy ( with the return being just a notch better than the fellowship of the ring). i obviously cannot say yet, that the two towers is my least favorite film, but what i can say, is that it was not as good as the first film. this has nothing to do with the actors (even though ian mckellen isn't as great as he was in the fellowship of the ring), the effects or the story. contrary to what some might think now it has also nothing to do with the fact that peter jackson added a few scenes,left some out and even delayed the appearance of shelob until the last film although it has something to do with the 'artistic freedom' peter jackson permitted himself in making this film. the only thing that really 'bugs' me about this film is (and i know i'm going to sound like one of those idiotic tolkien freaks) that it did not quite grasp the essence of the book, of the whole trilogy for that matter, for the lord of the rings is basically about frodo's quest to destroy the ring of power in the fires of mount doom and it is my opinion that this part of the story did not get enough attention throughout the film. while i was reading the book, i could fully understand frodo's difficulty with the ever heavier growing ring, that started to poison his mind and caused a lot of struggle within frodo. a struggle in which he was all by himself, for nobody knew what it was like and nobody could help him bear this ever growing burden. peter jackson (obviously) tried to bring that part of frodo's feelings onto the screen, but in my eyes he failed. the terror of the ringwraith's and the inner struggle within frodo were much better depicted in the fellowship of the ring than they were in this film despite the fact that it was an essential part of the 2nd book of the trilogy. now i know that this film has been cut (as the fellowship of the ring had been) to reach a wider audience and to earn back the big bucks that were invested in the making of this trilogy, so i can only hope that peter jackson cut essential parts out of the film instead of forgetting to forge a good second chapter of what is and could become an epic and classic trilogy on paper and on film respectively. oscars for: best art direction-set decoration and best makeup nominations for: best cinematography; best picture; best director; best writing; best effects, sound effects editing; best sound; best editing; best effects, visual effects and best costume design one ring to rule them all, one ring to find them, one ring to bring them alland in the darkness bind them. 1st view: 7,5 out of 10 2nd view: 7,5 out of 10";13 January 2003;8;['first', 'second', 'second', 'overwhelmed', 'first', 'whole', 'first', 'deep', 'other', 'limited', 'other', 'only', 'able', 'big', 'enormous', 'general', 'bad', 'well', 'least', 'favorite', 'good', 'first', 'great', 'contrary', 'few', 'out', 'last', 'artistic', 'only', 'idiotic', 'whole', 'enough', 'heavy', 'inner', 'essential', 'wide', 'big', 'essential', 'good', 'second', 'epic', 'classic', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'visual', 'good'];0.2092380952380952

157;perfectbond;even after seeing fellowship, i still haven't read the books but after just seeing two towers on the beautiful extended edition dvd i am now motivated to see the end of the trilogy before it ends its theatrical run. the story progresses nicely in this the second chapter which is in my opinion the most difficult of the three to execute. once again director jackson impressively conveyed the scope and grandeur of middle earth mostly through state of the art computer animation and special effects. speaking of that, gollum the cgi character, while a technical marvel, became extremely annoying. that's just my individual opinion. by the way, i think jar jar binks is brilliant comic relief in the phantom menace (i'm not prejudiced against cgi characters!) the acting from the cast was also spot on though frankly i don't think the material was that challenging (ie. no one deserved an oscar nomination). the costumes, props, and beautiful location photography were also uniformly excellent as befits a production of this magnitude. 8/10. i should note that i haven't seen the original theatrical cut of the film so i don't know what else besides background on the boromir (?) character was added. i look forward to the conclusion of the trilogy!;12 March 2004;7;['beautiful', 'extended', 'motivated', 'theatrical', 'second', 'difficult', 'middle', 'special', 'technical', 'annoying', 'individual', 'brilliant', 'comic', 'phantom', 'oscar', 'beautiful', 'excellent', 'original', 'theatrical'];0.2188095238095238
158;jdkraus;in the lord of the rings trilogy, the two towers was my favorite, but it is as good as the prequel. peter jackson won his major triumph again! the thing about the two towers is that, it makes everyone wondered what was going to happen, the fellowship was broken and the dark lord is winning over middle-earth. the two towers explained the path of the hobbits and the king. the film follows its prequel as did the book as frodo and sam make their way towards mount doom to destroy the ring of evil. they encounter a new creature called gollum that is bound to the ring, and claims he knows the route into mordor. is he a friend or foe? it then shifts to merry and pippin who are held captive by a band of uruk-hai. the uruk-hair get destroyed in a battle against humans, and merry and pippin flee into the forest of fangorn. there they meet the most beloved character in the lord of the rings books, treebeard, a creature that is a walking, talking tree that must gather the other trees for an inevitable battle against saruman. and lastly, there's aragorn, and his two friends gimili, a dwarf, and legolas, an elf. they follow the uruk-hai, till the damned creatures meet their miserable fate. the trio encounter a band of human riders from a country called rohan, which tell them the direction of the uruk slaughter, which leads the trio into fnagorn forest, where they meet an unexpected friend, and learn that the folk of rohan are being attacked by saruman, and must make a stand against an army of 10,000! can these three gatherers change the fate of middle-earth in the little time they have? peter jackson has proved himself of filming great battle sequences, unique special effects, a great storyline of an unforgettable tale, and moral lessons all people must learn. 5/5;6 March 2004;10;['favorite', 'good', 'prequel', 'major', 'dark', 'middle', 'prequel', 'new', 'captive', 'uruk', 'beloved', 'other', 'inevitable', 'aragorn', 'miserable', 'human', 'uruk', 'fnagorn', 'unexpected', 'middle', 'little', 'great', 'unique', 'special', 'great', 'unforgettable', 'moral'];0.1937384044526901
159;anselmdaniel;this review contains spoilers. the lord of the rings: the two towers is the sequel to the lord of the rings: the fellowship of the ring. the movie picks up where the fellowship of the ring had left off. frodo and samwise have split off from the fellowship after boromir's attempt to retrieve the one ring. aragorn, legolas, and gimli travel to the land of the rohirrim to save merry and pippin. the lord of the rings: the two towers has the dubious honor of being the middle chapter of the lord of the rings trilogy. the two towers handles this well with having satisfying stories and building the trilogy towards the last and final movie. there are many plot threads in this move that matter. the two towers focuses on the three groups that comprise the fellowship of the ring. frodo baggins and samwise gamgee continue to bear the ring towards mount doom. merry and pippin are captured by the uruk-hai to be brought before saruman. aragorn, legolas, and gimli seek to rescue the pair of hobbits captured by isengard. the story with frodo baggins and samwise have the pair traversing the to mount doom through both areas controlled by men and monsters. the pair of hobbits encounter gollum and enlist his aid in guiding them to mount doom. this trip takes the trio into beautiful locations and also serves an important purpose in frodo learning more about the realms of men and gollum. i enjoyed this plot a lot and seeing both frodo and sam persevere is motivating to watch. the encounter with faramir is also well done. the story with merry and pippin is not the strongest in this movie. merry and pippin contribute a fun side plot but do not really undergo an arc like frodo and samwise. the pair are simply freed and convince the ents to help defeat isengard. this arc is visually exciting to watch but is not that exciting narratively. the story line with aragorn, gimli, and legolas do not undergo and character changes. this story-line is the most visually impressive. the trio find a resurrected gandalf and also help the kingdom of rohan. the trio meet king theoden and worm tongue. these characters are fun to watch. the story-line focuses on the conflict between rohan and isengard. this story climaxes at helm's deep where an epic battle occurs. the battle at helm's deep is incredibly cool. this battle is a mini-movie with the way it progresses and develops. the attack by the uruk-hai is both awe-inspiring and suspenseful to watch. this battle is so fun to watch that it is worth the price of admission alone. i highly recommend watching the extended cut of the lord of the rings: the two towers. the extended cut adds more interesting details to the movie. i highly recommend watching the lords of the rings: the two towers. grade: a;17 November 2018;9;['gimli', 'dubious', 'middle', 'last', 'final', 'many', 'samwise', 'gimli', 'beautiful', 'important', 'more', 'strong', 'fun', 'exciting', 'exciting', 'aragorn', 'gimli', 'impressive', 'resurrected', 'fun', 'deep', 'epic', 'cool', 'inspiring', 'suspenseful', 'fun', 'worth', 'extended', 'extended', 'interesting'];0.33015873015873
160;Geeky Randy;"the adventure continues with two separate stories (readers of the book will notice that the stories have been sandwiched together): one with aragorn (mortensen), gimli (rhys-davies) and legolas (bloom) on the trail of orcs who have kidnapped hobbits pippin (boyd) and merry (monaghan); the other with frodo (wood) and sam (astin) making their way to mordor accompanied by troublesome guide gollum (serkis). no longer obscured by the shadows, serkis almost steals the movie when brought to the foreground. while undeniably more action-packed than fellowship (fans particularly love the intense helm's deep battle), this movie is really the start of the corny-lines and moments-of-boredom that plague the rest of peter jackson's middle-earth films. hill and otto are frustrating as the hope-driven king and princess of rohan. regardless of how disappointingly inferior it is compared to fellowship, it makes for an excellent story-bridge between its predecessor and the following return of the king. two towers is still a pleasure for treebeard (also voiced by rhys-davies) and the ents. *** (out of four)";1 December 2014;7;['separate', 'aragorn', 'gimli', 'other', 'troublesome', 'more', 'intense', 'deep', 'middle', 'frustrating', 'inferior', 'excellent', 'treebeard'];0.1678571428571428

162;TheOtherFool;in my comment on 'the fellowship of the ring' i made the mistake of stating i had not written any of the tolkien books. although not untrue, obviously what i meant to say was that i hadn't read any of them. and with this i again like to begin my commentary, as to make clear i value 'the two towers' as a movie, not as the filming of a book. the fellowship of 9 from part 1 are reduced to 7... uhm 8 and split up: sam and frodo keep on carrying the ring to mordor, pip and merry are captured by some mean looking orks and the man, midget and elf trio are following these orks to rescue the two hobbits. gandalf meanwhile takes a part as well, as he's 'reborn' even stronger and mightier than before. talk about your deus ex machina... if 'fellowship' was rather boring and one-directed (with events just happening over and over again until the three hours were full), 'two towers' is more intense but also more unclear and messy than that. it is darker than part one, but is introducing way to many characters that doesn't really matter for the continuing of the story. if part one had that problem, part two is taking it to new heights. worst part are the dream sequences with liv tyler... what was that all about? too long, boring and unimportant. bad film-making. one of the main treats of two towers should be gollum, or smeagol (why not give every character 2 names so nobody understands it anymore). gollum wants the ring frodo carries, but finds himself loyal to his master as well. now this could be interesting. too bad nothing is really happening with this conflict, except the endless and countless monologues of gollum... a missed chance. the end battle should cover up for everything, but it's more silly and slapstick kinda funny than intense (dwarf-tossing...). and of course it had to end with the second deus ex machina scene by gandalf. on the other side of middle earth though things get even wackier, with silly looking trees (did they run out of budget?) attacking the tower of saruman. watch out for the flooding scene... it has b-movie written all over it. although i can understand why these movies are appealing to some (in particular the ones who love the tolkien books), there is no way you can say the two towers is one of the best movies ever. there are so many moments the tension drops, so many silly hold-ups, a cast (although trying) undermined by the cgi. in a way, two towers is more compelling than fellowship, but on the whole it doesn't even live up to it's very mediocre prequel. let's just hope for the best for return of the king. 5/10.;4 August 2004;5;['untrue', 'clear', 'mean', 'reborn', 'strong', 'mighty', 'boring', 'full', 'intense', 'unclear', 'messy', 'dark', 'many', 'new', 'bad', 'long', 'boring', 'unimportant', 'bad', 'main', 'loyal', 'interesting', 'bad', 'endless', 'countless', 'silly', 'slapstick', 'funny', 'intense', 'second', 'other', 'middle', 'wacky', 'silly', 'particular', 'good', 'many', 'many', 'silly', 'compelling', 'mediocre', 'prequel', 'good'];-0.0138456937799043
163;tomimt;the two towers continues almost straight from where fellowship ended: the companions are scattered, frodo (elijah wood) and sam (sean astin) are going towards mordor, aragorn (viggo mortensen), gimli (john rhys-davies) and legolas (orlando bloom) are hunting down the orcs who captured merry (dominic monaghan) and pippin (billy boyd). i was amazed by the special effects of the fellowship and was in false impression, that there wouldn't be anything as stunning in the two towers. i was gravely mistaken. in the first moments of the film we are shown, because introduced would be wrong word, as we did see a glimpse of him in the fellowship, gollum, voiced by andy serkis, a fully computer generated character, who is as believable as the rest of the cast. small skirmishes of the fellowship turn into a full scale siege war in the two towers, when orc army of saruman attacks towards rohan, a land of brave horseback warriors, led by king theoden (bernard hill), who is mislead by his councillor wormtongue (chilling brad dourif), while his niece eowyn (miranda otto) tries her best to make her uncle to see the truth. theatrical version of the two towers always felt a bit fast for my taste, everything happened too quickly and there was always something missing. all this was fixed beautifully in the extended edition and fast pacing of the film was toned down, which in my opinion led in more enjoyable experience. i personally enjoyed all of the extended and added ent sequences. also ee introduces us one new character, denethor (john noble), father of faramir (david fenham) and boromir (sean bean). the battle of helms deep is dominating part of the movie, as it was in the books. fall of isengard, home of saruman, is shown as tolkien described it in the book: fast and neat. peter jackson and his companions have taken more liberties with some aspects of the story, adding in scenes, attack of the warg riders, that weren't in the book, or adding new aspects, like elves coming to help defend helms deep. some of these scenes were good, some of them weren't very original, but over all they none of them were extremely disappointing either. overall the experience leaves you hungry for more, as there is no real ending in the film, which was rather bold move. it all just shows, that the two towers is just a middle part of a longer story.;22 May 2005;10;['aragorn', 'gimli', 'dominic', 'amazed', 'special', 'false', 'stunning', 'mistaken', 'first', 'wrong', 'believable', 'small', 'full', 'brave', 'chilling', 'brad', 'good', 'theatrical', 'extended', 'fast', 'enjoyable', 'extended', 'new', 'neat', 'more', 'new', 'deep', 'good', 'original', 'disappointing', 'hungry', 'more', 'real', 'bold', 'middle', 'long'];0.1881948051948051
164;alindsayal;so next on my list of films to watch is the lord of the rings: the two towers and here is my review for it. the premise of the film sees frodo and sam get closer to mordor with the help of gollum, while the rest of the fellowship must stand against saruman and his huge army. main character viggo mortenson really shines in this film, he is given more to do and really gets given the shine and he is a great lead protagonist. you see how his character has taken up more of a leadership role in this film and his part of the film is great and interesting. he nails the action scenes and it makes aragorn really stand out and shine in this film, he develops well and he gives a really great performance here. elijah wood is still good as frodo, he maybe is in the shadow of mortenson a bit in this film but he still stands out. you see how the ring is really affecting frodo, more then the first film and the introduction of gollum really enhances his character and makes him more interesting then he was in fellowship of the ring. supporting characters onto the show stealer of the film and that is andy serkis as gollum, this character is fascinating and a really ground-breaking character. this performance really changed the game, it really is iconic and gollum was such a great addition to the frodo & sam story making it a much more interesting plot point. lets face it without gollum, you wouldn't have the brilliant motion capture performances that you get now, so real credit to peter jackson & andy serkis for taking the risk and knocking it out of the park. orlando bloom & john rhys davies as legolas and gimli are given much more to do in this film and they are fantastic and add some nice comic relief here that never feels out of place. the friendship between legolas, gimli and aragorn is one of the best parts of the film and really sells the relationship, and feels like a natural progression from the first film. sir ian mckellen is back as gandalf the white this time and he does a great job, he isn't in this film as much but when he is on screen he is awesome and nails this change of character. sean astin, christopher lee, bernard hill, billy boyd & dominic monaghan are great in there roles and prove that these lord of the rings casts are probably the greatest of all time. story the story is bigger and larger in the two towers and it does work, there are three story arcs going on, aragorn, legolas and gimli's, frodo, sam & gollum's & merry, pippin & treebeard and they are interesting. the aragorn plot gets the most screen time and it adds a new dynamic to middle earth and these films and make them feel larger then the previous film, even the merry & pippin stuff, though slower is good to watch and has a great conclusion to it which makes it worth it. the three stories work really well as they all feel a bit different and add something to the film in their own ways leading to the battle of helms deep which is possibly the greatest battle in film history. script the script is great, it has the right balance of drama and humour and it just does a great job of making these characters feel unique and interesting. this film does have a darker feeling and tone then the previous film and it shows but it knows where to find the times to lighten the mood without going against its overall feeling and it does a great job. style the style of the film is fantastic and raises the stakes. the action scenes are bigger and better, bloom & mortenson in particular standout with some great action scenes, leading as i said above to one of the greatest battles of all time that feels epic in nature but very real due to great stunts and great fight scenes. the film has great cgi and motion cap work, whether it be gollum or treebeard it looks great and gollum in particular changes the game and allowed characters like caesar, the hulk & thanos to exist in the future and this was his start. the film is 3 hours long but never drags, the stories are balanced really well and keep you interested throughout and expand on the films really well. overall overall, just like its predecessor this is one of the greatest films ever made and is a must watch. one of the greatest second films in a franchise ever and raises the stakes in a great way and sets up the final film in the most grand way possible. rating -

169;griffolyon12;there is something special about the two towers that makes it more enjoyable than the other two parts of the trilogy. that is not to say that the other two films are inferior in any way, i just am simply more entertained by this one than the others and this is a large part to due with the battle of helms deep. the battle of helms deep is simply one of the finest battle sequences ever in movie history. though not only is the battle exquisitely crafted, but thanks to peter jackson's wonderful direction, he makes us feel for the heroes and makes you want to continuously jump up and cheer each time aragorn mows down a row of orcs, or legolas rides a shield down a flight of stairs, pummeling enemies with his arrows on the way down. still the battle is not the only thing that makes this film more enjoyable. i felt for these characters more so in this film than any of the others. part of that is because this film puts more focus on the characters and who they are than either of the other two films. in the first one it was all about exposition, the third one it was all about drawing it all to a close, but this one was all about getting to know the characters better so that by the time we reach the third film we are so emotionally attached that we could not bear to see any of them pass. overall two towers is a terrific film and is easily one of my more favorite movies of all-time. i give the two towers a perfect 10 out of 10!;14 March 2009;10;['special', 'enjoyable', 'other', 'other', 'inferior', 'large', 'due', 'deep', 'fine', 'wonderful', 'aragorn', 'only', 'enjoyable', 'more', 'other', 'first', 'third', 'third', 'terrific', 'favorite', 'perfect'];0.2493734335839599
170;movieguy1021;"ho hum. in peter jackson's second movie of the three books, frodo baggins (elijah wood) is trying to deliever the ring of power to the fire in middle earth, since that is where it was created, that is where it can be destroyed. along with him is his friend samwise (sean astin), who refers to his friend as ""mr. frodo"". something about that strikes me as just weird. the other members of the broken fellowship (how did they break up? i don't remember, i saw the first one a year ago and i'm not an avid fan) seem to be trying to tag along. aragorn (viggo mortensen), a human, legolas (orlando bloom), an elf, and gimli (john rhys-davies), a dwarf, try to trace the trail of frodo and sam. two more hobbits, pippin (billy boyd) and merry (dominic monaghan) get lost and are aided by talking and walking trees (!). confused yet? the one-minute-shy-of-three-hours runtime seems somewhat padded, maybe so it can keep up its reputation. jackson tried to stay faithful to the book, but kept too close. for the record, i have not read any of the books. if everything about pippin and merry had been taken out, it would have been easier to tolerate. to improve, they needed a more over-the-top climactic fight scene. in the first one it was the mines of morea (sp?). this time it's helm's deep. with thousands of fighters, it's pure fun right? wrong. it goes on for way too long, and after a while, it becomes, dare i say, boring? the first hour or so was fine, fun, and enjoyable. in the second hour, when characters came in and out and jackson expected us to know everyone from the book, it drags a little. the third hour is just pure chaos, with not real rhyme to the reason. it also seemed like everyone who died came back to life. i know this is a magical world, but come on! after falling off a cliff? gimme a break. all of the acting was fine (astin's may have been best), but i still don't know who a lot of the characters were. added to the mix is a computer animated character named gollum, who sounds (and looks) a lot like dobby from harry potter and the chamber of secrets. he was once a hobbit, but came under the spell of the ring, and he's dying to get his hands on it. so he helps out frodo and sam to get to where they need to go. oh yeah, he also has split personality for a bit of comic relief. the cinematography seemed to either be long, wide, sweeping and beautiful shots or grotesque close-ups of gollum or rotted faces of orcs. not exactly a pretty picture. the two towers doesn't have anything to do with the title (unless, of course, it was mentioned when i was in the bathroom). it's mainly a continuation of the first film, a transition between numbers one and three. and what was with aragorn's dream type things? maybe i should read the books. the two towers is entertaining but deeply flawed by its meaningless plot and boring fights. its visuals are stunning, but little else in the movie is. my rating: 5/10 rated pg-13 for epic battle sequences and scary images.";20 December 2002;5;['second', 'middle', 'weird', 'other', 'broken', 'first', 'avid', 'aragorn', 'human', 'gimli', 'more', 'dominic', 'shy', 'padded', 'faithful', 'close', 'easy', 'top', 'climactic', 'first', 'deep', 'pure', 'wrong', 'first', 'fine', 'fun', 'enjoyable', 'second', 'little', 'third', 'pure', 'real', 'magical', 'fine', 'good', 'comic', 'long', 'wide', 'sweeping', 'beautiful', 'close', 'rotted', 'pretty', 'first', 'entertaining', 'flawed', 'meaningless', 'boring', 'stunning', 'little', 'epic', 'scary'];0.0876887340301974

174;Aylmer;"peter jackson's films worked best when they didn't take themselves seriously at all (as in the case of braindead or meet the feebles). his trilogy so far is indeed very well shot and edited (though each film so far could easily afford to cut at least an hour away), but the big mistake here is that the films keep wavering back and forth from silly stuff to graveyard stoicism. the battle scenes are overinflated cgi extravaganzas with lots to look at but nothing really interesting. i kept thinking of the film waterloo (the 1970 sergei bondarchuk version) and realized that the battle scenes in that 33-year-old film were actually better-filmed, more believable, and more enjoyable than here, where everything is fake - and definitely looks it. the music is unmemorable, as are the bland actors (except for the underused brad dourif and christopher lee of course, but these days the real talent is slowly getting replaced by the likes of ""viggo mortensen"" and ""liv tyler"") - but i digress. i'm not gonna stand on a soap box all night and rant about how silly this movie is and how the tolkien and ad&d fans (and i used to be one myself) will eat up every minute of this. however, i have to point out that it runs far too long, and the action sequences seem to just come and go without adding to the story in the least, just filler. basically, all the characters are in the same situation at the end that they were at the beginning of the film... the whole movie is filler. i actually preferred the animated 1978 bakshi version, in that it was much better paced and felt more stylized and less like a big cash cow. it's too bad that bakshi never was able to finish his film, but then again he had about the same budget to make his film that the lotr trilogy spent on wigs. that film actually had heart. in spite of the fact it was merely made to cash in on all the nerd-money not yet spent on computer games and ""warhammer 40k"" pewter models, this film will probably sweep the oscars... which in my opinion is truly sad, considering there were probably thousands of better movies made this year - but so few were widely seen.";24 January 2003;5;['least', 'big', 'silly', 'interesting', 'old', 'believable', 'enjoyable', 'fake', 'unmemorable', 'bland', 'underused', 'real', 'silly', 'long', 'least', 'same', 'whole', 'less', 'big', 'bad', 'able', 'same', 'sad', 'well', 'few'];-0.0873015873015873

178;johnnymonsarrat;"lord of the rings: the two towers is very much like the first film, ""lord of the rings: the fellowship of the ring"". it is a little less personal, because the danger much of the time involves huge groups of people and a war, rather than individuals. additionally, some of the personal interactions and dramas (thorien, the ents, the humans of rodan) didn't come across as powerfully as in the first film. and there was perhaps a bit too much plot crammed in. for all these reasons, i think i prefer the first film over the second. least impressive were the ents, the tree creatures, who seemed a little like comic relief rather than real creatures. most impressive was gollum, the best animated character we've seen yet in movies, and who is used stunningly for dramatic effect, unlike his predecessors (jar-jar binks in star wars i and jurassic park's dinosaurs) who were eye candy with no depth. despite being a die-hard lotr fan, i did find the endless war scenes a little long and repetitive. during one scene, there are two cute kids who are supposed to be frightened to death. but one child actor (the boy) is sort of smiling impassively rather frightened, yet the camera lingers on him. why? i think those are the director's kids. all summed up, this is a must-see. if you're only going to see one fantasy film in your life, this series is the one. a warning, though -- it is very long, so be ready for that. who should see this film: -- everyone (but not tiny children), a must-see -- nasty little hobbitses i'll give lotr ii a well-earned 10 out of 10.";22 December 2002;10;['first', 'little', 'personal', 'much', 'huge', 'personal', 'first', 'much', 'first', 'second', 'least', 'impressive', 'little', 'comic', 'real', 'impressive', 'dramatic', 'die', 'hard', 'endless', 'little', 'long', 'repetitive', 'cute', 'frightened', 'frightened', 'long', 'ready', 'tiny', 'nasty', 'little'];0.034
179;dragokin;the two towers is where the lord of the rings trilogy reared its head. the excitement about the first movie wore off a bit due to a year's wait until the release of the second installment. it was still romantic and epic, as you would expect as a proper movie based on j.r.r. tolkin's book. however, there were elements of a regular hollywood blockbuster which would eventually get hold of the third movie. the battles are becoming larger, the special effects grander, yet they were still well balances with superior plot in order to capture my attention. the merit for latter goes to tolkin, though, not to writers who managed not to get carried away. in the two towers we were still in a magical world with some dark changes. the characters are multi-layered and are developing as the dark menace of mordor is slowly unraveled. there were some twists and surprises, but also we knew that there was one more movie to go until the ending.;19 May 2013;7;['first', 'due', 'second', 'romantic', 'epic', 'proper', 'regular', 'third', 'large', 'special', 'superior', 'latter', 'magical', 'dark', 'multi', 'layered', 'dark', 'more'];0.1372767857142857
180;ronakkotian;out of all of the lotr films, this one is definitely the weakest but it still holds up as an amazing continuation from where the first film left off. the lord of the rings: the two towers continues the story with frodo and sam getting closer to mordor with the aid of gollum whilst the rest of the fellowship go up against saruman and his army. the two towers really steps it up from the fellowship of the ring in terms of scale. once again, this film looks absolutely stunning. peter jackson's direction is terrific. so many gorgeous shots conveying the beauty of middle-earth and constantly reminding you how epic it is. i view the two towers as more of a build up film. it sets a lot of things in motion for the events that will take place in the third film. due to that, the film does feel slower than the first but not a single minute feels wasted. it is three hours long but jackson manages to keep the viewer engaged throughout it with the characters and scale of the world. a lovely addition to this film is gollum, who we got a glimpse of in the first film. the motion capture work on gollum is really well done and andy serkis's performance helps the viewer feel connected to him. by far the best part of the two towers is the ending. the battle at the end is simply breathtaking. it's shot beautifully and the sheer scope of it all makes it one of the best battles in film history. hats off to the special effects team. they worked extremely hard and it all paid off in the end. the performances are great all around. elijah wood, ian mckellan, sean astin, viggo mortenson and the rest of the cast from the previous film all did well. the new additions like bernard hill and brad douris played their roles exceptionally well and contributed a lot to this film. i like the fellowship of the ring better but the two towers continued the lotr story brilliantly. peter jackson did complete justice here and delivered to us one of the best battle sequences to ever exist.;30 July 2020;10;['weak', 'amazing', 'first', 'close', 'stunning', 'terrific', 'many', 'gorgeous', 'middle', 'epic', 'more', 'third', 'slow', 'first', 'single', 'long', 'lovely', 'first', 'good', 'breathtaking', 'sheer', 'good', 'special', 'great', 'previous', 'new', 'good'];0.291554279054279

191;dfle3;"of the ""lord of the rings"" trilogy, adapted from the famous book(s) by j.r.r. tolkien (which i haven't read), this second installment is my favourite. it should have been the one to sweep the academy awards, as the last chapter in the trilogy did. maybe i'm a cynic, but i get the feeling that the academy jumped on the juggernaut/band-wagon for the final episode. the main reason i liked this movie so much was for the engrossing war scenes. it's one of the few films where there are countless thousands of soldiers fighting yet is nevertheless fascinating. notable failures in this respect include one of the early star wars prequels (hey, apart from the third installment of that prequel trilogy, they're all pretty forgettable). in that movie, countless thousands of computer generated soldiers fighting each other was just mind-numbingly boring. as was the giant brawl between hundreds of apes in one of the sequels to the ""planet of the apes"" series. in ""two towers"" you get one things those failures didn't have...military strategy. tension is built up by seeing military tactics and equipment deployed. it's just not one humongous but mindless fight scene. the best example of that is when one of the castles is besieged and attacked. in any case, this if a fine trilogy. watch it from start to finish. it's just the second chapter that i'd give 5 stars too, though.";4 July 2008;10;['famous', 'second', 'favourite', 'last', 'cynic', 'final', 'main', 'few', 'countless', 'fascinating', 'notable', 'early', 'third', 'prequel', 'forgettable', 'countless', 'other', 'boring', 'giant', 'military', 'military', 'humongous', 'mindless', 'good', 'fine', 'second'];0.0390151515151515

193;Al_The_Strange;"in the fellowship of the ring, the film saga of the lord of the rings was kicked-off in an endearing and faithful way. it meticulously established the groundwork for a cast of iconic heroes, settings with palpable folklore, and a grand journey that would stagger the imagination. the adventure continues in the two towers, with all the same flair and attention to detail that was established before. only now, it's a return to familiar territory, and the film uses every opportunity to expand the narrative and present an even stronger fantasy experience. picking up where the first film let off, the two towers wastes no time in tracking each character's tangent and showing what happens next. the film's opening, showing gandalf confronting the monstrous balrog, is an awe-inspiring sight as it is. then we continue to follow frodo and sam on their quest to mordor, and it is touch-and-go for them as they evade enemy forces and consort with the villainous gollum. at the same time, the film tracks aragorn, legolas, and gimli as they trek into rohan, to inevitably confront the threat of orc invasion head-on. all these plot threads build up to a magnificent climax, including the battle of helm's deep (a lengthy and awesome siege), the marching of the ents (an imaginative and inspiring sequence), and the skirmishes of osgiliath (providing the emotional climax to accentuate the action). it is a consistently engaging film with plenty of awesome spectacle. the story branches off into multiple directions with quite a lot of characters. you'd think it would be hard to keep track of everything (a complaint that made cloud atlas so inaccessible to audiences), but this film somehow manages to juggle everything perfectly, giving each tangent just enough time so that it never fades far from memory. it's easy to keep track of the characters and their movements across middle-earth, even with the addition of new characters, taut political drama, and even more folklore thrown in. the characters remain as endearing as ever, and the plot is manipulated with expert precision. tolkein purists may be quick to point out the changes from the source material, which become more numerous in this film than in its predecessor, but the basics of the story remain intact. most changes are made to accommodate the story's events across the three films in the most presentable way. while the film continues to utilize the classic epic-journey plot structure, it digs up some relevant themes concerning war, industrialization, and courage throughout. as before, the film is crafted expertly, with excellent photography and editing. acting continues to impress from the whole cast; ian mckellen, viggo mortensen, elijah wood, sean austin, dominic monaghan, billy boyd, orlando bloom, john rhyes-davies, hugo weaving, christopher lee, liv tyler, and cate blanchett all continue to inhabit their characters aptly. andy serkis steals the spotlight, while karl urban, david wenham, brad dourif, bernard hill, and miranda otto offer welcome additions to the cast. the writing is great. locales are beautiful. this production continues to use top-notch sets, props, costumes, and special effects. howard shore's music score is still impressively magnificent. the two towers is a thrilling continuation of the events laid forth in the fellowship of the ring, and it builds up to one impressive climax. it's still a great story told with great style, and with good attention to depth and detail. as strong of an experience as it is, it's still only building up to an even grander experience... the extended cut of this film includes about 45 minutes of new scenes. some of it includes extended action and battle scenes, which are cool. there's also a great flashback scene involving faramir and boromir. there are also a bunch of really neat smaller scenes, many of which adapt specific scenes from the book, or offer more to the characters. it is a really cool cut of the movie that's well worth seeing. 5/5 (entertainment: perfect <> story: perfect <> film: perfect)";5 April 2014;10;['endearing', 'faithful', 'iconic', 'palpable', 'grand', 'same', 'familiar', 'strong', 'first', 'monstrous', 'villainous', 'same', 'gimli', 'magnificent', 'deep', 'lengthy', 'awesome', 'imaginative', 'inspiring', 'emotional', 'engaging', 'awesome', 'multiple', 'hard', 'inaccessible', 'enough', 'easy', 'middle', 'new', 'political', 'more', 'endearing', 'expert', 'quick', 'numerous', 'intact', 'most', 'presentable', 'classic', 'epic', 'relevant', 'excellent', 'whole', 'dominic', 'welcome', 'great', 'beautiful', 'top', 'special', 'magnificent', 'thrilling', 'impressive', 'great', 'great', 'good', 'strong', 'extended', 'new', 'cool', 'great', 'neat', 'small', 'many', 'specific', 'more', 'cool', 'worth', 'perfect', 'perfect', 'perfect'];0.4312621286759219
194;Offworld_Colony;faceless world altering evil being stood up to my the united grieving good of the little person. when gandalf or sam or merry or faramir speaks they're speaking using tolkien's words through time and talking directly to us. undoubtedly the success of this and the other rings movies are that they are lovingly and reverently adapted by teams of indie creatives at the height of their passion and the tops of their game. however, it's enduring legacy and legendary status owes itself to the fact that the two towers had, and still has, a reason to exist in the world. it speaks to what fantasy was made for and it bolsters the human spirit and champions hope and understanding, forgiveness and love. there's a sensitivity here not usually applied to middle films in a trilogy but making the groundbreaking meld of cgi and characterisation of smeagol/gollum the central arc of the story is very smart. it gives the film thrust and purposeful connective tissue to return of the king. his arc from gollum to smeagol and to gollum again is sad, important and due to andy serkis also hilarious. it does everything a middle film should, introduces new characters, fleshes out old and builds tension to the third film. the battles are bigger but no less well crafted and every side story is a worthwhile one. the extended version is a difficult bag, all the scenes removed are extraneous certainly, but are all brilliant moments and in any other film, indispensable. boromir and faramir scenes manage to actually give more relatability to a character that's already dead and the funeral of theoden's son is incredibly sad, poignant and pertinent.;6 February 2020;10;['evil', 'little', 'other', 'indie', 'legendary', 'human', 'middle', 'groundbreaking', 'central', 'smart', 'purposeful', 'connective', 'sad', 'important', 'due', 'hilarious', 'middle', 'new', 'old', 'third', 'big', 'worthwhile', 'extended', 'difficult', 'extraneous', 'brilliant', 'other', 'indispensable', 'more', 'dead', 'sad', 'poignant'];0.0514129389129389

198;lagudafuad;the captivating thing about two towers is the fight choreography and the battle at helm's deep (which was kind of the movie's climax), it is one that you will not forget that easily and the movie is just another powerful extension of what peter jackson could do, the movie is filled with a lot more cgi (from my view) than the first, and it may not be the best of the three, but two towers delivered some powerful performances, especially from aragon (viggo mortensen), the dwarf gimli (john rhys- davies) and the elf legolas (orlando bloom). after you have watched the fellowship of the rings, you are ever so eager to see what the fellowship, (which is now broken into three groups frodo with sam, pippin with merry and aragon with legolas and gimli) will be able to achieve on their own, as part of the master plan to destroy the ring at mount doom. the interesting thing about watching this flick is that some managed victory in their own areas, giving you the viewer a delightful hope, while frodo (elijah woods) and sam (sean astin) were moving closer to their target. the movie's plot is focused mostly on the battle at helm's deep. the other fellowship members except frodo and sam and after the fall of gandalf when he battled the balrog, chased after the uruk-hai who took merry and pippin so as to rescue them. while they chased merry and pippin found an adventure of their own in the forest. the rescuers aragon, gimli and legolas found themselves in rohan and had to save the king and defend the city from an attack from saruman's forces, this defense and intense battle happened at helm's deep. the three most notable changes in the movie compared to the book that i picked up instantly are (although many other differences can be found) 1. in the book theoden is just depressed and deluded by wormtongue but in the movie he is possessed by saruman. the second is about theeoden, who didn't just run to helm's deep as the movie made it see, he actually fought at first. the last was the exclusion of shelob, who was later included in the final movie of the trilogy. not winning as much as the first, two towers won two academy awards for best visual effects and best sound editing. it was a commercial success making close to 10 times its 94 million dollars production cost. not as much of a powerful score like the fellowship of the ring the movie is a nice follow up to the first, and it served like a bridge from an excellent beginning in the trilogy (in the fellowship of the ring) to a magnificent ending (in the return of the king). you can't watch the first only without seeing this also, so get the dvd box set and enjoy. www.lagsreviews.com;6 January 2013;8;['deep', 'powerful', 'more', 'first', 'good', 'powerful', 'gimli', 'eager', 'gimli', 'able', 'own', 'interesting', 'own', 'delightful', 'deep', 'other', 'own', 'gimli', 'intense', 'deep', 'notable', 'many', 'other', 'depressed', 'second', 'deep', 'last', 'final', 'first', 'good', 'visual', 'good', 'commercial', 'much', 'powerful', 'nice', 'first', 'excellent', 'magnificent', 'first'];0.3485294117647058

204;malkane316;continuing directly on from the events of the last film, the fellowship has been destroyed and it seems the bad guys have the upper hand. gandalf is gone, boromir has been killed, and the enemy's forces are growing to vast numbers and in power. they are spreading across middle-earth destroying all people, all races who get in their way in their quest for frodo and the ring. saruman has been seduced by the evil, adding his superior skills and seeking out the remaining fellowship members. frodo and sam travel on towards mordor, followed by a mysterious creature. aragorn, gimli and legolas decide to rescue their friends pip and merry who were captured by the enemy, an ork army. things are looking bleak. the two towers, in splitting up the group becomes a more personal film for each character as we get to know them more in their individual struggles. jackso deals with the different stories brilliantly and we never get bored of watching one group too much. there is always something new happening, a new character, a new threat or battle, and we feel part of the proceedings. again the attention to detail is breathtaking, and the acting is just as good from both the old and new characters. we meet faramir, brother of boromir who also seeks the ring as he wants to please his father and save his own city, misguidedly. we meet gollum, once smeagol a creature corrupted and transformed over the years by the ring. he wants it, believing it is his and his alone, and promises to be sam and frodo's guide into mordor, along secret paths. meanwhile aragorn, legolas and gimli get an army together to protect the residents of rohan in a massive battle against the evil forces of sauran. the enemy is marching towards gondor to destroy the worlds of man forever, and the good guys must fight for the two towers between mordor and isenguard. merry and pip meet the ents, an ancient race of tree like creatures with immense power but slow pace. they set out to stop saruman. it is this film which heightens the emotional impact of the series. we learn more of aragorn's past, and his tragic romance with arwen who must decide between her immortality or her love. the banter between gimli and legolas continues, frodo and sam begin to drift apart because of the traitorous gollum, but not all is lost...theoden has been saved by an old friend an uses his old courage to rally his troops to victory, his strong-willed daughter eowyn taking an interest in aragorn. we learn of faramir's life which will be important in the next film. again the effects are superb, and the battle scenes are probably the most epic and sweeping yet. they are all only there though to give frodo and sam a slight chance of making it to mordor. another truly stunning feat by all involved. 10 out of 10;12 April 2005;10;['last', 'bad', 'upper', 'vast', 'middle', 'superior', 'mysterious', 'aragorn', 'gimli', 'pip', 'bleak', 'personal', 'individual', 'jackso', 'different', 'bored', 'new', 'new', 'new', 'good', 'old', 'new', 'own', 'alone', 'secret', 'aragorn', 'gimli', 'massive', 'evil', 'good', 'ancient', 'immense', 'slow', 'emotional', 'more', 'tragic', 'gimli', 'traitorous', 'theoden', 'old', 'old', 'strong', 'willed', 'important', 'next', 'superb', 'epic', 'sweeping', 'slight', 'stunning'];0.0449221949221949

207;rooee;"chris cooper's performance in 2002's adaptation was skillful and memorable, but the academy award for actor in a supporting role should surely have gone to andy serkis for his performance as gollum in the second part of peter jackson's seminal movie trilogy. the two towers (correctly) received the visual effects gong, but the academy may have missed a trick - we couldn't have felt pity for poor smeagol without the englishman's dazzling talent. the two towers is the heart of the story in jackson's (and fran walsh's, philippa boyens', and steven sinclair's) take on the tale. the book has been seriously and necessarily rejigged to suit the demands of the classical narrative. the battle of helm's deep, for instance, has been promoted beyond what was essentially a precursor to the final battle to something more immense: a grand, emotionally-driven climactic battle which represents arguably the best single action encounter of the trilogy. but this last stand would be nothing were it not for the quality of the drama that precedes it. the fellowship of the ring set the scene; the return of the king tore the scene to shreds on an awe-inspiring scale. the two towers, meanwhile, sows the seeds that will bloom into the enthralling narrative conflicts concluded in its sequel, as well as containing numerous character arcs of its own. the reluctant feud begins between boromir (sean bean) and faramir (david wenham) for the love of their father, denethor (john noble); the adversity between nature and industry, represented by the mighty ents and the tyrant saruman (christopher lee), comes full circle; grima wormtongue's (a particularly superb brad dourif) fleeting power over the troubled king theoden (bernard hill) and his adopted son, eomer (karl urban) is a wicked war waged by an opportunist weakling. and i haven't even mentioned the surviving members of the fellowship... pleasingly, jackson et al continue their exploration of arwen (liv tyler), as well as introducing another prominent female character. miranda otto's eowyn is spiky and obstinate, and yet hauntingly bereft; a pale ghost wandering the prison of her uncle (theoden). she's the most interesting female character in the series by far, deservingly foregrounded for the latter two movies. epic, exciting, heartfelt, and frightening - this is a brilliant hub for the trilogy.";12 April 2010;8;['skillful', 'memorable', 'second', 'seminal', 'visual', 'poor', 'dazzling', 'fran', 'classical', 'deep', 'final', 'immense', 'grand', 'climactic', 'good', 'single', 'last', 'enthralling', 'narrative', 'numerous', 'own', 'reluctant', 'mighty', 'full', 'superb', 'brad', 'fleeting', 'troubled', 'adopted', 'wicked', 'prominent', 'female', 'bereft', 'pale', 'interesting', 'female', 'latter', 'epic', 'exciting', 'heartfelt', 'frightening', 'brilliant'];0.1806190476190476
208;TheCorniestLemur;"the thing about reviewing these films so close to each other is that you kind of don't have anything to say after the first one, because they all feel so connected at an atomic level and so consistent with each other. not that that's a bad thing, seeing as it is all based on one book, and i do have to give it credit for being probably the most consistent trilogy of all time (like if they had released it all as one film, aside from the length, i think it would have worked almost perfectly), but all i can really say that's good about it is stuff i already said about fellowship, with the notable exception of ""sweet christ the battle at helm's deep is still one of the best battle scenes ever bloody filmed"", and ""sweet christ gollum is creepy and pathetic and funny, sometimes all at the same time and andy serkis should have broken all the oscar rules about voice acting to win best supporting actor for this"". which means the only thing to do is whine about the ways i think this is worse than fellowship, such as: the fact that i really hate it when a story acts like a character is dead, only to bring them back later, which actually happens a few times in this, and on the other side of the same coin, i also hate it when characters start feeling too indestructible, which a fair few of these characters unfortunately do. that there are a few slightly awkward edits throughout this, although i'm not sure whether that was just a symptom of watching the extended version or not. that i don't really like the stupid unrequited love that eowyn has for aragorn, especially when it never goes anywhere. and most of all, that of all three of these films, this is by far the one that drags the most. there is a pretty substantial chunk around the middle of the film in the parts that don't involve frodo, sam and gollum that really slow the film down to a crawl, even if i still couldn't really call it bad. although i will grant that merry and pippin are much less annoying in this one, and legolas does have...some personality. a little bit. enough to make him bearable. it's definitely my least favourite of the trilogy, but it's kind of like your least favourite haribo. you'll still eat them and most likely enjoy them whenever you buy a packet, it's just that you can't help but wish a little bit for what came before or what you know is coming after once you finish it.";25 January 2022;8;['other', 'first', 'connected', 'atomic', 'consistent', 'other', 'bad', 'consistent', 'good', 'notable', 'sweet', 'good', 'sweet', 'creepy', 'pathetic', 'funny', 'same', 'good', 'only', 'bad', 'such', 'dead', 'few', 'other', 'same', 'indestructible', 'fair', 'few', 'few', 'awkward', 'sure', 'extended', 'stupid', 'unrequited', 'most', 'most', 'substantial', 'bad', 'annoying', 'little', 'enough', 'bearable', 'least', 'least', 'favourite', 'little'];-0.0381578947368421
209;cat_ranchero;"peter jackson and his team did not disappoint again, another epic film with tremendous scope. i also have to mention again the original music by howard shore; another great score with some really great themes. as far as performances go, well everybody did a great job but those that stood out (for me) were; elijah wood as frodo, ian mckellen as gandalf, sean astin as samwise 'sam' gamgee, viggo mortensen as aragorn and bernard hill as theodin (king of rohan). also worthy of note were; billy boyd as pippin, dominic monaghan as merry, orlando bloom as legolas, john rhys-davies as gimli/voice of treebeard, liv tyler as arwen, miranda otto as eowyn, david wenham as faramir, christopher lee as saruman, karl urban as eomer and not forgetting andy serkis as gollum/smeagol. having recently read the book i did find that this departed from j.r.r.tolkien's original to a much larger extent than the first instalment 'the fellowship of the ring'. much more is put into establishing background and motive than in the text and, to a large extent, it works pretty well. it does, however, distract from the task at hand in places and i did find it a little heavy going here and there. i can't, on the other hand, fault the production; it is all brilliantly brought together and it looks fantastic! the battle scenes are immense and to be admired. it's certainly one, despite a couple of misgivings, i still rate very highly. steelmonster's verdict: highly recommended. my score: 9.1/10 you can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: thoughts of a steelmonster.";24 September 2012;9;['epic', 'tremendous', 'original', 'great', 'great', 'great', 'samwise', 'aragorn', 'worthy', 'dominic', 'gimli', 'urban', 'original', 'large', 'first', 'large', 'little', 'heavy', 'other', 'fantastic', 'immense'];0.2636904761904762
210;NoArrow;"and, by amazing i don't mean 'mostly good'. by amazing i don't mean 'could've been better'. by amazing i mean the template for perfection. peter jackson's second act of the trilogy, ""the two towers"" is not only three hours of eye candy, but three hour of ear candy, heart candy and any other kind of candy. as everyone knows, the second act is always the hardest, but peter jackson seemed to make this great film with ease. the story, continuing from ""fellowship"", focuses on two plotlines: frodo (elijah wood) and sam (sean astin) meeting gollum (andy serkis), who leads them to mordor and aragorn (viggo mortensen) helping the rohirrihm. the writers did very well blending these two stories together, just like tolkien did. the star of this movie is without a doubt gollum. even though he is a complete cgi character, he turns out to be the opposite of jar-jar binks. he isn't comic relief, he isn't there for cute laughs, he is the same, tormented character as he was in the book. of course, the action in this movie ranks up with ""braveheart"" for great medieval warfare. as most know, the last forty-five minutes of this movie is one long war scene. despite being so long, it never becomes boring or cheesy, and you're never getting restless in your seat. in fact, you're on the edge of it the whole twenty-seven thousand seconds of it. this film still has faults though, as all do, but they are miniscule compared to the great brilliance. there are but two things in ""towers"" that bugged me: the slightly overdone love story between aragorn and arwen (liv tyler) and gimli's (john rhys-davies) delve into comedy. i'm not saying that gimli wasn't funny, i'm saying that he wasn't as dramatic as he should have been. as i said, the faults are tiny compared to the brilliance.

211;OttoVonB;two films in and its now impossible not to admire what peter jackson and his team have pulled of in adapting tolkien's classic. i am no die-hard fan of the books, in fact i read them only once, and while the depth and world-building seduced me, tolkien's unconventional narrative choices made me skeptical at times. thank jackson and crew for painstakingly scrutinizing not only every last sentence of his work, but also for dissecting the lengthy appendices and fleshing out the core story in real time, while streamlining it, a paradox you'd think impossible to pull off: the plot keeps moving, but never at the expense of character, and fun but payoff-free side-notes (tom bombadil?) are left aside to focus on expanding what matters, particularly aragorn, the main rohan trio and gollum. structurally, there was a lot of work to do as the saga moved along: fans had noted deviations from book 1 in the fellowship, and jackson & co had to do additional tinkering on the two towers, not least in interweaving its previously cleanly separated narrative strands (aragorn/gimli/legolas in part 1, sam/frodo/gollum in part 2) in a way that heightened the impact of both. increasingly, it is impossible not to be contaminated by the love and care put into making these films by all involved, so breathtaking is the world on display, so lovable are its characters, and so gorgeous the execution: the melding of computer graphics, stellar model work and live action sets new, unprecedented standards, and these films are gorgeous to both look at and listen to - howard shore's score reaches new, hear- shattering heights - from one set-piece to the next, culminating in helm's deep, a battle for the ages ending in a series of shots that will have the hairs standing on your neck. thank your lucky stars this was made into three films and not two or - shudder - just one, because our main focus, our characters, beautifully played as they are, are given time to breathe, evolve, and get under our skin in ways you'd never expect from a feature films. and speaking of characters, though this is a case of ensemble greatness, it is impossible to discuss this particular entry without mentioning andy serkis and gollum. through an award-worthy performance and digital wizardry, weta, serkis and jackson pull off something unprecedented: they make gollum not an effect - and he is a landmark - but just another character, as real as any other! and so the quest races forth to its conclusion, continued in the staggering return of the king. as a bridge film, two towers has a thankless task: it has to have its own structure and ending but can neither establish everything from scratch nor end in a clean way. most will call this their least favorite, but for the way it achieves its impossible objectives so beautifully, i would call it my personal favorite. it certainly contains enough of my favorite and very best moments of the saga, from the charge at helm's deep to the ents, all the way to a wonderfully staged gollum/smeagol standoff. this truly is the masterpiece none of us had dared hope for.;6 January 2003;10;['impossible', 'die', 'hard', 'unconventional', 'narrative', 'skeptical', 'last', 'lengthy', 'real', 'impossible', 'free', 'aragorn', 'main', 'additional', 'least', 'narrative', 'impossible', 'breathtaking', 'lovable', 'gorgeous', 'stellar', 'live', 'new', 'unprecedented', 'gorgeous', 'new', 'next', 'deep', 'lucky', 'main', 'ensemble', 'impossible', 'particular', 'worthy', 'digital', 'unprecedented', 'real', 'other', 'staggering', 'thankless', 'own', 'clean', 'most', 'least', 'favorite', 'impossible', 'personal', 'enough', 'favorite', 'good', 'deep'];0.1088869463869464

219;Puroo;the lord of the rings is one long story divided among three movies, which is the reason why it is hard to review this movie in itself. i have already written a review for the fellowship of the ring, in which i talked about how awesome the visuals of the story are, the philosophy behind the ring and the pop culture icon that it became. that is why i won't talk about those things in this review. rather i will talk about the characters of the movie and why it has such a huge impact in the pop culture in spite of being nearly 20 years old book adaptation. percy jackson has done a really great job. the story picks up from the part where gandalf was attacked, except this time it happens from the other point of view. this not only helps the viewer remember an incident that was important from the previous movie, but also makes it interesting by not showing the exact same shots again. while previously we believed gandalf to be just a weak old man, over here he turned out to be a strong wizard. this is the reason why it paid off to see him return as gandalf the white. the thing i really like aobut gandalf is that he is a perfect balance of powerful and emotional character. in one moment he is being spun around by saruman where he is crying like a frail old man, and in the very next scene he is fighting a fire dragon. in the first movie he scared bilbo for a second by threatening him with magic if he dared to wear the ring, but immediately after he joined the hobbits in the party. this is the trait which adds character depth to him, preventing him from being a two dimensional person. this way we get to see him from multiple perspectives. the second character i'd talk about here would be gollum. the first time i saw him i thought he's just another one of those cringy skinny characters every fantasy movie needs to have (jar jar from star wars prequels, dobby from harry potter etc). but he's very different. earlier he was just a normal person like the rest of us. however, it was the temptation of the ring that completely ruined him, not just emotionally but physically too. now in spite of his immortality he wastes himself searching for an addiction he has never been able to get away from. this is the reason why in spite of not actually wanting to hurt frodo, he is unable to convince himself that what he is doing is actually wrong. this message is very clear in the scene where he is talking to himself. speaking of the scene where gollum talks to himself, that scene is one of the many scenes which is able to show the emotions that the characters wanted to express. this is something that can be done only by a good cinematography, which is something peter jackson was able to handle. even though that scene is ridiculed, the point behind the scene was to show how gollum was feeling while planning to kill frodo and not how he was actually looking like. there have been plenty of scenes where the characters have conversations, but i don't want to spoil the movie for you. and that scene was interrupted by sam, who is the next character i'd speak about. sam is frodo's best friend and he can go to any limits to make sure frodo is safe. he is absolutely pure of mind, which was shown in the first movie when he stopped frodo from wearing the ring. sam had heard that gollum wanted to kill frodo and even though gollum was the only one character who could actually help them reach the mountain of doom, sam was ready to take the risk even if it meant having to get lost. frodo didn't trust him or rather should i say, didn't want to trust him. and in spite of being abandoned by his best friend, sam never wasted any time to get back to saving frodo. the movie also has many battle scenes, cool cgi, shows the fellowship of the ring fight alongside other kingdoms while gandalf is not there to protect them. the action, the comic timings, the cgi, the acting, everything about this movie is absolutely great. the only mistake i made watching this was that i watched the theatrical cut of this movie. because of this i missed a very important (and cool) scene from the story, which i was thinking would be answered in return of the king. it has something to do with saruman. so don't make that mistake. i'd say you should watch the long one, no matter how much more you have to watch. the two towers is the most underrated movie of the trilogy and i really wish it was talked about more. only those people know about it who have watched the trilogy. that doesn't mean it's bad. that just means this trilogy should be watched more. since the fellowship of the ring is the beginning of the adventures and the return of the king is the conclusion, the two towers never gets any appreciation as it is sandwiched between the two. but in reality it is the movie which bridges the two. it is an essential part of the movie since this is where the maximum amount of character development takes place.;21 June 2021;10;['long', 'hard',

222;darkreignn;"what more is there to be said about ""the lord of the rings: the two towers?"" with over 2,000 reviews on imdb alone, and the endless amount of dialogue this movie has spurred, it seems like everything that needs to be said about this film, has been said already. considered an achievement in not only fantasy and action filmmaking, but filmmaking as a whole, ""the two towers"" has garnered substantial praise, and for good reason. with a darker tone that managers to naturally progress the plot forward, this movie continues and furthers everything that was great about its predecessor - deeper characterization, an enhanced sense of urgency, an increased scope and sense of scale, and of course more action, which is, in my opinion, the biggest drawback of this movie. i'm not one to complain about more action in a film, and certainly, ""the two towers"" has battle sequences that are technically impressive, with barely any cgi, and if there was cgi, it was well-hidden. additionally, all of the action has a great emotional backbone on it, especially during the climactic battle at helm's deep. classic scenes including when aragorn makes his reappearance after nearly falling to his death, and reaffirms his willingness to fight to the death, or when gandalf shows up at the end of the battle of helm's deep, an entire army at his command, are incredibly epic and literally gave me chills, and nearly brought me to tears in their sheer emotional power. yes, if there's one thing peter jackson does well, it's his ability to bring emotional resonance from everything to the performances of his actors to the individual sequences that make up the overarching whole of the movie. and while his strength may be in creating action scenes that you feel attached to and want to watch, unfortunately, the action itself is borderline incomprehensible. this is not to take away from the technical marvel of creating the action sequences put to film here - i can't imagine the amount of time and effort it took, and by any scale, it is impressive. i only wish i could've had an opportunity to experience the action in a manner that wasn't so shaky. practically every action scene is filmed in extreme close-ups, with the camera shaking as if the camera man is going through diabetic shock. it is impossible to tell what is happening at any given time - the camera will focus on faces and arms swinging weapons, but never clearly showing what is happening, and to whom. i know peter jackson has the ability to show action sequences in a crystal clear manner - the opening scene of ""the fellowship of the ring"" has a battle sequence that is filmed marvelously, in wide takes that allows the audience to see the two armies fighting. and here, there are times where peter pulls the camera back, and allows us to see what's happening. more often than not, however, he chooses to focus on the chaos of the battle using a stylistic choice that i absolutely despise - why go through all of the effort of filming an epic battle sequence if you're not going to let the audience see it clearly? that said, just like in ""the fellowship of the ring"" the good far outweighs the bad here. there are moments in here that i'll never forget how they made me feel - the amount of care put in this world is evident, and the amount of empathy that you'll feel for the world and its characters is unparalleled. as a whole, i enjoyed the first film in this series slightly more than this because of its sense of magic and wonder - but as a direct continuation, ""the two towers"" hits the ball out of the park, forming another emotionally satisfying entry in the so-called greatest story ever told.";21 February 2021;7;['more', 'endless', 'only', 'substantial', 'good', 'dark', 'great', 'deep', 'enhanced', 'more', 'big', 'more', 'impressive', 'great', 'emotional', 'climactic', 'deep', 'classic', 'deep', 'entire', 'epic', 'sheer', 'emotional', 'emotional', 'individual', 'technical', 'impressive', 'shaky', 'extreme', 'close', 'diabetic', 'impossible', 'clear', 'opening', 'wide', 'stylistic', 'epic', 'good', 'bad', 'evident', 'unparalleled', 'first', 'more', 'direct', 'great'];0.1801801801801801
223;bix171;"this time, there's less j.r.r. tolkien and more peter jackson--and that's a good thing. while still hewing close to the storyline in this second installment of the 'lord of the rings' trilogy, jackson emphasizes character development over tolkien's obsessions with myth and language and the results are far more evocative and immediate than the same events in the book. jackson seems stubbornly determined to make a movie and not a mere representation of the novel, and as a result, there are liberties taken with the narrative (the book's fans will occasionally be disoriented but will adjust) that are used to open up not only the cinematic possibilities but to provide credible character motivations that tolkien could not or would not provide. (minor characters dismissed simplistically in the book such as wormtongue, well-played by brad dourif, here help give emotion to the story and move the tale along in a convincing fashion.) the film, which follows three separate plot threads, is almost all cliffhangers and non-stop action (culminating in the enormous battle at helm's deep, which essentially comprises the final third of the film) and you're left with the delighted impression that jackson's inspiration stems from serials and swashbucklers of the thirties as well as cecil b. demille's 'the ten commandments'. overall, there's less balance than 'the fellowship of the ring'--this is out of jackson's control as the ruggedness of the terrain dictates the plot--and it's relentlessly dark; but andrew lesnie's fluid camera once again captures the majesty of jackson's larger-than-life vision and grant major's production design situates wooden-hut villages and stone fortresses in perfect harmony with the mountainsides that figure so prominently. enormously satisfying, this is another superb complement--without being an imitation--to tolkien's work and an outright cinematic triumph in its own right.";21 December 2002;10;['more', 'good', 'second', 'evocative', 'immediate', 'same', 'determined', 'mere', 'cinematic', 'credible', 'minor', 'such', 'wormtongue', 'convincing', 'separate', 'non', 'stop', 'enormous', 'deep', 'final', 'delighted', 'less', 'dark', 'fluid', 'large', 'wooden', 'perfect', 'satisfying', 'outright', 'cinematic', 'own'];0.1846790890269151

229;ebossert;"here are my point by point thoughts on two towers. --right from the start, this film opens with a sequence more cartoonish than anything in fellowship. it later provides a shoddy rationalization to bring gandalf back from the dead. i feel that this trivializes his death in fellowship, which was one of the more effectively dramatic moments in that film. i guess an apparent death results in one's return as a ""whiter"" version of oneself. gandalf struts around like nothing happened. also, when someone says that they were ""sent back"" from heaven ""until my task is completed"", i get the impression that they are borderline invincible. this diminishes any sense of danger in the storyline for this character, and also diminishes the theme of death in the film overall. --another problem i have is with gollum, who is annoying as soon as he appears. i suppose that's a personal gripe, but his mannerisms are rather obnoxious and hammy. he's practically unwatchable. his character is also a substandard attempt at writing a character with fake complexity. gollum shifts between evil jerk and loyal nutcase. that's about it. one understands the character completely the moment his split personalities present themselves. unfortunately, this shift in personality is repeatedly hammered into the viewer's brain. yes, we got it the first time it was shown. simply shifting between two thin personalities dozens of times does not create character depth or complexity. also, was there ever a question that his evil jerk personality would ultimately emerge as the dominant one? at no point during these films did i think that he would choose not to steal the ring (even for a second), and i didn't even read the books. his inner conflict feels meaningless and superfluous to me. --the drab visuals make for some tedious viewing. everything is gray. the environments are gray. the skies are gray. the bad guys are gray. gollum is gray. the orcs are gray. the weapons are gray. the buildings are gray. the color scheme is way too monotonous and repetitive. --the stifling effects of the ring were already established by the end of fellowship. we saw the effects of the ring on a variety of characters, so it's certainly frustrating that two towers continues to harp on this subject without further elaboration or complexity. frodo, sam, and gollum basically just walk through gray environments for 3 hours while complaining about the ring's effects. we already spent 3 hours in fellowship explaining this issue, and two towers brings nothing new to the table. --it's rarely mentioned, but this movie has one-dimensional, boring antagonists. we get very little time with any of them, and none of them are memorable. they're just generic caricatures to be ""fought against"" as necessary. there are standard bad guys that show up all over the place, like those big cartoon hyenas near the midpoint and the giant army near the end. a few memorable bad guys and some development would have made things a lot more engaging. --that leads us to the action, which has some uninspired choreography. the flaw of generic bad guys can be partially mitigated when the protagonists break out some awesome maneuvers or strategies. very little of this appears in this movie. we mostly get basic sword swipes, arrow shots, and riding horses directly into swarms of baddies. you'd think that helm's deep would have some traps and attack strategies for whittling the enemy down as they approach the fortress, but such is not the case - thereby wasting an opportunity for some creative attacks. at one point it seemingly points to aragorn and gimli having some kind of plan, but aragorn just throws gimli into a swarm of hundreds of baddies. to be fair, there are a few good moments to be had near the end (e.g., the bomb, the giant ladders, etc.), but that's not saying much when one realizes that the battle lasts over 30 minutes. --the cgi is exposed more here than in fellowship, with some particularly cartoonish moments (like the opening sequence, the big hyenas, etc.). --what is it, exactly, that the characters accomplish during the first two hours of this movie? aragorn helps gandalf cure a king, then he sits around and talks. it's also ironic that gandalf is brought back from the dead, then given almost nothing to do. he spends much of the film off screen as he rides his horse to find reinforcements, a task that almost any other character could have completed. meanwhile, the elves sit around and talk, mostly about stuff we already know. the humans sit around and talk, mostly about fighting but there's no discussion regarding battle strategy other than where they want to fight. they also walk around and put on armor. merry and pippin talk to a tree that takes forever to form sentences. i tell you, this movie is very difficult to sit through. --this movie also introduces one of the more unconvincing love triangles in cinematic history. aragorn, arwen, and that other chick. why even bother having romance in this movie at all if you're not going to spend time on it, develop it, or make it important? aragorn and arwen have a brief discussion or two, then make-out. that's it. also, liv tyler can't act. --one point that is related to galdalf's contrived resurrection is this: there are various fake deaths of characters in this movie. pippin and aragorn are given ""possible deaths"", but the filmmakers (and/or original novelist) obviously don't want to kill off a main character. of course, they do kill a random elf dude in an unwarranted moment of overdramatism. i'm not sure why i'm supposed to feel sorry for a guy that had a grand total of 30 seconds of screen time before his death. --also, the wizardry in this film is not creative. there's not much in terms of spellcasting.";7 June 2013;4;['cartoonish', 'shoddy', 'dead', 'dramatic', 'apparent', 'gandalf', 'invincible', 'annoying', 'personal', 'obnoxious', 'hammy', 'unwatchable', 'substandard', 'fake', 'evil', 'loyal', 'split', 'first', 'thin', 'evil', 'dominant', 'inner', 'meaningless', 'superfluous', 'tedious', 'gray', 'gray', 'gray', 'bad', 'gray', 'gray', 'gray', 'gray', 'gray', 'monotonous', 'repetitive', 'frustrating', 'further', 'gray', 'new', 'dimensional', 'boring', 'little', 'memorable', 'generic', 'necessary', 'standard', 'bad', 'big', 'giant', 'few', 'memorable', 'bad', 'engaging', 'uninspired', 'generic', 'bad', 'awesome', 'little', 'basic', 'deep', 'such', 'creative', 'gimli', 'gimli', 'fair', 'few', 'good', 'giant', 'much', 'cartoonish', 'big', 'first', 'ironic', 'dead', 'much', 'other', 'other', 'difficult', 'unconvincing', 'cinematic', 'aragorn', 'other', 'important', 'aragorn', 'brief', 'various', 'fake', 'possible', 'original', 'main', 'random', 'unwarranted', 'sure', 'sorry', 'grand', 'creative', 'much'];-0.0807531840140535

235;tributarystu;"actually it was as i expected. i had heard that there would be more action in this movie, so i did believe, that if all was done well, i would enjoy it. if i look at both movies, i notice that there isn't much of a change in the actual movies, but in the action. the fellowship of the ring didn't achieve to amaze me. it was poorly made, without any real action, without any real feelings and without any real characters. all that was interesting was the ring, but the ring can't keep on its own the whole movie. special effects...well, i consider they are quite enchanting, but not as enchanting as they should have been. i'll get back to these a little bit later. spoilers the two towers is the long awaited sequel to the widely praised fellowship of the ring. if you read my review to that movie, which is a little bit harsh, then you will know that i did not appreciate the first movie. what makes me like this movie is the action. nothing else. i personally consider it an action movie, with a little bit of adventure. the amazing battles make up for the quite pathetic sentimental scenes. the scenes that ruined the first movie. the actors are incapable to get real feelings into the movie, so i remained kind of cold to all the dead after which they ""weeped"". the characters do not change...except gandalf. i did not totally understand the change that took place in him, but i guess that is because i haven't read the books. still, this is a minus point. what really makes me laugh...well, this is regarding to the best movies of the year poll. not the fact that lotr is at the top. that was what i expected. what i find hilarious is that liv tyler actually has a place in th category of supporting actresses. she barely appeared 15 minutes during the whole movie, but still she's there. this is just one of the things which prove to me how superficial such polls are. not to mention how lotr appears at sections such as ""best documentary""... there is this interesting creature gollum. gollum who is the result of what the ring can make of something living. smeagol is what actually remains of the former self. smeagol is weak though, and gollum doesn't have much of a fight to take control. this is how i saw things. there were some who said that gollum was for lotr as dobby was for harry potter. i will not deny there aren't any similarities, but i do not think they should be compared. gollum has a much more important role in lotr, while dobby barely appears for some minutes in hp and the chamber of secrets. i believe this is a difference which matters. beside that, the characters definitely aren't the same ""inside"". i am quite curious which part of the creature will win: gollum or smeagol. the story itself is about war...and despite what some might be trying to do, i do not think it is really about the losses that a war brings. king theodon is the one who says he regrets the losses, but i can barely feel him saying it. the battles are quite impressive...the special effects now...well, regarding the battle scenes they are very well done. but then, i didn't feel quite at peace while seeing pippin and merry on that big tree. they seemed not to belong to that picture. probably is the result of unsuccessful effects. that's what i believe... the scene which i liked most was when the dam was destroyed and the water destroyed all that came in its way(except the living trees). it was a beautiful scene...as was the scene of the attack of gandalf and his reinforcements. unfortunately that was predictable, and it was a kind of traditional opposition.(light-dark) i guess this movie will get quite a few nominations for the academy awards. it is not on my list of possible winners though, despite the fact that i haven't seen movies like ""the pianist"", ""the hours"" or ""about schmidt"" yet. i will say that it is a good movie. because it is. it is interesting and it keeps you awake, unlike its predecessor. it will take me a lot of time to learn why people loved that movie so much...a lot of time. as a mark...well, it is quite an improvement. i guess it would deserve an 8/10. despite the not so impressive acting and the unsuccessful sentimentalist scenes...i'll be fair and i'll say it is worth seeing, if you want to see an action movie. something that isn't too much of a weight for one's intellect. i say this, because i personally didn't find anything that made a deep impression on me, or that made me ponder on its meanings.";8 February 2003;8;['more', 'much', 'actual', 'real', 'real', 'real',

236;illbebackreviews;'the fellowship of the ring (2001)' marked the beginning of a new era of film making. the first film was made with such care and love for j.r.r tolkien's work and many people were unsure if 'the two towers' would be as good. one word answers everyone's doubts: yes this is still a legendary film, although i prefer the first and third a little more than 'the two towers' but by no means was this a bad film. the film may seem like it dragged on in certain situations but the film came off in style. j.r.r tolkien's two biggest strengths with the vol 3 and 4 of his lord of the rings novel, or 'the two towers' novel were the way that gollum was introduced and everything about rohan. this film caps it off in amazing style. gollum was brought to the big screen in the most amazing way possible. it was so well done. edoras and everything about rohan was superbly filmed and i loved the addition of grima wormtongue into this film. he, much like saruman, is filled with pure hate for the good guys. however, both the acting by every single cast member was brilliant. sir ian mckellen was back, and he absolutely nailed the role of gandalf the white. legendary actor sir christopher lee also nails the role of saruman, whilst hugo weaving, cate blanchett, viggo mortensen, andy serkis and pretty much every actor puts out such a powerful performance. the special effects and the cinematography was superb. the way they showed several places such as mountains and mordor with descending or ascending shots was superb. the special effects are beyond amazing! the score for the film is untouched. howard shore absolutely kicks-ass with his music. many may say that john williams or hans zimmer would've been better, but i disagree. howard shore was able to pull you right into middle-earth and the elvish-type soundtracks were amazing. the film did choose to go through different paths from the book but the film was purely amazing! one of the best scenes in this film were gandalf releasing theoden and the entire build up to the battle of helm's deep. it was so intense and full of drama. ****full spoiler detail**** -the battle for helm's deep- every single thing about the battle of helm's deep was awesome. i loved how they should some awesome moments for all three characters and the whole idea of 'seeing higher kill count' was awesome. the fact that the elves joined the battle and that they all die is extremely sad. legolas' badass moments where he skateboards the shield and shoots down the ladder holder were awesome. i liked the entire dwarf-tossing idea. the end of the battle where gandalf and the rohirrim arrive is done so well and seeing the uruk-hai finally flee was brilliant -gollum- gollum is one of the greatest motion picture history characters. from the very moment you see him in the films, gollum casts such a strangely awesome feeling to you. andy serkis absolutely kills at being gollum! the way it ended with gollum finally betraying the hobbits once more was brilliant ***end of spoilers*** definitely a must see!;15 November 2012;10;['new', 'first', 'such', 'many', 'unsure', 'good', 'legendary', 'first', 'third', 'little', 'more', 'bad', 'certain', 'big', 'amazing', 'big', 'amazing', 'possible', 'pure', 'good', 'single', 'brilliant', 'white', 'legendary', 'powerful', 'special', 'superb', 'several', 'such', 'superb', 'special', 'amazing', 'untouched', 'many', 'well', 'able', 'middle', 'elvish', 'amazing', 'different', 'amazing', 'good', 'gandalf', 'theoden', 'entire', 'deep', 'intense', 'full', 'full', 'single', 'deep', 'awesome', 'awesome', 'whole', 'high', 'awesome', 'sad', 'badass', 'awesome', 'entire', 'brilliant', 'great', 'very', 'awesome', 'brilliant'];0.3755940988835725
237;Christopher_Reid;when i first saw the two towers, i couldn't follow that much of the story. i was just bad at following complicated stories and knew nothing about tolkien's world, other than the first movie. but it still blew me away in terms of sheer scale and ambition. being a sequel comes with pros and cons. one advantage is that you can launch straight into the story. you also already have a world and characters to play with which you can expand on. but there is pressure to keep the story moving and interesting and to match the first film without retreading the same ideas too much. in a sense, you don't have an ending but that can give you the freedom to go dark or end on a cliffhanger. overall, two towers is amazing for the position it's in. the main highlight has to be the huge battle at helm's deep which is surely still one of the greatest battle scenes of all time, perhaps only surpassed by its sequel. this time, i understood the strategy much better. the way it plays out is fantastic. it's easy to follow what's happening, there are many ups and downs, the stunts and effects are incredible, there's even some humour - it's very hard to fault. also, even thought i'd already seen it, the tension feels real because we know there's still a 3rd movie. there's no obligation for the good guys to win. no reason various characters can't die. another highlight is treebeard and his ent friends which merry and pippin meet. this is pure fantasy. it could easily seem silly and childish, but jackson commits to the concept and gives it gravitas. seeing the ents finally turn on saruman and help defeat him is one of my favourite sequences in any film. it transcends genre, in my opinion. it's unadulterated spectacle, taking you back to being a child, cheering at trees defeating orcs and an evil wizard stunned that he's somehow lost. it's larger than life. it also reminds me of macbeth... a less interesting plot line is the trio of frodo, sam and gollum. too much of the drama feels artificial. we know gollum will lie. we know the ring will start to get to frodo. we know sam won't trust gollum and that tension will rise. it goes back and forth predictably. it doesn't feel nuanced, it feels arbitrary. having said that, gollum is a pretty impressive achievement for its time. he never actually looks real, but his interactions with them are believable enough. and he is an interesting and tragic character. but still somewhat random. i liked the introduction of faramir and learning more of the world of men. but he's pretty mean to gollum. i didn't understand this. whereas i really like aragorn, legolas, gimli, gandalf and other characters who seem very kind, strong, wise and good, faramir seems much more flawed - but in a slightly unlikable way. the rohan plot is quite interesting. i wish we saw more of the king being manipulated by wormtongue (brad dourif is great in this role). but this curse is dispelled nearly straight away. karl urban and miranda otto are other nice additions to the cast. otto is very pretty but doesn't seem to have been in that many other big films. this whole subplot helps give weight and emotion to the helm's deep climax. the rest of the film overall is extremely well made like the first one. breathtaking cinematography, consistently good acting, an exciting story (only sometimes frustrating), great visual effects, an expanding musical score, etc. howard shore isn't a john williams tier composer (who is?), but the music works very well, enhancing many stirring moments. the last shot is one of my favourites of all time. panning gradually up to show barad-dur and mount doom, lava, lightning, dragons and an eerie song begins to play - gollum's song. it sets up the finale perfectly.;14 October 2021;10;['much', 'bad', 'complicated', 'other', 'first', 'sheer', 'interesting', 'first', 'same', 'dark', 'amazing', 'main', 'huge', 'deep', 'great', 'fantastic', 'easy', 'many', 'incredible', 'hard', 'real', 'good', 'various', 'treebeard', 'pure', 'silly', 'childish', 'favourite', 'unadulterated', 'evil', 'large', 'interesting', 'much', 'artificial', 'nuanced', 'arbitrary', 'impressive', 'real', 'believable', 'interesting', 'tragic', 'random', 'more', 'mean', 'gimli', 'gandalf', 'other', 'kind', 'strong', 'wise', 'good', 'flawed', 'unlikable', 'interesting', 'more', 'great', 'other', 'nice', 'pretty', 'many', 'other', 'big', 'whole', 'deep', 'first', 'good', 'exciting', 'frustrating', 'great', 'visual', 'musical', 'many', 'stirring', 'last', 'eerie'];0.1735584077380952
238;basrutten;"contains spoilers once again, peter jackson & crew have made a very enjoyable and suspenseful movie out of a very dry and uneventful book. yes indeed, i've read the books and although they certainly were epic and imaginative, i also found them to be dry, filled with unnecessary descriptions, and boring. the movie manages to take exactly those parts of the book that are the most interesting, while adding some action and humor here and there to make the movie more appealing to large audiences. while tolkien purists will likely be upset about (among others) the fact that gimli has been turned into a comedian, i really liked it. things like that are simply necessary to keep the casual movie-goer interested. on top of that, gollem is absolutely brilliant. the scene in which he (it?) talks to himself is amazing, and the whole frodo/gollem relation is done very well, even if frodo remains a whining little brat. i'm not sure about the whole aragorn/arwen ""romance"", the movie could have done without that, and should instead have focused more on characters like gandalf and legolas, who get very little screen time. in terms of plot, there are a couple of points where the movie screws up a little. for example, twice we have somebody who was presumably dead return to the land of the living, and there are a bit too much coincidences and lucky escapes in the plot. i'm not exactly sure to which extent this is due to the source material and which part was the ""fault"" of the script writers, though. while this movie is by no means perfect (especially not in terms of story), it's still a very suspenseful, epic and spectacular film. definitely worth watching. *** out of **** stars";5 January 2003;8;['enjoyable', 'suspenseful', 'dry', 'uneventful', 'epic', 'imaginative', 'dry', 'unnecessary', 'boring', 'interesting', 'appealing', 'large', 'upset', 'gimli', 'necessary', 'casual', 'interested', 'brilliant', 'amazing', 'whole', 'little', 'sure', 'whole', 'little', 'little', 'dead', 'much', 'lucky', 'sure', 'due', 'perfect', 'suspenseful', 'epic', 'spectacular', 'worth'];0.1605414746543778
239;MovieGuy109;after grabbing critical and commercial acclaim to his first installment of his trilogy, director peter jackson moves on to the second film. the two towers is excellent, a delight to watch. andy serkis's performance added with the cgi make gollum, a convincing critter, one of the highlights of the film. the battle scenes look amazing on camera and the film amps up the climatic scope to make the movie better than the first and it works! the story follows frodo and sam, still on their way to mordor as they face trials and tribulations of their journey. meanwhile aragorn and their former companions wage war on the forces of evil. arresting, epic entertainment that nicely sets up the grand finale.;20 July 2011;9;['critical', 'commercial', 'first', 'second', 'excellent', 'convincing', 'amazing', 'climatic', 'well', 'first', 'former', 'epic', 'grand'];0.2909090909090909
240;TheHande;"the two towers really feels like a medieval action-movie. though jackson deviates a bit more from the source-material than in the last film, in some ways this manages to enhance the film. i for instance was not distracted by gandalf exorcising saruman out of theoden and actually felt it was ten times a cooler moment than in the books. viggo mortensen aka aragorn now really takes charge for the first time and truly shines as the hero of this film. gollum's addition to the movie also makes it a lot more powerful (he's so creepy). unlike some, i have always enjoyed gimli's excellent comic-performance. this is a solid films from start to finish and in my view the best lotr film. it even manages to out-do the follow-up ""the return of the king"". jackson has created a truly great series of films.";3 December 2005;10;['medieval', 'more', 'last', 'gandalf', 'cooler', 'first', 'powerful', 'creepy', 'excellent', 'comic', 'solid', 'good', 'lotr', 'great'];0.3

244;general-melchett;the two towers dwarfs the fellowship of the ring in size, scale, and the grandeur of the action scenes. while fotr followed frodo and co. as they started their journey across middle earth to destroy the ring, ttt is our first glimpse at what happens in the bigger world as the fellowship breaks - a war is being fought over this ring, and the war is starting now... needless to say, ttt is a bigger film than fotr. instead of about 100 orcs and a troll against nine men, we have armies of thousands of orcs and uruk-hai, against armies of thousands of men, and proper big weapons. and the results are amazing. the battle for helm's deep is brilliantly done - braveheart can pack its bags and go home, this is the new champion of sword-fighting epics. the way tension was built up to the battle was brilliant - you found yourself practically drooling by the time the men were gathered on the outer walls of the castle, ready for battle. and besides from ending with the smaller fights and starting with the larger wars, this film also started off some new plots - the story of king theoden and eowyn and the first meeting with gollum (we got some glimpses of him in the last film but this film is his real introduction) - and develops these plots sufficiently for them to be continued and ended in the next film - the epic close to this great trilogy. this film definitely did not pass on anything, and though the relatively slim budget (believe me, $93,000,000 is not much for a film of this scale) tells you that a lot of it is cg, it is still bloody impressive, and builds more on the lotr trilogy's status as an epic series. the fellowship has broken, but the story is still far from over... 10/10;18 February 2007;10;['middle', 'first', 'big', 'needless', 'big', 'proper', 'big', 'amazing', 'new', 'brilliant', 'outer', 'ready', 'small', 'large', 'new', 'first', 'last', 'real', 'next', 'epic', 'great', 'slim', 'much', 'bloody', 'impressive', 'epic'];0.1425914994096812

247;TheOny13;before saying anything about this masterpiece, i will say that this is my favorite lord of the rings movie by far. while the first is an adventure that is just basically filler from the moment the fellowship is formed and until it is broken and the third one is basically deus ex machina after deus ex machina, this one is the perfect balance between storytelling and epicness on a biblical level. ever since i watched the trilogy as i was a little boy 12 or 13 years old, this was the movie that made me fall in love with middle earth. i still remember the excitement i had as i watched this movie the first time and how amazed i was seeing all the pieces of the movie's story come together in what is one of the best third acts of any movie i've ever seen. so why is this movie for me the best one of the trilogy? <ul><li>unlike the first one, where after the fellowship is formed they basically just pass one obstacle after another with no connection whatsoever between them (not to say that it introduces so much lore and stuff that probably only book fans would know like the ancient creature by the end which serves absolutely no purpose to the story other than killing gandalf), this movie takes the pieces left by the first movie and just develops such an interesting story with each of the characters. merry and pipin have their adventure discovering gandalf, aragorn, gimli and legolas go to rohan and prepare for the ineviatable battle which will come upon helm's deep, while frodo and sam continue their journey encoutering smeagol and trying to make him lead them through the mountains towards mount doom. and that is probably the best part of the movie: the urgency of the situation. the impending doom that's coming from isengard upon the realm of men and how can they stop this. every story goes at the beginning it's own separate way just so that by the end they all come full circle and connect with each other for a masterfull ending.</li></ul> <ul><li>unlike the third movie this movie doesn't rest on deus ex machina to resolve it's conflicts but rather develops each story in it's own way and lets you think they have nothing to do with each other, only to have them come together by the end in an epic finale. for example: gandalf's intervention by the end is well developed and is not a deus ex machina since he went to get help and by the end of the movie he brings indeed help. merry and pipin's story seamingly unimportant at the beginning of the movie it does play and enormous role by the end of this movie and also in the beginning of the next, by having the threes intervene and destroy isengard.</li></ul> all the other things about cinematography or visual effects not to mention the music (which is spectacular) make this movie a fantastic fantasy movie and an example on how to adapt a fantasy source material to the big screen. this is and will remain for me the best lord of the rings movie and one of the best acomplishments in cinema history. a shame this movie wasn't nominated for many oscars like the other two did, since it is at least as good as teh other two if not better.;25 May 2019;10;['favorite', 'first', 'third', 'perfect', 'biblical', 'little', 'old', 'middle', 'first', 'amazed', 'good', 'third', 'good', 'first', 'much', 'ancient', 'other', 'first', 'interesting', 'aragorn', 'gimli', 'ineviatable', 'deep', 'journey', 'encoutering', 'good', 'own', 'separate', 'full', 'other', 'masterfull', 'third', 'own', 'other', 'epic', 'developed', 'unimportant', 'enormous', 'next', 'other', 'visual', 'spectacular', 'fantastic', 'big', 'good', 'good', 'many', 'other', 'least', 'good', 'other', 'well'];0.2222560975609755
248;galensaysyes;"peter jackson hasn't the first idea--or perhaps has only the first idea--of how to tell a story in a movie. a character points to a ringwraith and says, 'look, a ringwraith!'; cut to the ringwraith. in general, that's the extent of jackson's skill in visual narrative. also, lacking a sense of story, he lacks a sense of myth, which is one of the two things that lord of the rings is. (the other is invented history, which he does get.) jackson is an enthusiastic but unbridled filmmaker. sometimes his shots cut together, sometimes not, and have to be glued together with loud music; sometimes his scenes are modulated in proportion to the whole, sometimes not, but you don't notice for all the noise. however, out of an obvious affection for the books, a sense of drama and epic, a goodish script, a mostly good cast, a good crew, a bunch of computer equipment, and all the money in the world, he has managed to cobble together a pair (so far) of classic fantasies, according to movie standards. they would be better viewed in half-hour installments, and, their huge lush landscapes notwithstanding, could do with a lot more fresh air. but they're as good as--and better than--one could sensibly expect. the second film improves on the first--slows up a bit, steers away from the faux 3-d effects, and allows space for some finer and subtler things to emerge: splendid performances in the roles of eowyn and faramir, a depth of feeling in the characterization of gollum, and moments of real visual poetry. but strangely, it's much less like the book, despite its fidelity to details of name and incident and setting. however, the most obvious ways in which two towers departs from the book were apparent in fellowship, too. the books are all story and no drama; the films are just the opposite. the books leave an impression of clearness: clear air, clear water, clear thought; the films are filled with drive, grit, and ceaseless motion--rather like the factory of isengard, and most unlike the cloister of lorien. but i'll probably go to see this one a third time, anyway.";24 January 2003;8;['first', 'first', 'general', 'visual', 'other', 'enthusiastic', 'loud', 'obvious', 'epic', 'good', 'good', 'classic', 'half', 'huge', 'lush', 'more', 'fresh', 'good', 'well', 'second', 'first', 'faux', 'splendid', 'real', 'visual', 'less', 'obvious', 'apparent', 'clear', 'clear', 'clear', 'ceaseless', 'most', 'third'];0.2029569892473118

254;BadWebDiver;"i just want to say that the ""fish & chips"" argument between gollum and samwise in this film is one of my favorite pieces of dramatization. it works because the scene reveals so much about the characters and the underlying themes of the story, without the whole thing sounding like a self-conscious english literature essay. with gollum having total spasms about the way sam's ""ruining"" the food, and sam stuck in the traditional ways of hobbit cooking, the interaction between the conflicting character points of view is brilliantly realized in a novel and interesting way. it's in scenes like this where dramatization really works best. on the other hand, i have to say in contrast that the big ""important stories"" speech in both the white city scene and at the end when the two hobbits are walking off is one of the worst pieces of heavy-handed moralizing i've ever heard. it sound really labored and forced and really doesn't fit the context of the situation too well at all. the helms deep battle is certainly a highlight of the movie - in fact the whole trilogy! it's very well set-up and executed (pardon the pun!); while providing some great character interaction. i personally enjoyed the comic relief moments with the rivalry between gimli and legolas. legolas' style at mounting his transport was very impressive. some of the best character moments in this movie is when frodo defends gollum to samwise, and also merry and pippin play off each other very well while being held by the orcs, then running and meeting treebeard. and the final battle of the ents with sauroman is a great climactic moment.";22 March 2004;8;['favorite', 'whole', 'conscious', 'english', 'total', 'traditional', 'interesting', 'other', 'big', 'important', 'bad', 'heavy', 'handed', 'labored', 'deep', 'whole', 'great', 'comic', 'gimli', 'impressive', 'good', 'other', 'final', 'great', 'climactic'];0.2047619047619047

256;ilovedolby;"well here we are, one year after the fellowship of the ring. i know that many of you out there are all very excited about this release, as you all should be. after all, if the two towers is anything like the fellowship. then it will undoubtedly be good. this is the obvious case. that's what happens when you have a director, peter jackson, who is more than just an avid fan of j.r.r tolkien's fantasy trilogy. jackson has created two motion pictures that are epic beyond proportion to anything that we have ever seen before theatrically. they are visually stunning, filled with incredible action sequences, and a story that reaches into the very foundations of all of our imaginations. when the fellowship of the ring opened last year on december 19, it was a huge success with an opening box-office weekend upwards of $45 million. what's more, it didn't really fall out of the public's attention after the christmas holiday; rather it held on. with talk of golden globe and academy award nominations, strong word of mouth from film patrons, critical appeal, and a huge fan base that was already established from the amazing series of books, the fellowship. proved to be a huge success in every aspect. now, after one year of waiting we have the two towers. george lucas, creator of the star wars trilogy and indiana jones said it best during an interview about the original star wars trilogy. george said that every play has three acts. in the first act, there is a small victory. the second act puts the main characters in the worst possible situation. and in the third act, the hero saves the day, and all's well that end's well. that's the case with the lord of the rings trilogy. the fellowship. set the stage with a small victory at the end of the film, but establishing the idea of hope and that there is more to come in the story. the two towers pits its characters in the worst possible situation. naturally, we can expect some fantastic ending to come next year in the return of the king. as for the two towers, frodo and sam are off in the land of mordor, trying to get to the gates of mordor to destroy 'the one ring.' however, they notice that they are being followed, and who should it be but gollum, the deformed creature that originally had the ring before it came into the possession of bilbo. frodo and sam capture gollum and make him lead them to the gates of mordor. meanwhile aragorn, gimly the dwarf, and legolas the elf are off to find the two hobbits who were kidnapped during the final battle of the fellowship., merry and pippin. but the lands of middle earth are in more peril than ever, and saruman the white is sending his army of uruk-hai against the lands of middle earth. in this case, it is primarily the land of rohan. it is up to the three companions of the original fellowship to unit with the people of rohan, and with the help of gandalf the white, formally the grey. they lead the people of rohan into an immense battle in a place called helm's deep. obviously the plot is far more intricate than that, however, fantasy, at least for me, is a bit difficult to explain. and i'm sure that those of you who haven't seen the fellowship of the ring are probably confused by the plot explanation in the above paragraph. if you are, then watch the first film or read the first book in the trilogy. but the two towers is equally as good as the fellowship. was. i can't really decide which film is better, or which i would prefer to watch. the two towers is more action packed, and there are the occasional jokes that one can't help but be amused at. the acting in the film is good, what would be expected for such a film. but the acting isn't phony either. in fact, the characters seem very heroic you find yourself and other audience members rooting them on. it's a wonderful film, and what a gift for the holidays to have in theaters. if you were not able to see the fellowship. theatrically, i urge you to see this one theatrically. especially in a digital sound theater if you can. the film is huge and filled with splendor; it needs to be seen on 'the big screen' to be truly appreciated for all that it is. it's become more than a film. rather, the release of the two towers is an event. i was fortunate enough to see it this morning in albany at hoyts crossgates cinemas 18, which in my opinion are the finest digital theaters around. and believe me, i've been to many megaplexes from here to florida. the show was sold out, and the crowd cheered, applauded, and rooted the characters on. like seeing the original star wars on it's opening day reissue back on january 31, 1997, the crowd was half of the fun of going. these films are amazing. see them and love them for all that they are, extraordinary motion pictures. ****";22 December 2002;10;['many', 'excited', 'good', 'obvious', 'more', 'avid', 'epic', 'stunning', 'incredible', 'very', 'last', 'huge', 'more', 'golden', 'strong', 'critical', 'huge', 'amazing', 'huge', 'original', 'first', 'small', 'second', 'main', 'bad', 'possible', 'third', 'well', 'small', 'more', 'bad', 'possible', 'fantastic', 'next', 'deformed', 'aragorn', 'final', 'middle', 'more', 'middle', 'original', 'white', 'immense', 'deep', 'intricate', 'least', 'difficult', 'sure', 'above', 'first', 'first', 'good', 'well', 'more', 'occasional', 'good', 'phony', 'heroic', 'other', 'wonderful', 'able', 'digital', 'huge', 'big', 'more', 'fortunate', 'fine', 'digital', 'many', 'original', 'amazing', 'extraordinary'];0.2342307692307692
257;lotus_chief;"**spoilers included** i must admit that i was surprised to see how much fanfare and praise lotr: fellowship of the ring got when it was first released. i'm not really a fan of fantasy films, i just enjoy good movies and, to my surprise, fellowship was a pretty good one. in my eyes it was flawed no doubt; me not being versed in fantasy stories, much less tolkien's books, there were some aspects of the story/characters that i didn't particularly like. but hey, that's my bias i guess. nevertheless it was a very good film and i was actually anticipating its sequel, the two towers. like almost all sequels, the two towers is a victim of the sophomore jinx. i wasn't as moved with two towers as i was with fellowship. the battle scene was good, and the landscapes as expected were spectacular. but the story truly lagged at some parts. the whole business with the 'tree people' was pretty boring; although in the end we finally see what their purpose to the big scheme of things is. what was also annoying was how hard it was to understand what most of the characters were saying.i found myself rewinding many times to try and make out what was being said. what was pretty surprising was how little we see of the hobbits, who are at the crux of the story. the two towers attempts to move at the same pace that the fellowship moved at, but ultimately fails to do so. so many new characters were introduced to the point where you just lose track and cease to care about what is going on. so much was crammed into this film without much background. fellowship kept you interested throughout, even through much dialogue and so-called 'slow spots'. the story of the two towers, however, lacks the same punch that fellowship had, and simply lags at some parts. with all this said, this is the 2nd in a trilogy, so i can only hope that the final installment brings everything together to make the whole lotr experience memorable. one more thingi am surprised that these two films are rated so high here at imdb (lotr 1 at #6; lotr 2 at #10)???? they are good films, but to be rated in the top 10 along with undeniable masterpieces like godfather i/ii, shawshank redemption & casablanca i feel is a travesty!! to the biggest fan of these types of movies/stories, could they really put this aside the godfather, usual suspects, memento or casablanca and honestly say that it ranks equally with any of those films? no way!! i see nothing in these films that make them as 'groundbreaking' as the ones listed. aside from the cgi eye candy what really is there to hold on to, like the marvelous acting in the films listed above? will lotr really be remembered 20 years from now as timeless classics like those? for the hype and monetary aspects, maybe..but for the actual movies, i doubt it very much. i really feel the hoopla around the lotr franchise is undeserved and exaggerated. the matrix remains the only trilogy that hasn't disappointed, and for all of its groundbreaking leaps it still doesn't get the respect and recognition it truly deserves.";26 August 2003;6;['surprised', 'much', 'good', 'good', 'flawed', 'less', 'good', 'good', 'spectacular', 'whole', 'boring', 'big', 'annoying', 'hard', 'most', 'many', 'surprising', 'little', 'same', 'many', 'new', 'much', 'much', 'interested', 'much', 'slow', 'same', 'final', 'whole', 'memorable', 'more', 'surprised', 'good', 'undeniable', 'big', 'usual', 'marvelous', 'monetary', 'actual', 'undeserved', 'exaggerated', 'only'];0.1386258417508417

260;ryan_kuhn;i may be committing cinema heresy here, but i have complaints about the second lord of the rings film, the two towers. number one: it is excessively long. i know the books that the movie is based on is really really long, and for a book, that's a good thing. when someone is reading a good book, they never want to put it down, they want to be with frodo and sam forever as they dodge ring raiders and enter mordor, the home of mt. doom where the ring must finally end up. however, for a movie, it's tough to sit through a 3 hour plus movie, especially one that consists of nearly one hour of fighting between the good guys and the bad guys. what i personally find fascinating with the lord of the rings, the mythology of the ring and how the different characters are allowed to act within the rules of the middle earth universe, is there, but is pushed aside in favor of a dark, muddy fight. that leads to complaint number two: there are too many characters for non-die hards to keep track of. perhaps these two complaints come from the fact that my attention span is not as good as it used to be. now the good: gollum makes jar-jar binks looks like a simpsons' cartoon character. the combination of stop-action and cgi animation, gollum the whithered hobbit looks totally believable and is the most interesting character in the saga, i think. what happened to him? will the same thing happen to frodo? these are questions i had that were spurred on by watching the two towers. the walking, talking trees are also a triumph in technology, something like this could not happen just a few years ago. the empire strikes back is the best of the 3 star wars films, i think the two towers is the weakest of the lord of the rings films, so there is no definitive word on whether the middle chapter of trilogy suffers or gains compared to the surrounding chapters. it is not a bad film, again it looks great, has interesting characters, but i just wish some fat was trimmed off the film. i know die-hards would have a fit, but the length does keep some casual movie go-ers away, and there is plenty, especially in the end fight scene, to be taken away. but peter jackson has a houseful of oscars, and i don't, so what do i know?;13 February 2005;7;['second', 'long', 'long', 'good', 'good', 'tough', 'good', 'bad', 'fascinating', 'different', 'middle', 'dark', 'muddy', 'many', 'non', 'die', 'good', 'believable', 'interesting', 'same', 'few', 'good', 'weak', 'definitive', 'middle', 'bad', 'great', 'interesting', 'casual'];0.1554444444444444
261;mgruebel;"is this the first time hollywood trusted a director to just make a 9+ hour movie and serve it up in three slices (not sequels)? i think so. it was a good call by new line, especially considering that the director of ""heavenly creatures"" and ""dead alive"" did not exactly have mega-credentials. when i first read the book many decades ago, i learnt feanorian script and basic sindarin. i have read it many times since. so my expectations were high when i sat down for the film. in part 2, i must say i was mesmerized from gandalf's aerial battle with the balrog to smeagol reverting to gollum on the way to mordor. i forgive the liberties jackson took with faramir manhandling smeagol, as it does provide a reason for gollum's re-emergence. the full opus takes quite a few liberties with the book, from omissions (tom bombadil) to transpositions (warg attack on rohirrim in episode 2 rather than on the fellowship in episode 1) to inventions (sam being sent back home by frodo in act 3). it merges and deletes characters (arwen and her brother, eomer and erkenbrand), or invents them (the orc sharku, a play on saruman's nickname in a part of the book cut out entirely). many of them are preferable to the alternatives that were considered (for instance, arwen in film 2 showing up in aragorn's dream, rather than as a battle maiden at helm's deep). only rarely does it have plot holes (like frodo suddenly brandishing a sword at sam in osgiliath, when they are prisoners of faramir who surely removed all their weapons). perhaps the greatest liberty is the constant weakening of the moral fibre of characters for the sake of creating short-lived dramatic tension (like treebeard only making up his mind to fight when he sees that saruman has killed his trees; or faramir originally taking the ring towards minas tirith to echo his weaker brother). there is one incomprehensible artistic and business decision: why did jackson not just end the third film with the crowning of king elessar, and let saruman live (as in the book, and as was potentially implied in the theatrical release)? then they could have made a fourth film to take the hobbits to the scouring of the shire. anticlimax, you say? i bet film 4 would still have made a tidy sum because lotr mania was at a high level in the early 2000s. and it would have avoided that awkward never-ending-ending in return of the king. after seeing the income stream from 1-3, new line would have gone for #4 and given the hobbits their own little final battle. as a positive side effect, it would have toned the scale down a little at the end, thus allowing the hobbit, which is vastly overblown, to stay a little closer to the smaller scale of tolkien's earlier book. all of this is easy to forgive because the films hews close to the spirit of the book overall, and departures are usually corrected, as in sam's ""by all rights we shouldn't even be here (osgiliath)"" - and soon they weren't. it is visually a masterpiece. many have remarked that jackson has finally trumped kurosawa as the best big battle auteur, and i grudgingly admit it's true (although i still like ran better than lotr; it's one of a few films i give a ""10""). jackson forces bold acting out of the actors sometimes, with pathos and tears pushed to the verge of what is acceptable. the level of detail in the scenery, weaponry, sets, costumes, just everything, is absolutely amazing; and yet the filmmakers resisted the temptation to gloat over it. so much work for a few seconds of screen time! the film is complex and textured, a classic like gone with the wind and the better costume dramas of the 50s when it comes to big bold scale. in the end, the film became my visual impression of the books for the most part, and that's a great compliment because i had read the books multiple times and certainly formed mental pictures of what everything is like. even the young frodo worked for me in the end: who knows what a 50 year old hobbit looks like in a world where dunedain can still reach 100s of years of age? with all its flaws, this mammoth film is great cinema, and deserves its oscars and other accolades. it will be a long time before this story is remade.";18 January 2014;8;['first', 'good', 'new', 'heavenly', 'dead', 'alive', 'many', 'basic', 'many', 'high', 'aerial', 'full', 'few', 'many', 'preferable', 'deep', 'great', 'constant', 'moral', 'dramatic', 'treebeard', 'tirith', 'weak', 'incomprehensible', 'artistic', 'third', 'theatrical', 'fourth', 'tidy', 'high', 'early', 'awkward', 'new', 'own', 'little', 'final', 'positive', 'little', 'overblown', 'little', 'close', 'small', 'early', 'easy', 'many', 'good', 'big', 'true', 'few', 'acceptable', 'amazing', 'much', 'few', 'complex', 'textured', 'well', 'costume', 'big', 'bold', 'visual', 'most', 'great', 'multiple', 'mental', 'young', 'old', 'mammoth', 'great', 'other', 'long'];0.140610119047619

(2002) welcome to the second part of the trilogy. although not as good as the first, the two towers is definitely worth your time. the story is great. the fx are stunning as usual. the acting is quite awesome. what can i say? this movie also has a much darker quality to it. the evil nazguls are quite the terrifying sight. the sight of the 10,000 strong uruk-hai at helm's deep is indeed something else. the battle at helm's deep is quite awesome. although this movie is not as action based as it's predecessor, it's still delivers. the acting here has more depth. everyone delivers a good performance. elijah wood delivers a clinic. we also get to know gollum. a very disturbed being that has been torn apart by the evil ring. his personality is shaken. gollum is quite entertaining. his allegiance remains a mystery. at one point, gollum gets into a argument with himself that is a very entertaining sequence of scenes here. some problems are here though. the evil forces are not as menacing here as in the fellowship. don't get me wrong, they were still evil. something was missing. some uruk-hai's would get trounced without as even inflicting any pain to aragorn and his fellow warriors. as much as gimli is fun, the comedy gets a little bit old. gimli in the fellowship was more serious, here he is more comedy. sometimes, comedy needs time off. the last word: excellent. the two towers delivers well. if you liked the fellowship of the ring(chapter 1 in the trilogy), you will enjoy chapter 2: the two towers. recommended.;13 December 2006;8;['second', 'good', 'first', 'worth', 'great', 'stunning', 'usual', 'awesome', 'dark', 'evil', 'terrifying', 'strong', 'awesome', 'more', 'good', 'disturbed', 'evil', 'entertaining', 'entertaining', 'evil', 'wrong', 'evil', 'fellow', 'gimli', 'fun', 'little', 'old', 'gimli', 'serious', 'more', 'last', 'excellent'];0.0950892857142857
268;dkncd;"""the lord of the rings: the two towers"" is the second installment in peter jackson's fabled adaptations of tolkien's novels. once again the costumes, scenes, sets, models, effects and epic score of howard shore work together to create a great atmosphere. the core cast from the first film is back and once again proves adept. several new characters appear in this film and are once again well-cast. bernard hill is authoritative and inspiring as king theoden of rohan. miranda otto is notable as eowyn, though her best moments would come in the third film. brad dourif was a perfect choice for the conniving grima wormtongue. david wenham and karl urban are effective as the warriors faramir and eomer. john rhys-davies, in addition to playing gimli, is memorable for providing the voice for treebeard. like with the first film, this film streamlines tolkien's work but largely remains faithful to it to create a well-paced film. the conflict at helm's deep is spectacular and the second best fantasy battle ever filmed next to the battle in ""return of the king"" (2003). my only complaint with this film is the alterations to faramir's character. the ""two towers"" book made a clear distinction between faramir and boromir's personalities, but in this film they are homogenized. however, this is a minor blemish in what is otherwise an outstanding film. as with the last film, i found that the added scenes for the extended edition were interesting but didn't add much above and beyond the theatre cut.";5 October 2007;10;['second', 'fabled', 'epic', 'great', 'first', 'adept', 'several', 'new', 'authoritative', 'inspiring', 'notable', 'good', 'third', 'perfect', 'effective', 'gimli', 'memorable', 'first', 'faithful', 'spectacular', 'second', 'good', 'only', 'clear', 'minor', 'outstanding', 'last', 'extended', 'interesting'];0.357167832167832
269;tapio_hietamaki;the two towers is one of the biggest and most successful sequels ever. it's not really even a sequel in the sense that the word is usually used, because the lord of the rings movies were filmed back to back and were always intended to be a single colossal story. other successful sequels (terminator 2, aliens, the godfather part 2, even the empire strikes back) are follow-ups to self-contained stories. the lord of the rings was largely unprecedented in that the creators knew in advance that there would be three movies to tell their story. it isn't that uncommon nowadays but in the early 2000's it was a big deal. the lord of the rings functions as a 9-hour movie (or 10-hour if you watch the extended edition). the two towers isn't recommended to be watched on its own. but if you've seen the other movies and want to revisit it, the two towers does have its own arc, although the story goes on the central conflicts are resolved. the last part, the return of the king, won 11 oscars and is regarded as one of the greatest movies ever (currently sitting at the 8th spot on the imdb top 250 list), but i think that movie is too bloated and blinded by special effects. i prefer the two towers. this part introduces new characters and settings and ups the stakes, while retaining the humanity and groundedness of the first part. the two towers is known for its exploration of the country of rohan and its people. they have an iconic piece of theme music, you get chills just remembering it. their people is a proud and old one, designed to be stylistically reminiscent of old anglo-saxons or celts, yet we get the sense that they live in the shadow of gondor where the real power of men lies. they fight the corruption of the traitorous wizard saruman and his orc army. they bring depth to the fantastical world: good and evil both have various forms. the rohan story is really only half of the movie, the other half follows the hobbits frodo and sam through abandoned gondorian country, hindered by the noble yet struggling hero faramir and aided by the treacherous gollum, a wonder of cgi special effects who largely influenced future filmmakers.;28 March 2017;10;['big', 'successful', 'single', 'other', 'successful', 'unprecedented', 'uncommon', 'early', 'big', 'extended', 'own', 'other', 'own', 'central', 'last', 'great', 'bloated', 'special', 'new', 'first', 'iconic', 'proud', 'old', 'reminiscent', 'old', 'real', 'traitorous', 'fantastical', 'good', 'evil', 'various', 'other', 'noble', 'treacherous', 'special', 'future'];0.2469103477167993
270;Ozzy2000;"it is a great pity that people cannot distinguish between great works of literature and the failure to exemplify these works in the cinema graphic medium. these three films adapted from the great work were shot on low quality film and in a manner to make the greatest profit from as much exploitation of its artisans as possible. for example peter jackson knew that he could new zealand citizens to be extras at no costs due to the novelty of under taking such a project of this magnitude and glamor in a parochial isolated hometown new zealand countryside. peter jackson, fran walsh and philipa boynes bought the film rights of the great literature for a massive cost and then hired scriptwriters to prepare the screenplay adaptation in their names at great cost. this was a very poor screenplay if you really loved the books and actually read them which most of the films audience probably never could or did. how the motion picture academy members voted it best screenplay adaption and gave the award to these three people is rather suspicious. the cinematography was very poor with many shots out of focus and overuse of various camera techniques. this has been supported many cinematographers in many blogs. the acting performances were very mediocre and the selection of actors was purposefully chosen from australians and new zealanders due to peter jackson's view that they are better actors than americans and the british. in fact australians and new zealanders have this strange dislike americans despite consuming their films. the animations of various creatures was so similar to the vampires in ""dusk till dawn"" it makes you wonder if the cgi people had much imagination. the many gratuitously violent scenes, not described as such in the books, would have been very frightening to children let alone the ridiculous characterization of the golum. in fact most of the cgi was carried out by americans hired by peter jacksons multi-million dollar cgi suite. which at the end of the day makes you wonder where mr peter jackson got the money to not only buy the film rights to the books but to build a multi-million dollar film effects studio in new zealand. the whole thing was obviously a massive profit making exercise in profit making with peter jackson and his mates securing huge merchandising deals in the planning of the project.it is further proof that the very wealthy and privileged can always demonstrate what their money can achieve not what they themselves can achieve due to any talent or real imagination. it was not made for the sake of love of a great work of literature but for profit and self aggrandizement. i fully understand that films must make profit but this one really couldn't go wrong with the material and the present day innovations in cgi. i am certain that one day someone will remake it and do it properly and maybe some one like john boorman who was originally going to make the film. i am so content in thought that there is a great difference between people like myself and the people who glorify this film and peter jackson.";29 June 2007;1;['great', 'great', 'great', 'low', 'great', 'much', 'possible', 'parochial', 'isolated', 'fran', 'philipa', 'great', 'massive', 'great', 'poor', 'most', 'good', 'suspicious', 'poor', 'many', 'various', 'many', 'many', 'mediocre', 'new', 'well', 'new', 'strange', 'various', 'similar', 'much', 'many', 'violent', 'such', 'frightening', 'ridiculous', 'most', 'multi', 'whole', 'massive', 'huge', 'further', 'wealthy', 'privileged', 'real', 'great', 'wrong', 'present', 'certain', 'content', 'great'];0.2154789654789655
271;A_Voice;rarely it is seen that sequels manage to keep up to the originals, generally heavily criticized by the fans of the original. but the two towers is a gem of a film and a jewel of a sequel. nor does it go astray, neither it looses its pace. it is as beautiful as the the lord of the rings: the fellowship of the ring. also as beautiful as the book itself. frodo and sam continue with their quest and are finally united with gollum, meanwhile merry and pippin finally get to play their part in the war. aragorn and others fight to protect the rohirrims from the armies of sauruman's uruk high. just like the fellowship of the ring this film excels in breathtaking cinematography, sound, original score, make up, set designs and visual effects. also the character design, creating a haunting and pitiful gollum, straight out of the book, i wonder if tolkien actually wanted gollum to be like that? also it's superbly digitally acted by andy serkis, who reaches new heights of digital acting. the film also has some superior character development as it further sketches the characters of previously un-scketched characters like frodo, aragorn and too some extent legolas. eoweyn brings in a good deal of famine element in the movie. according to the book, ents are the most sluggish or boring creatures in the middle earth, and jackson made sure to make their parts 'boring' (a little tongue in cheek). direction: flawless as before. script/screenplay: strong and superb. acting: i feel sad the andy wasn't nominated in any major award ceremony, he was superb. elijah shines too. others are convincing. music: extremely good, though not as good as the fellowship but still great and haunting. its a delight to see how gollum's last scene blends into gollum's song. overall, not a movie but an experience.;16 January 2014;10;['original', 'beautiful', 'beautiful', 'united', 'aragorn', 'uruk', 'original', 'visual', 'pitiful', 'new', 'digital', 'superior', 'scketched', 'aragorn', 'good', 'famine', 'sluggish', 'boring', 'middle', 'sure', 'boring', 'little', 'strong', 'superb', 'sad', 'major', 'superb', 'convincing', 'good', 'good', 'great', 'last'];0.2914457070707071

273;grumpy-3;the first one was beyond brilliant and now jackson carries on the story and tackles the difficult middle bit with such style brilliance and depth. if only more movies were as good. two towers has such emotion in it that myself and the audiences i watched the film twice now with, were caught up so thoroughly and deeply. on top of that the greatest cgi character yet on film, gollum, is so real and rounded as a character (where is the oscar nomination for best supporting actor). and as one british critic wrote the two sides of gollum was so much better done than willem defoe in the dreadful spiderman. i am writing this on the day the oscar nominations have been announced and it is a travesty that two towers has not received nominations in the main categories, jackson left out in favour of the much overrated scorcese for a not very good film. but then the academy have always been dreadful at recognising real talent, their history shows only too often their ignorance of truly gifted people and films.;12 February 2003;10;['first', 'brilliant', 'difficult', 'middle', 'such', 'more', 'good', 'such', 'great', 'real', 'oscar', 'good', 'british', 'dreadful', 'main', 'much', 'overrated', 'good', 'dreadful', 'real', 'gifted'];0.187037037037037

275;atzimo;"let me start off by saying that 'the two towers' was definitely worth the oscar for visual effects. the golum character is a marvel of the arts and technology. all the visual effects in this movie are better than the first one (where you could even see the wires in the gandalf-saruman battle). now, i believe that they should make only one lotr, not a trilogy. take for instance the complete 'two towers'. it could be easily omitted in its entirety, as it doesn't really advance the story any further and frankly i believe that the only thing it offers is the great golum graphics. just because there are three books, doesn't mean that there must be three movies. everyone's treating 'lord of the rings' like something sacred, which is not. it's like oscar wilde said- ""anyone can write a three volume novel. all it takes is complete ignorance of both life and literature."" 3/10";26 April 2003;2;['worth', 'visual', 'visual', 'well', 'first', 'gandalf', 'complete', 'only', 'great', 'sacred', 'complete'];0.19375
276;Barky44;"long before it came out, i knew the two towers would be the toughest of the three lord of the rings books to put on film. not only is it the middle child, but the very structure of the book makes it hard to craft a linear story with all the plot lines in tact and interesting. but i think peter jackson and company did a very good job. it's not as strong as fellowship, but is still outstanding. all the elements of the lotr films are here: the beautiful photography, set designs, costumes, scenery, special effects. all amazing, all brilliant, all oscar-worthy. the performances are terrific, too. bernard hill, viggo mortensen, elijah wood, miranda otto, all did great jobs. the supporting actors, too. it is sad that ian mckellan's role is relegated to almost cameo status, but that's the nature of the book. the biggest shame is christopher lee. he has so little screen time in this film, i think he only says two or three lines on camera, the rest is ""brooding"". such a waste, he is one of the great actors of our time, a real joy to watch (and a scene stealer to boot). but the stars of the piece have to be gollum and treebeard and the uruk army. the sequence with the ents seeing the destruction saruman wrought upon the trees brought tears to my eyes, and their revenge brought cheers to my voice. the battle of helm's deep was probably too long, but impressive nonetheless (and will probably be the model for ""epic battle sequences"" for years to come). and gollum. what can be said about gollum that hasn't already been said. we have entered into a new age of cgi, and, like all great works of art, it has a human soul. a great film. 9 out of 10, the only items keeping it from getting a 10 are the short-shrifting of christopher lee and that some parts don't quite flow too well (a problem rooted in jrr tolkien's novel, not the fault of the filmmakers).";5 August 2004;9;['tough', 'middle', 'very', 'hard', 'linear', 'interesting', 'good', 'strong', 'outstanding', 'lotr', 'beautiful', 'special', 'amazing', 'brilliant', 'worthy', 'terrific', 'great', 'sad', 'big', 'little', 'great', 'real', 'uruk', 'long', 'impressive', 'epic', 'new', 'great', 'human', 'great', 'only', 'short'];0.2965934858792001
277;senortuffy;"i have to admit, i'm completely won over by the masterful work director peter jackson has done with tolkien's ""lord of the rings"" trilogy. i'm not particularly a fan of george lucas' ""star wars"" movies and thought the ""star trek"" films to be inconsistent, so fantasy isn't exactly my thing. but after watching ""fellowship of the ring"" and ""the two towers"" back to back the past few nights, i'm absolutely stunned by the magnitude of the achievement here. this film picks up right where the first installment left off, with the fellowship having dissolved. frodo leaves with sam as company so that he may take the ring to mordor and destroy it in the fire from which it was created. the others leave to fight the battle for middle earth as saruman has unleashed his army from isengard. the battle scenes between the men of rohan and their elf allies against the urik-hai, the half men, half orc creatures bred by saruman, are amazing. digital technology plays a major part in these scenes, but as mentioned in a previous review, it is so seamless with the real cinematography that the result is just stunning. gollum, a digitally created image, plays a major part in this installment. he's one of the classic characters in tolkien's work, and i wondered how they could possibly portray him as i imagined, but the result is perfect. the digital artists struck just the right balance between a prowling little creature attempting to regain the ring and a pitiful figure twisted by its power. like the first movie in the trilogy, this one is long (three hours plus), but it's such an epic film and full of so many characters and so much detail, that you're sucked in anyways. at times, you're reminded of shakespeare, and at other times one of those disney cartoons from before the war, like ""snow white."" these films are a wonderful creation and i hope everyone enjoys them as much as i have.

278;quinimdb;"""the two towers"" has just the same amount of heart as ""fellowship"", but on a much bigger scale. in this film, the fellowship from the first film is now split up into small groups of two or three, but in a way they are closer than ever. the last film showed how the characters care for each other inspired courage in them, and how without each other they were nothing. this film shows this on a bigger scale, not just uniting the characters even closer, but the races of humans, elves, and ents, showing that in the end they are all fighting for the same cause, for some good in the world. this film introduces one of the most tortured and iconic characters of the series, golemn... or, smeagle. at first glance he seems like a monster, but really he is just torn into 2 halves, one loyal and scared, the other dominating and deceitful, and everyday is a struggle fir him. sam dislikes him and distrusts him, but no one understands his struggle more than frodo. frodo has seen it almost happen to bilbo, and its happening to him. the ring is beginning to overtake him. frodo needs to know that smeagle/golem can get better, because then he can believe that there is still hope for him that he can go back to the way he was. there is a large war in this film with great action, but the action also highlights the way in which the characters have developed. they work with each and help each other not to survive, but because they care for each other, and they know that they must unite against the bad that there is in the world. there are great character moments such as the moment where gimli asks aragorn to throw him, showing his trust for him while in the previous movie he states, ""no one throws a dwarf"". mary and pippin are almost killed, but they run into a forest and are taken away by ents, who turn out to be rather friendly. but when they meet to discuss what they should do about this war that is happening, they choose not to intervene. mary is upset because he knows the long term effect of what will happen if the orcs win the war (""there will be no shire""). but when the ent sees fields of his fallen friends, he knows that he must fight with those that are still alive with him, because you can use apathy to hide from the dangers of the world as much as you'd like, but eventually they will catch up with you, so the only thing you can do is fight for what you have left. at many times it seems there is no hope for the characters, specifically aragorn and frodo, but aragorn continues on because he knows that arwen will be waiting for him on the other side. frodo continues because, as we find out through an incredibly heartfelt speech by sam, they believe that there is still good in the world, and it's worth fighting for. that is just one line from his fantastic speech, but it embodies what i love about the lord of the rings movies. there may be hobbits and elves and orcs and magic and dwarfs and wizards and even talking trees, but it is a deeply human story. just like our world, there is also lots of hate and temptation and evil, but eventually it all passes, because we have people like frodo and sam, who are not super heroes, but normal human beings who are scared and absolutely need each other to regain courageous, but they know that there is good in the world that is worth fighting for.";27 May 2016;10;['same', 'big', 'first', 'small', 'close', 'last', 'other', 'other', 'big', 'same', 'tortured', 'iconic', 'first', 'loyal', 'scared', 'other', 'deceitful', 'well', 'large', 'great', 'other', 'other', 'bad', 'great', 'such', 'gimli', 'previous', 'friendly', 'upset', 'long', 'alive', 'apathy', 'only', 'many', 'aragorn', 'other', 'heartfelt', 'good', 'worth', 'fantastic', 'human', 'super', 'normal', 'human', 'scared', 'other', 'courageous', 'good', 'worth'];0.1306390977443609
279;Pavel-8;"**warning! mild spoilers ahead!** there are a handful of issues i have with this movie. i thought the cross-cutting between stories was disjointing due to the vastly different paces of each tale. i noticed a few blatant blue screen shots. some of the dialogue seemed out of place, almost hokey. and on top of all of that, the film suffered from being the middle one in a trilogy, a film that by definition did not contain a true start or finish. having said all of that, i still choose it as my best film of 2002 for this reason. after i saw ""chicago,"" i sneaked across the theater hall to catch the last half hour of ""two towers"" again. not even close. i thoroughly enjoyed ""chicago"" (#2 or #3 of 2002), but ""two towers"" was simply on another level. it completely swept me away into middle earth as i relished the final battle for helm's deep. gandalf and company streaking down the hill into the enemy was one of the best movie moments of the year. the emotion seemed quite real, and even the slight melodrama didn't bother me at all. other highlights...the opening sequence of gandalf and the balrog was excellent, yanking the audience back into the story as though they never left. all the battle scenes were not only epic, but cohesive. some directors just don't seem to know how to put a fluid and continuous battle together (see ""gladiator""). but these (helm's deep primarily) were fantastic, ranking among the best ever on film. bottom line: the best movies pull you into their world, make you feel their emotions, and relate to their characters.

280;RIK-22;very similar feeling to the first film. certainly everyone can admire the effort and hard work that must have gone into making these three films. i have never read the books and probably never will, so i can't comment on whether the original material was worthy of praise, but as films, they are poor. i can only assume, by the large amount of hysterical praise both films have received, that people decide before even watching the film, that it is great or that audiences just wish to see special fx. just like the first movie, there's lots of little sub plots going on, but for what reason, none of the external characters seem to have any purpose or add anything to the story. the complete mess of a story is virtually non-existent and by the end you realise after all the pompous procrastination you have a very simple battle sequence. what were the first 2 hours about ? the biggest crime of this film is that you don't care about any of the characters, nothing is explained really, none of the motivations of any of the characters seem genuine. in the end, you see that the main cast of characters basically are invincible, so who cares, they're going to win, there is no tension, no edge. the fx, which seems to be the main reason everyone is watching the film, range from very good to very average. the laughable tree sequences never really look real or believable. parts of the battle sequence were comedic, they were so over-the-top. the bottom line is really if people were more honest and looked at this film or it predecessor without pre-judging it as a book conversion, they would see that although there's lots of fx and lot's of things going on, the film is a muddled mess and not really worthy of such high praise.;7 February 2003;1;['similar', 'first', 'hard', 'original', 'worthy', 'poor', 'large', 'hysterical', 'great', 'special', 'first', 'little', 'external', 'complete', 'non', 'existent', 'pompous', 'simple', 'first', 'big', 'genuine', 'main', 'invincible', 'main', 'good', 'average', 'laughable', 'real', 'believable', 'comedic', 'bottom', 'honest', 'muddled', 'worthy', 'such', 'high'];0.1313307823129252

286;Starbuck-13;"this second part of the trilogy starts right in the middle of the action and goes on for over three hours without ever lowering the excitement. it ends a little bit sooner than the second book does - probably to offer christopher lee a chance to appear in the third part as well - and left me with only one notion: ""what? is it over already???"" i watched the movie at midnight on opening day, and at three o'clock at night i was not one little bit tired. all i wanted was the movie to continue right now - but i guess we'll have to wait another year... compared to ""the fellowship"", this movie has fewer epic moments (as boromirs death, the hobbits being hunted by the nazgul or the forming of the fellowship) but is somehow told faster without focusing too much on action scenes alone. the shifting between the three different storylines (rohan (aragorn), rohan (merry/pippin) and mordor) makes the movie much more interesting than the book with its very rigid way of telling the story. this way, not a hint of boredom comes up, and the huge cast of characters has a chance to be shown in equal parts. certainly, the story in mordor was somehow kept shorter than it could have been, but jackson had to cut somewhere and he did right by rather highlighting the events happening in rohan. as for gollum: i would never have imagined that technology was thus far advanced! the facial impressions of gollum were tremendous, at first i really was appalled about how ugly he was, but jackson really captured the essence of gollum and made him one of the most sophisticatedly portrayed characters of the film. an oscar for gollum? it's an opportunity! many of the other characters were developed further like aragorn, sam or gimli whose comic relief elements were just right: not too much, but certainly right on the mark! the only thing i cannot really fathom right now is the way the arwen character goes, how eowyn fits in the picture compared to the books and why the rohan storyline ended right after the helms deep battle instead of in isengard. oh yes: and the attack on helms deep was great in the beginning and in the middle, but in the end - after the rohirrim showed up - it seemed rather hastened, it ended too suddenly for my taste. not to mention the reality check when aragorn and gimli are fighting alone against hundreds of orcs - but well, they are heroes after all, so who am i to criticize :-) ?";19 December 2002;10;['second', 'little', 'second', 'third', 'little', 'tired', 'few', 'epic', 'different', 'interesting', 'rigid', 'huge', 'equal', 'short', 'advanced', 'facial', 'tremendous', 'ugly', 'many', 'other', 'gimli', 'comic', 'right', 'much', 'only', 'deep', 'great', 'gimli'];0.0737103174603174

289;Kubris;imdb top 250: 30 the lord of the rings: the two towers continues the epic story that began in fellowship of the ring. we meet new characters, develop others, and see epic battles. there is such a phenomenon in film called 'middle film syndrome' or something of the sort. it means that in a trilogy, the middle film is the weakest because it isn't exposition like the first film, or conclusion like the third. the two towers is a perfect example of this concept. the awe of fellowship isn't present, and the finish of return of the king doesn't happen, leaving... the middle. i'm not trying to say two towers is a bad film. but compared to the other lord of the rings films, it is. they're aaa, towers is aa. the characters introduced, like the king and nephew in rohan, are thrown into the story without a reasonable introduction. the battle for helm's deep isn't that spectacular. humour is misplaced. even the films colour is wrong. some of these factors can't really be fixed, because of the books, but some of them should've been dealt with. there are still some great parts of two towers. gollum is nuts, batty and crazy. his presence helps frodo and sam's scenes, which don't actually go anywhere. the dead marshes are creepy. ringwraiths return- on new mounts. and the tree battle, the only epic scene in the movie. most of my problems with two towers are that the scale is diminished, no scenes other than the battle at isengard leave the viewer in awe. the battle for helm's deep was also... not great. the sides weren't even close to being reasonable, making the result unbelievable. the colouring of the last battle made it seem very dark and bleak, but gimli became a walking joke and legolas rode a shield/surfboard. clashing themes. the orcs didn't have anything special in that battle to make the battle interesting. in a series with groundbreaking battles, two towers came up short. the two towers is a good film, but a mediocre lord of the rings film. if for some reason you see it before the other two, the others are far better. not much else i can say, you're either in it for all 3 or not in it. fear not, return of the king is the strongest, a worthy finish of your time. 8.3/10;21 August 2011;8;['epic', 'new', 'epic', 'middle', 'middle', 'weak', 'first', 'third', 'perfect', 'present', 'bad', 'other', 'aa', 'reasonable', 'spectacular', 'wrong', 'great', 'nuts', 'crazy', 'dead', 'creepy', 'new', 'only', 'epic', 'most', 'other', 'great', 'close', 'reasonable', 'unbelievable', 'last', 'dark', 'bleak', 'gimli', 'special', 'interesting', 'groundbreaking', 'short', 'good', 'mediocre', 'other', 'well', 'much', 'strong', 'worthy'];0.0551720209614946

300;FrankBooth_DeLarge;in this trilogy there is a beginning that sets up the audience for the characters and the plot, then there is a sequel where the characters continue on from where the first leaves off, certain things happen throughout the second one that prepare everyone for the third, and in the third everything comes to an awesome and amazing ending. the two towers picks up from where the fellowship of the ring left off. (spoilers ahead) in the end of the fellowship: gandalf fell off a ledge after defeating the balrog, boromir was shot by orc arrows, merry and pippin were captured by orcs, frodo and sam left and continued on their quest to mordor, aragorn, legolas, and gimli decided to follow the orcs and rescue merry and pippin. the two towers basically follows their adventures and shows how gandalf, aragorn, legolas, and gimli are all reunited, merry and pippin are rescued by the ents after their captors are attacked, and frodo and sam encounter the creature gollum and ask him for help in getting to mordor. the two towers is a much more complicated story, as there is a subplot involving a falling kingdom and their struggle to survive as orcs are trying to destroy them all. the two towers is another feast to the eyes and imagination just like the fellowship of the ring. there is a great battle scene in this at the climax of the story, but the battles in return of the king make the battle in this movie seem like a brief sprawl.;24 December 2004;10;['first', 'certain', 'second', 'third', 'third', 'awesome', 'amazing', 'gimli', 'gandalf', 'aragorn', 'gimli', 'creature', 'complicated', 'great', 'brief'];0.2364285714285715
301;matlock-6;while certainly a very good movie, visually appealing, dramatic and awe inspiring in many ways, the two towers is not as good as the fellowship of the ring for many of the same reasons fotr could have been better. peter jackson takes some liberties with the characters here that weren't taken in the first film. faramir, while ably portrayed, doesn't seem quite right. and the scene in which aragorn falls into a coma and dreams about arwen (conveniently providing a heavy kiss romance scene) is a good scene, but also wasn't a part of the original story. all these are acceptable, as many of them make the film better than it would otherwise be, however, there are two glaring omissions, both involving orcs. the scenes which involve merry and pippin being held captive by the two different bands of orcs, and fought over by grishnak and the uruk-hai leader (i forget his name). some of the arguments ans conversations here were among the best in the book and are missed. also, as has been mentioned by other here, the orcs, while certainly vile, frightening and mean looking, are far too puny during fights. especially the uruk-hai, who are supposed to be a kind of super-orc, are mowed down left and right simply by aragorn and theoden riding their horses through them. while we see orcs being slain left and right, we rarely see the orcs defeating any humans, elves or whomever. the orcs were vicious, formidable fighters in tolkien's book, and instead, are portrayed like the storm troopers in star wars, whose primary role seems to be to continually lose fights. they should lose, since that's how the story goes, but they don't have to be routed. probably not as good as it could have been, but still enjoyable.;23 December 2002;9;['good', 'appealing', 'dramatic', 'many', 'good', 'many', 'same', 'well', 'first', 'right', 'heavy', 'good', 'original', 'acceptable', 'many', 'glaring', 'captive', 'different', 'good', 'other', 'vile', 'frightening', 'puny', 'orc', 'right', 'aragorn', 'vicious', 'formidable', 'primary', 'good', 'enjoyable'];0.2407867494824017
302;SeminolePhenom;the journey to mount doom continues for only sam (sean astin) and frodo (elijah wood). the fellowship has been broken, but not entirely. aragorn (viggo mortensen), legolas (orlando bloom), and gimli (john rhys-davies) have stuck together in an attempt to regroup with the captured hobbits (pippin and merry). darkness becomes stronger than ever in middle earth as saruman (christopher lee) creates the army of isengard and sarun grows more powerful. the adventure grows more perilous in the 2nd part of the epic trilogy. what can be said more than this is singly one of the greatest films ever created? the acting is phenomenal in this film. the fellowship showed great supporting roles, but nothing real strong from the main characters which the two towers is filled with. elijah wood really starts to express the power that the ring posses and viggo mortensen gives a performance unlike any other. gandalf may have been wonderful in the previous film as well as this one, but the other characters really just start to shine in the two towers. you really start to see the characters transition into the hero. the story takes a whole new level in this film also. the adventurers experience roahn, one of the kingdoms of man for the first time on film and are greeted with grief that has not been seen in the lord of the rings films yet. not to mention the greatest battle scene ever put on film! the battle at helm's deep is the most phenomenal battle of all time. it is only a totally different league with battles from other movies like braveheat or gladiator. overall, the two towers is one of the greatest films of all time. enough said!! i highly recommend this film.;25 December 2005;10;['aragorn', 'gimli', 'strong', 'middle', 'powerful', 'perilous', 'epic', 'more', 'great', 'phenomenal', 'great', 'strong', 'main', 'other', 'wonderful', 'previous', 'other', 'whole', 'new', 'first', 'great', 'phenomenal', 'different', 'other', 'great', 'enough'];0.3120882740447958

305;fearfulofspiders;"the lord of the rings - the fellowship of the ring was a fantastic start to tolkien's epic tale. the only true weakness of the two towers -- if you can call it a flaw -- is that the film is the middle-child, in that it has no beginning and no end. though it starts out where the first ended, the two towers begins with a recap of gandalf's battle with the balrog as we continue to see their fight as they plummet thousands (if not miles) of feet through gaping chasms in the mines of moria. the acting is just as great as the first, and with the addition of new characters, the film's atmosphere has gone from ""new and wondrous"" to ""grim and hopeless"". needless to say, andy serkis as gollum is one of the best performances of the new decade. bernard hill does a wonderful job as theoden, as well as miranda otto as eowyn. karl urban is a nice choice as eomer, nephew of the king. possibly the best of the new characters is faramir, played by david wenham. unlike the passive-type as portrayed in the books, this faramir is more troubled and only corruptible by the ring because of his desire to be accepted by his close-minded father -- a nice change made by the writers. the character treebeard is a reflection of the greatness of the cg work on gollum; both are exquisite. the writing and directing equals the fellowship of the ring, in that the continuity remains, never feeling like we missed any key moments in the plot. the only real flaw, which is mainly due to pacing and events leading up to the return of the king, is the vast expansion of frodo and sam's journey to mordor, aided by the insidious gollum. the changes and omissions were once again necessary to provide a decent pace and focus on the ever-rising tension of what all leads up to: the battle at helm's deep. yet, with the massive battle near the final 30-40 minutes of the film, there's plenty more to keep a viewer attached to the screen. fully seeing the massive software at work, the special effects incorporated with the miniatures/bigatures still dazzle the eyes in flawless execution, as 10,000 uruk-hai soldiers lay siege to a seemingly impenetrable fortress. from the mumakil (elephants) to the fell beasts upon which the ringwraiths ride, we are given the introduction of creatures that play major roles in the following film. howard shore's evolution with the leitmotifs he created from the first film have now been shifted towards a more explosive composition. equaling the fellowship of the ring, the music for the two towers is nothing short of awe-inspiring. from the theme of rohan to the thundering might of isengard, the two towers is full of rousing composition. there's also beautiful moments between aragorn and arwen, as well as some wonderful choral work for the last march of the ents. overall, while different from the text in terms of time-line, the two towers is an extraordinary sequel to a ""trilogy"" destined for greatness. while the film ends before the events in shelob's tunnel, there's no doubt one will be amazed in what is to come. one must see this film.";26 August 2008;10;['fantastic', 'epic', 'only', 'true', 'middle', 'first', 'great', 'first', 'new', 'new', 'wondrous', 'grim', 'hopeless', 'needless', 'good', 'new', 'wonderful', 'theoden', 'nice', 'good', 'new', 'passive', 'troubled', 'corruptible', 'close', 'minded', 'nice', 'exquisite', 'key', 'only', 'real', 'due', 'vast', 'insidious', 'necessary', 'decent', 'deep', 'massive', 'final', 'more', 'massive', 'special', 'flawless', 'uruk', 'impenetrable', 'major', 'first', 'explosive', 'short', 'inspiring', 'full', 'beautiful', 'wonderful', 'choral', 'last', 'different', 'extraordinary', 'amazed'];0.2195021645021645
306;bburns;"i think i may be the only person i know who still prefers ""the fellowship of the ring"" to ""the two towers"". that doesn't take much away from this film, it's just that truly perfect films are rare, and it's hard to make lightning strike twice. i have only three real problems with this film. the first is gandalf. in the first film, gandalf the grey was a kindly, grandfatherly figure. in this one, gandalf the white is cold and strangely distant (admittedly, this is a problem with the original source material, so i guess that jackson was just being true to the book). also, in the first film, ian mckellen's prosthetics looked like real hair and a real beard. in this one, they look like the stage props they are. the second problem is that it lingers for far too long on the battle of helms deep. true, i have not read the books in years, but i don't remember that much attention being paid to this battle. i think it was just an excuse to focus on aragorn so women would sit through the movie, and also to make sure the audience remembered the spectacular visual effects. the third problem is the most pervasive. as i recall, the book was mostly about the frodo & his relationship with gollum. in the film, elijah wood is given little to do besides swoon under the ring's power. and gollum is the most compelling character in the film. he should have been given more screen time. but all in all, this is an excellent film. i was particularly wowed by the aforementioned special effects, and by gollum. i knew when i saw the effects that i was watching cgi animation. but the only times i could truly *see* that was when gollum made a particularly rubbery smile, or when treebeard showed an expression other than annoyance on his face. i also really liked the way gollum was portrayed by andy serkis, and the particular attention paid to the internal battle between good smeagol and wicked gollum. i think my favorite thing about the movie, though, was treebeard and the other ents. in many ways they reminded me of the clay figurines come to life in ""heavenly creatures"" (the first peter jackson film to have an impact in the u.s. other than as just a cult phenomenon). ""the fellowship of the ring"" was the best film of its type to come along since ""the empire strikes back"", and ""the two towers""--although it may not be the masterpiece that ""fellowship"" was--proves that ""the lord of the rings"" (barring a truly wretched ""return of the king"") is the best trilogy since the original ""star wars"" trilogy. 9 out of 10.";24 May 2003;9;['only', 'perfect', 'rare', 'hard', 'real', 'first', 'gandalf', 'first', 'grandfatherly', 'cold', 'distant', 'original', 'true', 'first', 'real', 'real', 'second', 'long', 'deep', 'true', 'much', 'aragorn', 'sure', 'spectacular', 'visual', 'third', 'pervasive', 'little', 'compelling', 'more', 'excellent', 'aforementioned', 'special', 'only', 'rubbery', 'other', 'particular', 'internal', 'good', 'wicked', 'favorite', 'treebeard', 'other', 'many', 'heavenly', 'first', 'other', 'good', 'wretched', 'good', 'original'];0.2306318681318681

""the two towers"" has just opened. one can foresee the after-viewing thoughts and debates to explode any time now. at the threshold of this taste-variant blood bath, all i can say is, let it be... i have seen and since loved that seminal opening chapter to the lord of the rings trilogy, ""the fellowship of the ring"". like that much loved film, i do not judge ""the two towers"" as a stand-alone movie with flaws for nitpicking. i look upon it as a further unveiling of peter jackson's lotr mythology, his visionary adaptation from book to screen. but that's just my take and my take alone...all are free to disagree with this humble reviewer as i'm not a believer in ""taste-dictatorship"". notice i stated peter jackson's and not tolkien's lotr. with all due respect for jrr tolkien (and the wrath of his literary groupies), i think that lotr should by now be just as much a labour of love for jackson as it once was for tolkien. judged as work of art in another artistic medium (film), what jackson has achieved, is in my humble opinion, a masterpiece in its own right. dissenters of lotr movies, we know who you are. in an ideal world, we will respect each other for the movies we like, the faith we practice and the lives we lead. but in reality, nothing is as black and white as middle-earth. for good or evil, i have thus come to terms with the spectrum of people's reaction to this much debated film series. i will thus accept in grace the searing attacks or equally gushing compliments ttt will likely garner in the days and weeks ahead. i have nothing more to add on my present state of mind. that i love the lord of the rings movies, is but a given. that i am now taking the higher road of no more bickering is my choice. a choice which i pray i will have the strength to honour. consider that my leap of faith. in conclusion, the story is far from over. like gandalf's famous last words in ttt (the movie), ""the battle for helm's deep may be over, but the battle for middle earth has just begun..."" till then, i shall breathe, while i wait for ""the return of the king""...peace and out.";18 December 2002;10;['variant', 'seminal', 'much', 'alone', 'further', 'visionary', 'free', 'humble', 'due', 'literary', 'much', 'artistic', 'humble', 'own', 'ideal', 'other', 'black', 'white', 'middle', 'good', 'evil', 'much', 'more', 'present', 'high', 'more', 'famous', 'last', 'deep', 'middle'];0.1281944444444444

320;Tin Man-5;"*spoilers* i've seen it, i've sat on it, i've thought about it, and i'm going to go see it again tonight. for now, here is my verdict: there are a lot of things i can forgive for the sake of poetic license. among them: 1. faramir. my favorite character from the books. period. at first, i was pissed off. now, i understand that poetic license had to be taken to make the character and his interaction with the movie for tense. in the end, he resists the ring, and his character was shown having the integrity and strength that boromir lacked. not exactly the brilliant foil for his older brother and father that he was in the book, but the tension helped with galadriel's monologue about the ""sons of gondor taking the ring."" 2. the different ending. or rather, the cut-off point being different from the book. they killed boromir at the end of fotr anyway, so having also altered the beginning, i can see why they would save frodo's capture for the beginning of rotk to maintain better story arcs. 3. aragorn's fall off the cliff. a little pointless, but for purposes of dreaming about arwen, i guess it works. 4. a three or four page passage taking forty-five minutes in the movie: okay, for purposes of being climactic, peter jackson did a similar exension for the ogre battle in moria in fellowship. sure, it would take longer than the book described, and focusing on this for the film worked. 5. reduced role for frodo. after all, they cover the most significant parts. at first, i felt like they did not focus on the ring and that it played second fiddle to the human story, but i realized this was necessary to see how powerful the ring and sauron's influence really was. by focusing on helm's deep, we realize the stakes were higher. in fotr, we understood that the ring was dangerous, but all they did was talk about it and search for it. it was buildup for the war. in ttt, we see the battle that the ring is causing in full-throttle. frodo's reduced part was necessary, and they still got his mission and temptation across. the way he stroked the ring, and his fall into the lake because of its influence were very effective moments. so is his obsession with gollum (after all, he sees himself, doesn't he?). at first, i'd have liked to have seen more, but now that i have considered it, they portrayed it as much as was necessary. galadriel's monologue was also necessary to remind us just what was at stake, and that this entire battle was about the ring. what i cannot forgive: 1. the lack of characterization in gandalf. where was he?!!?!? if i hadn't been familiar with the original story, i'd have been completely confused as to why he was now ""the white."" i can understand mckellen's (wise) choice to play the grey and the white as two seperate characters. but i cannot forgive the emptiness of the role. how was he different? how were his powers different? how was his personality different? these ideas are never explored. he just comes in, has a few lines, and disappears. gandalf is lord of the rings! couldn't we have at least seen a little character development. 2. lack of characterization for saruman. again, just a few lines, and he's gone. no sense of forbidding and power that he had in the first film. in fact, they could have used archive footage from the first film for his part (though the ""exorcism"" from theodin was well-done). the scene where he watched the ents destroy isengard was laughable...he just stood there and looked p***ed off. at the very most, they could have developed the reltionship between he and grima a little bit better. which leads me to..... 3. grima's character going nowhere. if saruman was possessing theodin, why was grima needed at all? he just uttered a few lines, looking imposing in the film's first act, and then disappeared. i understand that peter jackson sees the lord of the rings as a nine-hour movie and that we'll see more of grima later, but he could have given us some sort of sense of completion for the purposes of waiting one more year. though i did like that single tear fall from his eye as he beheld the army (a sly reference to his role in exorcist iii, as the film already referenced the exorcist anyway). 4. some lazy storytelling. i enjoyed the exorcism of theodin scene, but i had a hard time figuring out if saruman was in his domain or if he was actually thrown out of theodin and was with the others in the castle. there are also a number of plot holes. how could boromir fight in the woods and get shot with arrows quickly, and yet aragorn and gimli could fight on the draw bridge fifty times the number of orcs that boromir was fighting and remain unscathed? i just don't understand this. it's just lazy story telling. some of the pacing was a bit off, too. way too much time was spent with merry and pippin with the ents. i love the ents as much as the next fellow, but speed us up already. by the time they're in the woods deciding whether or not to join the war, we've having enough exposition and decision making from all the other characters. i for one would have rather seen them cut to the chase. what i liked: fortuntanely, i loved all the rest. the development of aragorn, gimli, and legolas was wonderful. we get a better sense of these characters (i especially enjoyed the competition between legolas and gimli). gimli served as the comic relief, but it didn't take away from the character's integrity. aowen and theodin were wonderful additions, as was faramir, even though his change was controversial. treebeard was inventive, and gollum was the most convincing cgi character i have ever seen. the battles were epic, and every square inch of the screen is loaded with detail. peter jackson has taken a fantasy story and has filmed it like it was a historical world war ii film. the realism and the stakes presented works, and most of this approach blew me away the same way an effective historical war film (""saving private ryan"" or ""the longest day"") would. if fellowship belonged to the hobbits, towers is the story of the humans' continuing battle, and they all must make important choices. does aragorn stay at helm's deep and fall for aowen? does theodin lead his people into an attack? does aowen love aragorn? does arwen leave with the elves or stay for aragorn (she's a elf, but she wants to be human, after all)? does faramir do the duty of his position to please his father, or does he do what it right? all of these questions are strongly developed. and the payoffs are wonderful and show the power of the human spirit, much like war films. i trust peter jackson, and i look forward to return of the king. that said, the two towers was overall a step backwards from fellowship, and i hope that jackson does not get over confident in his ability. he had to prove himself with fellowship. lord of the rings in arguable the greatest fantasy series ever written, and it has harbored millions of fans. there were a lot of expecations from fans. perhaps too many. he had to prove that he could look past all of the weight of the trilogy's momentum and make a great film out of the books we all love. and he did. he brought us a masterful film which, like the godfather, made us appreciate the original text even more and also spun the ideas in new directions. this does not give him permission to slack off with the rest of his work. develop those characters more. keep the pacing interesting. don't compromise getting a film done quick and making money over quality. in other words, don't pull a lucas!!!! but i love you, peter. and i know that return of the king will be a satisfactory wrap-up to this wonderful series of films that you're making. final verdict: seven out of ten, *** out of ****.

322;pri_e;"i recently just got ""lord of the rings: fellowship of the ring"" for xmas and so it had been the second time i'd seen it since january at the cinemas. after finishing, i couldn't wait until i saw the next installment, and i surely wasn't disappointed with ""the two towers"". *possible spoilers ahead* we continue on where we left of with frodo and sam going to mordor to destroy the ring. some say that the beginning should have been a re-cap of what happened in the previous installment but if anyone really noticed they were recapping things. for example- what happened to gandalf (the grey) when they thought he died, explained how boromir died, what the love story was between aragon and arwen. i mean if you wanted to add recaps, then that would probably take another 15 minutes to do!! i didn't feel that there was enough of frodo and sam, but i suppose they wanted to focus this time on aragon, legalos, gimli, merry and pippin. we are introduced to some new characters king theoden and eowyn (shieldmaiden of rohan). i know that they are trying to introduce eowyn as part of some love triangle with aragon and arwen, but it doesn't work. there's something enchanting about aragon's love story with arwen, how there love keeps the both of them going. gollum/smeagol was an interesting character and for once the cgi effects were believable, just like the character of dobby in ""harry potter and the chamber of secrets"". his mental fight between good and evil was good to watch, with an ending making you want them to hurry up the process of ""return of the king"" for at least june of next year! i give it a 10, i haven't read the books so i can't really agree or disagree with those who believe peter jackson has changed the story. people say it's too much about fantasy, my question is what would you liked to have been? why can't people escape the strangeness of this world and get involved with a whole other world that conveys a whole different way of life? i've also read that some believe this glamourises war, i believe that to be untrue. it's a book that was written a long time ago, little did tolkien now how screwed up the world would be now but i do not think it was on purpose. nor do i believe that peter jackson is encouraging it either! he's doing what the book has written, nothing more or less. elijah wood and sean astin are just fantastic as frodo and sam, there's something warm and truthful about the way they convey the characters. there's something about viggo mortensen's acting that makes people wonder why they didn't acknowledge him before as an actor, he show's aragon's torment between his duty and his fear. orlando bloom and john rhys-davies are classic as legalos and gimli, showing the vast difference in thinking between the elf and dwarf. dominic monaghan and billy boyd are fantastic to watch as merry and pippin, we got to see a more emotional side to their characters as opposed to their cheery and fun dispositions in ""fotr"". i recommend the ""lord of the rings"" installments for those who enjoy these kind of genres. if your critical of it, by all means you are going to be bored and not really see the value of the storylines.";27 December 2002;10;['second', 'next', 'possible', 'previous', 'enough', 'gimli', 'new', 'interesting', 'believable', 'mental', 'good', 'good', 'least', 'next', 'much', 'whole', 'other', 'whole', 'different', 'untrue', 'long', 'little', 'less', 'fantastic', 'warm', 'truthful', 'classic', 'gimli', 'vast', 'dominic', 'fantastic', 'emotional', 'cheery', 'fun', 'critical', 'bored'];0.1421676441837732

324;smashattack;"spoilers. after watching the first lord of the rings, i wasn't expecting too much from its sequel. thank goodness, because i didn't get much. these two movies have much in common. for instance, they're both extremely boring in parts and way too long. sometimes i really enjoy long movies. but at times like these, when the movie is extremely slow, i want to fall asleep. the two towers has an extravagant beginning, though, in which gandalf battles the gigantic behemoth balrog. this scene was probably the most impressive in the entire movie, matched only by the battle of the ents toward the end. the characters have all split up, and so the movie jumps from one to the next to the next without really following any particular pattern. it's almost random, and at times i was getting a little confused. one time i was wondering where the heck gandalf had gone, but then i remembered that about an hour ago he rode off on a horse. such is the way of the lord of the rings, and i'm beginning to believe that this series will never change. i am also quickly tiring of the way these movies try to 'trick' the audience into believing a certain character is dead or has died, when its obvious that it hasn't happened. aragorn goes over a cliff (but fell into a river and survived), and merry (or was it pippin?) is 'trampled' by a horse (nope, we find out ten minutes later that he actually rolled out of the way!). but it's all in good fun, and i guess it's supposed to keep the movie tense. which doesn't really work. the plot is the same as the first, but this time frodo and sam have aid in the form of gollum. within the first few minutes, i was tired of gollum. he is a sickly little character, with an interesting schizophrenic personality, but an annoying and poorly generated character nonetheless. story line is, of course, different than the fellowship of the ring, but i found it just as boring. there is so much going on, yet the movie somehow manages to nearly put me to sleep. the music is absolutely awful. i no longer appreciate howard shore's work. in the first movie, he thought up some excellent themes and i was impressed. however, in the two towers, several themes play over and over nonstop, which is extremely annoying. no new themes are created in this movie; instead, shore takes snips of pieces from the first movie and puts them in this one, which makes for a lousy soundtrack. sickeningly lousy. i can really say it hit rock bottom. despite all these flaws, the two towers does have some excellent battle scenes, although they, too, are stretched far too long sometimes. gimli, the dwarf, provides some excellent comic relief, and he basically pulled me through the movie. character development is still poor, but better than the first. all in all, the two towers is exactly what i expected. much like the first, it is a major disappointment because it is so boring, lacking in a good storyline, and just too flawed.";18 January 2003;5;['first', 'much', 'much', 'common', 'boring', 'long', 'slow', 'asleep', 'extravagant', 'gigantic', 'impressive', 'entire', 'next', 'next', 'particular', 'random', 'little', 'confused', 'such', 'tiring', 'certain', 'dead', 'obvious', 'aragorn', 'good', 'tense', 'same', 'first', 'first', 'few', 'tired', 'sickly', 'little', 'interesting', 'schizophrenic', 'annoying', 'different', 'boring', 'much', 'awful', 'first', 'excellent', 'impressed', 'several', 'nonstop', 'annoying', 'new', 'first', 'lousy', 'lousy', 'excellent', 'gimli', 'excellent', 'comic', 'poor', 'well', 'first', 'first', 'major', 'boring', 'good', 'flawed'];-0.0220105574697411

326;DoctorSkyTower;i have read several comments on this movie and am very surprised at how many reviewers expected it to be exactly like the book the two towers. i have read the books several times myself, and seen dozens of movies based on books i've read, but i never expected this film (or any other) to copy the book to a double t. this film is absolutely one of the best i've seen this year, and fits my bill as the best movie of 2002!! it is also an excellent adaptation of the second book, with a few changes made and extras added in, and i didn't mind that shelob (who features at the end of the book ttt) won't make her appearance until the third movie. i was a little worried that this film wouldn't meet my (rather high!) expectations (re star wars i, ii) and the battle scenes would turn out like they did in star wars ii - but i was pleasantly surprised! you see real warriors (and c.g.i ones of course) in real armor during the huge battle at helm's deep. i liked the battle with the waarg riders, and gandalf's fight with the balrog was pretty cool. gollum is simply amazing. you forget he's c.g.i and marvel at how hideous and slimy he is. his animation is just about perfect, even better than that boring final fantasy flick. his movements were animated over a live actor (who also does his voice) which really added to his realism. i found ttt to be even better than fotr! unlike the first movie, which concentrated mostly on character development, ttt now concentrates on moving the story along with the battles, rise of sauron etc. mr lucas take note!! watch this film a few times before you make star wars iii (after all, we *do* have to wait 3 or 4 years for the third installment, which is *plenty* of time to come up with a *good* movie) i highly recommend this film to everyone who loves movies! congratulations mr jackson and crew! 10/10;7 January 2003;10;['several', 'surprised', 'many', 'several', 'other', 'double', 'good', 'good', 'excellent', 'second', 'few', 'third', 'little', 'worried', 'high', 'surprised', 'real', 'real', 'huge', 'deep', 'cool', 'amazing', 'hideous', 'perfect', 'well', 'boring', 'final', 'live', 'well', 'first', 'few', 'third', 'good'];0.1919949494949495

(except for the time where he took frodo and sam to gondor.) not only is this a terrific movie, but it could not have been better. it may be too long for some people, but it it not too long to me. i think it is amazing that the two actors who played boromir and faramir have a certain resemblance. it is only 3 hours and 43 minutes long, and there's at least a half hour alone on the credits. if you like the first movie, you won't be disappointed in this movie. my score: 10/10.;27 February 2006;10;['well', 'first', 'first', 'first', 'first', 'many', 'special', 'hard', 'minor', 'good', 'nice', 'right', 'terrific', 'well', 'long', 'long', 'amazing', 'certain', 'long', 'least', 'half', 'first'];0.1774404761904762

329;TheNabOwnzz;while the two towers introduces a couple of new characters, it is still not exactly on fellowship's level due to the character development of that particular motion picture. however, it is still painfully obvious that nearly every other single movie pales in comparison to the masterpiece that is the two towers. in another comparison to the fellowship of the ring, the scale is increased significantly in two towers, and this results in a lot more special effect shots. it is not quite as beautiful visually as fellowship because of this, but like in that film, the cgi that is used is once again utterly fantastic. still, director peter jackson seems to only use cgi on objects or creatures it has to be used on, because it would be near impossible to utilize practical effects on certain things, such as the oliphaunt, or an army of ten thousand uruk-hai. with the addition of the 'rohan' storyline come a couple of new characters, with bernard hill as theoden, karl urban as eomer, miranda otto as eowyn, brad dourif as grima wormtongue & the motion captured but largely cgi character gollum 'played' by andy serkis. all of these characters are being noteworthy in being a fantastic addition to a cast that was already near perfect. the score by howard shore is still perfection, who uses a new 'rohan' theme to further emphasize emotion when coupled with these scenes. the very first scene in which this sound is heard is when aragorn, gimli, legolas & another individual arrive at edoras, in which a flag of rohan can be seen tearing itself away from the king's keep, and landing right before aragorn, as if it symbolizes that hope is fading, and that only he can return it. the melancholy new sound of the rohan-esque themes by shore further fuel this emotion in the audience. the dialogue is once again fantastic. ofcourse this is once again largely thanks to tolkien's literature, the poems recited by theoden or the speech of sam to frodo ( by rights, we shouldn't even be here ) result in once again a very human story about hope, friendship and brotherhood. which is ofcourse another thing that jackson has succeeded as, the constant lingering fear of hopelessness, only to triumph in a great emotional climax in the end. the acting in the two towers is near flawless, and seems to be even a notch above the first one in this aspect. andy serkis is absolutely brilliant as the crooked gollum suffering from a split personality, and his voice perfectly emphasizes this feeling of 500 years of depravity and lust for the ring. mirando otto's facial acting when told of aragorn's 'death' is also worthy of special notice, as the sheer genuine emotion there is almost too much to bear. once again, the two towers takes its time to set up the premise of the rohan storyline, and does this with excellent characterization & character bonding. however, the build up would be worth less if it wasn't topped off with the incredible climax during the battle of helm's deep, which is undoubtedly one of the greatest cinematic sieges ever put to screen. from the very first shots of this massive army marching before the gates of helm's deep, you know this is going to be a special piece of filmmaking. emphasized by gloomy rainy weather conditions and night-time, this siege is highly atmospheric and this does manage to capture the hopelessness of the situation even more. the story of the siege on helm's deep is worthy of a movie in itself, as every single new situation brings our main characters ( who we have grown to care so much about ) in danger. the editing in this sequence, in particular the amount of widescreen shots as opposed to the closer shots of our protagonists fighting off the uruk-hai, is once again perfection. it is only when all hope seems lost, with only a couple handful of soldiers left, that our heroes decide to ride out and meet the adversaries, resulting in an incredible triumphant emotional climax as if we were riding besides them. however, the true climax was still yet to come, as a beautiful image of gandalf appearing in full white with the rohirrim behind him is seen, followed by a long charge down a very steep hill, combined with extraordinary cinematography & shore's incredible score, resulting in one of the greatest charges ever filmed. the emotional satisfaction in this is inhumanly high, and the fact that the victory is pronounced over sam's very human speech to frodo makes it even more involving and emotional. the two towers is the weakest link in the lord of the rings trilogy, which is admittedly not saying much, since there are very few films that can possibly compete with it. featuring superb acting, fantastic dialogue, excellent slow paced characterization, an even more impressive howard shore score, gorgeous cinematography & one of the greatest sieges of all-time, the two towers is indeed one of the all-time greats of motion pictures.;23 December 2018;10;['new',

332;hooma814;wow! i love lord of the rings! having just watched the extended version i was again blown away by this movie. i could and have watched this movie over and over again, and will continue to watch it throughout my life. it is just so good. i love that its three hours. it's an investment, it is a journey, a battle. these things aren't done in a quick 1 hour 30mins-2hours. many of our movies today barely scrape through with enough solid content to even reach the two hours. whereas lord of the rings has to cut quality content out just to reach 3hours! it is full of so much goodness. the acting is sublime. peter jackson really steps up his game in this one. having the ringwraiths on winged creatures blew my mind as a kid and is still a great way to take it to the next level. the elephants are similar in that way too. what i'm stoked with the most is that the lord of the rings didn't follow suit with many other films over the years like the matrix, terminator, hunger games, alien vs predator, all movies that have an excellent first movie, great concept, but then go and flop in the movies that follow. the aim of a sequel should always be to do what you did the first time but so much better. it should build to a climax, ultimately fulfilled in the final instalment. and boy do we get that with the two towers. it sets up the return of the king wonderfully with sauron's influence, the ever present eye and mount doom spurting lava in the world. it deals with saruman's army and builds on characters so well. legolas gets such great scenes where he does the truly impossible (we all know that flip onto his horse is the absolutely ridiculous), gimli and legolas have great on screen time, sam and frodo have great scenes, gandalf returning makes everything so much better, aragorn begins to assume his role as king. and helm's deep has to be one of my favourite battle scenes of all time. done so much better than the book in my opinion. i loved it all. this movie is satisfying in every way.;3 August 2020;10;['extended', 'good', 'quick', 'many', 'enough', 'solid', 'full', 'much', 'sublime', 'great', 'next', 'similar', 'most', 'many', 'other', 'alien', 'excellent', 'first', 'great', 'first', 'well', 'final', 'present', 'such', 'great', 'impossible', 'ridiculous', 'gimli', 'great', 'great', 'gandalf', 'well', 'aragorn', 'deep', 'favourite', 'well'];0.2669753086419753
333;thewillt08;"now i'm aware the lord of the rings is three movies but in my eyes it is one giant movie and story. they next one also picks up right where the other left off. here we go the review of peter jackson's epic trilogy, the lord of the rings. lord of the rings is a trilogy of books written a long time ago by j.r.r. tolkien and it is the most cliche story of good vs. evil. the story is stereotypical, but it works. tolkien created his own world of middle-earth and it is filled with different races and languages. in the beginning magic rings were made but there was one ring made of pure evil, ""one ring to rule them all."" the maker of this ring was named sauron and long story short, he was defeated but survived through the ring. the ring passed from person to person and it ended up in the hands of a hobbit named frodo baggins. he has been chosen to destroy the one ring before the armies of sauron destroy middle-earth. the storyline is very cliche. it is a good vs. evil story of epic proportions. if you think you have seen this before, you have, but this is completely different. the little guy saves the day and nobody expected the hobbit with hairy feet to defeat the dark lord. one of the major aspects of this movie is the relationships between characters. gandalf's relationship with frodo and the ring. frodo's relationship with sam, gollum, and the ring. gollum's relationship with the ring. merry's relationship with pippin. all of these relationships drive this movie. nothing is more powerful then the relationship between frodo and sam. samwise gamgee is more than frodo's best friend, he is basically his protector. sam acts as a barrier between the evil of the ring. frodo could not have survived without sam and the roots of this trilogy are the relationship between frodo and sam. sauron has all the power of persuasion, power of armies, fear, and all the power in the world. the only thing more powerful is the love and friendship between two young hobbits who take on this evil power. coming in second with relationships is between gollum and the ring. think about it, gollum spent more time with the ring than anybody else, excluding its master sauron. gollum lived with this ring for 500 years. it literally poisoned his mind and turned him into a gangly creature that you can't help but pity. he is easily my favorite character with his complexity and how it isn't his fault that he is the way he is. he is obsessed with the ring and calls it his precious. any fan of these movies knows what i'm talking about. over the span of three movies the audience gets their favorite characters and sees them develop. gimli and legolas didn't like each other at first because one was a dwarf and the other an elf. ""i never thought i'd die side by side with an elf,"" gimli says in the final battle. ""how about side by side with a friend?"" legolas answers. these two against all odds became friends and were inseparable. you also see merry and pippin evolve into something i know i did not expect. in the first movie they were silly and naive but in the second movie merry begins to understand the dangers of the world and that it needs saving. pippin matures a bit late but nevertheless they are two of my favorite characters. these three movies are filled with incredible action scenes and special effects. from hobbiton to rivendell to helms deep and all the way to the crack of doom, every place in middle-earth comes to life. the designers of these sets and cgi went into extreme detail and any fan of the movie should check out the six discs of special features. you learn how hobbiton was actually dug out in a hill in the ground in new zealand. my favorite battle has to be the battle of helms deep. it was 10,000 uruk-hai vs. around 500 men and elves fighting at a castle that has defended the country of rohan for centuries. aragorn falls into his place as a leader and he develops into the man he needs to be in the third movie. these movies are made with incredible detail with every movie being made at once. peter jackson and his cast and crew spent 15 months in new zealand and filmed this masterpiece. costumes were made and weta workshop made all of the sets they needed and used miniatures and made the world of middle-earth come alive. actors took the books and looked for details fans would look for from the books. the only real problem with these movies is that if you don't know the story you cannot really enjoy the full experience. i saw the first movie when i was really young and i had no idea what it was about and i had to see the movies many, many times before i knew what was going on. as soon as i did, i was hooked and now i know almost everything there is to know about these movies. overall, the lord of the rings is possibly the best trilogy ever made. the way the filmmakers dove into the world of middle-earth with such detail is commendable. this movie won so many awards, made a bunch of money, and it deserves everything it got. these are movie that need to be seen by anybody who even remotely likes the books and even if you don't, go in, pay attention, and join the experience. lord of the rings is my favorite movie, next to titanic, and gets the willyt seal of approval.";5 February 2013;9;['aware', 'giant', 'other', 'epic', 'long', 'good', 'stereotypical', 'own', 'middle', 'different', 'pure', 'long', 'short', 'middle', 'good', 'evil', 'epic', 'different', 'little', 'hairy', 'dark', 'major', 'powerful', 'more', 'good', 'only', 'powerful', 'young', 'evil', 'more', 'favorite', 'precious', 'favorite', 'gimli', 'other', 'other', 'final', 'inseparable', 'first', 'silly', 'naive', 'second', 'favorite', 'incredible', 'special', 'deep', 'middle', 'extreme', 'special', 'favorite', 'deep', 'third', 'incredible', 'weta', 'middle', 'alive', 'only', 'real', 'full', 'first', 'young', 'many', 'many', 'good', 'middle', 'such', 'commendable', 'many', 'favorite', 'titanic', 'willyt'];0.1560090702947845
334;Sfpsycho415;the two towers continues the story from the fellowship of the ring, but it has a lot more action. the first one took a while to get started and didn't have many epic battles. regardless, it was a great movie. the second installment has got much more action and the end battle at helm's deep is amazing. the cast and crew still do an excellent job with acting and special effects. i do have a couple of complaints. the movie didn't continue the story as much as it could have. other than gollum becoming a more important character, you probably could have skipped this one and caught up quickly in the third film, but you would have missed out on some great scenes. i also did not like the walking-talking trees. i found them boring and a little irritating as they didn't do much. other than those forgivable flaws, this is a fantastic adventure that makes you drool in anticipation for the conclusion. 7/10;31 August 2003;7;['more', 'first', 'many', 'epic', 'great', 'second', 'more', 'amazing', 'excellent', 'special', 'other', 'important', 'third', 'great', 'boring', 'little', 'much', 'other', 'forgivable', 'fantastic'];0.2649801587301587

'the two towers' is in the same ranking--imperfect, yet amazing and equally worthy of acclaim. i am in the (not so) sad position of having to give this movie a '9' score as well. marking the first time, i believe, that i have found a series to have not dwindled in value, production, or in the nebulous 'fun factor.' really, this isn't that surprising since 'the two towers' was filmed simultaneously with 'the fellowship of the ring.' therefore, i say: go, get in line now. see it; take somebody who will appreciate it. enjoy. this movie is wonderful. score: 9 out of 10. it's a modern classic, just like 'the fellowship of the ring.'";22 December 2002;9;['worth', 'massive', 'worthy', 'high', 'perfect', 'same', 'ranking', 'imperfect', 'amazing', 'worthy', 'sad', 'first', 'nebulous', 'surprising', 'wonderful', 'modern'];0.3366666666666666

343;paulo20;"two towers would have been a very good picture, if not a great one, if not for a few needless ommissions and intrusions. the arwen sequence was included for no other reason than to give the highly overrated liv tyler screen time. there just doesn't seem to be enough of a reason to beef up her role. yeah, sure, the reason commonly given is that it's supposed to give the female viewers something to watch, but it's not like the gals are bored with everything else that's going on. i'm not saying the romantic angle should go unplayed, just that it should be lavished with such loving detail. aragorn's fake death was played for dramatic purposes, as if there wasn't enough drama in the story to go around and if there hasn't been enough fake deaths in the first film. both of these sequences/occurrences squandered screen time that could have been used to include the huorns (basically the reason the ents were called treeherders) and shelob, the giant spider. the huorns are instrumental in routing the orcs at helm's deep; they are an important element in the story. in the film, the defeat of the orcs wasn't terribly convincing since there were still hordes of them. there didn't seem enough of a reason for them to just turn and flee. a burst of sunlight wouldn't seem to be enough, especially since these orcs were the uruk-hai, specially bred to move about in sunlight. in the book, the orcs were crushed between gandalf's contigent and the huorns, which make a lot more sense and would have made a much better movie. there was plenty of time to establish the huorns if not for unnecessary dream sequences. shelob, the spider, was also ommitted for no clearly good reason. presumably, shelob will be featured in the the third movie (won't there be enough to take care of in the third movie?). in the book, frodo seems to be mortally wounded by her and goes into a sort of coma, yet one more time the fake character death card will have to be played (making aragorn's fake death seem all the more excessive) but at least with shelob and frodo, it's warranted and would have made an astounding finish to the film, as it did the second book of lord of the rings. (it probably inspired the less-than-happy ending in the empire strikes back and look how good a film that was). it also would have given samwise (and thus, the hobbits, who have thus far been little other than ""the little people) his moment to shine, as he takes on and defeats shelob. i disagree there wasn't enough time. for one, as i said before, i don't think the time was spent wisely in telling the story; for another, an extra half an hour to 45 minutes would have been sufficient. judging from audience reaction to the film, very few would have minded an extended film. oh well, it will have to wait till the third film. but imagine the anticipation for return of the king that would have been created if shelob was included in towers. instead, it will just be something that happens in the third film that's quickly resolved (it will have to, i imagine, if the rest of the story is to be told with any sort of efficiency). also, the whole faramir plot was a total, total, hack job that i don't even have the heart to comment on right now. overall, a severe disappointment. the major bright spot was the performance of andy serkis/gollum, truly an astonishing development in the world of cgi; he makes the severe disappointments of this film almost bearable.";22 December 2002;1;['good', 'great', 'few', 'needless', 'other', 'overrated', 'enough', 'female', 'bored', 'romantic', 'unplayed', 'such', 'loving', 'fake', 'dramatic', 'enough', 'enough', 'fake', 'first', 'giant', 'instrumental', 'deep', 'important', 'convincing', 'enough', 'enough', 'more', 'well', 'unnecessary', 'good', 'third', 'enough', 'third', 'more', 'fake', 'fake', 'excessive', 'least', 'astounding', 'second', 'happy', 'good', 'little', 'other', 'little', 'shelob', 'enough', 'extra', 'sufficient', 'few', 'extended', 'third', 'third', 'whole', 'total', 'total', 'severe', 'major', 'bright', 'astonishing', 'severe', 'bearable'];0.0596955128205128

352;Streetwolf;so i finally got to see the two towers and during the first half hour the pace slowed down, but it later picked up and got better by the minute. summary: the story continues with 3 different tales, frodo and sam journey alone towards mordor to destroy the ring, but are lost. they finally catch the annoying gollum, who has been after them since the mines of moria. i got so tired of gollum, the annoying gibberish and screaming. his only mission is to get back the ring, but as the movie progresses we learn that smeagol, gollum's real name needs a shrink due to his split personality. anyways, smeagol decides to help them get to mordor, but instead they run into boromir's brother faramir, who seems to have the same intentions as his dead brother. on the other end, pippin and merry escape from the uruk-hai and end up in a forest, where they meet treebeard...who is a tree, that talks and walks....right... and behind them are aragorn, legolas and gimli, who take the path to rohan to find pip and merry, but after gandalf re-appears now as gandalf the white they are sent to help the king of rohan who is under saruman's spell and the annoying wormtongue, who has a schoolboy crush on the king's niece is there working undercover for saruman, one look at him and you will know he is a bad guy. there, aragorn meets the fine eowyn, who is the niece of the king and a major tom-boy. anyways, she falls for the elegant and charming aragorn, let's face it, who wouldn't fall for him? but aragorn's heart belongs to arwen, the elf, whom he seems to have broken up with...whilst arwen is forced to choose between her immortality and her love for aragorn, the guy who dumped her. whilst frodo is going under the spell of the ring, he fears he won't make it, aragorn, legolas and gimli lead the refugees of rohan to the great fortress of helm's deep aware that they have at least ten thousand uruk-hai heading their way for war, merry and pip are hanging around on trees literally, middle earth seems to have no hope left and all that, you can actually see in the trailer as well. this movie is much darker than the one before, i even read the books, they took a whole to read, they are packed with each character singing and dancing through out all 3 books (no joke) and with the books you can't really visualize the surroundings of each character and scenery much, it's great to see that peter jackson's imagination really brings life into the characters and the whole story. there's also quite a bit missing from the books to the movie, but i guess that's to be expected. in this movie the only person who had a comedy part was gimli (john rhys-davis), a lot more elvish is spoken in it between the characters and my favorite scene was when gandalf rode out of the stables, that was great. there was a lot of hard work put into helm's deep and it was truly worth watching and as for gollum, he seemed nice and innocent at times and that was cute. i do hope there will be an extended version of this movie and the cast are really breath taking in their roles. i'm rating this 10/10. all lord of the rings fans will love it.;23 December 2002;10;['first', 'half', 'well', 'different', 'annoying', 'tired', 'annoying', 'only', 'real', 'split', 'same', 'dead', 'other', 'right', 'white', 'annoying', 'undercover', 'bad', 'aragorn', 'fine', 'major', 'elegant', 'charming', 'gimli', 'great', 'aware', 'uruk', 'middle', 'dark', 'great', 'whole', 'missing', 'only', 'gimli', 'more', 'favorite', 'great', 'hard', 'deep', 'worth', 'nice', 'innocent', 'cute', 'extended'];0.0980985449735449

355;TheBabblingFool;"the easiest way to sum up the two towers is this. if you haven't seen fellowship, avoid this, rent fellowship, then see this movie. if you liked the character development in fellowship, this film may dissapoint you because there isn't really any character development. if you thought fellowship needed more action, this is right up your alley. i will say this film is entertaining, but far from best picture worthy, simply on the fact that it needs for it's viewers to have seen fellowship of the ring to understand or care about any of it. everything you loved about fellowship is back, the sights, the costumes, the actors who are their characters. but the film does lack major character development. the only person who seemed to change is gimli, who provides the comedic relief (very well i must say), which is understandable considering that merry and pippin's time has been cut back. aragorn is still the dashing hero, legolas is still the cunning elf who pulls off all the bitchin' stunts, frodo delves deeper into the ring's evil power, and sam is still worried about him. the plot is so well told and entertaining it makes this 3 hour movie seem like an hour and a half. the battle at helms deep is a huge wild spectacle, it gives a great feel of a midieval battle. it was just as crazy and entertaining as the clone war in star wars: episode 2, but was full of more drama. i could rant and rave about how good gollum looked, and he did look good, close up, but from afar he looked like a special effect, what deserves the real praise is the actor who put the performance in him. the really great characters in the film were the ents. all of the designs for them are so elaborate and imaginative. people who say that treebeard looked ""jerky"" and ""stiff"" when he talked must lack a sense of logic. he's a living tree, his skin is made of bark, of course he is going to have more stiff rigid movements, bark sure isn't as flexable as flesh. the scene in which the ents take on isengard is just a fantastic spectacle, and is one of my favorite scenes. to sum it up, the two towers is a worthy, entertaining follow-up to the fellowship of the ring, but only if you have seen the fellowship of the ring.";27 December 2002;8;['easy', 'more', 'entertaining', 'good', 'worthy', 'major', 'only', 'gimli', 'comedic', 'understandable', 'aragorn', 'evil', 'worried', 'huge', 'wild', 'great', 'midieval', 'crazy', 'entertaining', 'clone', 'full', 'more', 'good', 'good', 'special', 'real', 'great', 'elaborate', 'imaginative', 'jerky', 'stiff', 'stiff', 'rigid', 'flexable', 'fantastic', 'favorite', 'worthy', 'entertaining'];0.3237433862433863
356;K-Noah;the lord of the rings: the two towers is once again directed by peter jackson, taken from j.r.r. tolkien's novel, screenplay by fran walsh, philippa boyens, stephen sinclair and peter jackson. all of them are the same from the first one, except for stephen sinclair. starring elijah wood, ian mckellen, viggo mortensen and sean astin. the story continues with frodo and sam trying to destroy the ring, during the journey they met gollum. meanwhile, aragorn, drawing closer to his kingly destiny, rallies forces of good for the battles that must come. if you read my first review of the lord of the rings trilogy, so you already know that i loved how they set the characters and how they made the special effects, etc... and you also know that i didn't like the performance, and the direction sometimes wasn't good for me. so i watched this one and i was hoping to see these flaws got fixed. so, did they fix it? not that much to be noticed, but as a middle chapter of a trilogy setting all paces for the final one, the lord of the rings: the two towers is completely amazing, also for the fans of the book and the lord of the rings: the fellowship of the ring. the lord of the rings: the two towers has lots of amazing special effects just like the first one, i was still amazed of how talented and unique the creators of this movie were, i mean some movies were released in the same year but the special effects weren't that good, not even close. the performances on the other hand are the same, the only one that was brilliant is andy serkis as gollum, all the others are the very same, and i didn't like them before, so it's the same problem, but andy serkis improved it. i liked the direction a little tiny pit more than the first one. so technically, as it's obvious, i liked the lord of the rings: the two towers more than the lord of the rings: the fellowship of the ring, especially the story, which was fast-paced and better than the first one. so as it's improved, it's definitely getting a higher grade, so i'm gonna give the lord of the rings: the two towers an a! i really had lots of fun, while talking with you about the lord of the rings: the fellowship of the ring and the lord of the rings: the two towers, and i'm so excited to talk to you about the lord of the rings: the return of the king, and it's gonna be very soon. alright, guys thank you for reading my review, hope you like, and if you do, please, support my work to encourage me to carry one.;2 December 2018;9;['fran', 'same', 'first', 'aragorn', 'kingly', 'first', 'special', 'good', 'much', 'middle', 'final', 'amazing', 'amazing', 'special', 'first', 'amazed', 'talented', 'same', 'special', 'good', 'close', 'other', 'same', 'only', 'brilliant', 'andy', 'same', 'same', 'little', 'tiny', 'first', 'obvious', 'more', 'well', 'first', 'high', 'excited'];0.2497906403940887

358;MadBadMovieman;the 2nd movie of the series does not disappoint. it was non-stop adventure and excitement the few parts that did seem to slow down were long to sit through but helped give you more background or information on the characters. the battle between good and evil is even more overpowering in this movie. gollum/smeagol was such an unusual character. the real actor is never seen but knowing he was actually being filmed and cgi altered later made his part even more difficult. his face was ugly at first but his eyes were mesmerising after the first few closups. obsession was running wild for him, frodo and others. so many characters are being tested during the movie. do the right thing or take the easy way. turn on frodo or not. steal the ring or not. a more than worthy sequel in the series. we are so glad they decided to put in the ent's.;28 December 2002;9;['non', 'stop', 'few', 'long', 'more', 'good', 'unusual', 'real', 'difficult', 'ugly', 'first', 'few', 'wild', 'many', 'right', 'easy', 'more', 'worthy', 'glad'];0.1501488095238095
359;jantoniou;"(minor interstitial spoilers) at least three-quarters of this movie is perfect - every scene, every character, every shot evenly and perfectly bears the weight of the entire movie. though i felt some shots and characters were, perhaps, slightly wasted, in context it seems trivial. the ending 40-45 minutes could have been smoother--thus the one-quarter i am less confident about--and it certainly was dragging at the end. i overheard several people leaving the theater wondering aloud when the movie was going to end. perhaps it was the late hour--our showing didn't let out until after midnight. peter jackson executes with a sure and confident hand in rotk. his direction and editing is masterful and he brings his actors--who, frankly, were lacking in the previous films--up to the task in this final movie. i think the length of this production and the years the cast and crew spent making these films comes together to near-flawless effect in rotk. the previous films were substantially flat in comparison. they were ""good"" and sometimes ""bad"" and almost never ""great."" i really think the actors - most of whom were not especially ""great"" actors before the ring series - with the exception of ian mckellan and cate blanchett, though she was essentially a beautiful mute in all previous - and jackson himself, a b-grade horror movie director hitherto, didn't have great dramatic footing in the first two. even though the story was clear, he didn't really know how to tell it in the first two films. whatever his vision was, it fell short. the same cannot be said of rotk. the battle for minas tirith i think will be remembered as one of the great battle scenes shot on film. the near-seamless combination of live action and cgi has set a new standard. it is breathtaking work and a real revelation of filmmaking craftsmanship. the only big dramatic ""flaw"" was the final anticlimactic battle at mordor--even as you saw overwhelming numbers of baddies surrounding the armies of gondor, you already knew that mordor would be defeated. i have never read the books but even i was aware that frodo and sam would succeed in tossing the ring into the volcano. i didn't get a specific sense that the final 45 minutes or so were a tacked-on tying up of loose ends. it felt more like the dramatic energy was running thin, like everyone on the set was essentially running out of steam (and who can blame them?). maybe it was deliberately played down because, after all, this isn't a ""hollywood ending"" kind of movie that can have a flaming building smoking in the background and a spiffy little remark as the credits close like a ""die hard"" or ""rambo""-type franchise. in the final analysis--if there is such a thing--it is nearly impossible to dismiss the whole because of any part of it. so much of it is composed and delivered so masterfully that the minor flaws are ultimately very easily excused. i found myself very satisfied that a movie, especially such an epic one, had been done so well--so often i find parts of movies great in certain aspects but other aspects act to effectively kick the leg of a table out and destroy the whole composition. rotk has all its legs fully intact and strong at the end and we're very pleased to have watched it.";28 December 2003;10;['minor', 'interstitial', 'perfect', 'entire', 'trivial', 'smooth', 'confident', 'several', 'late', 'sure', 'confident', 'rotk', 'masterful', 'previous', 'final', 'flawless', 'rotk', 'previous', 'flat', 'good', 'bad', 'great', 'most', 'great', 'beautiful', 'previous', 'great', 'dramatic', 'first', 'clear', 'first', 'short', 'same', 'great', 'near', 'seamless', 'live', 'new', 'real', 'only', 'big', 'dramatic', 'final', 'anticlimactic', 'overwhelming', 'aware', 'specific', 'final', 'loose', 'dramatic', 'flaming', 'spiffy', 'little', 'close', 'hard', 'final', 'impossible', 'whole', 'much', 'minor', 'satisfied', 'epic', 'great', 'certain', 'other', 'whole', 'rotk', 'intact', 'strong', 'pleased'];0.1835791363808604

365;tyson-hunsaker;the lord of the rings is was directed by peter jackson and features some of cinema's most iconic, epic, and incredible story elements in film history. it's grand, spectacular, and incredibly dense when one experiments with the extended versions. adapting j.r.r. tolkien's incredible book might go down as one of the most ambitious film projects of all time and it sure paid off. considering the consistency in production of all three films, this review includes personal thoughts about the entire trilogy and will tackle the all three films from a more general standpoint since my opinion on all three are pretty much the same. shooting in new zealand might've been one of the best production decisions they had to make. landscape shots in each film completely immerse you in this fantasy world which you completely believe is nothing but middle-earth. while cgi did have immense benefits during production. it's definitely apparent practical sets, props, and costumes were utilize to feel more authentic instead of obvious and generic green screen. each film stands well alone as it's own independent story but when you watch all of them you see the entire story arc for each character from beginning to end which yields an incredibly satisfying ending for each character. seeing how each one changes in their own and unique way is seeing how understanding of a writer tolkien was and how genius the filmmakers were in expressing those stories and deeply thought-provoking themes explored in such an epic and thorough way. each scene feels necessary and not a moment in the stories do we feel bored or wanting something else. each section of the story whether it be brutal war sequences or character developing dialogue scenes, they feel fascinating and satisfying enough to engage the audience no matter who they are. while few can complain about minor plot flaws or changes made from the book (which are very few), no one can deny the cinematic brilliance of the lord of the rings trilogy or its impact on modern filmmaking. it will forever be remembered as one of the best movie trilogies of all time and a fantasy epic that will be damn near impossible to rival in scope, ambition, and appeal. if you haven't seen this marvelous trilogy yet, see it as soon as possible. the extended versions are well worth your time as well given the additional footage that provides clear context and further character motivations. this will be a long and time consuming endeavor but when it's over, it will change the viewer to some degree. don't let these films go unseen.;17 August 2017;10;['iconic', 'epic', 'incredible', 'grand', 'spectacular', 'dense', 'incredible', 'ambitious', 'personal', 'entire', 'general', 'same', 'good', 'middle', 'immense', 'apparent', 'practical', 'utilize', 'authentic', 'obvious', 'generic', 'green', 'own', 'independent', 'entire', 'satisfying', 'own', 'unique', 'epic', 'thorough', 'necessary', 'bored', 'brutal', 'fascinating', 'few', 'minor', 'few', 'cinematic', 'modern', 'good', 'impossible', 'marvelous', 'possible', 'extended', 'worth', 'additional', 'clear', 'further', 'long', 'unseen'];0.1740310077519379

372;Tyson14;"peter jackson has done what could not be done. deemed unfilmable for decades (with the terrible cartoons as an example of why), ""the lord of the rings"" took the audiences by storm when ""fellowship of the ring"" premiered in 2001. in 2002, anticipation was even higher, dread was lower -- and ""two towers"" is an outstanding continuation of the epic fantasy tale. the movie picks up where ""fellowship"" left off: merry and pippin have been captured by uruk-hai, and aragorn, legolas and gimli are pursuing them. but they are sidetracked by an old friend: gandalf, returned in a new form and with new powers, as gandalf the white. he takes them to the kingdom of rohan, whose king is bewitched by the evil saruman. they barricade the people of rohan in the fortress of helm's deep, for a final defiant stand against an army of uruk-hai. sam and frodo have left, to venture into mordor alone so that frodo can destroy the ring in mordor's mount doom. when the two hobbits become lost in emyn muil, frodo realizes that someone is following them: gollum, the tormented, twisted former owner of the ring. they capture gollum, who swears to serve ""the master of the precious."" but even gollum's shaky allegiance isn't enough for them to succeed, because the ring has started to bend frodo to its will. while the first movie revolved around frodo, the ring and the fellowship, here the focus widens. we get a better sense of the epic quality of the story and how it affects the whole world, not just our heroes. gondor is crumbling, rohan is beaten down by orcs, and even the forces of nature -- the tree-like ents -- are being attacked by sauron and saruman. it's nature versus the destructive machines, and the wild wrecking of saruman's forges by these ancient tree shepherds is something to cheer for. elijah wood blossoms in this film as frodo baggins, the little hobbit who could. in the first movie wood played frodo as an innocent who loses his innocence; here he takes it a step further, showing the darkness and violence that are swallowing frodo up. because we saw what a bright, sweet person frodo was before, it's all the more horrible to see him starting to slide down (even attacking his best friend -- the look on frodo's face as he comes to his senses is stunning). sean astin perfectly embodies sam gamgee -- increasingly desperate, trying to keep frodo from going under. he serves as a reminder of what frodo is fighting for, and astin has perhaps the most powerful lines of the film, near the end: ""but in the end, it's only a passing thing, this shadow. even darkness must pass. a new day will come. and when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer."" these simply-worded lines will bring tears to your eyes. but if frodo is just starting to be addicted, gollum is a junkie. even if andy serkis doesn't appear in one frame in the entire movie, his motions and voice are heard and seen behind an exquisitely detailed cgi puppet. this is no jar jar or dobby -- gollum is detailed down to the last hair and wrinkle, believable in his appearance (i actually forgot he was animated for most of the movie), and has a multifaceted personality that reflects his own inner struggle -- smeagol and gollum, good and evil. the scene where gollum's two halves argue is too amazing for words. the other supporting actors shine almost as brightly. viggo mortensen turns his reluctant hero aragorn into a leader and a warrior. ian mckellen manages to make gandalf more stately and majestic, yet keeps that little grandfatherly twinkle. john rhys-davies provides a bit of comedy as gimli, mostly related to gimli's stature, but never loses his dignity; orlando bloom is outstanding as ethereal elf archer legolas once again. liv tyler captures arwen's fear of mortality and loneliness. billy boyd's pippin and dominic monaghan's merry, the well-meaning goofballs of ""fellowship,"" are now forced to make their own decisions. and new cast members miranda otto and bernard hill also shine as the strong-willed eowyn and tough old king theoden, in roles that will bloom further in the third film. peter jackson (who makes a few cameos) once again outdoes himself with camera-work and direction. his cameras as like living things: they swoop, dive, pull back for outstanding combat shots and then zoom in for exquisite close-ups. the battle scenes are dark, bloody, explosive, and full of chaos; only near the finale does any hint of glory shine through. he adds little human touches (the family split up by the war) that give a glimpse of what the non-heroic, ordinary people are suffering. of course ""two towers"" isn't as good as the book. few movies are. but taken purely as a cinematic experience, and an adaptation, ""two towers"" is virtually without peer. epic, majestic, action-packed and brimming with pathos, this is a treasure.";27 December 2014;10;['unfilmable', 'terrible', 'high', 'low', 'outstanding', 'epic', 'aragorn', 'gimli', 'old', 'new', 'new', 'evil', 'deep', 'final', 'defiant', 'emyn', 'tormented', 'twisted', 'former', 'precious', 'shaky', 'enough', 'first', 'well', 'epic', 'whole', 'like', 'destructive', 'wild', 'ancient', 'little', 'first', 'innocent', 'bright', 'sweet', 'horrible', 'good', 'stunning', 'desperate', 'powerful', 'new', 'clear', 'entire', 'detailed', 'last', 'believable', 'most', 'multifaceted', 'own', 'inner', 'good', 'amazing', 'other', 'reluctant', 'stately', 'majestic', 'little', 'grandfatherly', 'gimli', 'outstanding', 'ethereal', 'dominic', 'own', 'new', 'strong', 'tough', 'old', 'third', 'few', 'outstanding', 'exquisite', 'close', 'dark', 'bloody', 'explosive', 'full', 'little', 'human', 'non', 'heroic', 'ordinary', 'good', 'few', 'cinematic', 'epic', 'majestic'];0.1004471639471639

375;bullions27;"*spoilers* i'll say this right off the bat. whatever problems i had with this movie (and there were a few), i nevertheless was impressed deeply with jackson's handling of cgi and camera. i don't care if you're a naysayer of the series, or a fan. if you're not impressed with the choreography and direction of the battle of helm's deep, you need some serious help. no director, to this date, has done what jackson has done on the screen. he doesn't just throw rambunctious cgi as you would throw a bucket of paint on a murel and call it art. he has a formula. he knows what fits, and what works. call it good instincts, or maybe he's just a genius. the most important trait for a director is being able to tell the story without the script. can the audience understand the feeling, or the gist of the story just by looking at the scene, and the actors, and the lighting? can you integrate cgi into this and still achieve the same effect on the audience? if you mention final fantasy, or star wars, you'll probably say ""heck no"". this movie stands alone. the two towers, if not going to be recongnized for its good storytelling, is cinematic masterpiece by biblical proportions. that said, i believe andy serkis needs some serious, serious consideration for the best supporting actor role as gollum. it's not just jackson's employment of some of the most realistic cgi ever used, but the script and acting was done perfectly. we're not just looking at a mindless talking cgi, like jar jar, for that whole moment. we really believed we were actually seeing a living, breathing gollum. now on to the story itself. some dedicated tolkien purists will probably have a few beefs with jackson for the myriad of changes in the characters. for those who have never read the novels, these changes are only additional subplots for the audience to remember. these aren't detrimental to the actual storyline (to some degree), but nevertheless not very subtle and made rather obvious. i'm a bit on the neutral side in this, but i thought jackson could have done a lot better. two things that stand out: 1) legolas - i find it disturbing that fangirls seem to like this character only because orlando bloom is ""cute"" despite the horrible dialogue jackson and walsh provided for him. this only cheapens legolas. if he were any other movie character concocted by any other writer, it can be excused. not legolas. i thought jackson should've given more thought to him. give him one personality (he seems to bounce back and forth between optimism, and pessimism at the whim), and make him kick more butt. he's an elf. his combat prowess and reliability should be paramount. why make him act and look ridiculous (the surf scene with the shield bugs me to all hell)? i'm not saying give legolas the powers of jet li, but at least enhance his fighting abilties if you are not going to give him good lines. just wishful thinking. this brings me to the next point: 2) legolas / gimli - i can somewhat see the need of comedy relief in something as dark and morbid as the two towers would eventuate towards the final hour of the movie. i have no problem with that. however, because legolas seems to shift between personalities, and gimli seems to be more focused on creating comedy relief, their friendship is virtually non-existant. as a result, their whole ""how many can you kill"" little adventure in helm's deep is out of place, and awkward. not exactly detrimental. none of this detracts me from enjoying the movie, but it stuck in my mind even at the closing credits. oh well. the two towers succeeds in telling the story, and that's important. not exactly tolkien's story, but jackson interpretation of the novel series. he provides enough, without going overboard, or cutting too much. the dialogue isn't exactly top-notch, or memorable (in fact, it's actually quite subpar in my opinion) but it gets the job done. anyway, i'm not going to go anymore deeper. for me, i'm not going to remember this movie for the story. i'll leave that to my leather-bound collector's series (yes i am a tolkien fanatic). i'll remember this movie for its technical achievements, and the way gollum stole the entire show. 8/10";22 December 2002;10;['few', 'impressed', 'deep', 'serious', 'rambunctious', 'good', 'important', 'able', 'same', 'final', 'good', 'cinematic', 'biblical', 'serious', 'serious', 'good', 'realistic', 'mindless', 'whole', 'dedicated', 'few', 'additional', 'detrimental', 'actual', 'subtle', 'obvious', 'neutral', 'cute', 'horrible', 'other', 'other', 'more', 'more', 'paramount', 'ridiculous', 'least', 'good', 'wishful', 'next', 'gimli', 'dark', 'final', 'gimli', 'focused', 'non', 'existant', 'whole', 'many', 'little', 'awkward', 'detrimental', 'important', 'novel', 'enough', 'top', 'memorable', 'subpar', 'fanatic', 'technical', 'entire'];0.0821022727272727

378;jillbeckinheim7;good film, but doesn't follow book closely. the first reason why towers is just slightly less satisfying is the shire, or absence of it, rather. while the grandeur of the dwarfs' caves and the bewitching charm of the elves' forests equally excite and delight me, the real magic of lotr is rooted in the humble, simple, but most comfortable dwellings of the hobbits in the shire, just as the ultimate strength of the fellowship of the ring is rooted in the simple, fun-loving but resilient and enduring hobbits. therefore, while the entire movie of fellowship is immensely satisfying, it's the very first part, when gandalf was coming to the shire, that i best love. and i miss it a little in towers. the other reason has to do with the difficulty of making the book into a movie. in the trilogy, each of the three volumes is sub-divided into two books. in fellowship, the movie pretty well follows the book in a single, linear progression. in towers, book 3 deals with what happens in rohan while book 4 tells the story of frodo and sam going into mordor. within book 3, the chapters alternative between the stories of aragon's trio and the two hobbits. obviously, it wouldn't do to follow the structure of the book in making the movie, devoting the entire first half to rohan and the second half to mordor. the director and film editor have done their best however the movie came across as slightly too fragmented.;30 October 2021;7;['good', 'first', 'satisfying', 'real', 'humble', 'simple', 'comfortable', 'ultimate', 'simple', 'resilient', 'enduring', 'entire', 'satisfying', 'first', 'good', 'little', 'other', 'sub', 'single', 'linear', 'entire', 'first', 'second', 'good', 'fragmented'];0.187687969924812
379;RichardKleiner;"well, another day, another part of the lotr saga. those who saw the two towers' trailer over and over again, as it was shown a million times everywhere, already learned that the gollum creature, who appeared very briefly in ""fellowship"", would be an important character in this next installment and also knew the big spoiler that gandalf was returning from the dead. thanks a lot, trailers, you ruined what would have been a pleasant surprise. so, now, the remnants of the fellowship part ways, frodo and sam in their quest to mordor and, aragorn, legolas and gimli on the search of the missing hobbits. the emotional center of this story is no longer the ring or the fellowship, but two different introductions. on one hand, gollum, the first cgi character to have big psychological issues, marvelous portrayal by andy serkis, and also rohan, the country that becomes the first victim of saruman's improved uruk-hai and their invasion. for the rohan side, it's a beautiful portrayal of the vast land and it's inhabitants, mainly king theoden, and his nephews, eowyn and eomer. with this setting, the story turns into more of a war epic than an adventure quest, like in the first movie. the big battle scene is longer than the one in the prologue and it's much more detailed. you get to see aragorn, legolas and gimli in full action, even though this is technically not their battle. however, even though frodo's story is the most important one, with all the build up and excitement for the battle at helm's deep, whenever you see frodo, sam and gollum on their journey, you want to see what happens on the other side, and you don't really care for them. there's a scene in which galadriel tells a summary of what has happened, and that makes it sort of an intermission, not only for the movie, but for the whole saga. it drags too, but it's good information for those who just walked in. the scenes with merry, pippin and the ents were also killing the thrill for the battle going on, but later on, you see them in full action. the scenes with the uruk-hai in the forest at night had me cracking up. ""we ain't got nothing but maggoty for three stinking days!"". still, the sequence with the forbidden pool was my least favorite. it didn't say anything and slowed down the plot, at least to me. not only that, it made the previous scene with frodo confronting gollum rather useless. why show him remembering smeagol if he eventually goes back to gollum. still, it add a little more in the tragedy concerning the once hobbit. in the end, you are left with a small cliffhanger, gollum wishing to take the ring from frodo after ""she"" kills them. the score here presents themes for both narrative cores: rohan, a beautiful norse country melody, and gollum, a sneaky theme for his plotting and a more gentle theme for his smeagol persona, and also a bjork sounding song (performed by emiliana torrini) for the end credits, that inspires awe when you listen. still, the famed ""shire"" and ""fellowship"" themes are back with different arrangements, making them always a good listen, and, one of my favorites, sam's theme, comes back as a reprise in the cd. also, you can hear the uruk-hai pounding theme (which i first mistook as the orc's theme) a little longer. as for the cinematography, special effects, visual effects, set design and costumes, are all flawless. what else can i say? it's funny. when ""towers"" ends, nothing left unresolved in ""fellowship"" was resolved here. again, the ring hasn't been destroyed and merry and pippin haven't met aragorn and the rest (although they did meet gandalf). but, the rohan situation is resolved, and saruman with his uruk-hai is defeated. not only that, gandalf returns and rohan is saved. that's very relieving, and doesn't make you feel frustrated. that's why it's far more enjoyable from beginning to end. this is a noble successor to ""the fellowship of the ring"", and my second favorite.";12 September 2008;10;['important', 'next', 'big', 'pleasant', 'gimli', 'emotional', 'different', 'first', 'big', 'psychological', 'marvelous', 'first', 'beautiful', 'vast', 'more', 'epic', 'first', 'big', 'long', 'detailed', 'aragorn', 'gimli', 'full', 'important', 'deep', 'other', 'whole', 'good', 'full', 'forbidden', 'least', 'favorite', 'least', 'previous', 'useless', 'little', 'more', 'once', 'small', 'beautiful', 'norse', 'sneaky', 'gentle', 'famed', 'different', 'good', 'long', 'special', 'visual', 'flawless', 'funny', 'unresolved', 'gandalf', 'relieving', 'frustrated', 'enjoyable', 'noble', 'second'];0.2034321175278622

401;Nigel St. Buggering;"after the thickly-layered mountains of praise heaped upon ""fellowship of the ring"", perhaps it was inevitable that ""the two towers"" couldn't live up to it. and maybe i'm the only one who feels that it did not. unfortunately, where ""fellowship"" managed a near-perfect combination of the book's strengths with a good deal of shoring up to cover its weaknesses (sorry, ringies, but it does have weaknesses), ""towers"" shows all too many of the limitations of its source material, and the additions sadly weaken it even further. certainly there's plenty to admire. the new characters are beautifully introduced and performed, particularly in the case of miranda otto as eowyn, and a surprisingly sympathetic and complex rendition of gollum, who could easily have been extremely irritating. the new characters, in fact, come off much better than the established ones. john rhys davies' gimli suffers particularly, reduced to an almost jar-jar-like role of comic relief and battle buffoon. also of note is the spectacular staging of the assault on helm's deep, surely one of the finest mass ground battles ever committed to film. however, there are many more mis-steps here than evident in the first film. a sequence in which aragorn is separated from the party ultimately serves no purpose, as he simply experiences a flashback sequence and is quickly reunited with his friends. why? in addition, the pacing is less even than that found in ""fellowship"". where that film managed to pace out its thrills in excellent beats with the story-driven scenes, this one makes the audience wait quite a bit longer for payoff. ""the two towers"" is more likely to test the patience of those not already enamored of tolkien's world, as it's a long haul from the bombastic balrog opening to the two battles that cap off the story. at the same time, the many liberties taken with the structure of the book (especially the characterization of faramir) may put off the hardcore fans. still, there are a lot of filmgoers out there who decided to unconditionally love this series long before the first chapter hit the screens, and i doubt that this will dim their enthusiasm. i can't wholeheartedly recommend ""the two towers"" for everyone, but that really won't stop anybody. as a means of getting from part one to part three, it does its job in an entertaining manner. hopefully, ""return of the king"" will bring us as rousing a conclusion as ""fellowship of the ring"" was an introduction. but this definitely represents a dip in the road.";19 December 2002;7;['thickly', 'inevitable', 'only', 'perfect', 'good', 'sorry', 'many', 'new', 'sympathetic', 'complex', 'new', 'well', 'gimli', 'like', 'comic', 'spectacular', 'deep', 'fine', 'mass', 'many', 'more', 'evident', 'first', 'excellent', 'likely', 'enamored', 'long', 'bombastic', 'same', 'many', 'hardcore', 'first', 'entertaining'];0.2855757575757576

405;AsifZamir;this is my favourite of the lord of the rings trilogy. the movie the lord of the rings: the two towers is based on j.r.r. tolkien's second novel in the lord of the rings series. the series is an extension of the hobbit and carries on the story of the hobbit bilbo baggin's nephew, frodo. on bilbo's original dragon slaying quest he comes across a ring, whose original bearer was smeagal. smeagal was originally a hobbit, but when fishing one day with a relative he came across the ring and killed his relative for it. the ring has show much power that smeagal migrated to deep down in the mountains and became a shell of a man fading away but had his life prolonged by the ring and in the end becomes gollum who has a split personality and talks to himself. gollum becomes barely recognizable as a hobbit and bilbo stumbled across the ring and gollum deep in the mountains, ends up with the ring and carries this burden a while and then passed it on to frodo. now frodo and his best friend sam escape from their hometown and embark on an epic adventure filled with danger in order to have frodo return the ring to where it was forged and destroy it. the ring was made by dark lord sauron who is a wizard gone rogue and sauron's life source is bound in the ring. when it was forged it was forged with this curse: one ring to rule them all, one ring to find them, one ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them. the lord of the rings: the two towers is the middle part of this epic journey and simply sheer genius. the book is phenomenal and the movie a classic. they'll never be able to make a better remake of this movie. - asif zamir;28 November 2013;10;['second', 'original', 'original', 'smeagal', 'much', 'split', 'recognizable', 'good', 'epic', 'dark', 'middle', 'epic', 'sheer', 'phenomenal', 'able', 'well'];0.2269230769230769
406;MinorityReporter;the second part of the lord of the rings saga maintains the style, momentum and integrity that made the first film as brilliant as it is and thus what peter jackson gives us is one of the best sequels ever and certainly the best film of 2002. i prefer the first film for being closer to the book but i completely understand the changes made from book to film and i see why they are necessary to keep the film's narrative flowing instead of dropping dead. the film is not without a few weaknesses mainly because of it being a middle part linking the fellowship of the ring and the return of the king and therefore not having an obvious beginning or an end. this doesn't stop the film from being an experience that people shouldn't be cheated out of. the acting is, like in the first film, very good and at times even brilliant. viggo mortensen improves greatly and provides a more well rounded and believable aragorn and proves his qualities as an actor especially in the quit moments (of which there are too few in the theatrical release, this was remedied in the extended cut). also elijah wood deepens his character considerably and shows many of the darker sides of his character in the film. this provides for some interesting exchanges between wood and his faithful companion played by sean astin. bernard hill is introduced in this film along with the method actor, brad dourif. both of the aforementioned are excellent in their respective parts even though there are some inconsistencies in hill's character compared to the character from the book. these changes were obviously made for dramatic purposes and are very plausible. ian mckellen's character, gandalf, has been somewhat reduced in the second film but instead he steals every scene he is in. likewise, hugo weaving's character has been reduced but he is still very good and keeps his character in the same style as in the first film. orlando bloom and john rhys-davies returns as well and i have to comment on the choice to make gimli into comic relief, because while i understand the necessity given that dominic monaghan's and billy boyd's characters have taken a turn towards more serious characters there had to be someone to relieve the dramatic tension, i found it a shame that gimli had been reduced to some bumbling clown. fortunately most of his comic remarks worked. among other characters introduced are faramir, played by david wenham, and gollum, played beautifully by andy serkis. i'll get back to faramir but for now i have to comment on gollum. gollum is quite simply the most interesting film character in the last decade and this relates both to the ground breaking special effects but also serkis' performance, which was most unfairly not deemed fit for an oscar nomination. overall the acting is excellent like in the first film and all actors manages to develop their characters in ways that are at the very least acceptable. the effects and fight scenes in this second film are among the best ever and is perhaps only bested by some of the effects in the third film in the series. the gollum character and the battle for helm's deep seem to be excellent examples. gollum is quite simply the most stunning and beautifully created cgi character of all time and he displays extraordinary emotional range. as previously stated the battle for helm's deep is among the finest battle scenes ever created. well paced and choreographed and above all the editing in between the hectic battle sequences and scared citizens provides for some emotional depth as well (something that was sorely needed in the battle sequences in star wars: episode ii). this gigantic battle isn't the only battle in the film. there are many other interesting battles but i'm not going to spoil them so you'll just have to see the film yourself. the battles are consistent with the style that was laid down in the first film they are simply on a much more epic scale. some people have raved that the changes made from book to film were too radical but i completely understand and condone the reasons which were obviously dramatic purposes. especially david wenham's character has been criticized and after watching it the first time i was a bit unhappy with his character as well but when you think about it the changes in the character were at the very least essential to maintain the narrative structure. there are other examples but it would really be pointless to mention them because the reason is exactly the same as in the case of david wenham's character. dramatic purposes. overall the two towers serves as an excellent link between the fellowship of the ring and the return of the king and it deserves every bit of praise coming to it. one of the very best films of all time. 10/10 -

407;a666333;"people often worship this part of the trilogy but it was effectively ruined by the grossly unrealistic portrayal of the battles. a bit of rudimentary research could have prevented that up but peter jackson, who otherwise has a great eye for detail, clearly didn't respect his material or his audience enough to do his work properly, or, he was badly advised. spoilers follow for example; one does not launch mass cavalry charges down steep slopes. anyone who has ever rode on a horse would know this. historically, people have not been so crazy as it inevitably would lead to a mass pile up at the bottom and a complete disaster. one also does not charge cavalry directly into a well formed pike formation even on flat terrain, let alone down a slope. it is suicidal and skilled, experienced soldiers would avoid such tactics as a matter of routine. there were other very badly handled scenes but i won't start listing them all but they are there for anyone to see. it is really disappointing to create such wonderful costumes, bring in lots of motivated extras and state of the art sgi effects and then neglect to do even the most rudimentary research on the simple physics of battles (let alone intelligent tactics). it is also disappointing that the viewing public accepts such incompetence as justifiable ""artistic license"". as an analogy, think of an otherwise well produced ww2 movie that portrayed soldiers and equipment doing things that were physically impossible or downright crazy. wouldn't that hurt any film that set itself up to be an epic?";15 September 2005;6;['unrealistic', 'rudimentary', 'great', 'mass', 'steep', 'crazy', 'mass', 'complete', 'flat', 'suicidal', 'skilled', 'experienced', 'such', 'other', 'disappointing', 'such', 'wonderful', 'motivated', 'rudimentary', 'simple', 'intelligent', 'such', 'justifiable', 'artistic', 'impossible', 'crazy'];0.0675925925925926

409;darkmax;to everyone who gave a negative review, would you please comment sensibly? look, this is the second part of a trilogy. you are really watching a 9-hour movie shown to you in 3 parts. all the character building is done in the first installment. the second movie is more to advance various characters' relationships and moving the story of the war further. do you see the frailty of humans, dwarves and elves (who are supposed to be immortal)?? do you feel the heroes clinging on to their hope in the impossibility of their situations? do you see the variety of personalities that made up the people in helm's deep? the commoners? the warriors? the knights? the defenders of the weak? or do you just see a story that has been dragged for 3-hours? i believe some are critical about how peter jackson omitted out or changed certain portions of the story. people, he is trying to do his best to give us the best interpretation of the very lengthy and often long-winded story written by j.r.r. tolkien. believe me, going through the length of the 3 books was quite torturous (even though i think it is a modern classic). if he were to be as true to the books as some of you want it to be, he would probably be better off making the nine segments that made up the 3 books!! by then most of you would have lost much interest over some of the very exhausive and boring parts of the entire story. be very grateful mr jackson has given us the best fantasy epic yet! then think about this: can you do better?!;26 December 2002;10;['negative', 'second', 'first', 'second', 'more', 'various', 'immortal', 'deep', 'weak', 'critical', 'certain', 'good', 'good', 'lengthy', 'torturous', 'modern', 'true', 'well', 'most', 'much', 'exhausive', 'boring', 'entire', 'grateful', 'good'];0.1389097744360902
410;HBeachBabe;"much like gollum in the film, i am off two minds about two towers. oh it still gets a 10 and is an absolutely astonishing work of art and entertainment. the battle scenes alone are the greatest ever put to film. my sole complaint comes only in comparison to the first film, fellowship of the ring. in fotr we get one story - frodo's story - told over 3 hours. there is a singular drive and focus. two towers however, actually being made up of two 'books' (lord of the rings was written as six books that the publisher combined into 3) has a split focus. 'the battle of isengard"" sections focusing on merry & peppin with the ents, and aragorn, legolas and gimli and the events leading up to the battle of helm's deep; and 'the ring goes west' section featuring frodo and sam's dealings with gollum and faromir. the movie rapidly moves between the two parts of the novel and as such, the is a lack of cohesion to the story. it doesn't movie forward in the way fellowship did. oh, it's still better than nearly any other movie out there, but whereas fotr is in my top 10 all time, two towers will have to be content with being in my top 20. as for changes from the book, who cares???? it's a movie, not the novel on screen. if the author had wanted a movie, he would have written a movie. the job of a film is to tell the essence of the story. getting every detail from the book exact is what makes the harry potter films so lacking in spark and magic. peter jackson's ability to deviate from the novel when it serves the needs of the movie is amazing and commendable. anyone demanding slavish devotion to the text should be rightfully ignored. and yes, that means shelob and the tunnel have been moved to the beginning of the 3rd film. yes that means the elves, and arwen in particular, have a larger role here than in the novel. but it all works and works brilliantly. this is a film not to be missed on the big screen.";19 December 2002;10;['astonishing', 'great', 'sole', 'first', 'singular', 'split', 'gimli', 'deep', 'such', 'well', 'other', 'content', 'harry', 'amazing', 'commendable', 'slavish', 'particular', 'large', 'big'];0.2187229437229437

413;tevanson;"maybe my expectations were too high. maybe all the critics' hype of the film set me up. but while ""the two towers"" is head and shoulders above everything else this year (including spielberg's awful ""catch me if you can"" and scorcese's flawed masterpiece ""gangs of new york""), it's not a perfect film by any means. perhaps the greatest flaw in the movie is the failure to maintain narrative speed. the film does a truly admirable job of picking up the story ""where we left off."" the superb special effects of gandalf's battle with the balrog are eye-popping. but from there, the film stumbles a bit. the fellowship's chase of the uruk-hai across the plains of rohan lacks much of the spectacle and blow-you-away visuals that were typical of the first film. the introduction of eothain's horsemen seems sudden and jarring. the special effects of theoden's transformation from ensorcelled king into hale-and-hearty middle-aged man are too shocking to be believed. the scenes with merry, pippin and the ents in the forest are cut into the film almost as afterthoughts, and are not well-integrated, not well-written and not lengthy enough to really stand up well. the animation of treebeard himself is rather poor, and looks more like a sad version of a disney animatronic creature than the astounding, realistic being we have come to expect from weta film. and the middle-of-the-film segments with elrond, arwen and aragorn are poorly paced, poorly conceived and don't fit in well with the rest of the story (or what is to come in the next film, either). but most disturbingly, the script too often takes the audience out of the real of middle earth and back into the present. the villian here are the silly jokes that appear throughout the film. gimli's ""oof""-ing moments when the isengard wolves fall on him is something out of chaplin, not middle earth. the brief, joking exchange between aragorn and gimli as they attempt to sneak out of helm's deep and attack the uruk-hai on the ramp are similarly out of place (they would have fit in had the scene been better-written). indeed, the film turns gimli from a full-blown, honest, realistic character into the ""joking little dwarf"" character of the film. it's something to be expected of lesser films like ""willow"" or tv shows like ""hercules"" -- not lotr. but overall, the film is outstanding. while the pacing of the narrative leaves something to be desired, the overall story is terrific (a major accomplishment, given the huge amount of source material). the character development is much stronger in this film than in the first one, and the acting -- particularly by christopher lee, brad dourif, ian mckellan, bernard hill and david wenham -- is quite good. the battle for helm's deep ranks with the opening segment of ""saving private ryan"" and the snow-battle of ""the empire strikes back"" as one of the great war scenes of all time. so is the battle of the ents at isengard (although one wishes there had been more of this segment).";27 December 2002;8;['high', 'awful', 'flawed', 'perfect', 'great', 'narrative', 'admirable', 'superb', 'special', 'much', 'typical', 'first', 'sudden', 'jarring', 'special', 'hearty', 'middle', 'aged', 'shocking', 'lengthy', 'poor', 'sad', 'disney', 'animatronic', 'astounding', 'realistic', 'weta', 'middle', 'next', 'middle', 'silly', 'middle', 'gimli', 'deep', 'gimli', 'honest', 'realistic', 'little', 'less', 'lotr', 'outstanding', 'overall', 'terrific', 'major', 'huge', 'strong', 'first', 'good', 'deep', 'private', 'great', 'more'];0.1145654761904761

420;Hellrazr360;"part of what made the last lord of the rings movie so great was its presentation. the light-hearted scenes were heart-warming and the darker moments were more suspenseful. the two towers takes a dark turn in the lord of the rings and uses it to be its primary mood. for the most part, this darker atmosphere pays off and helps the battles seem more impressive. the fellowship is broken in this movie, but the journey must continue as the two towers continues right where the fellowship of the ring left off, like a true sequel. almost instantly, jackson introduces us to a crowd favorite character, smeagol and gollum. but why do we love this two part combo character? maybe it has to do with the world-famous line ""my precious...."" yes, that line alone makes this ugly imp-like creature one the audience can't help but love. frodo and sam don't have much a role in this movie, instead, the two towers puts the major focus around aragorn, legolus and gimli, which i'm pretty thankful for. it's nice to see that after getting used to the silly hobbits that we get a movie that puts as much dedication towards the more serious part of the group. gandalf also makes a return appearance and his changed attitude makes him more or less a more credible character this time around. the battle sequences in this movie are big and great. the first few battles that take place out in open fields are impressive themselves, but you won't know true battle scenes until the battle for helms deep. this sequence, combined with the ents taking on isengard is one of the most impressive epic battle combos ever seen in a movie. the cgi in the two towers is also incredible, no shot looks bad or ugly, with the exception of the brutal and nasty orcs and uruk-hai. other new characters are brought into trilogy with the two towers and while it's nice to see some more good guys fight against the orcs, the movie lacks a spark to make them more lovable. the connection that jackson establishes with these new characters exists, but it isn't used to the effect that he did with smeagol and gollum, which is a true shame. regardless of this flaw that affects the movie more than it probably should've, the two towers is an great sequel. some will say that this is the best of the lord of the rings movies, which in some ways is true. but compared to how great the first movie in this epic trilogy was, the two towers just doesn't create the same impressive feeling that fellowship of the ring left.";5 February 2006;9;['last', 'great', 'light', 'dark', 'suspenseful', 'dark', 'primary', 'most', 'dark', 'impressive', 'true', 'favorite', 'famous', 'precious', 'ugly', 'like', 'much', 'major', 'aragorn', 'gimli', 'thankful', 'nice', 'silly', 'much', 'serious', 'credible', 'big', 'great', 'first', 'few', 'open', 'impressive', 'true', 'deep', 'impressive', 'epic', 'incredible', 'bad', 'ugly', 'brutal', 'nasty', 'other', 'new', 'nice', 'good', 'lovable', 'new', 'true', 'more', 'great', 'good', 'true', 'great', 'first', 'epic', 'same', 'impressive'];0.2304292929292928
421;Niv-1;the first part of the lord of the rings trilogy was very overrated. the action scenes were repetitive and overlong and some of the characterizations were terribly annoying (merry, pippin, sam). the second installment however, overcomes it's very choppy editing (especially regarding the romance between aragorn and arwen) and definitely rises above fellowship of the ring. one of the main reasons is the presence of the ents (the walking, talking trees.) these scenes are excellent. they stand for the all the environmental destruction that has gone on the past century, whether by war or industrialization. merry and pippin were seriously toned down, whether by circumstances, or the realization of the filmmakers and actors that their antics in fellowship was very detrimental to a consistent tone for the series. these scenes were very powerful. the score by howard shore is very good especially in the ent scenes. bernard hill is excellent in the role of king theoden. miranda otto as his niece eowyn is very impressive, and i look forward to more of her in return of the king. the widely hailed helm's deep climax was largely sabotaged by the dual between legolas and gimli as to who could kill more. another good aspect of the movie is gollum, voiced by andy serkis. there are a couple of good scenes involving frodo sympathizing with gollum because of the effect the ring had on him. overall the two towers was a tremendous improvement over the fellowship of the ring, but because of the editing problems and the incompetent acting of sean astin, still is wildly overrated with many flaws.;3 October 2003;6;['first', 'overrated', 'repetitive', 'overlong', 'annoying', 'second', 'choppy', 'main', 'excellent', 'environmental', 'past', 'detrimental', 'consistent', 'powerful', 'good', 'excellent', 'impressive', 'more', 'deep', 'gimli', 'more', 'good', 'good', 'tremendous', 'incompetent', 'overrated', 'many'];0.288095238095238

425;Zod-2;"i have a sneaky suspicion that many, not all mind you but many, of the people going to see the two towers are watching it with blinders on. seeing only what they wish to see and not seeing what is being presented on the screen. for years we have been told that the lord of the rings is the defining work of fantasy fiction. it is no doubt very thought out and well written but when you come right down to it the novels are very often quite dull and over-long and that is brought out magnificently in the second installment the two towers, which is itself quite dull and over-long. the two towers is a great looking movie and very well acted, the problem is it isn't very well paced. overall the movie doesn't even need to exist for all it accomplishes. as has been pointed out it bridges the gap between the first and third films however it doesn't justify a 3 hour running time. is the two towers an action picture? i certainly hope not! if it is the film makers need to take another look at the first two hours of the film which are only lightly peppered with action sequences and to make matters worse contain fewer pieces of important/interesting plot. the final 45 minutes is loaded with action footage and does pick up the pace of the rest of the movie quite nicely. the battle at helm's deep is a magnificent spectacle but alone cannot save the movie. the battle of the ents is also visually impressive but, as with the helm's deep battle, ends rather unsatisfyingly. instead of being climactic battle scenes both battles instead play as saviors to an otherwise dull movie. at 3 hours the two towers is over-long but even with an hour shaved off the running time i don't think this movie has what it takes to be truly ""great"". although i do think special notice should be made of gollum as he is very well done and the most interesting character in the movie and makes the otherwise enormously dull frodo and sam portions of the film worth watching. i throughly enjoyed the fellowship of the ring but the two towers fails to entertain. this, however, is not necessarily the film makers fault but due to the flaws in the source material. when watched with blinders off the lord of the rings: the two towers receives and deserves a 5 out of 10.";26 December 2002;5;['sneaky', 'many', 'many', 'defining', 'dull', 'long', 'second', 'dull', 'long', 'great', 'first', 'third', 'first', 'bad', 'few', 'important', 'interesting', 'final', 'deep', 'magnificent', 'impressive', 'deep', 'climactic', 'dull', 'long', 'great', 'special', 'interesting', 'dull', 'worth'];0.1829805996472663
426;DragoonKain;having seen the second part of my favorite epic novel, it once again blew me away. a word of warning: this one is dark. the book, like the movie, takes a very dark and violent turn in this second part. i love that sort of thing, so i was very happy, but be wary if you're taking kids to see this one. spoiler warning rather than seperate the journey of frodo and sam from the rest of the story, they interlaced them together, and a lot of changes were made. many of them for the better, but like before there were a few changes i did not like. first the bad stuff. most of the changes i did not like were simply the things left out of the story. the ents, for instance, could have been more developed on. we didn't get to hear much of their philosophy and lifestyle, which was a very enjoyable part of the book (no meantion of entwives). and they made the ents seem less intelligent then they are portrayed in the books. also, there didn't seem to be enough gandalf in this one. in the book, he had a much larger role. it would have been nice to see the events leading up to gandalf's battle on the peak, and i think more explanation was needed as to gandalf's return as gandalf the white. those that didn't read the book wouldn't know how he wound up in fangorn forest. then again, i really didn't fully understand what happened to him until i read the silmarillion so i guess a little mystery was tolkien's intention. but i think they just left a little too much unexplained here. i could have done without the whole aragorn being thought dead part. not really a bad part as we get to see more of the story of arwen and aragorn, but kind of unnecessary. the siege of isengard was just as cool as i had hoped, but was a bit short. in fact, this movie actually was too short. it ends quite a bit early in comparison to the book, probably a good choice pacing-wise since you can't top that climax. but, i hope they make up for those lost chapters in the next movie. still, i had simliar feelings about the stuff they left out of the fellowship, and they made up for it perfectly in the extended edition, which is definitely the most flawless movie i have ever seen. hopefully it will be the same when the ee comes out for this one. pretty much everything else in this movie was perfect. the battle of helms deep (a favorite chapter of mine) is every bit i could have hoped for and more. this was the mother of all battles in the book (second only to the battle of the pelennor fields in return of the king), and they really hit the nail on the head for this one. they didn't change the course of the battle too much from the book, but the additions they made to it were great. i especially love the addition of the lothlorien elves to the battle. the look, special effects, score, fight scenes and acting were wonderful. the performance of gollum/smeagol was right on. another great addition was the story of arwen and aragorn, an appendix to the book i was afraid they were going to leave out. although they leave out most of their history, we do get to know enough about their past, and in the process learn a little more about the elves. another cool addition was the whole fight with the warg riders. we get introduced to wargs in the hobbit but don't see much of them in the lord of the rings novel. definitely a cool fight scene (gotta love gimli). gimli was probably my favorite character for this movie. in the book, gimli and legolas were very well developed characters. two warriors who start off hating each other, then wind up best friends. peter jackson, thankfully, managed to develop them well. gimli kind of takes a back seat to legolas in the first one, but in this one he really shines. he is the comic releif in this one, as he is in the book, and peter jackson nailed it. we definitely needed the comic relief among all this doom. my favorite bits of tolkien dialog are the ones between legolas and gimli during the battle of helms deep. they're both pretty much doomed to die, but all they can do in between cleaving orcs is joke around and place bets on the number of kills they can get. i was very happy to see that this is one of the few bits of tolkien dialog pj left unchanged. this was definitely a wonderful film, go see it, and see the extended edition as well. 10/10;18 December 2002;10;['second', 'favorite', 'epic', 'dark',

427;DragoonKain;after seeing the extended version of this movie, i'm going to have to change my vote for this movie from a 9 to a 10 (pretty much what happened with the first one). they fixed everything i found wrong with the first. the theatrical was a great thrill ride. it was fast paced, and you could really feel the doom upon all the good guys. but the extended was an epic of biblical proportions on its own. jackson expands the depth of every character in the movie, often going beyond what even tolkien depicted. the most important thing is that faramir's character is completely redeemed. although still not quite the same character he was portrayed in the book, he is depicted as a much more similar character to the one in the book in the extended cut than he is depicted in the theatrical cut. he is a much more sympathetic character, and it is now understandable why it took him so long to make the right decision. we now know more about the ents, (and the entwives), and we get more gandalf, which i can't get enough of. we also get more of an end to this movie. i always thought the theatrical version ended prematurely. after all it left nearly half the book untold. this one still doesn't make it to the end of the book, but it doesn't leave much left, and it ends on a much more satisfying note, although still a brilliant cliffhanger. if you have the option and the extra 40 minutes, definitely see the extended edition instead of the theatrical version.;18 November 2003;10;['extended', 'first', 'wrong', 'first', 'great', 'good', 'biblical', 'own', 'important', 'same', 'similar', 'extended', 'theatrical', 'sympathetic', 'understandable', 'right', 'more', 'more', 'enough', 'more', 'theatrical', 'untold', 'much', 'left', 'satisfying', 'brilliant', 'extra', 'extended', 'theatrical'];0.2811688311688312
428;DragoonKain;i tend to find that the people who have not seen these films yet are people that assume they will not like it, or feel intimidated by its epic scale, running time, and/or feel turned off by the fantasy genre in general. do not let this deter you from seeing these films, they are definitely worth your time for one viewing as they are great movies, and destined to be classics. i would go as far to say that they are the best book adaptations to film, but this is, of course, all a matter of opinion. (and as a long time fan of the books, i'm a bit biased). first of all, i highly reccomend seeing the extended editions of these films as opposed to the theatrical versions. you may want to wait for the ee of rotk to come out on dvd before watching these films. the extended editions are simply far superior versions because it more closely captures the pacing, and feel of the books. there is also more depth of character and development introduced in the extended editions lacking from the shorter theatrical versions. whereas the theatrical versions are simple, but good action/special effect movies, the extended editions are grand epic adventures that have far more depth and intelligence to them. secondly, unless you are watching them for the first at a lotr buttnumbathon type party, i do not reccomend watching them all at once. all together, these films clock in at about 12 hours not including breaks. your rear will probably be hating its existence by the time you get to return of the king. instead, i reccomend watching it small doses. the extended dvd editions split the films over 2 discs and are perfectly designed for 6 90-120 minute episodic viewings. this is the length of an average film, and allow for much less of a time commitment. still, i reccomend you not wait too long before seeing the next part, as these films essentially are one story with many characters, place names, and plot lines that can be easily forgotten. it's best to watch one dvd per night over 6 nights. treat it like a really good tv mini-series that you don't want to miss each night. lastly, turn off the lights, pump up the volume, and turn on the subtitles. there are many strange words in these films, and it helps if you can see them written in front of you. the films are pretty easy to follow, but the plot is also complex and deep. you will enjoy the films more if you understand as much as you can, as one of the main appeals of tolkien's story is its attention to detail. i can guarantee you that if you give these films a chance and take my reccomendations to heart you will not be disappointed. enjoy.;25 August 2004;10;['epic', 'general', 'worth', 'great', 'good', 'long', 'biased', 'extended', 'theatrical', 'extended', 'superior', 'more', 'extended', 'short', 'theatrical', 'theatrical', 'simple', 'good', 'special', 'extended', 'grand', 'epic', 'more', 'first', 'lotr', 'buttnumbathon', 'small', 'extended', 'episodic', 'average', 'less', 'next', 'many', 'good', 'good', 'many', 'strange', 'easy', 'complex', 'deep', 'main'];0.2372023809523809

446;MyDarkStar;"i needed a little bit of time to ponder upon this installment of lord of the rings after seeing it. i wanted to think about how it would be viewed in the grand scheme of things for this trilogy years from now. because basically, i don't view lord of the rings so much as three different movies, as much as one giant 9 hr movie that we just happen to see in three 3hr segments. looking at it from that perspective, i think this ""segment"" had two main goals : 1) have more action than part i 2) set up part iii as the mac-daddy ending-to-end-all-endings this one does have more action scenes than part i - though the majority of the action scenes are grouped together towards the end of the movie. as far as setting up part iii to be an ending-to-end-all-endings, well, i think this film accomplishes that because it really kept some key parts from ""the two towers"" book. because of that, peter jackson is basically going to have a ton of material to put into part iii. i mean, there's probably about 45-60 minutes worth of material that's going to have to appear in the movie ""the return of the king"" that is from the book ""the two towers"". so, the third part should be pretty interesting. so, i'll admit it, i was slightly disappointed at first - but when i started thinking about what jackson has set himself up for in part iii, i realized that it's all a matter of telling the tale in a way that will make for the most successful trilogy possible. part i : has to be awesome, make sure the entire audience wants to come back for part ii part ii : give everyone their action fix & those big battles that movie goers love part iii : make sure the audience leaves this one thinking it was a home-run on all levels knowing what all material jackson left for part iii, he definitely has set up the trilogy to end with a home run. i will have to say this : the second time was much better than the first! much better! somehow, the movie seemed to move along much smoother & the pace was more tolerable & balanced. on the other hand, certain aspects of the film that caught my attention in a negative way stuck out even more noticeably the second time. the best example of this was aragorn's ""dreams"" that he was having of arwen (which were not part of the book). because of the awkward change of pace to the rest of the film, these scenes felt slightly out of place - and the fact that they are not part of the book makes it look like a bad call on jackson's part to add them. i'm convinced jackson is viewing this whole epic as a giant stew that he wants to be able to look at 10 years from now and never have to worry about saying to himself ""hmmm...i should have put this in there when i had a chance"". i mean, after all, is anyone going to care that there are 10 minutes of mushy dream scenes between aragorn & arwen when they view these films back-to-back on dvd on a 11 hr super mega platinum edition years from now ? gollum was especially impressive to me the second time around. they just couldn't have done a better job with him. they don't overuse him in the scenes and they make sure that when he says something it's memorable. inevitably there will be comparisons to jar-jar, but in reality there really is no comparison. i think this is another example of how lotr has shown up the new star wars in yet another way. lucas was determined to have jar-jar be one of his shining accomplishments with the new trilogy (have a completely cgi character play a supporting role in the movie). instead of having jar-jar viewed as a great cinematic accomplishment, lucas has people begging him to get rid of the character. gollum, on the other hand, is actually a very interesting character that actually brings something to the story, and you enjoy viewing on screen. i'm a little worried about what all jackson has left for part iii, though i do understand why he left it for part iii. however, he has so much material to cover in that movie that it could be quite overwhelming to those that didn't read the books. ""return of the king"" is definitely going to have to be the longest of the three films if he is going to cover the material the way it needs to be covered. when i wrote comments on ""fellowship"" on imdb, i said it was a good start for what could potentially be the greatest trilogy in cinematic history. i think this installation of lotr does a proper job in bridging the trilogy & setting us up for what should be the proper ending to the greatest trilogy of all time.";22 December 2002;8;['little', 'grand', 'different', 'much', 'giant', 'main', 'more', 'more', 'key', 'worth', 'third', 'interesting', 'successful', 'possible', 'awesome', 'sure', 'entire', 'big', 'sure', 'material', 'second', 'well', 'first', 'smooth', 'tolerable', 'balanced', 'other', 'certain', 'negative', 'second', 'good', 'aragorn', 'awkward', 'bad', 'convinced', 'whole', 'giant', 'able', 'mushy', 'mega', 'impressive', 'second', 'well', 'sure', 'memorable', 'new', 'determined', 'new', 'great', 'cinematic', 'other', 'interesting', 'little', 'worried', 'much', 'overwhelming', 'long', 'good', 'great', 'cinematic', 'proper', 'proper', 'great'];0.2315735930735931
447;headfulofghosts126;"i know that it's not really appropriate to review the two towers as a straight sequel since lotr is essentially one nine hour long movie. still, it falls into some traps that most regular sequels do. i enjoyed fellowship an immense amount more than this film. maybe that has something to do with the fact that it was our first glimpse into this world and that unbelievable first impression has been somewhat watered down now that i've grown used to the impressive visuals and sweeping landscapes. it doesn't hit as hard when you've seen it all before. my biggest problem with ttt is that the splitting of the fellowship from part i really hurts the story. obviously they're following the books and this is the sequence of events but the only section of this film i found interesting were the events that centered around aragorn, legolas, and gimli. frodo and sam are very boring characters when they're left on their own. i won't even go into the ""other"" two hobbits bc if i had to see one more scene of them in that damn tree i was going to stab somebody. the characters work best together. their chemistry was a huge part of the first films charm. this one feels rather flat. a lot of gloss without a whole lot of substance underneath it. it also feels like the first film was on a larger scale. this one kind of felt like i was looking at the same countryside over and over again. obviously the climax to ttt is far superior to fellowship but that's about all it has on the original movie. that and gollum, who alone is almost worth the price of admission. but the ring wraiths are totally wasted in this film, and surprisingly unfrightening. they were one of my favorite parts of fellowship but here they're just cartoons. now i haven't read the books since i was a kid, but i know that fellowship was a much better adaptation than ttt. everything they needed was right there in the pages. why did they feel the need to change so much? i don't need it to be down to the last detail. hell, i like the new love triangle they've added... but there's something missing in this entry. a level of intrigue that the first one maintaned throughout it's entire running time. there were only a few moments of ttt that left me with a similar reaction. don't get me wrong, this was still one of the better movies i've seen. it's actually fantastic until compared to the earlier film. bottom line- great flick, but not the same rush as part i.";28 December 2002;8;['appropriate', 'straight', 'long', 'most', 'regular', 'immense', 'more', 'first', 'unbelievable', 'first', 'impressive', 'sweeping', 'big', 'only', 'interesting', 'aragorn', 'gimli', 'boring', 'own', 'other', 'more', 'damn', 'huge', 'first', 'flat', 'whole', 'first', 'large', 'same', 'superior', 'original', 'worth', 'favorite', 'well', 'much', 'last', 'new', 'first', 'entire', 'few', 'similar', 'wrong', 'well', 'fantastic', 'early', 'bottom', 'great', 'same'];0.1881412337662337
448;Essex_Rider;for all its wonderful special effects, for me the most moving part of the film was the relationship between frodo and sam and gollum and frodo. although not a verbatim copy of the book, peter jackson has caught the spirit of tolkiens world and characters so completely that it left me emotionally drained. from an initial reaction of disgust when first confronted by gollum, frodo gradually realises that the ring has almost destroyed the creature and that this process is happening to him as well. i found it profoundly moving to watch as this strange relationship builds between them. peter jackson has allowed andy serkis to express the full range of gollums plight and the wizards behind the scenes have pulled of the greatest feat imaginable. they have given gollum the ability to make us feel for him in creating a wonderfully and almost human schizophrenic creature. the director has also pulled us headlong into a world created by tolkien and made us believe. the breathtaking landscape 'is' middle earth, complete with the complex creatures that inhabit it. those who gripe continuously about the differences between the book and the film are obviously unaware of the problems created by the different narratives. a visual narrative is very different to a literary one. peter jackson has very cleverly interwoven the spirit of tolkiens world with the reality of cinematography and special effects. i thought it would be difficult to better the fellowship of the ring, this has, and if the final episode is the best, then we're in for a truly staggering experience.;29 August 2003;10;['wonderful', 'special', 'verbatim', 'initial', 'strange', 'full', 'great', 'imaginable', 'human', 'schizophrenic', 'middle', 'complete', 'complex', 'unaware', 'different', 'visual', 'different', 'literary', 'special', 'difficult', 'final', 'good', 'staggering'];0.1533834586466165

450;bnm81510;"after a year of anticipation, increasingly intense with each day of waiting, each spoiler revealed, and each rave early review read, the second part of lotr has finally arrived. as a wary filmgoer who seldom wastes money on current cineplex junk, i was naturally concerned whether this colossal undertaking will live up to my expectations, let alone its equally collossal hype. perhaps, the two towers is an easier book to adapt cinematically, because it is more action-based, and its main events occur during a more condensed time period - weeks as opposed to months or years. on the other hand, it creates greater challenges in terms of intercutting between three separate storylines. peter jackson does a near-flawless job facing up to these challenges, and largely succeeds. the flaws are still there, but they are less jarring. the ""gloom and doom"" yet hopeful spirit of tolkien's second book is present in spades, and again - painstalking detail is lavished on all visual aspects of middle earth. now, the usual discussion of strengths and weaknesses - and the latter are definitely fewer this time around. warning - possible spoilers ahead!!!! ----------------------------------------------- the good: 1) my favorite character in the entire book was always gollum, and jackson's team along with andy serkis absolutely nail him. he is best acted and most complex of all, a feat for a cgi creature. as another reviewer said, ""jar-jar is not fit to lick gollum's ass"", a view which i wholeheartedly agree with. when gollum/serkis remembers his past as smeagol, the moment alone is worth the price of admission. personalit(ies) indeed go a long way. nearly every scene in the book that featured gollum is reproduced here, with great accuracy, even the ""rabbit stew"" scene! the final scene of the film is extremely effective, possibly one of the finest. 2) gimli - yes, he is largely relegated to necessary comic relief, but he is funny, not laughable. his character is actually well realized, because a dwarf would truly feel like a fish out of water in such foreign surroundings. he also gets to save the day more than a few times. i have a feeling he'll have even more to say and do in the extended dvd. 3) merry and pippin display passion and wit, taking their development further. 4)the movie is historically/geographically minded, and handles various new places and concepts well. the fans even get references to the bombadil story omitted from fotr - the old forest and the barrow-whigths (gollum sings their song). all of the landscapes are gorgeous, and 100% alan lee. 5) of course, the epic feel is tremendous and the action spectacular. it is unneeded to even mention. at times it seemed like i was watching something out of the iliad. the not-so-bad: 1) arwen and aragorn came off well, at least non-distracting. the sequence of arwen mourning and wandering the woods alone was starltingly beautiful. 2) faramir i never cared much about, so his motivation changes did not bother me. the actor playing him was not very strong however, and didn't impress me. good thing he had little screen time. 3) treebeard was decent, not quite as i would have liked but in the context of the film, the ents worked. i know that they will get additional scenes in the dvd from jackson's interview. their scenes appeared choppy. the destruction of isengard, though, was magnificent - goosebump-worthy. 4) the music was still excessive, but better. the rohan theme was more pleasing to the ear than any pseudo-titanic pap. the not-so-good: 1) the rohan ""women and children"" storyline. used purely for dramatic purposes, cheesy and worn-out. could have done without it. 2) sam's long speech about heroic endurance at the end needed some editing. jackson is not a director known for subtelty. 3) haldir's real death and aragorn's fake one were overdone (slow-motion bathos syndrome) , but that is a fairly minor complaint. 4) cgi was spotty in places (the wargs and oliphaunts come to mind), but not enough to ruin the scenes. in fact, none the action scenes falter much. ------------------------------------------------------------ in closing, i am pleased that ttt not only lived up to the hype/expectations, but managed to exceed them on almost all accounts. a gleeful smile has hardly left my face in all 3 hours, and my expression changed to an annoyed cringe only once or twice - far less than during fellowship. i have to say that this film was the one (in the sci-fi/fantasy genre) that i enjoyed the most ever since the good old days of the original star wars trilogy, and i do not say that lightly.";20 December 2002;9;['intense', 'early', 'second', 'wary', 'current', 'cineplex', 'colossal', 'easy', 'more', 'main', 'other', 'great', 'separate', 'flawless', 'jarring', 'hopeful', 'second', 'present', 'visual', 'middle', 'usual', 'latter', 'few', 'possible', 'favorite', 'entire', 'complex', 'fit', 'worth', 'long', 'great', 'stew', 'final', 'effective', 'fine', 'gimli', 'necessary', 'comic', 'funny', 'laughable', 'such', 'foreign', 'more', 'few', 'more', 'extended', 'minded', 'various', 'new', 'old', 'gorgeous', 'epic', 'tremendous', 'spectacular', 'unneeded', 'bad', 'least', 'non', 'beautiful', 'strong', 'good', 'little', 'decent', 'additional', 'choppy', 'magnificent', 'worthy', 'excessive', 'well', 'pleasing', 'titanic', 'good', 'dramatic', 'long', 'heroic', 'real', 'fake', 'slow', 'minor', 'spotty', 'enough', 'pleased', 'gleeful', 'annoyed', 'less', 'good', 'old', 'original'];0.1479886897140417

457;nickthegun;excited wasn't the word for this. i was giddy as a school girl (so to speak) and was looking forward to a cinematic treat. and i wasn't disappointed. firstly i have to say a big thanks to new line for not giving us too many spoilers. i know us fans know what happens (hey, we can read!) but we don't know how it happens (if you follow me). for example, we had tantalising glimpses of gollum in fotr. but he was kept carefully under wraps. and for that, new line, i salute you. in the week leading up to the original mib i had seen trailer upon trailer, music videos, making of's and every interview and clip you can think of. i had, essentially, seen every moment of that film. so the impact had been lost and my enjoyment dulled. not so the two towers. as i went in blind, everything blew me away. sure, the adverts gave us a few minutes of helms deep and a bit of eowyn here and there, but nothing major. everything came to me fresh and kicked a lot of ass. amazingly enough, the thrill was still there even on my second and third viewings. high praise indeed. with a few viewings it becomes obvious that pj has captured the essence of the second book, while skilfully leaving out the things he could get away with. for example, the meeting of the ents and all their songs are, quite frankly, dull and we are well rid of them. the pacing is superb. it never seems to drag and every scene is welcome. it was a hard job following the superb fellowship but pj has done us proud. helms deep, the centre piece of the film, is just enthralling. from the tear jerking scenes of young boys getting tooled up for war to the rousing sight of gandalf leading the charge, we are assaulted by a bombastic mix of sound and sights. i can safely say, without hyperbole, that it is simply one of the most phenomenal scenes in cinematic history. a review of two towers wouldn't be complete without a mention of the gollum. the character is just brilliant. retaining all the pitiable characteristics of the book. the inner conflict scene had me close to tears! the standard has now been set. the bar has been raised. fellowship and the two towers stand head and shoulders above almost any film i have seen. the quality of them is awe inspiring. my problem now is waiting for the extended dvd. and return of the king. and how hard is legolas? he is just a killing machine!;20 February 2003;10;['excited', 'giddy', 'cinematic', 'disappointed', 'big', 'new', 'many', 'new', 'original', 'blind', 'few', 'deep', 'major', 'fresh', 'second', 'third', 'high', 'few', 'obvious', 'second', 'dull', 'rid', 'superb', 'welcome', 'hard', 'superb', 'proud', 'tear', 'young', 'rousing', 'bombastic', 'phenomenal', 'cinematic', 'complete', 'brilliant', 'pitiable', 'inner', 'close', 'extended'];0.1616739980449658

461;ShinKyo81;"after watching ""the two towers"" (ttt) twice, i've realized that ""the lord of the rings"" (lotr), apart from establishing itself as one of the pillars of the modern literature, it will achieve the same position in the 7th art world. those sceptics that prophesied that the ambitious project of peter jackson would be a disaster, those guys should keep away from the theaters. because they aren't obliged to watch peter jackson's interpretation of tolkien's universe. i believe the ""purists"" of the lotr world won't agree with me when i say that peter jackson is leading an incredible job in conjunction with a huge number of people that forms the lotr staff. lots of fans complain about that jackson has sort of invented some parts of the original story created by jrr tolkien and they ironically say that the film should be titled ""peter jackson's the lotr""... for god's sake, if you're so critic, go on: ""the hobbit"" and ""the silmarillion"" movies are still to be made. look for a producer who gives you a millionaire budget and show me what you've got ^_^ we must understand that peter jackson is just another tolkien's fan who has had the guts to take on with one of the most ambitious projects in the film history and in the movie-adaptation-from-novel thing. ttt is the culmination of what ""the fellowship of the ring"" (fotr) was. in the first chapter of the trilogy, everything is shown up but in fact you left the cinema with a bit of emptiness, like smelling the food but not eating it. in the ttt, which is the heart of the novel, it's where the story goes on and the action progresses. let me talk about plot for a second. (beware: spoiler imminent :p). if you've read the book, then you'll have the same 'deja vu' sensation you had in fotr. but you could possibly complain about the bigger amount of parts which are not in or differ from the book. i think peter jackson has done well not including some parts of the novel and i will prove it with the ending of ttt: it's better to end the movie right in front of mordor than inside mordor, as the book ends. it's more... movie-like. also, it's so astonishing how jackson has achieved a level in the movie to keep up the story because, in my opinion (this is when the 'purists' will hang me ^_^), ttt novel is the most difficult to read, because of the plot, which is quite plain compared with the 1st and 3rd book. talking about the characters, there are new people around the plot, like eowyn, theoden, grima wormtongue. but in my opinion the best one is gollum, such an incredible and realistic cgi character (probably the best one up to date), who steals the acting from sam and frodo in some sequences (just don't miss the dialogue between his two personalities. worth of an oscar!). aragorn is probably less active in this sequel, probably because legolas rocks with his acrobatic movements! gimli has got a clown-like role, that i really hated through all the film, but however, he somehow fit in it. in conclusion, i'd like to say that 'the two towers' is one of the most solid sequels i've ever seen. it's darker than the first one and the action is more intense. peter jackson is handling the situation with great success. i cannot wait to see 'the return of the king'. worth a look! 10/10 pd: btw, c'mon lucas! don't spend 3 years to do a movie! learn from peter jackson! ^_^";29 December 2002;9;['modern', 'same', 'ambitious', 'incredible', 'huge', 'lotr', 'original', 'critic', 'ambitious', 'first', 'imminent', 'same', 'big', 'well', 'more', 'like', 'astonishing', 'difficult', 'plain', 'new', 'good', 'incredible', 'realistic', 'good', 'worth', 'aragorn', 'active', 'acrobatic', 'gimli', 'like', 'solid', 'dark', 'first', 'intense', 'great', 'worth', 'lucas'];0.2622374539041205

470;foxhound-37781;the two towers is an astonishingly made film as far as a sequel is concerned. despite the fact it is indeed part of a trilogy and not just some ham handed sequel written for a quick cash grab, the two towers is a cinematic masterpiece that flawlessly continues the story. picking up with frodo and sams journey a few days after the events of the fellowship of the ring finishes, the two towers introduces us to gollum played brilliantly by andy serkis, a pivotal character for this movie and the next one. the entire film switches between three main storylines. frodo and sams storyline, merry, pippin and treebeards storyline and then of course aragorn, legolas, gimli and gandalf's storyline. i remember seeing this in the cinema for the first time and being so caring towards all the characters, after you've had frodo and sams storyline on screen for a good while i started thinking come on switch to merry and pippin and show us whats happening with them or switch to aragorn and their storyline i wanna see them again. you just care so much about all the characters in these movies but that's what a+ character development does to you with a film like this. i'm not outlining plot details much because it's simply too enormous of a task to do so but the pinnacle of this film is the battle for helms deep. despite the fact it has a lot of cgi going on during it's progress, it is hands down one of the most incredible pieces of cinema ever shot. peter jackson did six months of night shoots in a quarry just outside of wellington, nz to bring this scene to life and the extras who played the orcs just kept turning up night after night after night week after week to get suited up in these wet, smelly prosthetics. but that goes to show how invested everyone was in this film. the extras were just as invested in this film as pj himself was. and it really shows on screen. the two towers acts as the perfect bridge between fellowship and return. yes you can watch all 3 movies back to back as just one long movie, but personally i wouldn't recommend it. there's so much to take in with these movies if you watch them back to back you're not giving yourself a good enough chance to really take in everything you've just seen. 10/10 from me. can never get bored with these movies;19 January 2021;10;['handed', 'quick', 'cinematic', 'few', 'pivotal', 'next', 'entire', 'main', 'aragorn', 'gimli', 'first', 'good', 'enormous', 'deep', 'incredible', 'wet', 'smelly', 'perfect', 'long', 'much', 'good', 'enough', 'bored'];0.2055555555555555

[just one example: in the book, sam's speech is shot through with maritime references, natural to an englishman, but no shire hobbit had ever seen the sea.] i give 4 derisive 'bree belches' to roger ebert's delicately fatuous and thoroughly erroneous critique of the two towers's supposed lack of faith to the trilogy, which he acknowledges he has never read. well, i *have* read the books, about a dozen times in the past four decades (starting with the hardcover first edition in my high school library, when that was still the only edition), and i believe that peter jackson's movies are true to the heart, soul, and characters of the story, and that the liberties he took with the plot were warranted by the translation to film, and some are genuine improvements (e.g. replacing glorfindel with arwen). ebert pompously claims, ""the last third of the movie is dominated by an epic battle scene that would no doubt startle the gentle medievalist j.r.r. tolkien,"" but the battle of helm's deep is in fact just as big and dark and violent in the book as it is in the movie, and both are tame compared to what tolkien would have experienced firsthand as a line officer on the western front in the great war. for a much more perceptive review, from another critic who has not read the books, check out joe morgenstern's column in the wall street journal of 12/20/2002. * for others who like to obsess over details, consider this: six of the eight middle-earthly members of the fellowship are princes of their people. aragorn is heir to the throne of gondor; boromir the eldest son of its ruling steward. legolas is the son and heir of thranduil, king of the mirkwood elves. gimli is nephew to thorin oakenshield, dwarf king under the lonely mountain, and cousin (and therefore potential heir) to balin, late lord of moria. merry is heir to the thane of buckland, while pippin is in direct line of descent from the old took. only frodo and sam are commoners -- a rich eccentric country squire and his devoted gardener, nostalgic timeless english characters singularly resonant for tolkien's own shattered generation. jackson essentially omits this set-up from the movie. in the book it does not become important until after the fall of sauron. alas jackson has stated that ""the cleansing of the shire"" will not be part of his return of the king, though he was careful not to reveal what *will* be included. narsil re-forged will play a part, one hopes. elrond does set this up. and would zombie-master jackson dare to delete the paths of the dead? one hopes not.";27 December 2002;10;['fran', 'southern', 'bottomless', 'great', 'great', 'humble', 'joyful', 'cinematic', 'other', 'well', 'extended', 'perfect', 'different', 'maritime', 'natural', 'derisive', 'fatuous', 'erroneous', 'past', 'high', 'only', 'true', 'genuine', 'last', 'epic', 'gentle', 'big', 'dark', 'violent', 'tame', 'western', 'great', 'perceptive', 'middle', 'earthly', 'aragorn', 'eld', 'gimli', 'lonely', 'potential', 'late', 'direct', 'old', 'rich', 'eccentric', 'devoted', 'nostalgic', 'english', 'own', 'shattered', 'important', 'careful', 'narsil', 'dead'];0.0748245614035087

482;Jakethemuss;out of all the films i've seen during my life, which is easily hundreds, it would be most fair to say that lotr: the two towers stands as my favoured film. the middle of the stunning peter jackson trilogy, it is not the biggest or boldest, or most important, but i feel it is scene for scene the greatest film i have ever seen. the film is basically split into 3 separate but intertwining plots. first, we see our warrior trio (aragorn the ranger, leglolas the elf and gimli the dwarf) as they track across vast plains in hot pursuit of the somewhat depleted uruk hai party that has kidnapped hobbits merry and pippin, before making way to the ruling town of rohan. then, there is the ring carrier frodo and his trusty sidekick and friend samwise, who wearily hike across rocky unfamiliar terrain en route to mordor, which is where frodo's mission lies. lastly and by no means least, we follow the path of hobbits merry and pippin, who find themselves in the huge, dark fangorn forest upon escaping their green skinned captors. it is here where they see an old friend, and stumble across the ancient natives of the wood, who just might join their cause. my favourite sub story would have to be the aragorn one, as not only does that have the most battle and combat, but is also the main attraction of the film for me. it is the 3 fearless warriors who must help defend the people of rohan as they take the dangerous but necessary journey to the mountain fortress of helms deep. which is where they stand firmly together and await the sinister saruman's next move. i would not recommend this to anyone who has not already seen the fellowship of the ring, as this carries on directly and the viewer would be trying to fill in the holes as events progressed. it would also not be as enjoyable if you hadn't seen the build up to where they are now. it is immensely gripping and exciting to see the story unravel, almost impossible to not be totally swept in by it all. everything has been handled just as it should, there is a little humour, passion, stirring scenes of valour, plenty of sword fighting and battle to keep the action fiends happy. as for the violence, it is not disturbing or malicious, but brave and uplifting. the men of the west, dwarfs, elves and co. are fighting for a reason, to save themselves from extinction, they do what they have to do for survival. it is a true case of good vs evil here, light vs darkness. anything else? oh yes, glorious cinematography, excellent and effective use of cgi, amazing new zealand scenery, captivating dialogue and character interaction, not to mention great performances from viggo mortensen as the softly spoken yet ultra strong, bearded uncrowned king of middle earth, bernard hill as the noble theoden and as always ian mckellen shines as the wise and knowing gandalf. very few performances were bad in fact. then again, this film has very little wrong with it. 10/10;4 September 2007;10;['fair', 'stunning', 'big', 'bold', 'important', 'great', 'separate', 'gimli', 'vast', 'hot', 'trusty', 'rocky', 'unfamiliar', 'least', 'huge', 'dark', 'green', 'skinned', 'old', 'ancient', 'favourite', 'aragorn', 'most', 'main', 'fearless', 'dangerous', 'necessary', 'deep', 'sinister', 'next', 'enjoyable', 'exciting', 'impossible', 'little', 'happy', 'disturbing', 'malicious', 'brave', 'uplifting', 'true', 'good', 'light', 'glorious', 'excellent', 'effective', 'amazing', 'great', 'ultra', 'strong', 'bearded', 'uncrowned', 'middle', 'noble', 'wise', 'few', 'bad', 'little', 'wrong'];0.1914682539682539

485;Hairy_Lime;really, the two towers is the weakest of the three novels, and it is only natural that the middle volume would be a bit of a let down. jackson does a nice job of trying to lift the story - the battle sequence is fantastic - but to my mind the 10 i might have given for this movie went over the cliff with aragorn. i have nothing against jackson deviating from the books - i was not troubled by the changes in the faramir character, for instance, and adding the warg riders themselves was a nice touch. but what was the purpose of sending aragorn over the cliff? creating false tension that probably fooled less than 1% of the audience? screen time for liv tyler? all it did for me was make the movie feel false for about ten minutes. this crucial mistake is compunded now that we have the extended edition and see some of the scenes that were left out of the theatrical release. the movie would have been stronger without aragorn's fall, and with, for instance, the scene between boromir and faramir, or the march of the trees to the battle of helms deep. well, so be it. one or two major missteps in a ten hour movie is not unexpected. on its merits, apart from that, this movie, like the whole trilogy, is a magnificent achievement. one question: every time i look, legolas is shooting dozens of arrows. and every time i look, his quiver is full. where are the arrows coming from? elf magic?;9 February 2004;8;['weak', 'natural', 'middle', 'nice', 'fantastic', 'nice', 'false', 'less', 'false', 'crucial', 'extended', 'theatrical', 'strong', 'deep', 'major', 'unexpected', 'whole', 'magnificent', 'full'];0.1391203703703703
486;jennifer_litchfield;"the lord of the rings: the two towers is a worthy sequel to the outstanding the fellowship of the ring. it is much darker than its predecessor in both mood and in the very coloration of the film itself. the initial scenes as the audience falls through the inky blackness of the mines of moria, following the epic duel between gandalf and the inferno that is the balrog, sets the tone for the rest of the film. the fellowship of the first film has splintered into three groups merry and pippin have been captured by uruk-hai, and are now being tracked by aragorn, legolas and gimli. frodo and sam are slowly edging nearer to the fires of mount doom in mordor where they can destroy the terrible burden that is the ring. in their quest they are aided by the wonderfully dichotomous character that is gollum/smeagol. and the two towers really is gollum's film. he is a triumph of digital wizardry that the audience will both loathe and wish redemption for. the other major computer-generated characters treebeard and his ilk are perhaps not so successfully believable; although few viewers could fail to be moved by the 'last march of the ents'. the settings are simply stunning; both the natural scenery of windswept plains and craggy mountains, and the built sets, such as the kingdom of rohan that echoes the viking settlements of old. at the conclusion of the battle of helm's deep, where (despite being a supposedly purpose-bred fighting force) the uruk-hai are massacred by a handful of men, gandalf prophesies that 'the battle for middle earth is about to begin'. the audience is left to ponder what further horrors, heartbreaks and triumphs are in store for the adventurers.";25 July 2004;8;['worthy', 'outstanding', 'dark', 'very', 'initial', 'inky', 'epic', 'first', 'terrible', 'dichotomous', 'digital', 'other', 'major', 'believable', 'few', 'last', 'stunning', 'natural', 'windswept', 'craggy', 'such', 'old', 'deep', 'gandalf', 'middle', 'about', 'further'];0.0485416666666666

488;taikman;in my review of 'the chamber of secrets' i mentioned how tough the job of chris columbus, director of the harry potter movies was. however when it comes to adapting books to film his job looks straightforward compared to peter jackson's. over a thousand pages of novel had to be trimmed and shaped into six hours of film, perhaps two dozen important characters to bring to life, millions of devoted tolkien fans and also the general filmgoing public to satisfy. i thought he did an amazing job with 'the fellowship of the ring', which was, aside from a few overwrought moments, probably as good an adaption as could possibly have been made. unfortunately i can not say the same for 'the two towers'. oh, it is very good - jackson again shows what a master he is at staging battle scenes and creating moments of wonder and horror, the special effects and new zealand scenery are breathtaking and the quality cast again do a good job. but there are moments that are a bit corny and scenes that could have been more tense and exciting than they were. the story consists of three seperate plot lines - merry and pippin journey into fangorn forest where they meet the ents, the ancient shepherds of the trees, frodo and sam head closer to mordor with gollum, the twisted former possessor of the one ring, and the remaining members of the fellowship fight to save the kingdom of rohan from the forces of saruman, who has used magic and a treacherous advisor to enfeeble theoden, rohan's king. while it is packed with characters and events, there is not as much in 'the two towers' as there was in 'fellowship', so while it does not have quite the variety of locations events that the first film did, jackson has been able to create a film that is not as episodic this time (which was inevitable with the theatrical version of 'fellowship' - see the extended dvd version for a longer, better-paced cut). the three-pronged story is still which was the screenwriters and editors biggest problem, as they had to try and juggle and balance the plots so that the viewer follows what is going on while the movie's momentum is maintained. generally i think jackson and company did a fine job but, especially towards the end of the movie, they could have done a better one. the film cuts between the climaxes of all three plots which reduces the power of each of them, especially the epic battle of helm's deep. the battle is a huge, superbly choreographed sequence but the tension that it creates gets released too often as we shift to what sam and frodo or merry and pippin are doing. i think it would have been better to finish sam and frodo's story, except for the epilogue with gollum, which belongs at the end, before cutting between the battle at helm's deep and the hobbits' dealings with the ents. partly to provide a climax, a lot has been changed from the book. many things that were in 'the two towers' will now be in the third movie (which makes me wonder how they will fit everything into 'the return of the king') and a few things have been added. some of the additions, such as the battle with the warg-riders and the black rider's sweep over the dead marshes, are very good. others, such as aragorn's near-death experience and his triumphant return, the slow-motion fall of haldir and the reunion of a mother with her children are cliched. the screenplay is a flawed one: it does not always explain what is going on adequately and there are a disappointing number of melodramatic moments. i could have done with less shots of frightened women and children, less inspirational speeches, less beams of shining light and, though he was funny, less of gimli the dwarf as comic relief. sometimes, as at helm's deep, the atmosphere should be grim and frightening and a joke spoils the mood. as do a few cute, anachronistic moments such as when legolas skates down stairs on a shield or when sam talks about what it would be like to be a character in a great story. 'the lord of the rings' is not supposed to be postmodern - such moments just take you out of the alternative world that the movie is trying to create by reminding you that it is a movie. but while it is not up to the very high standard of 'fellowship', 'the two towers' is still a quality movie: spectacular, sometimes stirring and gorgious to look at and listen to. there is one other thing that would make it worth seeing: gollum. the first cgi character to actually act well, gollum, with his split personality, creepy voice and pale, veiny, superbly rendered body, is fascinating to watch. all his scenes are among the movie's best. if 'the two towers' does get an oscar nomination for acting andy serkis, who did the voice and the movements that gollum was based on, will probably be the one. i suspect though that this won't be the year that peter jackson gets to go up for best director or best film. oh well, there's still 'the return of the king.' 7 1/2 / 10;8 January 2003;7;['tough', 'harry', 'straightforward', 'important', 'devoted', 'general', 'amazing', 'few', 'good', 'same', 'good', 'special', 'good', 'tense', 'exciting', 'seperate', 'ancient', 'twisted', 'former', 'treacherous', 'enfeeble', 'much', 'first', 'able', 'episodic', 'inevitable', 'theatrical', 'extended', 'long', 'pronged', 'big', 'fine', 'well', 'epic', 'deep', 'huge', 'choreographed', 'well', 'deep', 'many', 'third', 'few', 'such', 'black', 'dead', 'good', 'such', 'near', 'triumphant', 'slow', 'flawed', 'disappointing', 'melodramatic', 'less', 'frightened', 'less', 'inspirational', 'less', 'funny', 'less', 'gimli', 'comic', 'deep', 'grim', 'frightening', 'few', 'cute', 'anachronistic', 'such', 'great', 'postmodern', 'such', 'alternative', 'high', 'spectacular', 'gorgious', 'other', 'worth', 'first', 'split', 'creepy', 'pale', 'veiny', 'fascinating', 'good', 'oscar', 'good', 'good'];0.1080977182539682

490;stu9003;my overall impression of the fellowship of the ring was that i thought it was a technical masterpiece for bringing middle earth to life but i was a little less than enthused with the story. i can't say i ever really got totally absorbed by the story or character is in fellowship of the ring. so while i looked forward to seeing more incredible cinematography in the two towers i never expected to be blown away in quite the way that i was. the very first scene totally grabbed me in a way that few movies have ever done before. i was expecting a fairly standard recap with a narrator explaining what happened in the last movie and where we are now. instead, the movie opens with some stunning vistas of the misty mountains. we hear the sounds of shouting and fighting echoing through the mountains and then we suddenly zoom right into the heart of the mountains where we see a thrilling fight between gandalf and the balrog. when this happens, its like the viewer is suddenly thrown right into the story. it's a feeling that doesn't leave until the closing credits. because of the way it immediately immerses you in the story i think this scene was the best in the movie and considering what followed that's saying a lot. what followed is the truly awesome battle at helm's keep, the climax of the film. it is a truly grand spectacle that i can't really put in words except to say that you just have to see it. on a big screen. the view of the approaching army is firmly planted in my mind. some characters who were fairly peripheral in fotr get much bigger roles this time, particularly aragorn, legolas and gimli. in some ways, aragorn is the main character of two towers and viggo mortenson turns in a terrific performance. that said, the very best character of the two towers is gollum. i've never been a big fan of 100% cgi-based characters but gollum is truly exceptional. he seems so hopeless, pitiful, horrifying and dangerous all at once. there's just no telling what he's going to do. i was absolutely blown away by the two towers. it's easily the best movie i've seen this year. in fact, it's one of the best movies i've seen in any year. i eagerly look forward to the return of the king.;28 December 2002;9;['overall', 'technical', 'middle', 'little', 'less', 'enthused', 'incredible', 'first', 'few', 'standard', 'last', 'stunning', 'misty', 'good', 'awesome', 'grand', 'big', 'peripheral', 'big', 'aragorn', 'gimli', 'aragorn', 'main', 'terrific', 'good', 'big', 'exceptional', 'hopeless', 'pitiful', 'horrifying', 'dangerous', 'good', 'good'];0.1891666666666666
491;elizabeth-12994;this is my favourite set of movies, return of the king (3rd lord of the rings movie) being my absolute favourite movie i've ever seen. the cgi and special effects are brilliant for something of this time, the cast couldn't have been better. elijah wood was absolutely superb, along with sean astin, ian mckellen, viggo mortensen, orlando bloom, billy boyd, john rhys davis and dominic monaghan. they were all absolutely excellent, start to finish. they are like the books in so many ways and really managed to take the books and put it onto a screen in such a wonderful way. the storyline was very strong and advanced. the way the turned andy circus into gollum was epic for something that came out at that time. it, by far, had the best battle scene in the whole franchise and better than the majority of films i've seen. those who've seen the film will know which battle i'm talking about but i don't want to give spoilers. i've lost count of how many times i've seen these films. the dialogue was awesome and there wasn't a scene where i spotted a huge mistake that ruined the film. i think there was the odd cgi error but it wasn't major. the make up was extremely believable, especially the orcs and the hobbits' feet. the whole world was just so great. overall, this was my least favourite out of the three but it is very close. peter jackson did a great job and i have no idea how many times i've rewatched these films! i hope the amazon series is going to be really good but i don't think it's even remotely possible to live up to these standards.;24 August 2018;10;['favourite', 'absolute', 'favourite', 'special', 'brilliant', 'well', 'superb', 'dominic', 'excellent', 'many', 'wonderful', 'strong', 'advanced', 'epic', 'good', 'whole', 'well', 'many', 'awesome', 'huge', 'odd', 'major', 'believable', 'whole', 'great', 'least', 'favourite', 'close', 'great', 'many', 'good', 'possible'];0.471452380952381

495;marshall89;"i was in a bit of an unhappy mood when my father and his brothers took my sister and i to go see this. by the time i left the theater my mind was completely devoid of any unhappy thoughts. this was more than just a good movie: it could be the greatest film ever. now a lot of people are going to disagree with that, but i don't care. this is even better than the first, and considering the fact that the first one is one of the greatest movies of all time, you know that you have a classic right here. rather than starting with flashback scenes like in the first, the two towers starts with frodo baggins (elijah wood) having a dream about gandalf's death during the fellowship journey. gandalf's battle with the fire monster while plummeting down into a deep cavern is the perfect climax to start the movie, and it's definitely the right way to pick up where fellowship left off. but overall, ttt didn't start too well for me. it's great all the way through, but i thought it was overly violent and scary at first, two factors that made me think, ""there's no way this is going to be better than the first one."" the film does, however, get better and better from there on. there are many exciting twists and scenes that will surprise and excite you. the battle in rohan (or wherever it was: the place where everyone fled to and hid in the caves) was one of the most riveting cinematic moments i have ever experienced in my entire life. like the brilliant star wars episode 1, the ending switches between sequences like the tree invasion of saruman's kingdom, and they're so good that even if you're on the brink of wetting your pants after that huge drink you had, you'll still remain planted in your seat just to see what happens. the scenes in this movie were so tense that i could feel my pulse racing, and when gimli (john rhys-davis), my favorite character, jumped into the storm of invaders, i think i could have passed out. if what i just said isn't enough to convince you that this is one of the greatest films of all time, then i don't know what to say. this movie has everything and beyond. and if you thought ian mckellen was great in the first, wait until he drops your jaw this time. all in all this film is perfect except for smeagle, who, although proves to be an interesting character, gets pretty annoying and says the word precious too many times. but i'd much rather listen to him all day instead of moaning myrtle, the top candidate for most annoying movie character ever. my rating: 5 out of 5";4 January 2003;10;['unhappy', 'devoid', 'unhappy', 'more', 'good', 'great', 'well', 'first', 'first', 'great', 'classic', 'first', 'deep', 'perfect', 'right', 'great', 'violent', 'scary', 'well', 'first', 'well', 'well', 'many', 'exciting', 'riveting', 'cinematic', 'entire', 'brilliant', 'good', 'huge', 'tense', 'gimli', 'favorite', 'enough', 'great', 'great', 'first', 'perfect', 'interesting', 'annoying', 'precious', 'many', 'top', 'annoying'];0.2607448107448107

500;jaesboxer;looking over the imdb comment board for 'the lord of the rings: the two towers', i see that in general, it is as beloved as the first one. there is, however, a fairly large group of avid tolkien fans who feel the removal of the ending to the book would have been unnecessary if peter jackson had simply cut out the aragorn/arwen scenes. what i hope to offer here is a rationalization as to why jackson did what he did, and the perfectly valid justification he had for doing it. to begin with, despite many crossovers between medias of film and literature, the two rarely mix entirely. literature is an expression of a writer's views and ideologies on the page, and film is a visual expression of the combined vision of several people. many books are perfect fodder for adaptations, but few pieces of literature. imagine someone trying to adapt joyce's 'ulysses' to the screen, or proust's 'remembrance of things past'. it simply could not be done. in most works of great literature, dostoyevsky, joyce, tolstoy, flaubert etc., the artists express themselves through the writing as a style. tolkien, while perhaps not on par with the supreme literary brilliance of the aformentioned authors, is still the father of fantasy, and it is his book that will be remembered as the most popular and, outside of the scholarly world, influential book of the 20th century. so how do you make it into a movie? up until a few years ago, no one believed it could be. and then peter jackson released 'the fellowship of the ring' last year, and everyone, even the most discerning tolkien neophytes were satisfied. with this year's installment, 'the two towers', jackson has become more daring, and has taken several liberties with the story line, most notably, excluding the last 5 chapters. yet i want to specify something to all the tolkien addicts who are most enraged by this blatant cut: word-for-word adaptations rarely ever work. in adapting a novel to the screen, something is invariably lost if the director does not have the wits to put the film in his vision rather than the author. if the author wanted to make a film he would have instead of writing a book. i believe, most strongly, in a dapting a book to the screen, one must take the general emotions the book generates, and do everything possible to bring them to the audience. in tolkien, these emotions are invariably a sense of joy and wonder, something he certainly instilled with the first volume. yet now, it has been a year, and many people (like me) have seen the fellowship so many times we can recite it line by line. the wonder is no longer new, and the joy somewhat dimmed by our familiarty with the perils of middle-earth. in 'the two towers', jackson takes our familiarty, and enhances upon it, bringing us deeper into the characters and the realm of tolkien's universe. it's not the same as the book, but it most certainly works.;17 March 2003;10;['general', 'beloved', 'first', 'large', 'unnecessary', 'aragorn', 'valid', 'many', 'visual', 'combined', 'several', 'many', 'perfect', 'few', 'most', 'great', 'literary', 'aformentioned', 'popular', 'scholarly', 'influential', 'few', 'last', 'satisfied', 'daring', 'several', 'last', 'enraged', 'blatant', 'general', 'possible', 'first', 'many', 'many', 'new', 'middle', 'same'];0.2017465293327361
501;jaesboxer;reading over some of the imdb comments on this film, i am truly appalled by the number of people who rant and whine about the films deviations from the book. film and literature are two different mediums, not to be confused, and very rarely are they entirely compatible. tolkien's book, while brilliant, is not the 'perfect series' as i have heard it proclaimed, and cannot be expected, even by the most adamant of fans to be portrayed to utter perfection in the movie. jackson's film is an utter masterpiece, giving the audience what they want, entertainment, emotion and raw pure spectacle. almost all of the most brilliant films of all time are not entirely faithful to the book, including 'the godfather', in which rather large sections were left out, 'gone with the wind', 'the silence of the lambs', 'doctor zhivago', 'the shawshank redemption', 'a clockwork orange', 'the bridge on the river kwai', 'apocalypse now', 'one flew over the cuckoo's nest', 'amadeus', 'raging bull' and 2001. and yes, i have read all these books so don't doubt me when i say it. literary structure is different from the structure of movies. and any good screenwriter will tell you more often than not it is necessary to take liberties with a book in order to create the aesthetic of a good movie. so the ending was changed. it will be in the next one. so arwen's appearance was an invention of jackson's. it created a bridge in her character between the first and third films. okay, i can understand the argument about gimli being made into comic relief, that annoyed me too, but it did not mar my impression of the film in any way. in no way do the legitimate complaints of people annoy me, but when i hear such comments as 'like merry and pippin would ever let frodo go to the boats, he should have snuck to them through the shadowland like in the books', i get really bothered. menial arguments such as this are the product of disgruntled tolkien purists, many of whom i feel would not be satisfied even if the book followed the writer's vision perfectly. the smallest flaws are made into an ignominious nuisance by those who, even if those flaws were not there, would still complain about something else. i myself have read 'the lord of the rings' about 6 or 7 times, and i agree it is a great book. yet no book is so perfect that it should not be changed in any way. and i apologize to any tolkien fans i am offending, but speaking from the view point of a huge literary afficionado i must say that 'the lord of the rings' is not the greatest book ever written, nor is tolkien the greatest writer. his mammoth fantasy epic is by no means the standard for literary style, nor for characterization or meaning. i shake my head when i hear 'the lord of the rings' referred to as the quintessential novel. despite being the greatest masterpieceo of fantasy ever written, it still does not measure up to joyce's 'ulysses', dostoyevsky's 'the brothers karamazov', or proust's 'remembrance of things past'. i love dostoyevsky, yet if a movie were made of 'the brothers karamazov', and 'the grand inquisitor', perhaps one of the most incredible sections in all literature were removed, i would not damn the director, and insult the film, for i realize the scene, though essential to the writer's purpose, is not essential to the story the film is trying to portray. if i may parody a line from 'inherit the wind', the lord of the rings is a great book, but it is not the only book, and its brilliance as a film may not match its brilliance as a book (though in my opinion it does) but it cannot be insulted merely because it deviates from its source.;24 May 2003;10;['different', 'compatible', 'brilliant', 'perfect', 'utter', 'raw', 'pure', 'brilliant', 'faithful', 'large', 'literary', 'different', 'good', 'necessary', 'good', 'next', 'first', 'third', 'gimli', 'comic', 'legitimate', 'such', 'menial', 'such', 'disgruntled', 'many', 'satisfied', 'small', 'ignominious', 'great', 'perfect', 'huge', 'literary', 'great', 'great', 'mammoth', 'literary', 'quintessential', 'great', 'dostoyevsky', 'grand', 'incredible', 'essential', 'essential', 'great', 'only'];0.3541056166056167

508;evilasahobby;"lord of the ring: the two towers hits almost all the right notes in its adaption of jrr tolkein's work to the screen. starting with a fantastic scene straight off the bat, there is little doubt that this movie will be action packed and full throttle. this is a great middle section to the lotr saga. arguments can be made about how true it stayed to sections of the book and how the changes influenced the story, but given that the movie stayed internally consistent, these gripes are possibly misfired. in adapting a book for the screen changes are always going to be made - the important thing is for those changes to be consistent to the overall narrative as it appears on screen. in ttt's case, peter jackson has made changes that have arguably added to the picture. ttt has some of the greatest battle scenes shown on film thus far. although shying away from the visceral reality of saving private ryan, these battles are epic in scope and brutal to watch. these battles also avoid skewing into the ""hero beats all"" stereotypes that so many fantasy films enter into - each battle sees both sides take casualties, which sometimes include more than just the nameless rabble. the flaws in ttt are almost unavoidable given the adapted material. firstly, it is sometimes disrupting to move from one of the story arcs (say aragon, legolas and gimli's) to another (frodo and samwise's). unfortunately the most important journey to the narrative in frodo's and samwise's journey to mt doom is also the least interesting to watch which also disrupts the enjoyment of ttt. the final problem is that none of the characters really seem to develop to the same capacity of fotr; the exception here is golum, who is the most memorable character contained within this sequel. that said, these are minor points. ttt continues the lotr's epic scope and vision. with the return of the king due out on boxing day 2003, ttt has set up the audience for an exciting and dynamic conclusion to this epic fantasy saga.";19 January 2003;9;['right', 'fantastic', 'little', 'full', 'great', 'middle', 'true', 'consistent', 'important', 'consistent', 'overall', 'great', 'visceral', 'private', 'epic', 'brutal', 'many', 'more', 'unavoidable', 'important', 'interesting', 'final', 'same', 'memorable', 'minor', 'epic', 'due', 'exciting', 'dynamic', 'epic'];0.2017219387755102

517;j30bell;"in the two towers (tt) we are re-united with most of our heroes from the fellowship of the ring (fotr). split apart by betrayal, and a company of orcs, frodo and sam have begun the last leg of their quest to mordor. ant and dec (sorry, merry and pippin) are prisoners of the orcs, pursued by aragorn, legolas and gimli a quest that brings the company, and the people of rohan, closer to conflict. opinion is divided about the second film. the entertainment junkies seem to think it's better than the first, largely on account of the battle of helms deep, which is rather impressive. i thought it was a bit weaker, mainly because, in a wilderness adventure, there's more emphasis on the characters than in the spectacle of set piece action; and because the cgi is less subtle as a result. once again, liberties are taken with the story. there's no riding of the grey company. there's a more obvious tension between eowyn and aragorn (legolas has to remind aragorn who he's dating), and (controversial among the tolkienites) faramir's character has been darkened somewhat. in fact, the directorial trait of adding more colour to the main characters while painting out the subtlety of the peripheral ones continues from fotr. partly because we're introduced to more characters in tt, the overall effect leaves the film slightly two-dimensional. on balance i thought the treatment of faramir to be less heinous than that of denethor in return of the king, but more on that later. the mood, though, remains pure tolkien and that, more than anything, is the triumph of the movie. from the beowulf-like set for meduseld (tolkien famously nicked his description of the seat of rohan from the uk's first epic) to the majestic sweep of new zealand, the film more than once reminded me of my own mental images of tolkien's world. and, once again, i found myself interested in the story. so, to the flaws. i mentioned in an earlier review of fotr the astonishing heighism in peter jackson's adaptation. you can imagine jackson scratching his head wondering what to do for laughs now that ant and dec have been nicked by ugluk, grishnakh and the lads. his solution is ingenious; find the next shortest member of the company. gimli, therefore, shoulders the mantle of comedy relief. as a strapping man of 6'4'' i am allowed a certain disdainful disinterest to such a phenomenon; but it is worth noting. also worth noticing is the astonishing transformation of arwen from a feisty, most un-tolkien lady in fotr to the submissive pre-raphaelite stereotype of the books. i guess this is because eowyn has turned up, but still. the elves still speak like they're doped up, except the peculiarly immune elfin fancy boy, legolas. on that note, was it really necessary for him to mount his horse that way? or surf his way down a staircase at the battle of helms deep? jim horner should do an alternative beach boys theme for that scene. anyway, these are minor points in a film that is, if not a major, then at least a minor, triumph. as mentioned by others, the film is worth seeing for gollum alone. and i can think of many more reasons to see it. you could also check out the extended version, which is even better. 7/10.";20 December 2004;7;['united', 'most', 'last', 'sorry', 'gimli', 'close', 'second', 'well', 'first', 'deep', 'impressive', 'weak', 'more', 'subtle', 'grey', 'obvious', 'controversial', 'directorial', 'more', 'main', 'peripheral', 'more', 'overall', 'dimensional', 'heinous', 'pure', 'more', 'like', 'first', 'majestic', 'own', 'mental', 'interested', 'early', 'astonishing', 'ant', 'ingenious', 'next', 'short', 'gimli', 'strapping', 'certain', 'disdainful', 'worth', 'worth', 'astonishing', 'feisty', 'most', 'submissive', 'pre', 'raphaelite', 'immune', 'fancy', 'necessary', 'deep', 'alternative', 'minor', 'major', 'least', 'minor', 'worth', 'many', 'more', 'extended', 'well'];0.1976048752834467

there was one in attack of the clones! also aragorn is such a cardboard cut out of a 'hero' that he belongs in the same parthenon of hero's as mr t and shatners infamous captain kirk. aragorn and legolas, sam and frodo. so many cute couples. lords of each others rings. thats why i think they threw in some love interests because otherwise...this isn't a fellowship of the ring but a mardi gra of the ring. many people i talk to complain about the issues of lack of depth in the characters. however as i have said, i don't think it is jacksons fault. i think these flaws go back to the original text. but hey, 'cocktails anybody?' the feminine angle of the film further bugs me when none of the women engage in physical combat! they are forced to look after the kids! isn't this the 21st century!?! where the hell was xena!?! she would have kicked ass! i mean i can't remember the book very well, but didn't women fight? listen, if you are heavily outnumbered against a bunch of very hungry looking urak hai, you would have your wife, daughters and grandmother fighting with pitchforks! the character eowyn should have had more to kick. she was straight jacketed by the limited role and wasn't let out to kick ass and chew bubble gum! everyone wants to see sexy chicks kicking ass or mud wrestling. basically what jackson has done is take the best elements of the book and made them cool. observe legolas using a shield as a skateboard at the battle of helms deep. jackson has 'matrixed' lotr. i am sure if tolkien saw this, he would roll in his grave, either that or spark up a big fat one. the battle scenes are impressive and they made me think that they must have been extraordinarily difficult to film. tension is actually built up all through the film and by the time helms deep rolls around the viewer is at the edge of their seat. well at least i was! so many aspects of this film could have been so very cheesy. the ents could have destroyed the whole film. the golem could have been the worst thing to hit cinemas since jar jar binks or that guy who played anakin in clones...the villains are also well done. they look like the evil dead and speak like sid vicious. orcs and goblins as punks is a cool idea and harks back to jacksons classic 'meet the feebles.' also an added bonus is that many stars of a local kiwi soap die in this film. to see 'lionel' and that other guy die is worth the price of admission alone! the set designs, costumes and special effects are all excellent. the filmakers deserve an oscar for those aspects. golem becomes the first computer generated psycho, who is actually well acted and could give anthony perkins a run for his money. weta obviously went nuts on this movie. the effects literally transport you to another world. i was amazed as jackson has taken the images of the book and what i imagined and transposed them onto the screen. this is how tolkiens invented world looks and is! for achieving this feat alone the jackson team deserve much credit. this film is also a great tourist brochure for new zealand and hopefully many d&d freaks will come here and pretend to be little goblins in the mines of moria. overall this is a simple film. but it is still a very enjoyable one. the last two points i would like to mention are, 1. why do christians watch lotr and boycott harry potter? two towers has brutal violence and homicidal maniacs that make josef stalin look like timothy leary! potter gets picketed and banned in school libraries! just because tolkien is christian and potter is not devout, that does not mean potter is an evil little boy who deflowers virgins. that's not potter, that's bill gates. 2. why did anyone think any of these films would get oscars? other than for special effects. it has hobbits in it! did anyone notice that? how can anyone take this film seriously? although chicago won oscars and it possessed a singing richard gere. jesus, there is hope for rotk then. i give this film 7 extremely horny and angry urak hais out of 10. thats a b.;3 June 2003;7;['regular', 'young', 'uncool', 'big', 'colorful', 'most', 'social', 'funny', 'chief', 'grand', 'wide', 'comic', 'freaky', 'right', 'many', 'marketable', 'english', 'cheesy', 'secret', 'aragorn', 'same', 'infamous', 'many', 'cute', 'mardi', 'many', 'original', 'feminine', 'physical', 'hungry', 'urak', 'more', 'limited', 'sexy', 'good', 'cool', 'deep', 'matrixed', 'sure', 'big', 'fat', 'impressive', 'difficult', 'deep', 'least', 'many', 'whole', 'bad', 'evil', 'dead', 'vicious', 'cool', 'many', 'local', 'other', 'worth', 'special', 'excellent', 'first', 'nuts', 'amazed', 'much', 'great', 'many', 'little', 'simple', 'enjoyable', 'last', 'brutal', 'christian', 'devout', 'evil', 'little', 'other', 'special', 'angry', 'urak'];0.0899492583918813
520;McHuevo;"just as its predecessor, ""the two towers"" is a major scale film, very well executed and performed. i don't think i can call it a sequel, since it was simultaneously filmed along with parts i and iii of the trilogy. just under three hours long, the movie picks up right where we left in ""the fellowship of the ring"". frodo and sam are on their painstaking way to mordor and aragorn, legolas and gimli are trying to catch up with the uruk-hai that took pippin and merry as prisoners. enter gollum, the riders of rohan and treebeard, the new characters that play an essential part, each on their own, in the whole trilogy. i was looking forward to see this movie ever since i was captivated by the first installment of the trilogy. i hadn't read any of the books by that time, but the story caught me so much, i just couldn't wait another year to know what happened to frodo. i think that's the main difference between my perception of ""the fellowship of the ring"" and ""the two towers"". to be honest i felt that the first film was too long the first time i saw it, but when i finished the book and saw it again i felt it was too short. now, having read the book twice, i feel that ""the two towers"" is just a little bit too long, and i think i have a very good reason to do so: chapters 8-11 of book iii and 7-10 of book iv were simply cut out and and replaced with many other battle sequences, like the attack of the orcs on the people of rohan on their way to helm's deep, many flashback and dream sequences, and others i won't tell to avoid spoiling it for you. this certainly will benefit the third film ""the return of the king"" as it will contain many more action sequences than the book describes (and i agree it needs them instead of such a long epilogue), but ""alas!"" it made me mad having to wait another year to see them. and since those chapters are left out, the whole movie concentrates on the grand finale of the battle of helm's deep. did you think the first battle sequence of ""saving private ryan"" was long? think again. leaving this aside, the movie is a very good adaptation from the book. i'm amazed by the way peter jackson's vision brought the story and its characters from the books to the film. all the places and landscapes are everything i had pictured in my mind. i was so anxious to see gollum and treebeard come to life, and i got more than i expected. in fact, despite the disadvantage of being a digital character, gollum's performance is the one that makes the most lasting impression in this movie (and perhaps the three of them). just like frodo, you feel pity for the little guy. awesome voice performing by andy serkis combined with flawless animation. also, kudos to frances walsh for her screenplay adaptation. it's no easy task writing a linear story from a book that goes forward and backward in time so abruptly. i have to see it again two or three more times to make an honest vote about it. i thought 9 at first, but that's just because i missed shelba so much. i guess you guys that had read the books before felt the same way about tom bombadil (although she's not out at all, no my precious, just delayed...). now bring on the extended edition on dvd! i want to see treebeard's home, the complete battle with the balrog, more merry and pippin! one year is too long to wait for ""the return of the king""!";21 December 2002;9;['major', 'painstaking', 'gimli', 'new', 'essential', 'own', 'whole', 'first', 'main', 'honest', 'first', 'long', 'first', 'short', 'little', 'good', 'many', 'other', 'deep', 'many', 'third', 'many', 'more', 'long', 'mad', 'whole', 'grand', 'deep', 'first', 'private', 'long', 'good', 'amazed', 'anxious', 'more', 'digital', 'lasting', 'little', 'awesome', 'flawless', 'easy', 'linear', 'more', 'honest', 'same', 'precious', 'extended', 'complete', 'long'];0.2255423553719008

522;WilliamSG;"so, the sequel is upon us. and.... it's not as sizzling as the first. peter jackson seems to have taken far too many liberties with this movie and turned it into a more generic hollywood romp. you could almost tell from the outset that this movie was nowhere near the quality of the first. something about how it starts... i can't quite put my finger on it...but if you compare the wonderful start of 'fellowship' to the beginning of 'towers', you'll see what i mean. there are so very many things wrong with this movie, but, ironically, smeagol was not the worst part, despite being completely cgi. infact, i would go so far as to say he was the best part of the movie. his torment is wonderfully portrayed, and the fact that he was cgi'd did not irritate like a certain cgi star wars character. also, credit is due to the animators for making the human/cgi interaction of frodo and smeagol very impressive. i looked forward to the smeagol scenes the most. (although...there was one torment scene i disliked where they shot it in 'takes' - cutting back between smeagol and his alter ego. it felt wrong in this kind of movie, but then again...a lot of things felt wrong) where was the acting in the rest of the movie? there was hardly any. i can't recall a single scene where there was any standout actor. the beginning of the movie was remarkably slow and even my wife - a bigger tolkien fan than myself - shifted uncomfortably in her seat after almost ninety minutes. oh...and gimli. why? why did they do this? why did every scene with gimli have to be one of comic relief? it felt like a bad disney movie. once or twice would have been too much, but every scene? the action too, felt far less orchestrated than it did in the first movie. again, jackon took more liberties with the way the scenes played out. legolas now surfs down stairs on a shield. somehow this is the sort of thing i expect from a bond movie... but, and rather cleverly i might add, - jackson ends the movie on a high, and the masses will love it. in that respect, this movie reminds me of 'the sixth sense.' a quick summary of the 'sixth sense' would be: ""zzzz....zzzzzzz.....zzzzzzz.....(insert clever ending here)"" viewer walks out of 'sixth sense' with that 'clever-ending-taste' in his mouth and gives the movie a ten out of ten! ""amazing! fantastic!"" -he screams, forgetting all about the tedium he had to endure to see said ending. in much the same way, the end of 'two towers' leaves the same feeling in one's mouth. undeniably an epic ending. (forgetting about the constant gimli comic-relief throughout it) so that's the movie for you really. nothing particularly memorable other than a very swish looking smeagol, and an epic ending. i can't really think of anything else memorable about the movie, except for treebeard. (- and some very dodgy blue-screen use) i'd (almost) go so far as to say just walk in for the end twenty or so minutes, but judging by the cheers at the beginning and end of the movie last night, no-one will listen to me anyway. that sweet taste at the end won everyone over. ah well..at least i tried..";18 December 2002;6;['first', 'many', 'generic', 'first', 'wonderful', 'many', 'wrong', 'bad', 'good', 'certain', 'due', 'human', 'impressive', 'wrong', 'wrong', 'any', 'single', 'slow', 'big', 'gimli', 'gimli', 'comic', 'bad', 'much', 'orchestrated', 'first', 'more', 'high', 'sixth', 'quick', 'sixth', 'zzzz', 'clever', 'sixth', 'amazing', 'fantastic', 'same', 'same', 'epic', 'constant', 'gimli', 'comic', 'memorable', 'other', 'swish', 'epic', 'memorable', 'dodgy', 'blue', 'so', 'last', 'sweet', 'least'];0.1281184668989547

528;grenmonkey;"(i watched the extended cut) the middle part of the lord of the rings -trilogy, the two towers (2002) managed to balance nicely between the intimate character driven moments of the first film and the massive (and long) battle sequences and ""epic"" atmosphere of the third film. the film also added a well crafted cgi-character to that mix, along with a wonderfully bleak story and a great soundtrack. the result was that two towers is somewhat the highlight of the trilogy; not bouncing so much around from scene to scene as the first or the third film and rid of the boring story moments of the the return of the king (2003). the fellowship has broken and the film follows the three somewhat separate story lines of the remaining characters of the fellowship of the ring (2001), while adding new ones from left and right. elijah wood (frodo) and viggo mortensen (aragorn) are again the strong points of the cast, bernard hill (theoden) also a positive surprise. andy serkis does great work along with the effects team at bringing ""real"" life and emotion to the cgi -character of gollum. the action scenes are fun to sit through, the drama keeps you interested and the definite battle scene is well build-up from the first words of warning to the last swings of swords and whatnots the film's good fantasy entertainment. like the other films of the trilogy, it lacks the deeper and more""humane"" approach of the books the films are based on, concentrating more on the ""heavy on drama and action"" -scenes but i understand the thought process behind that decision. i'm not so much of a fan of the books, myself so that's not a ""big question"" for me. peter jackson (the director) managed to keep the multiple and branching story lines well in place, the film also looks great and contains a great otherworldly atmosphere throughout. it has some issues (i didn't find all the story lines interesting enough, the cgi in places is pretty awful in comparison to the best the film can offer, runs for a tad too long) but is a great movie experience to sit through. 3/4";23 August 2009;7;['middle', 'intimate', 'first', 'massive', 'long', 'epic', 'third', 'bleak', 'great', 'first', 'third', 'boring', 'separate', 'new', 'left', 'strong', 'positive', 'great', 'real', 'fun', 'interested', 'definite', 'first', 'last', 'good', 'other', 'deep', 'heavy', 'much', 'big', 'multiple', 'great', 'great', 'interesting', 'awful', 'good', 'great'];0.1491755793226381

532;dcorr123;many reviewers, professional as well as us amateurs, have commented that *the two towers* departs much more from the novel than did *the fellowship of the ring*. i have gone over both movies comparing them with the novel and don't find this to be the case. one difference between the movie and the book is organizational. in the book, all of the events involving aragorn, gimli, legolas, etc were told as a continuous story followed by the events involving frodo, sam and gollum even though these events were taking part concurrently. the movie instead interwove these. this gives the appearance of being more of a departure than it was and actually i find the movie approach in this respect more satisfying. presumably, this approach will continue into *the return of the king*. another seeming departure is that the last 4 chapters of each of these halves of the story were excluded. that much of this will be presented in *the return of the king* is fairly certain. gollum, e.g. does say that she will be able to help him recover the ring, referring of course to shelob. i assume that the chapters after the defeat of sauron will greatly reduced. except for the very important *scouring of the shire* most of these are rather anticlimactic. faramir's behavior is different than in the book. in the book he never attempted to take frodo and the ring back to gondor. however in the movie he does, in the end, realize the *truth* and lets frodo continue his mission. i find this probably more believable behavior than the more noble image depicted in the book. to some extent the same can be said for the ents. in the book, treebeard was well aware of saruman's crimes against the forest and i find it unlikely that he had to wait until the coming of a couple of hobbits before he felt motivated to take action. on the other hand, i find it also unlikely that, as in the movie, he would have been unaware of saruman's crimes. either way, this part still leaves me a bit dissatisfied. i did find the addition of aragorn's plight, after falling over the cliff and being presumed lost, a bit contrived. i assume that's so they could add more of the aragorn/arwen romance to the story but maybe they could have found a better way. and talking of arwen, the movie gives the impression that she has, after all, taken the ship over the sea. that could of course lead the way open for aragorn, instead of faramir, to marry eowyn. that would be a significant departure. my bet is that arwen will prove not to have sailed after all. further speaking of elves, i was glad to see elves, lead by haldir, come to the aid of rohan at helm's deep. the elves after all ultimately had a large part in bringing all these troubles about to begin with even if that's not apparent in lotr. the highlight of this movie for me is gollum. i've always regarded him as the most interesting character in lotr anyway and was hoping they would do his part well. not only was it done technically superbly well but they capture much of the combined revulsion and pathos of gollum. i'm in the ranks of those who would like to see an oscar for andy serkin. finally there is the battle of helm's deep. this was done as spectacularly as i anticipated (based to a large extent on the short battle scene presented as a prologue to *the fellowship of the ring*. many have hailed this as the most spectacular battle scene you will ever see in a movie. maybe to date, but this is but a skirmish compared to the siege of gondar/battle of pellanor fields in *the return of the king* ! prepare to be blown away by that one.;10 January 2003;10;['many', 'professional', 'more', 'organizational', 'gimli', 'continuous', 'more', 'satisfying', 'seeming', 'last', 'much', 'certain', 'able', 'important', 'most', 'anticlimactic', 'different', 'believable', 'noble', 'same', 'aware', 'unlikely', 'motivated', 'other', 'unlikely', 'unaware', 'dissatisfied', 'contrived', 'more', 'aragorn', 'well', 'open', 'significant', 'glad', 'deep', 'large', 'apparent', 'interesting', 'much', 'combined', 'deep', 'large', 'short', 'many', 'spectacular'];0.2086134453781512

536;MetalMania88;peter jackson's the lord of the rings trilogy is considered the most influential fantasy film of all time, it has the magic, heart, artistry and intelligence to make a great fantasy film so beloved and acclaimed that it is made long and is ended of in three parts just like how the star wars movies were made, and the trilogy is so good that even the moronic critics love it to while not all of the critics are mindless they are often disagreeable with how they review movies but sometimes they can also be agreeable and here they have a point the lotr trilogy is the most influential fantasy trilogy of all time and it is well worthy of the hype it gets but it's not what the critics say it's what the audience and the public says and here all of them say the trilogy is beyond great and i agree in fact i love it the most of them all i loved fellowship of the ring and return of the king this one which is two towers is in the middle it's still a cinematic blessing but while it's dangerously close to being as good as fellowship of the ring and return of the king it's not as great nevertheless it is a very good movie and i would grade it higher than a 10 if it was possible. the film starts with flashbacks of gandalf fighting the balrog, frodo dreams it's and wakes up he and sam later continue their journey and then they meet gollum who they eventually use him as a guide throughout the film sam doesnt get along with him though frodo is ok with him and he eventually learns his real name is smeagol. meanwhile legolas, aragorn, and gimli are still on their quest and try to find out what happened to hobbits merry and pipin on their road they encounter riders of rohan they meet somber played by karl urban who is one of king theo dams servants they also reunite with gandalf in the woods and tells him how he cast down the balrog, they return to rohan were gandalf releases the king from the corroupsion they are tasked to evacuate to helms deep where a big battle happens the action scenes are shot very well, peter jackson is very good at it he has a skill of making a good fantasy sword and scorchers flick with lots of battles and action scenes the ensemble is great, there is also one point where merry and pipin, meet treebeard the leader of the ents they first think they are orcs but later realize they are hobbits then they are told to go to a fight they first refuse but then they decide to go on the last march they storm isengard, killing uruk hai, and later flooding the whole place, frodo sam and gollum are captured by gondorians led by boromirs brother faramir they encounter a battle at osgiliath and then set them free, gandalf then shows up at helms deep with a big army and then gain victory and kill off the army of saruman who is locked up in his tower. this second part of the trilogy is still the best and it is the best book adaptation ever made it was all good that they even made a prequel called the hobbit trilogy which i thought was also really good it was a great prequel to the most influential trilogy of all time, everything in all the middle earth movies are great, they deserved all the awards they have recieved, the book was very good but the movies were much better even when the books have more details like i said. this film is fantastic and it is another great film in the trilogy, the film deserved oscar nominations for , best picture, best director( peter jackson) best arti direction, best sound mixing, best sound, best film editing, best visual effects;22 August 2020;10;['influential', 'great', 'beloved', 'long', 'good', 'moronic', 'mindless', 'disagreeable', 'agreeable', 'influential', 'worthy', 'great', 'most', 'cinematic', 'close', 'good', 'great', 'good', 'high', 'possible', 'gandalf', 'ok', 'real', 'gimli', 'gandalf', 'big', 'good', 'good', 'great', 'last', 'whole', 'free', 'deep', 'big', 'second', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'prequel', 'good', 'great', 'prequel', 'influential', 'middle', 'great', 'good', 'well', 'more', 'fantastic', 'great', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'visual'];0.4698518518518517
537;keuhkokala;"(this has some spoilers) they say this part was the most difficult to film, as it's in the center of the trilogy. well, it isn't as good as the fellowship of the ring, but this part has still a lot of great stuff in it. first, there's gollum. you simply can't write a review of this movie without writing about gollum. he is my favorite character in the book, as he is a horrible monster and an old hobbit the ring has been torturing for 500 years at the same time. i always pitied him. gollum has been made cg on this movie, though his motions and words come from actor andy serkins. on screen gollum looks quite like how i pictured him, although his ears are too big and blue eyes do not suit him, especially as his eyes were green in the previous film. serkins also provides great acting, especially when monster gollum and his inner hobbit smeagol argue. kind of reminds me of the green goblin and norman osborne in spider-man. another great new character is treebeard the ent, who is also mostly computer-generated. john rhys-davies's voice fits him, but it's too bad the ents are on-screen very little. well, it gets paid off in the end. rhys-davies also plays gimli the dwarf who is now the comic relief of the movie, when merri and pippin are most of the time in the woods with the ents, where they have nothing to joke about. it doesn't bother me, gimli's jokes are funnier, although he hasn't got as good a comment as in the previous film; ""nobody tosses a dwarf!"" most of the running time is spend in the kingdom of rohan, where theoden tries to avoid war against evil wizard saruman's uruk-hai armies. it's not all boring, but the second hour seems to last much longer than the first or the third. jackson has spiced up the dullest parts of the book by adding a fight against orcs riding wargs, kind of hyena-like beasts and aragorn and arwen missing each other. the last hour is the best of this film and the whole trilogy so far. first, there's the massive battle of helm's deep. the despair of the defenders feels in the air as 100 000 uruk-hais and orcs march in front of the fort and start shouting to taunt their opponents. it's hard to believe most of those soldiers are cg. the viewer feels like s/he's in the battle itself and dives even deeper to despair when the enemy breaks the walls and beats the hell out of rohan's soldiers. but in the morning, when gandalf rides in with the riders of rohan the viewer's despair changes to joy and relief. peter jackson sure can create great feelings. although the film is not as good as the first one, it doesn't deserve anything less, than the full points. 10/10 the best part (spoiler): the final march of the ents. i felt very good seeing the tree people finally paying back to saruman by coming to his fortress, eisengard, and starting to wreck the place up! stomp! orcs get squashed! wham! orcs get crushed under a big rock thrown by an ent! ker-sploosh! the ents break the dam and the river sweeps all the smaller creatures into saruman's mine pit! it can't get any better than this! oh, i can't wait for the third and final movie!";13 September 2003;9;['difficult', 'good', 'great', 'favorite', 'horrible', 'old', 'same', 'big', 'blue', 'green', 'previous', 'great', 'inner', 'great', 'new', 'bad', 'little', 'gimli', 'comic', 'most', 'funny', 'good', 'previous', 'most', 'evil', 'uruk', 'boring', 'second', 'first', 'third', 'dull', 'hyena', 'like', 'aragorn', 'other', 'last', 'good', 'whole', 'massive', 'deep', 'hard', 'most', 'great', 'good', 'first', 'less', 'full', 'good', 'final', 'good', 'stomp', 'big', 'small', 'well', 'third', 'final'];0.104908781694496

541;ProperCharlie;it sounds to me as if some people are disappointed that they haven't just witnessed their own personal epiphany on celluloid (or digitally projected where available). if you are one of these people, i feel sorry for you. you are missing a truly wonderful experience and probably one of the best cinematic adaptations from source material there is around. don't worry, those treasured images conjured from reading the books will still be there after you've seen the film. maybe they'll even be improved. plus, you can always read the books again afterwards. this film is the equal of the magnificent 'the fellowship of the ring'. the themes are different of course and the feeling is possible even more traditionally epic. you get swept along with the whole experience, you feel the devastation of rohan, the assault on helm's deep, the possibility of the extinction of men. the portrayal of the effect of the ring is magnificent. frodo's pain and fall into its grip are clear across the screen as frodo's dependence on sam to keep him going grows. gollum/smeagol is the best use of a cgi character i've yet seen on film, praise which should not detract from the ents, fell beasts and wargs. the assault of helm's deep in stunning mostly because of the clarity of editing and narrative at what could be a very confusing moment. at all points it is clear what is going on and how desperate the situation is becoming. the only slight criticism i have (and it's only tiny and not enough to stop me giving the film a 10), is that it feels as though there's something missing. you'll know what i mean if you've seen the extend fellowship dvd. the extra footage in that seems to round out that film and complete it. i already can't wait for the extended dvd of the two towers. so, you must see this even if you think that elves and dwarves are a little bit silly. peter jackson has made a stunning film out of what could have been the hardest book of the three adapt. possibly the best epic film series there has yet been made.;7 January 2003;10;['disappointed', 'own', 'personal', 'available', 'sorry', 'wonderful', 'good', 'cinematic', 'treasured', 'magnificent', 'different', 'possible', 'epic', 'whole', 'deep', 'magnificent', 'clear', 'good', 'deep', 'confusing', 'clear', 'desperate', 'only', 'slight', 'tiny', 'enough', 'extra', 'extended', 'little', 'silly', 'stunning', 'hard', 'good', 'epic'];0.1220052083333333
542;marlyly;i truly believe that 'the lord of the rings' is one of the greatest stories ever told. the tale of frodo baggins and the ring of power continues in the second part of the trilogy, where frodo and sam are continuing their relentless quest to mordor to destroy the ring, only to be joined by the sinister yet pitiable creature known as gollum. meanwhile, merry & pip try their hardest to escape from the evil orcs who captured them at the end of 'the fellowship of the ring', whilst gimley, legolas and aragorn meet a king and immediately sense something is not right. old characters return and new ones are introduced as the tale of the ring grows closer to it's end. the extended edition is far superior to the original, though the amount of time it takes to watch borderlines on ridiculous. there are many (necessary) explanations and more focus on various story arcs. i was especially pleased at the extra focus on arwen and aragorn, one of the main stories to hold my interest. as with the 1st of the films, each shot, every scene is spectacular to watch, and as the viewer you never question the integrity of this fantasy world - for a few hours you truly are transported into this world, the characters do exist, the elves, dwarfs, orcs, ents and hobbits are all real. the soundtrack is breathtaking and the acting is superb - the characters all look and sound the part and the script is infallible. i don't really have any complaints, except (as i mentioned earlier) for the length of the film, but as this is the extended edition, and that no matter how long this film is it never once feels boring, all is forgiven on my part and i sincerely look forward to watching 'the two towers' again. this is how film adaptations from books are meant to be done. those responsible for the harry potter and narnia films would do to take heed and learn from the master.;4 October 2008;9;['great', 'second', 'relentless', 'sinister', 'pitiable', 'hard', 'evil', 'right', 'old', 'new', 'extended', 'superior', 'original', 'ridiculous', 'many', 'necessary', 'more', 'various', 'pleased', 'extra', 'main', 'spectacular', 'few', 'real', 'superb', 'infallible', 'extended', 'boring', 'responsible'];0.1103801995106342

544;karenlynn1;"first off, let me just say that i love tolkien's original story the lord of the rings. it's absolutely a classic, and deserves much praise--as well as the cult following it's gathered the past few decades. but of all of the three parts of the story this one stands out apart from it's predecesor, the fellowship of the ring, and it's sequel the return of the king. the second part of the saga is definitely pivotal. why? we are introduced to gollum, the kingdom of rohan and it's characters, and faramir of gondor. let's not forget the battle of helm's deep, gandalf the grey becomes gandalf the white, or the the breathtaking march of the ents. despite certain liberties--artistic and cinematic--taken by peter jackson, it still does not mar the beauty or enjoyment of this film for me. while boromir's death should have been the beginning of this film instead of the end of the last, and the spider shelob should have made her appearance earlier i respect jackson's decisions in that respect. with all that went on in the film version of the two towers--battle of helm's deep and all--shelob's lair interjected into the mix would have made this seem ""too busy"" after all. (that's just my opinion, however.) many viewers scoff at a miniscule modernism by jackson, involving legolas using a shield in a skateboard-like fashion. but honestly, if you blink you would miss it. all in all, it was well done--relatively true to the source material, exciting and entertaining.";16 January 2007;10;['original', 'much', 'past', 'few', 'second', 'pivotal', 'deep', 'white', 'breathtaking', 'certain', 'artistic', 'cinematic', 'last', 'deep', 'busy', 'many', 'miniscule', 'like', 'true', 'exciting', 'entertaining'];0.2068121693121692
545;susan7;"i was somewhat disappointed in the two towers. i felt that the editing was a little choppy resulting in a lack of transition between some scenes. i hope the extended edition of the dvd will correct this. and while i can allow for the introduction of certain scenes not found in the trilogy to maintain the love interest angle, i can see no need to introduce a story line that simply doesn't exist in tolkien's work. the principal example is this: in tolkien, the elves never showed up at helm's deep, and the captain of the elves, haldir, while he did an exceptional job of dying in the movie, did not die in the battle at helm's deep. the introduction of that into the movie served no useful purpose that i can see. i could have lived without it, and peter jackson should have lived without it. another example is when aragorn went off the cliff during the battle with the wolf riders. it can be inferred from tolkien that a fight with the wolf riders could have occurred, because the text is clear about the fact that some skirmishes did occur on the way to helm's deep. but tolkien goes out of his way to indicate that the encounters were minor. they were of the ""hit-n-run"" variety. still, i can live with the movie presentation. but aragorn did not go off that cliff; he did not float down stream; and he did not reappear. that part of the movie can only serve as a possible introduction to a second love interest, and a conflict in aragorn's mind over his future. if that was the intent, it was poorly done. but my major complaint with this movie is the shabby treatment given to faramir. he was an honorable man in tolkien. he was able to do what his brother was not able to do. he knew the ring of power was within his grasp, but he never saw it. indeed, he did not want to see it. and he let frodo go. he did not drag him off to present him as a gift, and frodo never stood on that wall and faced the ringwraith. putting this into the movie was an unjustified modification of tolkien's work. it served no purpose other than to add perhaps 5 minutes to the running time of the flick. that is a poor excuse for doing such a hatchet job on a man's work. unforgivable! all of this leaves me with some doubt about how jackson will handle part iii of the trilogy. does he have the nerve to do it right and do it completely? we shall see. mr. jackson, you have an unprecedented opportunity here. please don't waste it. this could be your magnum opus.";10 September 2003;7;['disappointed', 'little', 'choppy', 'extended', 'certain', 'principal', 'deep', 'exceptional', 'deep', 'useful', 'clear', 'deep', 'minor', 'possible', 'second', 'major', 'shabby', 'honorable', 'able', 'able', 'unjustified', 'other', 'poor', 'unforgivable', 'unprecedented', 'magnum'];0.0647869674185463

550;rookie-8;i love the books. call me a geek, a loser, a freak, its been done before.(mostly by my mother) i love the world tolkien created, that wonderous place called middle earth, and i love the characters that he sprung from its soil. i love everything about it. so when jackson was making and then releasing fotr i was excited, nervous, and a little apprehensive. how could anyone, even with lucas graphics behind him every step of the way, how could anyone capture that magic the books cast upon most of us who read them? how could anyone do them justice? well, jackson did, and two towers comes close to eclipsing fotr as a whole. first, it is darker, as the book is. there is more action, more fighting, more tense pressure put on by impending doom. second, there is more comedy. these characters that seemed so distincted are now alive, real, human in this movie, where their love and their fears and their hates all come out in full view. finally, there is gollum. i have never seen such a character. you have to remind yourself that he is computer animated for one thing, but then the depth of the character, the depth of the emotions shown in its face, the eyes, the forhead, the body language, it is all just astounding. i could have watched gollum all day and night. the charcater is so very interesting you do not mind being taken away from the action to seem him as he guides frodo and sam closer and closer to mordor. jackson does, as in the first one, take some liberties with the novels, not living up to every chapter in them, but the detail is so precise, the important moments so well done, the intensity raised to such a high level, that even the most ardent lotr fans will not scowl at such changes. go see this movie. go see it once, twice, three times if necessary. it is great cinema, it is great escapism, but most of all it is a great story that finally comes to life. and now, we wait for the return of the king. is anyone else excited?;18 December 2002;10;['wonderous', 'middle', 'excited', 'nervous', 'little', 'apprehensive', 'lucas', 'most', 'dark', 'more', 'more', 'tense', 'more', 'distincted', 'alive', 'real', 'human', 'full', 'astounding', 'interesting', 'first', 'precise', 'important', 'high', 'ardent', 'such', 'necessary', 'great', 'great', 'most', 'great', 'excited'];0.3095666666666666
551;rookie-8;"this movie, like all others based upon epic books, will always leave some confused, frustrated, dissappointed, and down right pissed off. no movie can ever bring a book to life no matter how true they stay to the original novel. so jackson, in his attempt to not only bring the books to life but to also make a movie, has tinkered with the story. he has cut here, expanded there, and just used his own imagination to develop parts in the movie tolkien never imagined in the book. when all is said and done a person who loved the books does a great disservice to him/herself if they don't just watch instead of study. the beauty of tolkiens story was that it entertained us. it brought us into a world called middle-earth and it never let us go, even when the final chapter of the book had been read. jackson is doing the same thing, only in a different way. **********spoilers********************* lets get to the changes. first, and possibly most serious, is the fact that faramir is far different in the movie then the book. his basic character is changed. i for one was never a fan of faramir or boromir, never really cared for either, but jackson takes far too many liberties with him then need be. instead of passing the test of the ring in the lands outside of mordor and sending frodo on his way with sam and gollum, faramir drags the threesome to gondor, where he is ready, able and willing ti hand the little hobbitt with the little ring over to his father and thus destroy all hope that remains. i think jackson did it to lengthen the journey through/to morod part of the movie but it was not needed. faramir also warned frodo of gollum and the path he proposed to take them on in the book, but not in the movie. second, the whole romance between arwen and aragorn, and the displeasure elrond exhibits towards it, is overplayed here. no one cares if arwen leaves the shores of middle earth. she wasn;t a large character in the books and she is not that interesting in the movies. and galadriel showing up out of no where, just to get some screen time, makes no sense either. third, the elves never do show up at helms deep to help out the men of rohan. this, in my opinion, is the worst decsion jackson has made. to underscore the rohirrim in favor of a brigade of elves coming to help out in helms deep was a wrong decision in my opinion. i would have rather seen the fight of helms deep the book portrayed rather then the one jackson dreamed up. but what did work? gollum!!! i can't explain to you the startling reality of this character. i always found gollum to be one of the most complex, interesting, disgusting yet pitiable characters anyone has ever created. this character is everything he was in the books. he is perfect, as if jackson simply opened his copy of lotr and gollum jumped out asking to see his precious. you fear him yet you pity him yet you like him yet you distrust him. he is the character of gollum. and the precision of the cgi on this character is amazing. he has feeling, emotions, and actions that are displayed through his eyes and his face. you don't think of him as a cgi character when you see him, you think of him as a pitiful creature, but one that is real. outstanding!!! the ents!!!!! the book basically tells you, in much more eloquent terms then i use now, "" these guys are kinda crappy until they get p****d, then watch your a**."" and boy do they get going. the attack of isengard by the ents is incredible. it is brief but the power of the ents, and the anger of treebeard come to life in those moments. helms deep!!!!! sure it is a little far fetched to have gimli and aragorn fighting 100 orcs on a bridge all by themselves and not being touched, but who cares. they are heroes, right? they are the modern day beowulfs, right? and didn't tolkien write a story where a little hobbit killed a nazgul? so that isn't a big deal. and the action, the action is incredible. the fight is overwhelming. the orcs are never ending, the bravery is unquenchable, and intensity is palpable. one of the best battle scenes movies have produced. finally, the characters!!! the love of tolkiens stories, in my opinion, rest first on the amazing world the man created, then second on the amazing characters the man created to inhabit that world. in and out of the novels moved characters, some important to the story, such as treebeard and elrond, and others not so important but yet enchanting, such as tom bombadill. but the main characters are the ones most of us fell in love with. they were our eyes and ears. they carried our swords, killed the orcs we would have killed, and braved the hopelessness of the dark places the way we would have liked to. we loved them. and in this movie these characters come to life. aragorn is strong and kingly, yet humble and unwilling to force his heritage on anyone. gimli is strong, funny, awkward, and head strong, yet loveable. legolas is exotic, fearless, and full of joy in times that seem to be devoid of such emotion. frodo is weak, tired, stressed, fearful, yet loving even to the creature gollum. sam is simple yet strong and fearless and while frodo is the bearer of the ring, for all intensive purposes sam is the keeper of that ring and its mission. and gollum is astounding. the characters are what drives this movie, our love, our hate, and our fear of all of them, but mostly by our deepest desire to see all of the main characters reach their goals. go see this movie. go see it tonight so that you can go see it tommorow. go see it after christmas and then read the books over again so you can be ready for the next one. but while you are watching the film, put the books down and enjoy the show. enjoy middle earth.";19 December 2002;10;['epic', 'confused', 'frustrated', 'true', 'original', 'own', 'great', 'middle', 'final', 'same', 'different', 'serious', 'different', 'basic', 'many', 'ready', 'able', 'willing', 'little', 'little', 'whole', 'middle', 'large', 'interesting', 'bad', 'wrong', 'startling', 'complex', 'interesting', 'disgusting', 'pitiable', 'perfect', 'precious', 'amazing', 'pitiful', 'real', 'outstanding', 'eloquent', 'crappy', 'incredible', 'brief', 'treebeard', 'deep', 'sure', 'little', 'gimli', 'aragorn', 'right', 'modern', 'right', 'little', 'big', 'incredible', 'overwhelming', 'unquenchable', 'palpable', 'good', 'amazing', 'amazing', 'important', 'such', 'important', 'enchanting', 'such', 'main', 'most', 'dark', 'aragorn', 'strong', 'humble', 'unwilling', 'gimli', 'strong', 'funny', 'awkward', 'strong', 'loveable', 'exotic', 'fearless', 'full', 'devoid', 'such', 'weak', 'tired', 'stressed', 'fearful', 'creature', 'simple', 'strong', 'fearless', 'intensive', 'astounding', 'deep', 'main', 'ready', 'next', 'middle'];0.138064713064713

554;tuhin94;"everything aside from the plot was marvelous. the novel's split of the eastern and western events were skillfully interlaced with one another in the film to create scenes that progressed together chronologically. many of the light moments in the novels were brought to full light and made quite funny in the film. gimli got the majority of these entertaining lines. the huge helpings of makeup and cgi were a monumental undertaking and they were executed so perfectly that they had me saying ""wow!"" even 12 years after the original release in front of a tv. in this sector, the film's makers stepped up from the first. i cannot wait to see what is in store for the third. it pains me to have to give this wonderful masterpiece a 9. alas, it did not stick to the books as it should have. by this i do not mean every single detail; i mean that there were major story and geographical alterations that should not have happened. in the fellowship of the ring, there were scenes like the hobbits' adventures with tom bombadil that were completely omitted. this is understandable as it would not have contributed significantly to the story as a whole and, thus, would only be added weight in terms of runtime. also, minor changes (eg., ""you shall not pass!"" and flashbacks) served to improve the quality of the movie. however, in the two towers, things such as aragorn being shown defeated and near death after the warg fight (which was a semi-major battle that never occurred in the novel in the first place) are major changes to the plot and tend to harm the movie, especially with fans that love this fantasy series so much. it seemed like a clear attempt to milk the relationship between aragorn and arwen to its fullest, while this aspect of the film was not given too much attention in the novel. additionally, faramir was shown to be drawn in by the power of the ring. this bothered me the most because faramir was quite a good character and one to look up to in the novels. his respect was earned when he immediately showed he was unlike his brother and did not lust after the ring. changing faramir to possess the same traits as boromir is a bit of an insult. but, like i said earlier, minor changes serve to ameliorate the movie or add as much of the story as possible given the budget and time constraints. adding an army of elves at the battle of helm's deep made the already enthralling action even more so. having eowyn present at helm's deep as opposed to dunharrow allowed the heat between her and aragorn to grow more quickly. frodo hiding sam and himself with his cloak in front of the black gate added more suspense. lastly, it must be said that the music played throughout the movie was incredible. the film would not be nearly as impactful without its presence. for the ""everything else"" portion, a solid 10. if only the plot had adhered to the novel.... watched (extended edition) and written 05/30/2014.";30 May 2014;9;['marvelous', 'eastern', 'western', 'many', 'light', 'full', 'funny', 'gimli', 'entertaining', 'huge', 'monumental', 'original', 'first', 'third', 'wonderful', 'single', 'major', 'geographical', 'understandable', 'minor', 'such', 'aragorn', 'semi', 'major', 'first', 'major', 'clear', 'full', 'much', 'most', 'good', 'same', 'boromir', 'minor', 'much', 'possible', 'deep', 'enthralling', 'present', 'deep', 'aragorn', 'black', 'more', 'incredible', 'impactful', 'solid', 'extended'];0.2477092352092352

556;Chibichasechan;the one thing about this movie that really catches my attention, is the special effects. the director really did everything that he could, and what is needed in this movie, and made a movie from the book spectacular, and beyond stunning. this is my favorite lord of the rings movie of them all, and i have watched the 3 hour extended version of the movie about 10 times over, and watched the extras on the dvd, which takes about an hour to complete. i must say i am one of those lord of the rings geek. one of the best movies of all time, and the best movie i have seen in all my time. the actors are so good with their roles it's unbelievable that they were acting, and not actually feeling it themselves, because i definitely did. this movie also housed a lot of my favorite actors, and they picked perfect people for all of their roles. elijah wood played an excellent role of frodo baggins, his character being the small, lost hobbit in the movie, wandering with his one friend sam gamgee, who was also very perfect for his role. they made the elves look so real i wondered sometimes if they were born with those ears or not. the fight scenes in the movie also blew me away, especially the last one. this has to be the only movie from the book where i liked the movie better than the book, and i am not a person like that. i believe you get more involved with the movie than the book, and that is not normal for me. i am glad they haven't ruined the book with the movie, like a lot of directors do. take a look at something like that da vinci code, or eragon, and you will see what i mean. the book is very good though, but also very long. i can easily just sit through 3 hours of this movie whenever i want to, and watch it over and over again at my pleasure, i know few people like me who can do that, and a lot of people watch a movie once and throw it away and never watch it again. i try to convince them to continue to watch it, but no one listens. the same thing happens with king kong, i can watch that over and over again and never get tired of it. definite 10 out of 10.;12 June 2007;10;['special', 'stunning', 'favorite', 'extended', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'unbelievable', 'favorite', 'perfect', 'excellent', 'small', 'perfect', 'last', 'only', 'well', 'involved', 'normal', 'glad', 'good', 'few', 'same', 'tired', 'definite'];0.3431972789115646

559;Roman-Nies;"i dislike these films. i dislike all this films with witches an wizards and other inhuman beings which are demonstrated to be good and the demons are mostly primitive. humans should not turn to such kind of supernatural forces and produce fairy stories for entertainment. i went into one of the three ""ring""- films with my children, who were already half grown up. after half of the film i left the cinema because i could not stand any longer this high quality-nonsense. in spite of the vast occult imagery, these movies and their literary counterparts are being praised by some professing christians to be an allegory for the bible story in which the good prevails in the end over the bad. world magazine's review is titled ""powerful rings"" and says that the ""movie version of tolkien's book speaks to today's culture."" unfortunately the today's culture is a very doubtful sort of thing. what about the increasing preference of our youth for the occult, for violence and obsessions? is the lord of the rings harmless fantasy or even a wholesome christian allegory? i think neither nor. if the film or the books contained bible truths it would not attract so many atheists. if they attract christians it is apparently because these sort of christians have a liking for the belief that wizards, hobbits, dragons and the kind could be of the good buddies, maybe also a liking for pagan contents which also had the author tolkien. his books are filled with occult imagery, such as witches, goblins, warlocks, wizards, fairies, and such things; and though these are strongly and unconditionally condemned in the bible, they are often portrayed as good and desirable by tolkien. many of the heroes of the lord of the rings, in fact, are of doubtful nature. the books became in the sixties and seventies popular with the generation of drug headed hippies. when tolkien was eight years old, his mother converted to roman catholicism, and he remained a catholic throughout his life. in his last interview, two years before his death, he unhesitatingly testified, ""i'm a devout roman catholic."" catholics have a different approach to the bible as protestants as well as a different approach to pagan symbols and cults. as a professor of literature at oxford university, tolkien specialized in old and middle english and loved ancient pagan mythology. his first fantasy novel, the hobbit, appeared in 1937, and the lord of the rings, in 1954-55. several others were published later, some posthumously. like tolkien lewis and perhaps most of the so called christians they did not accept the bible as the infallible word of god and he picked and chose what he would believe about the new testament, rejecting it in parts. and like tolkien, c.s. lewis loved at least some things about catholicism. he believed in purgatory, confessed his sins to a priest, and had the last rites performed by a catholic priest. the books depict the calling up of the dead to assist the living, which is plainly condemned in the scriptures of the bible as every protestant knows. sympathy with the devilish is not so much fostered and demonstrated as in the dominant occult harry potter series but tolkien's fantasies are certainly not of a christian spirit. some christians regard them as potential dangerous message. films are to a younger unexperienced audience always a strong influencer. in a film review this should also be taken in consideration. for agnostics the films should be rejected as they depict the bad as something too less subtle. the enemy of man is not outside him, it is inside him and everybody should know this. in us schools young students massacre their fellows, there are no hobbits who come to give the defenders of the right and good a helping hand, no flying by of harry potters. the bad is inside man and we have to take means to keep it down and promote the good. films like that are not helpful. in his last interview in 1971, tolkien stated that he did not intend the lord of the rings as a christian allegory and that christ is not depicted in his fantasy novels. tolkien said, ""but that seems i suppose more like an allegory of the human race. ... they (the humans) struggle on, almost blindly in a way"" a blind struggle? it is going to be a blind struggle if we do not take care to which direction our offspring goes! survival of the fittest? are the good the fittest? may be, maybe not! tolkien also said: ""i dislike allegory whenever i smell it."" he had definitely no christian aims. fantasy role-playing games are very influential today. dungeons and dragons, which appeared in the early 1970s, was based on tolkien's fantasy novels. tolkien certainly did get his ideas from pagan religions, and the message promoted in his fantasy books is strictly pagan. and so do the films. the morals in the books and films is of a very doubtful nature, it is primitive and not endurable. it can carry nobody to nowhere.";4 May 2008;1;['other', 'inhuman', 'good', 'primitive', 'such', 'supernatural', 'high', 'vast', 'literary', 'bible', 'good', 'bad', 'powerful', 'doubtful', 'harmless', 'wholesome', 'christian', 'bible', 'many', 'good', 'such', 'such', 'good', 'desirable', 'many', 'doubtful', 'popular', 'old', 'roman', 'last', 'devout', 'roman', 'different', 'different', 'old', 'middle', 'ancient', 'first', 'several', 'most', 'infallible', 'new', 'least', 'last', 'catholic', 'dominant', 'christian', 'potential', 'dangerous', 'young', 'unexperienced', 'strong', 'bad', 'subtle', 'young', 'good', 'bad', 'helpful', 'last', 'christian', 'human', 'blind', 'blind', 'fit', 'good', 'fit', 'allegory', 'influential', 'early', 'pagan', 'doubtful', 'primitive', 'endurable'];0.0431703830760434
560;ptwomey;the lord of the rings: the two towers is without any doubt the ultimate showcase of how good cinema can get. not only is towers a worthy extenstion of the first instalment, fellowship, but it is a stand alone thrill ride of cinematic genius. without warning, without any form of reminder or any chance of catching ones breath, peter jackson thrusts us right back into the world of middle-earth and right back into his daring and exciting form of film-making. unlike most sequals (i guess you can't really call this a sequal) towers is a completely different and unique film from the first. towers presents a darker more unforgiving mddle-earth and is unquestionably a war epic of truly incredible proportions. watching the film the energy that oozes off the screen in the extremely fast paced and action packed three hours gives you a bizz that many people would relate as the feeling they had when watching the empire strikes back for the first time all those years ago. the chemistry between each character, aided undoubtedly by the first film is electric and every scene serves to advance the film in a positive and entertaining direction. one weeps at the sheer brilliance of the films complex construction and near perfect cinematic execution. this is the stuff dreams are made of, this is the stuff that shapes the way forward in the future of film. towers is not without flaw, with a screen time limit of three hours much of the book has been cut and changed much to the displeasure of many fans and purists. still the film stands alone all by itself as grand cinema regardless of how prescious the book is. there are some very obvious computer aided effects, especially when watching the ents, but these are over shadowed by the sheer joy derived form the events on screen. peter succeeds where most special effects directors fail, he suspends disbelief so that even the most fake of creations is missed as the audience gets sucked into the events on screen. speaking of special effects, gollum/smeagol will undoubtedly go down in history as the very first succesful completely computer generated characters on film. yes he is obviously created by a computer, but he looks far better than anything else that has ever been presented and the character itself is an absolute treat and completely steels the show. the emotional high point of the film is stolen by gollum in his two he scenes where he speaks quite disturbingly to himself as each other alter ego. the acting is all very sifficient and definately above average for any film of this style. special credits should go to brad dourif as wormtounge who is as evil and cunning as the genius of peters vision, elijah as frodo and sean as sam who as a pair make for a great on screen plutonic chemistry defining a lost art of male comradeship, and of course any serkis as gollum. the film is often very light hearted as john-rhys davis discards his sombre dwarf character gimli from the first film and settles in as the comic-relief, this is a sharp contrast to the films very dark themes. people die, limbs are hacked, the world falls apart around them, but all the while peter remains focussed on the task at hand and delivers tolkiens message with the edge that only he can. the films three climaxes, the battle of helm's deep, the trashing of isengard and the siege at osgilith would all be a single fitting end to any epic film, and then the film leaves you breathless and wanting more... such torture - if the ending to fellowship had you wanting more, this willhave you tearing out the seats at the cinema in riot that you have to wait another year... still to behold the scene at helm's deep will be enough, no words can describe this except to say that it is the biggest most spectacular battle on screen and will not fail tpo satify. these films are looking to be the defining trilogy of this century and are certainly groundbreaking near perfect cinema. this once weeped for a good portion of the film, i can only hope the experience is as good as that for everyone else. peter jackson, heres to you and yours!;26 December 2002;10;['ultimate', 'good', 'worthy', 'first', 'alone', 'cinematic', 'middle', 'daring', 'exciting', 'most', 'sequal', 'different', 'unique', 'first', 'incredible', 'many', 'first', 'first', 'electric', 'positive', 'entertaining', 'sheer', 'complex', 'perfect', 'cinematic', 'much', 'many', 'grand', 'prescious', 'obvious', 'sheer', 'most', 'special', 'fake', 'special', 'first', 'succesful', 'well', 'absolute', 'emotional', 'high', 'other', 'sifficient', 'special', 'evil', 'cunning', 'great', 'lost', 'male', 'light', 'gimli', 'first', 'comic', 'sharp', 'dark', 'deep', 'osgilith', 'single', 'fitting', 'epic', 'more', 'such', 'more', 'deep', 'enough', 'big', 'spectacular', 'defining', 'perfect', 'good', 'good'];0.2335449320794148

563;FilmWiz;the fellowship has been broken. boromir (sean bean) is dead, frodo baggins (elijah wood) and samwise gamgee (sean astin) have gone to mordor alone to destroy the one ring, merry (dominic monaghan) and pippin (billy boyd) have been captured by the uruk-hai, and aragorn (viggo mortensen), legolas (orlando bloom), and gimli (john rhys-davies) have made friends of the rohan, a race of humans that are in the path of the upcoming war, led by its aging king, theoden (bernard hill). the two towers between mordor and isengard, barad-dur and orthanc, have united in their lust for destruction. the corrupt wizard saruman (christopher lee), under the power of the dark lord sauron, and his slimy assistant, grima wormtongue (brad dourif), have created a grand uruk-hai army bent on the destruction of man and middle-earth. the rebellion against sauron is building up and will be led by gandalf the white (sir ian mckellen), who was thought to be dead after the balrog captured him. one of the ring's original bearers, the creature gollum (andy serkis), has tracked frodo and sam down in search of his 'precious', but is captured by the hobbits and used as a way to lead them to mt. doom. the war of the ring has now begun... the above is the plot in a nutshell. this 3-hour (3.7 for the extended version) movie has gone beyond the imaginable. trees that talk and pick up humans, to this gollum character who's downright annoying. what is in store for the return of the king? don't misunderstand me, i liked the film, and after seeing the original i was anxious to see this one, as i had heard that it would be coming out in the upcoming months. i thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it. well that would be a like. i enjoyed the movie as a whole, but it was way too long. i will definitely see return of the king in the theater next year but someone tell peter jackson to include an intermission! while the movie is very visually impressive, i believe that the film is not up to the hype that it was given. i should have known however that it was lotr worshipers who gave it 26269 ratings of 10. did it disserve a best picture award? it absolutely did not. i was glad that it got the special effects oscar, however. but nonetheless, i was able to hold my urine for to hours, for i was intrigued to find out what happened in the end. the battle of helms deep was probably one of the best battle scenes done since braveheart and i thought it was an excellent adaptation of tokien. however, it lingered for too long. i think tokien would have liked these movies, but disliked at how bored you sometimes you get sitting in the chair. this movie was very good. however, the american film institute need not revise its 100 greatest movies of all time for fellowship or two towers. like many series films, i thought that the first film, the fellowship, was far superior. mpaa rating: pg 13 my rating: 12 and up for epic battle sequences and scary images my * rating 8.8;16 June 2003;8;['dead', 'dominic', 'aragorn', 'gimli', 'upcoming', 'corrupt', 'dark', 'slimy', 'grand', 'uruk', 'middle', 'white', 'dead', 'original', 'creature', 'precious', 'extended', 'imaginable', 'annoying', 'original', 'anxious', 'upcoming', 'like', 'next', 'impressive', 'good', 'glad', 'special', 'able', 'good', 'excellent', 'bored', 'good', 'great', 'many', 'first', 'superior', 'epic', 'scary'];0.2306122448979591

565;theojhyman;hardly a moment's rest in this film!...very little space to sit back and breathe. it goes straight back into the story and the action, introducing the character, gollum, almost immediately and putting him at the heart of this middle part of the trilogy. so many great points to commend, especially the battle sequences and even more breathtaking i think - the ents. aragorn is the great hero of the movie and frodo, this time, becomes the sad soul or the victim of the film, because of the pain and burden of bearing the ring. the 2nd book was the best of the trilogy, but i'm expecting the third film to be the best of the movies. this lived up to all expectations and was far from disappointing. however, it seemed to be just a little dumbed down for today's audience for two reasons - the complexity of the 2nd book was extremely difficult to put onto film and that the story was so dark, cold, violent and horrific that peter jackson felt he had to lighten it up a little with gimli's frequent comic lines and gollum's overplayed cute, childlike innocence, which, while ever apparent in the book, wasn't as oveerplayed as in the film. sad to see that merry and pippin have very little screen time in this film. i'm sure the audience would love to have seen more of them, after having become so attached in the first film. good to see an emotional depth to the character, eowyn - excellent, although it did overshadow the love story between aragorn and arwen. i'd agree with most other reviewers that this film is not as emotionally involving as the first, as it does concentrate more on the action and story development, compared to the first whose main focus was on characterisation and served to make the first film the more moving and compelling of the two. but i don't consider any of these criticisms to be faults of the moviemakers. i think they have tackled the most challenging of stories with a standard that is as close to perfection as you can get in cinema. out of the 2 films, this is the more watchable - i think people will keep going back to the cinema over the next few months to watch this one again and again. its pacing is much faster and tighter and i suppose it was quite a clever move to end this film much sooner than the incredible cliffhanger ending in the book. can't wait to see the next one in a year, and i'll add that all other films over the next 12 months will seem disappointing compared to what we are expecting next december! this movie will soon be in the imdb top 10, and perhaps top 5 ?;20 December 2002;9;['little', 'middle', 'many', 'great', 'breathtaking', 'aragorn', 'great', 'sad', 'good', 'third', 'good', 'disappointing', 'little', 'difficult', 'dark', 'cold', 'violent', 'horrific', 'little', 'frequent', 'comic', 'overplayed', 'cute', 'childlike', 'apparent', 'oveerplayed', 'sad', 'little', 'sure', 'more', 'first', 'good', 'emotional', 'excellent', 'most', 'other', 'first', 'first', 'main', 'first', 'moving', 'compelling', 'close', 'watchable', 'next', 'few', 'fast', 'tight', 'clever', 'incredible', 'next', 'other', 'next', 'disappointing', 'next', 'top'];0.1062196307094266
566;duff_99;i was a huge fan of the fotr movie adaption, and gave it 10/10. don't get me wrong: ttt is an amazing movie! but, there is a lot they could have done to make it better by not straying so far from the books. here's my list, which some other ttt book fans have already noted (warning, spoilers) king theoden: in the books, he was a headstrong king, strong within, and was able to make his own choices. in the movie, he's a little whiner who needs nudging from aragorn every 5 seconds to go to war. faramir: this was unacceptable. he's not the same character anymore. in the books, he was a great warrior, wise, and had a strong will. in the movie, he's more rash, impatient and weak willed then boromir was. what the hell happened? gandalf: well, not much to say, seeing as how one of the most imposrtant characters of the book is maybe in the movie for 15 minutes. we don't see at all how he's changed from grey to white. the whole love thing with aragorn and arwen: ok, we get the friggin point. they love each other, but she has to make a sacrificie. elrond doesn't want her to go with him. after a whole 30 minutes of watching that, i was nearly asleep. and what about the 6 chapters that they kind of skipped? don't i remember something about a spider named shelob in this book? and about my favourite chapter in the book, where gandalf and theoden exchange words with saruman? i mean, they really could have taken out the unnecessary scenes (osgilath, arwen) and made room for these important ones. how do they expect to fit all in return of the king? and since when does saruman work for sauron? isn't he supposed to be a double traitor? it gives him more depth. he was one of my favourite characters in the book, because of his thirst for power, but now he's just a servant to another power. and now for the good. gollum was great! andy serkis pulled off an amazing job. exactly how i imagined him. it gives you the right affect, as you end up pitying him. the ents were great. my favourite scene in the movie would have to be them attacking isengard. i just hated how pippin had to trick treebeard into going to war. how the hell would one of the oldest beings of the land get tricked by a teenage hobbit? the battle of helm's deep was well done, with all the details i remember from the book being there, and the few that were added were good. excellent job and excitement. elijah wood and sean astin both did amazing jobs as frodo and sam. frodo was great at showing how the ring was taking over him, and sam is showing how he's maturing. in total, a very good movie (hell, i'm sseeing it again in 2 days) but there was much they could work on and add and delete. 8/10;18 December 2002;10;['huge', 'wrong', 'amazing', 'well', 'other', 'strong', 'able', 'own', 'little', 'aragorn', 'unacceptable', 'same', 'great', 'wise', 'strong', 'rash', 'impatient', 'weak', 'willed', 'much', 'imposrtant', 'white', 'whole', 'other', 'whole', 'asleep', 'favourite', 'gandalf', 'theoden', 'unnecessary', 'important', 'double', 'more', 'favourite', 'great', 'amazing', 'right', 'great', 'favourite', 'old', 'teenage', 'few', 'good', 'excellent', 'amazing', 'great', 'good', 'much', 'delete'];0.289996693121693

583;asticht;i was absolutely enthralled with the two towers, i don't think there are enough superlatives in the english language to express the pleasure and all out thrill i received from watching this movie unfold on the screen. peter jackson is absolutely brilliant with his making this movie a separate film with a completely different style of editing from the first installment of the series. i do however wish to make an editorial comment here regarding the academy of motion picture sciences nominating the first film for practically every category imaginable and the film only coming away with a couple of statues. listen up oscar, this film is by far the best picture of the year, and peter jackson is a penultimate director and deserves credit for the incredible work that he has done making a movie that is not only pleasing to the fans of the work on which it is based, but also is very well crafted as a good motion picture should be in this day and age. i read last year that there were some people commenting about the film not being that good because it is basically a chase movie. really? i mean get real people, of course it is, and anyone with half a brain who has actually read the original masterpieces on which the films are based would have known that! this isn't rocket science people! tolkien i think is smiling down on peter jackson right now as he has done well for making a visually and artistically stunning movie. for those who have rank & bass's interpretation of hobbits and dwarves and gollum, throw everything out from your mind. gollum most specifically is the most accurate and true form to tolkiens description of not only his appearance but as to his genetic origins being closely related to hobbits. it is his characterization by andy serkis along with the mystical ent treebeard played by john rhys davies which in my opinion makes this film as good as one who is a lotr fan would hope for. not only that, but the cg technology used to create these two characters is by far some of the best computer animation i have ever seen, and the realism that these characters posses is definitely the best live action characters since jurassic park. brad dourif's portrayal of grima wormtongue was also worthy of note as he is as snaky and evil in the book as he was in the movie. all in all, this is a wonderful fast paced film. the editing was much more snappy than in the fellowship of the ring. there are many more separate stories going on at the same time due to the fellowship having parted at the end of the film and there are three separate tracks taking place simultaneously. the only thing i felt was distracting was where i ended up sitting during the film, i was near the front of the theater and during some of the action scenes, due to how close i was to the screen, it was blurry at times and there was more activity going on than i could follow. this was not the filmmakers fault however, i was just too close to the screen to see everything happening at once. i would caution those who would like to bring younger children to this movie as it is definitely more violent and scary than the first film and some parents may find themselves calming nightmares for several days after a younger child sees this movie. bravo peter jackson!;20 December 2002;10;['enough', 'english', 'brilliant', 'separate', 'different', 'first', 'editorial', 'first', 'imaginable', 'good', 'penultimate', 'incredible', 'pleasing', 'good', 'last', 'good', 'real', 'original', 'stunning', 'accurate', 'true', 'genetic', 'mystical', 'good', 'lotr', 'good', 'good', 'live', 'worthy', 'wonderful', 'snappy', 'many', 'separate', 'same', 'separate', 'only', 'close', 'blurry', 'more', 'close', 'young', 'violent', 'scary', 'first', 'several', 'young'];0.3203934506353861

589;Frogfisher;"now i'll start by saying that for me the second installment of the lord of the rings trilogy, hasn't meant as much to me as fotr and rotk. but two things has meant a lot to me; gollum and parts of the books we'll see in rotk, and boromirs last stand. the film is a great epic war movie. and for me thats not good enough. the story is fare from what i remember. the most important scenes in the film are the ones in helms deep. tolkien also lies much weight on these chapters but not as much as pj & co. the scenes are well made and probably only seen better a few times before. that massive system really works out great. i have no problem with the battle in helm deep, beside the fact that i think it's too long. and here i wonder. why is there is teen scenes we never read about in the books, too end the movie five chapters or so before the book. before that we already knew that one chapter would be cut from ttt, boromir's last stand. where have the original story gone? instead they put the elves in the middle of the story, where they don't belong. why? so we have a more clear love story. for most of the fans i guess we don't need it, and beside, isn't there warm feelings between aragorn and eowyn? but wait that isn't the only new scene. varges? where do they come from and the result of the fight with the varges doesn't even support any of the important story lines that we have in this film, why should he fall? well, to make it more hectic and give it more speed and action, yes, but isn't there enough when the uruk-hai's are killed, when theoden king is freed from the poison of isengard and the battle of helms deep? and we even get to see some action in a place where frodo, sam and gollum never went. another new scene, but this is so short and important to clear out what faramir has to do, this probably was a hard task. there's plenty of action and incredible scenes as in fotr, and some are betters, much better. the judgement: this is still one of the best films seen the last year, terrifying at points, beautiful, actionpacked and deep most of the time and remarkable in every scene. but besides the fact the it isn't excatly what the book is telling at some points, it is a great epic journey to a new part of middle earth. the designs, the effects, the music everything helps us fall in to the world and feel that this is a historic film, not a fantasy film. i love it, but it lacks magic and suffers under that the makers sees it as a middle part to guide our heroes to their destiny in rotk, because that is what it is. we see magic places, but not because of beauty and history of the place but because the story takes them there, not as in fotr, where it all is new and exciting. i hope that in the last installment they have regained the exciting feeling of the project too make a great end to what stil is the best trilogy so fare. gollum. gollum is so perfect, incredible and realistic like no other thing i've seen in movies. andy serkis delivers a great performances and defintely is the right choice. he is the movie. i would like to see those deleted scenes with him in the movie and a couple of minutes less battle and new scenes, would have savved the movie. i like the first half and of course gollum in every scene. it is a great intro to the movie with, gandalf and the balrog, and of course our first glimce of gollum. it is great up to the point the varges attack, and after that in few periodes. the battle of helms deep is epic and historic, but too long. and the destruction of isengard is well done. but to make it one of the last scenes, it doesn't work for me. i still love the movie and i give it 7 out of 10, because of the grandness of the story and the very beautiful images of middle earth.";12 January 2003;7;['second', 'much', 'rotk', 'rotk', 'last', 'great', 'epic', 'good', 'fare', 'important', 'deep', 'much', 'well', 'few', 'massive', 'great', 'helm', 'long', 'teen', 'last', 'original', 'clear', 'most', 'warm', 'only', 'new', 'important', 'hectic', 'more', 'enough', 'theoden', 'deep', 'new', 'short', 'important', 'hard', 'incredible', 'good', 'last', 'beautiful', 'most', 'remarkable', 'great', 'epic', 'new', 'middle', 'historic', 'middle', 'rotk', 'magic', 'new', 'exciting', 'last', 'exciting', 'great', 'good', 'perfect', 'incredible', 'realistic', 'other', 'great', 'right', 'less', 'new', 'first', 'great', 'first', 'great', 'few', 'epic', 'historic', 'last', 'beautiful', 'middle'];0.2897858454676637

592;NotTheOne000;"it is a hazardous business, watching much anticipated films, especially when those are based upon greatly loved existing works - the new star wars films or the judge dredd movie are good examples. when it comes to a work that touches people so deeply, everyone has their own very personal opinions about how things should look, about which characters or events are most important and about how many alterations are acceptable. some hold that if the story is not to be re-created exactly then it should not be done at all; others hold that as long as the spirit of the source material is maintained we should accept any changes that are made. i am one of the lucky ones, as my vision of lotr and peter jackson's vision are remarkably similar. when i watched the two towers it was as though (with a few exceptions) my own imaginings had been sucked out of my head, polished, tweaked, filled out and generally improved, and then projected onto a giant white screen with dolby surround sound accompaniment. i didn't mind the changes, and i didn't mind the fact that the film ends before the book does because i was too busy falling in love with the second part of what i consider to be the greatest cinematic work of all time. citizen kane? unimaginative! star wars? old hat! i know this will sound really tragic, but there were points during the film (and also, i found, when watching the extended dvd version of the fellowship yesterday afternoon) where the vision before me was so exquisite and captured so well my understanding of the book that i worried i would embarrass myself by bursting into tears! to put it simply, there may be a few other films that achieve to greater effect individual aspects of this film, but as a whole experience lotr is, to me, simply without equal; no other film even comes close. this realisation of tolkien's great classic is the pinnacle of a hundred years of film making, and i would compare it with the sistine chapel, st peter's cathedral or beethoven's midnight concerto as one of humanity's truly great artistic creations. i do feel deeply for those fans who do not find jackson's interpretation as wonderful as i do, and i am sorry that some do not see him as the great visionary that many others do. all i can suggest is that next time you watch the two towers, try and forget the details of the plot - ignore the alterations and the differences in interpretation and try to remember how you felt when you first read the books. hopefully, with time, you will learn to love this film as much as i do.";3 January 2003;10;['hazardous', 'new', 'good', 'own', 'personal', 'important', 'many', 'acceptable', 'lucky', 'similar', 'few', 'own', 'giant', 'white', 'busy', 'second', 'great', 'cinematic', 'unimaginative', 'old', 'tragic', 'extended', 'exquisite', 'few', 'other', 'great', 'individual', 'whole', 'equal', 'other', 'close', 'great', 'great', 'artistic', 'wonderful', 'sorry', 'great', 'many', 'next'];0.2629437229437229

""the two towers"" is a wonderful film, filled with dazzling special effects and awesome battle scenes. the story starts off with gandalf falling with the creature that dragged him down when they were passing through moria. it shows him battling the creature in the air and later shows how the battle turns out. the story then switches to frodo and his loyal apprentice, samwise gamgee. as frodo becomes more controlled by the ring, sam is getting more worried of his master. when gollum sees them sleeping, he attempts to take the ring, but fails. the special effects on gollum are astounding and the creature steals the show. he agrees to help frodo and sam find the gates of mordor.meanwhile, aragon, legolas, and gimli are searching for their two friends that were taken captive, merry and pippen. this is just as good (possibly better) than the first one. warning: if you haven't seen the first one you will be completely lost so before you see this see the first one. elijah wood, viggo mortensen, orlando bloom, john rhys-davies, ian mckellen, and sean astin all give superb performances and the new characters are a treat (especially gollum and the empts) the empts are fun to watch, they are basically talking and walking trees that don't like to be pushed around. this story has a lot more humor in it, especially when gimli (rhys-davies) is around. this movie is a masterpiece of its time and its got my vote for best picture of the year. this story is good vs. evil is very well written by the brilliant writer j.r.r tolkien and peter jackson has done a magnificent job in translating this wonderful book into a wonderful movie. **** out of ****";23 December 2002;10;['great', 'wonderful', 'special', 'awesome', 'loyal', 'worried', 'special', 'astounding', 'gimli', 'captive', 'good', 'first', 'first', 'first', 'new', 'fun', 'more', 'gimli', 'good', 'good', 'brilliant', 'magnificent', 'wonderful', 'wonderful'];0.5873325087610802
601;bzb2001;"so the journey continues with 'the lord of the rings: the two towers.' this review will assume you have seen the first film, 'the fellowship of the ring.' which is fine because peter jackson, at the helm of this massive production, assumes you have seen it as well. intelligently, jackson does not begin with a redundant and unnecessary prologue. he dives right into what the filmmakers considered the hardest of the trilogy to make. when we left the fellowship, they were in shambles. gandalf had fallen; merry and pippen were kidnapped by the evil forces; aragorn, legolas, and gimli seek their smaller comrades without the help of boromir, who has also died; this leaves frodo and sam on their way to mount doom, the one ring still in their grasp. 'the two towers' is more successful than 'fellowship' because the storytelling becomes more complex without drowning us in information. the first film introduced us to the many characters of middle earth (too many, i believe). 'the two towers' isn't quite as concerned with exposition, though new characters do come on board. merry and pippin meet treebeard, a large, talking ""tree herder"" who is concerned about the plight of his forest's future since the destructive orcs and their masters, sauron and saruman, burn everything in their path. legolas, aragorn, and gimli enter the kingdom of rohan and cross paths with king theoden and his people. theoden has been under saruman's spell as part of he and sauron's master plan to take over the separate kingdoms of middle earth. eowyn, the king's niece, develops a special liking for aragorn. however, as we understand from the first film, there is still a deep love between aragorn and the elf arwen. along with the rest of the elfs of middle earth, arwen is persuaded to leave for another world entirely. she does have reservations leaving her true love aragorn, though mortal and she is not, for distant lands and never see him again. frodo and sam are introduced to the mysterious gollum, who attempts to attack the hobbits in their sleep to regain the ring. instead, gollum and frodo kindle a special relationship since they both harbor a certain addiction to the ring's power. frodo's elijah wood is the most effective actor in 'two towers' as he is gradually taken more and more over by the ring and it's awesome strength. gollum becomes frodo and sam's guide to mordor, as he has been there before. gollum's intentions, though, are never clear to the hobbits - neither are they to gollum. these three strands of story form a massive, thoroughly effective, epic tale of nature vs. machine, creature vs. creature and, through frodo, man vs. himself. the encompassing story leads to a heroic battle sequence fought on two fronts, while all the time we wonder how long frodo can hold on to his sanity as the ring slowly takes power over him. the pacing, which was an issue with 'fellowship,' is not problematic at all the second time around. the three stories are told in a manner that flows right through the three hour+ tale. one problem that persists is that 'two towers' is largely unaffected by the humanity other than frodo's saga. there is love between aragorn and arwen, eowyn also shows up as a romantic character. her father, theoden, is a courageous man but flawed psychologically. there exists connections between these many characters and more but they all feel half baked and cast aside to make more room for fighting. still, 'the two towers' is enormously successful as a narrative and even more ambitious than 'fellowship' visually. the score, by howard shore, is among the very best ever composed. the evil orcs and uruk-hai never look fake and evoke terror in the characters and in the audience. i still yearn for a more personal story, but in other realms of film-making, peter jackson and those under his command have outdone themselves. ***.5 out of ****";12 February 2005;8;['first', 'fine', 'massive', 'redundant', 'unnecessary', 'hard', 'evil', 'gimli', 'small', 'successful', 'complex', 'first', 'many', 'middle', 'many', 'concerned', 'new', 'large', 'concerned', 'destructive', 'gimli', 'separate', 'middle', 'special', 'first', 'deep', 'true', 'aragorn', 'mortal', 'distant', 'mysterious', 'special', 'certain', 'effective', 'awesome', 'clear', 'massive', 'effective', 'epic', 'heroic', 'long', 'problematic', 'second', 'unaffected', 'other', 'romantic', 'theoden', 'courageous', 'flawed', 'many', 'more', 'baked', 'more', 'successful', 'ambitious', 'good', 'evil', 'uruk', 'fake', 'personal', 'other'];0.1092698118208322
602;mithilbhoras-103-581296;honestly, i was scared that the movie will go down after fellowship's great success. i felt the same before watching aliens, bourne 2, pirates of the caribbean 2, etc. but, they made it... the first part only had a single story line. this time there are many things happening at once. in this part, the tension is raised. more characters are introduced who will play crucial roles in the next part. the feeling of hope, despair and absence of lost ones was captured very beautifully in this movie as though there is a continuous flow of energy. this movie enhances these feelings and we get attached to the characters. this movie is also rich in imagery. each and every character is given equal importance, not just frodo and sam, as they too are a part of this war. this movie is also well-known for gollum: the double-minded creature who is stuck in a to-be-or-not-to-be state. he is the character who does poetic justice to the book and keeps the thrill never-ending. but with gollum, we have the prowess of saruman and the evil gaze of sauron. these two stand tall on their towers (hence the title) creating a massive army which would result in explosive endings in the current and next installment. nevertheless, two towers is better, bigger and more stronger. i promise, you will be left spellbound... 10/10;23 October 2011;10;['scared', 'great', 'same', 'first', 'single', 'many', 'more', 'crucial', 'next', 'continuous', 'rich', 'equal', 'double', 'minded', 'poetic', 'evil', 'tall', 'massive', 'explosive', 'current', 'next', 'well', 'big', 'strong'];0.1201058201058201

614;daninthemix;once again peter jackson manages the not-inconsiderable feat of making 3+ hours pass in the blink of an eye. before i go all googly-eyed over this film, the few negatives must be got out of the way: still too many extreme close-ups and flash cuts in the battle scenes which don't really communicate anything besides the general impression of violence and aggression that is already brought forth by the build ups (one of this films and the predecessor's great strengths btw). aragorn and gimli's continual hurling of themselves on swathes of orcs and each time coming out unscathed. it does become a tad ridiculous after a while. the lack of the enormous female spider which i was expecting to turn up...this would have been one of my most anticipated moments, but i guess i'm gonna have to wait another year because the dividers between books two and three have not been respected, which is fine i guess - compared to this, the third book is lean on action. ....that's it actually. now... golem. he's astounding. i don't think i've ever seen a human create such an emotional and convincing performance of a person wrestling between their good and bad sides. i still don't believe it. the sheer scale has been ramped up immeasurably, as races join together against their common foe. whereas a balrog or cave troll might be a major foe in the first, here thousands of orcs are the enemy, bringing a welcome expression of vastness to the saga. the ents are superb - funny, and implemented at least as well as could be expected (probably much more so). there may be a tendancy for some to look at them and go 'well it's obviously digital' but that's not the point. the chracterisation and momentum they bring to the story is what matters. the interleaving of the three main plot strands (frodo/aragorn and co/merry, pippin and the ents) is handled in an awesomely inspired manner. the rythmical moving back and forth between these stories is almost digital in it's precision, and yet so, so, effective at driving the story forward (this is certainly one main reason why three hours seems like 25 minutes). anyway, i've wibbled on enough. this is the best film i have ever seen, and i simply can't want till return of the king...;20 December 2002;10;['inconsiderable', 'eyed', 'few', 'many', 'extreme', 'close', 'general', 'great', 'continual', 'unscathed', 'ridiculous', 'enormous', 'female', 'anticipated', 'fine', 'third', 'lean', 'astounding', 'human', 'emotional', 'convincing', 'good', 'bad', 'sheer', 'common', 'major', 'first', 'welcome', 'superb', 'funny', 'least', 'digital', 'main', 'co', 'inspired', 'rythmical', 'digital', 'effective', 'main', 'enough', 'good'];0.1807795698924731

619;sdillon-1;contains possible spoilers the second film in peter jackson's epic adaptation of jrr tolkien's classic trilogy the lord of the rings is every bit as much a triumph as the first. wisely eschewing the 'previously-on-the lord of the rings' type nonsense that so often wastes valuable screen time in such works, jackson literally hurls you straight back into the plot, as gandalf battles the balrog in a stunning opening duel. some have criticised this lack of a re-cap as being insensitive to those who haven't read the book or seen the first film. however, i've no sympathy for anyone who's not done at least one of those two. anyone coming to the two towers with no previous knowledge would soon get hopelessly lost in any case. the plot follows threes strands. first and foremost, it concerns frodo and sam's journey to mordor as they attempt to put and end to the ring. they are guided by the ring's previous owner gollum, a twisted, demented creature coming across like a schizophrenic drug addict. in the second plotline, human aragorn, elf legolas, and dwarf gimli search for the other hobbits captured by uruk-hai in the previous installment. along the way they enter the land of rohan and help its beleaguered king theoden fight saruman's evil army of uruk-hai. the third plot strand follows the plight of hobbits pippin and merry (whom aragorn and his companions seek) as they escape the uruk-hai and befriend the mysterious ent treebeard, a walking talking tree. given the extreme difficulty in adapting the two towers as a film, peter jackson has done an incredible job creating a coherent film. he wisely opted to end the film short of where the book ends (the latter chapters of the book will take place in the third film). certain elements of the book he has tweaked (most notably the character of faramir, boromir's brother) to, in my opinion, good effect. performance wise, the high standard set by the first film continues. all the characters from the first film are just as good, if not better here. new characters theoden (the splendid bernard hill), eowyn (mirando otto) and faramir (david wenham) are all brilliantly brought to live. worthy of special mention is the fantastic rendering of gollum, without doubt the best cgi character ever created. the special effects continue to stun. i always thought the army of ents storming isengard would be impossible to put on film - i was wrong. also, the battle of helms deep is a triumph - a stunning battle which more than lives up to its counterpart in the book. the production design, editing, sound and cinematography are as impressive as ever. howard shore's score is nothing less than a work of genius in its own right. from the heroic rohan theme to the melancholic and haunting gollum's song, this is an unparalleled work. less immediately showy than fellowship's themes (some of which are briefly reprised here) this ultimately gets under one's skin more than the music of the first film (no mean feat). all in all, this is another triumph. darker and more action packed than its predecessor, the two towers is a great continuation of a great story, and a wonderful, heroic epic. it's weighty themes of immortality, betrayal, genocide, temptation and sacrifice and nicely balanced by a great sense of humour that runs throughout. gimli provides a lot of laughs, and one line by treebeard (surprisingly not in tolkien's book) offers a wonderfully bizarre but true observation - 'i always like going south. somehow it feels like going downhill.' quite.;25 July 2003;10;['possible', 'second', 'epic', 'classic', 'first', 'valuable', 'such', 'gandalf', 'stunning', 'insensitive', 'first', 'least', 'previous', 'previous', 'twisted', 'schizophrenic', 'second', 'human', 'gimli', 'other', 'previous', 'beleaguered', 'theoden', 'evil', 'third', 'mysterious', 'extreme', 'incredible', 'coherent', 'short', 'latter', 'third', 'certain', 'good', 'high', 'first', 'first', 'good', 'well', 'new', 'worthy', 'special', 'fantastic', 'good', 'special', 'impossible', 'wrong', 'stunning', 'impressive', 'less', 'own', 'heroic', 'melancholic', 'unparalleled', 'less', 'showy', 'first', 'mean', 'dark', 'more', 'great', 'great', 'wonderful', 'heroic', 'weighty', 'great', 'treebeard', 'bizarre', 'true'];0.1984363404452689
620;Hanichi;"warning: spoilers are present, however if you have read down the comments this far, you already know everything about the movie. first, off let me say that i have read the books at least 10 times in my life. my entire imaginative life has been molded by tolkein's marvelous world. second, let me say that i really enjoyed this movie, and i give it a 9 out of 10, same as the first film. it is not perfect, but it is really good. now to the meat of my comments. many of the commenters, i have noticed have repeatedly bemoaned the changes made in the film. and there are a fair number of them. the big question though,as a tolkein fan, should be ""did peter jackson change the story?"" anyone who has ever seriously considered what it takes to adapt a book into a film has to realize that some things will be different. elements that work very well in writing are impossible to translate to the screen. visual elements take a much more prominent place relative to dialogue and plot. the film must be adapted for the amount of time available (and jackson is lucky he was allowed 3 hours). also, every single person who has read and enjoyed tolkein's work has a picture in their mind of every character and a movie in their head of every scene. it is impossible to satisfy all of these diverse viewers with every aspect of the movie. someone will be disappointed with something. therefore, alterations were inevitable. so, did jackson change the story? in my opinion, he didn't. he did change elements of the story, and on the whole they were changed for the worse. some that work well: * cutting out several extra and essentially unnecessary characters and replacing them with other more important characters where necessary (i.e., erkenbrand replaced with eomer, in much the same way the glorfindel was axed to make way for arwen.) * intercutting the various storylines from the book so that all resolve at the same time. * altering the exact ending and beginning of the film from the book. as long as minas morgul, shelob, and the breaking of saruman's staff are in at the beginning of return of the king, i think the changes jackson made end up with a better movie. * the whole gunpowder blowing up the wall bit. i thought is was interesting and exciting. * the cool bit at the black gate with the elf chameleon cloaks. * gimli as stand up comic. some that are ambivalent or unnecessary, but don't really make much difference in the end.: * having elves show up at helm's deep. if he had to bring someone else in, it would have been better if he brought in the rangers of the north early. * throwing a warg attack in for fun. the wargs were the least believable cgi in the film, but you got to see legolas do that cool quick mount on gimli's horse, so it was worth it. * more arwen bits. liv tyler does a passable job, but the storyline really feels tacked on. * aragorn's whole near death experience. many that were bad: * faramir really is a completely different and much less likeable character. * no mention of how faramir knew that boromir was dead. * ditto on theoden. * no ent draughts? how are pippin and merry supposed to get tall in return of the king? * elrond as manipulative father. * frodo and sam dragged off to osgiliath to be seen by the nazgul and then set free by faramir the reformed bully. however, i have to say that all of these items are details. the fundamentals of the story really remain unchanged. i hope and believe that many of the bad bits will be corrected in the next film; faramir will end up cool, theoden will go down as a true hero, pippin and merry will end up big, etc. but even if they don't, none of these changes ruin it for me. he got a lot of details wrong, but he also go a lot absolutely right: * shadowfax running across the heath at gandalf's whistle. * gollum/smeagol, one of the most pathetic, compelling characters i have ever seen in a movie. * treebeard's eyes and face. * everything about eowyn (i get goosebumps picturing her throwing off her helmet before the lord of the nazgul, her straw blonde hair blowing in the wind.) as i look at the chapter titles in my copy of the two towers, i note that every major story element not already covered in the first film is covered in the second film, up to chapter 8 in book iii and chapter 6 in book iv. as long as the remaining chapters are covered well in the next film, then i would say he did well. and thats really the crux of it all. if return of the king doesn't cover some of the important material left out of this movie, and correct a few of the more egregious bad changes, then i might have to revise my rating of this film. however, hope springs eternal, so the bottom line is that while jackson made changes, for bad or for worse, i don't think he ever took liberties. one last comment: what is the deal with all the people who read a homoerotic subtext into the movies? i think that the relationship between sam and frodo is one of the best adapted parts of the films. look, get it through your heads that these are two hobbits who love each other, in a deep, committed way that has absolutely nothing to do with sex. it comes through so clearly in both the books and the movie. i find the whole aspect of friendship in the books and movies to be one of the most compelling aspects. i, for one, find it wonderful to learn about a relationship between two men that doesn't consist of either superficial back-slapping comradery or sex, but of profound friendship. the friendships between sam and frodo, between merry and pippin, between gimli and legolas; these are the relationships that bring a richness to the work. a very touching and moving film about homosexual attraction could certainly be made, and probably has been, but this isn't it. man, i apparently had a lot more to say then i thought. i wonder if anyone will actually read this.";19 December 2002;9;['present', 'entire', 'imaginative', 'marvelous', 'same', 'first', 'perfect', 'good', 'many', 'fair', 'big', 'tolkein', 'different', 'impossible', 'visual', 'prominent', 'relative', 'available', 'lucky', 'single', 'impossible', 'diverse', 'inevitable', 'bad', 'several', 'extra', 'unnecessary', 'other', 'important', 'necessary', 'same', 'various', 'same', 'exact', 'well', 'whole', 'interesting', 'exciting', 'cool', 'black', 'gimli', 'comic', 'ambivalent', 'unnecessary', 'much', 'deep', 'well', 'believable', 'quick', 'worth', 'more', 'passable', 'whole', 'many', 'bad', 'different', 'likeable', 'dead', 'tall', 'manipulative', 'free', 'unchanged', 'many', 'bad', 'next', 'cool', 'theoden', 'true', 'big', 'wrong', 'right', 'pathetic', 'compelling', 'blonde', 'major', 'first', 'second', 'next', 'important', 'few', 'egregious', 'bad', 'eternal', 'bottom', 'bad', 'bad', 'last', 'homoerotic', 'other', 'deep', 'whole', 'compelling', 'wonderful', 'superficial', 'profound', 'gimli', 'touching', 'homosexual', 'more'];0.0927441229656419

629;xenolupa;after i saw the movie in cinema, i gave it a score of 9. yesterday i got the extended edition, 4 dvd box set, as a gift, and enjoyed the 214 minutes of film. i agree with many others that this was the version i want to have seen in cinema. i don't mind sitting 214 minutes in my chair. it is a shame that so many parts were cut out in the original release, like merry and pippin being swallowed by old man willow, the moving of the forest to help rohan, the eating of the orcs by this forest, the funeral of theodred, the part where eowyn founds out the real age of aragorn, and much much more. this version of the movie makes more sense, more things are explained, the story is more comprehensible and logical. and above all that, the scenes that were cut out are often magnificent, in themselves better than many complete movies i've seen. the characters, the special effects, the sets, the paintings, the armory, the humor, the biting similarities with the real sad history of the world, the overwhelming music and the beautiful views of new zealand nature: this movie contains a lot of wonderful movies, more action than most action movies, more emotions than most dramas, more story developments than most fiction movies. i re-voted and now gave a 10 for two towers. it is one of the best movies i've ever seen and i am certainly going to see this many times. i really look forward to return of the king. i've read somewhere that it will be over 3 hours in cinema and over 6 hours on the extended edition. next month i will join the marathon session in my local cinema, watching all three movies in a row. this is the best thing ever happened to cinema!;23 November 2003;10;['extended', 'many', 'many', 'original', 'old', 'real', 'more', 'more', 'more', 'comprehensible', 'logical', 'magnificent', 'many', 'complete', 'special', 'biting', 'real', 'sad', 'overwhelming', 'beautiful', 'wonderful', 'more', 'most', 'more', 'most', 'more', 'most', 'good', 'many', 'extended', 'next', 'local', 'good'];0.4404336734693877

637;Squirelly Joe;if you're going to see this movie, please be sure to watch fellowship of the ring (or reading the book works too). there is no reminiscence of the first, save for the opening scene that is shown in a different perspective than in fellowship. the movie cuts right to the action, much like the books, because of the mere fact that its just 1 big, long, continuing story. all 3 of the movies/books could fit hand in hand without interuptions and would still flow smoothly if it was shown all in 1 sitting. the mere title of the two towers caused a considerable ammount of commotion, with a lot of people thinking that it had a sort of reference to 9/11. those are the kind of people who didn't know that the books were written over 50 years ago, still sporting the same title. however, the title stuck and the controversy has quieted down to maybe the avid ranter still complaining about it. if, by chance, you are that person, there's a little thing we people call 'acceptance'. figure it out. acting: 11/10 the acting is still straight on and well depicted. the introduction of an extremely large variety of characters in 1 movie was nicely done, and didn't put a restrain on the film. that pairing of actors with their roles was superb, aside from the character change of faramir, however, i didn't mind it much and liked the changes. once again, to any ranter reading this, the word acceptance pops up again. the original cast still holds true to their characters. bernard hill did a great performance in this movie as theoden. i'm surprised he wasn't nominated. only a few actresses could play eowyn, and mirando otto is one of them, and struck the character right on. opposite to eowyn is eomer, played by karl urban. despite the lack of line's and appearance in the film in comparison to the others, he still played his part well. faramir, played by david wenham, had some of the most well spoken lines in the film, and portrayed his role well even though it was changed from the book, but it does make sense, considering he is one of the character's brother from fellowship. then we get to gollum, the tormented creature driven mad by the ring. gollum alone crosses over to new boundaries in both acting and computer animation. i could write a whole paragraph on gollum, but i won't. andy serkis deserved best actor. story: 10/10 the same story as fellowship of the ring, seeing as how its all a continuation, but now there's a twist. the two towers, which the title is named after meaning the towers of orthanc and barad-dur, have officialy united in saruman's and sauron's assault to rule middle-earth. the war begins in rohan, where aragorn, gimli, and legolas still pursue the uruk-hai who captured merry and pippin. music: 9/10 while the movie, in a retrospective view of fellowship, is considerably darker, the music as well ties in with this darker theme, and tends to get darker as the story progresses. there are some moments which the darkness subsides for a while and a little bit of light shines through. when the sad feeling of despare overcomes the screen, the music ties in perfectly. when the battle begins, the music is there and sounds just right. however, it doesn't end with the emotional song fellowship ended with. now it ends on a sad, depressing note with gollum's song. visual effects: 10/10 once again, the massive program is put to full use in this. the masses upon masses of uruk-hai are all so real, its threatening. the ents are amazing, however, the occasional twitchy movements of the ents makes it seem that massive had a little glitch in it. final score: 40/40 one word review: amazing;30 March 2003;10;['sure', 'first', 'opening', 'different', 'mere', 'big', 'long', 'mere', 'considerable', 'same', 'avid', 'little', 'large', 'superb', 'original', 'true', 'great', 'theoden', 'surprised', 'few', 'opposite', 'eomer', 'tormented', 'mad', 'new', 'whole', 'good', 'same', 'middle', 'gimli', 'retrospective', 'dark', 'dark', 'dark', 'little', 'sad', 'right', 'emotional', 'sad', 'depressing', 'visual', 'massive', 'full', 'real', 'amazing', 'occasional', 'twitchy', 'massive', 'little', 'final', 'amazing'];0.0610200845665962
638;kdladage;"in my review of the first installment in this trilogy, i wrote: -----=====----- it has been tossed around in hollywood for a long time. the very idea of making a big-budget feature film of the timeless novels is intoxicating. but how do you create a film that is true to the stories (and thus not going to upset the legions of rabid fans that can practically quote the books from start to finish) and still make a film that will attract the non-rabid fan who has vaguely heard of the existence of these books by some author from world war i? -----=====----- well, once again, i do not claim to be a rabid fan (i read the books, i liked the books, and have felt for a long time that they could make a good movie). i also do not claim to be some sort of insider that can give someone the secret to the process that lead to this masterpiece. just as with the first installment, the cast, crew, writers, producers, and very talented director managed to tell a very good version of the second book's tale... ...as an adaptation, and as a stand-alone movie, i give this an ""8/10"" -- but as the bridge between fellowship and return... this movie is nearly flawless. the only faults i found in the movie deal with the story of faramir. had the story of boromir been actually told in the fellowship, then this butchering of the faramir tale would not have been needed. still, it manages to recover in the end from this failing and tell what is an engaging (if not a bit confusing) story of the path that the ring takes... despite this one small shortcoming, the film is a fantastic piece of work that i highly recommend to anyone and everyone. but: i recommend that you watch the extended cut dvd version, and that you plan to sit down for all three films -- because this is not (technically) a stand-alone film. it is just act 2 of a 3 act screenplay.";30 June 2005;9;['first', 'long', 'very', 'big', 'timeless', 'true', 'rabid', 'non', 'rabid', 'rabid', 'long', 'good', 'first', 'talented', 'good', 'second', 'alone', 'flawless', 'only', 'engaging', 'confusing', 'small', 'fantastic', 'extended', 'alone'];0.25625
639;Bottlebrush;having seen fotr and loved it - the acting, the scenery, the sets, and the fact that the film captured the spirit of tolkien, i was desperate to see ttt. i knew that it was going to be changed from the book more than fotr had been, but didn't know that it was going to be changed to the extent that it was. 1. the nauseating 'arwen' inclusion is a disaster. it has nothing to do with tolkien, however romantic and 'beautiful' they tried to make the scenes, and despite the fact that they had hugo weaving's seductive voice in one of them (in point of fact that was the only scene with 'arwen' that bore a remote resemblance to tolkien, i.e. the appendix). putting this virtually new character into the film has meant that various changes were made which took away from much needed time that could have been used to explore the real tolkien story. for instance, why have the warg fight - just so that aragorn could fall over a cliff and have 'arwen' change into a horse over him? it was totally unnecessary to change tolkien's storyline - the original story is brilliant enough in itself. and why does 'arwen' appear everywhere in the promotional stuff - is she being used to promote the film? the main characters in the story are far more important, and they are who most people feel is important to the story, and want to see. 2. why did eomer disappear for virtually the whole film? why was treebeard - supposedly the oldest and wisest being in middle-earth - portrayed as stupid? where was the noble faramir? why wasn't there more of gandalf, who is the figure around which everything turns? where were the wonderful huorns, and all the action involving them, which we were so much looking forward to? why was there so little about the hobbits, who with gandalf are the main characters in tolkien's lotr? none of this is the fault of the actors, because the casting for the film is excellent - it is great that they used mostly british, new zealand and australian actors who weren't known 'movie stars', which would have completely ruined the film. it is to do with the way the story was rewritten. certainly there are brilliant things in the film - gollum, gandalf leading the charge on shadowfax at the end of the film, the three running at the beginning of the film, the horses, edoras, helm's deep, the marching uruk hai, new zealand as middle earth, the costumes, among other things . . . but it would have been so much better if the story had been stuck to. the changes just seem so pointless, and i've heard far more criticism than praise for them. i really, really hope rotk will go back to the books, but think this may be a forlorn hope - for one thing, i don't know how they could squash everything in from ttt that wasn't included in the film, and still do rotk justice.;3 July 2003;10;['desperate', 'more', 'romantic', 'beautiful', 'seductive', 'only', 'remote', 'new', 'various', 'much', 'real', 'unnecessary', 'original', 'brilliant', 'promotional', 'main', 'important', 'most', 'important', 'whole', 'treebeard', 'old', 'wise', 'middle', 'stupid', 'noble', 'more', 'wonderful', 'little', 'main', 'excellent', 'great', 'british', 'australian', 'brilliant', 'deep', 'middle', 'other', 'well', 'pointless', 'more', 'rotk', 'forlorn', 'rotk'];0.229491341991342

645;Science_Fantasy_Guy;"(click on my name for part one) okay, that's that. now for some deconstruction. first, to the visual side of the lord of the rings. visually, it is indeed ravishing in every sense of the word. its scale and technological wonders make it heaven on your eyes, and in every frame there are so many beautiful things to look at that with every viewing you notice something there that you never noticed before (something that defines any true classic). the design is so richly detailed and by turns shimmeringly beautiful and powerfully arresting that you feel like you can just reach into the screen and touch the rainforest treetops of rivendell or lothlorien, or smell the gritty underbelly of the almost dystopic caverns of isengard. much of this is due to the many spectacular new zealand locations on which the movie was filmed indeed, jackson's choices of locations were so beneficial overall to new zealand's tourism industry that then-new zealand prime minister helen clark stated, ""peter jackson has done more for new zealand's tourism industry than any man since captain cook!"" still on the visual aspect of the lord of the rings, overshadowing the sets and costumes are the indisputably awe-inspiring special effects. they have the same effect as the sets and costumes, however they overpower other technical aspects of the production when we learn there was much more at stake with the special effects. and the special effects are, it must be said, nothing less than special. in fact, what am i saying? to merely write them off as ""special"" is both an understatement and an injustice. it's almost as if peter jackson has made a 3-d movie that you don't need to watch while wearing those stupid glasses, to get the adrenaline rush that 3-d brings. the dragon firework; frodo's blurred and almost otherworldly vision when he puts on the one ring; the dormant demon erupting out of cate blanchett's queen galadriel when she sees the ring; the river flooding isengard to the ground; mount doom blowing its top and the tower of orthanc collapsing to the ground, causing an earthquake after the destruction of the ring; and the afore-mentioned showdown on the bridge of khazad-dum to name but a few. all become indelibly etched in your memory forever. and then there's gollum (played to sheer perfection by andy serkis), the first completely lifelike (if that's the right adjective to use in relation to a non-human character) computer-generated character ever committed to celluloid. gollum was the main reason as to just why the realism of the visuals in the lord of the rings was so critical to the outcome, especially in the two towers and the return of the king, because he is the character through which the story's moral of how power corrupts is delivered. visually, the lord of the rings is, to put it lightly, a dream come true. another visual plus is andrew lesnie's exhilarating cinematography indeed, the effectiveness of the picturesque new zealand locations in the overall look of the movie has a great deal to do with his camera and he deserved every gram of the academy award he won for fellowship. two photographic shots in the entire piece that never fail to leave me awestruck are the tracking shot of the butterfly flying along the caverns of isengard then up and over the tower of orthanc (despite that shot being mostly computer-generated) and the haunting mise-en-scene (following arwen's (liv tyler) vision of aragorn's (viggo mortensen) passing) of leaves floating over aragorn's casket to show the withering passage of time. sublime. click on my name for part three!";12 January 2008;10;['visual', 'technological', 'heaven', 'many', 'beautiful', 'true', 'detailed', 'beautiful', 'rainfor', 'lothlorien', 'gritty', 'dystopic', 'much', 'due', 'many', 'spectacular', 'beneficial', 'more', 'visual', 'special', 'same', 'other', 'technical', 'more', 'special', 'special', 'less', 'special', 'special', 'stupid', 'adrenaline', 'blurred', 'dormant', 'few', 'first', 'lifelike', 'right', 'non', 'human', 'main', 'critical', 'moral', 'true', 'visual', 'picturesque', 'overall', 'great', 'photographic', 'entire', 'sublime'];0.2103174603174602

'elf-girl' indeed. as to the movie, i can only say... wow. i've read lotr about five or six times in the past ten years, and i've dabbled into the lore of tolkien quite a bit, and peter jacksons alterations are, to the contrary of what many purists say, merely trivial in the grand scheme of things. they do not detract from the story, they just make it more dramatic. see, in condensing a 1000 page book into 9-9.5 hours of movie, you're bound to have to spice some things up, and omit others: you don't have 50 pages plus 50 more in appendix f to explain why the elves are leaving, and to justify it, hence they'd seem terribly obnoxious, if not cowardly, if they just kept heading west. thus, they come to the humans' aid in ttt. arwen and aragorn get married in rotk, and the audience would be pretty surprised at her arrival if she only showed up in act 4 of movie 3. theoden king can't hurry off to helm's deep to bravely fight the orc army while the rohirrim peasants head off to dunharrow - it's near impossible to explain on screen why the orcs don't just march past said helm's deep and sack dunharrow. and you'd have even more cuts between various locations, confusing the uninitiated to great lenghts. faramir is less nice than in the book because, in the book, he's as nondramatic a character as can be. shows up, let's frodo go. you can't not have faramir, to stay true to the book, but you can't have him act exactly the same or you'll risk people falling asleep over the lack of any drama or tension in the whole encounter. lastly, the movie ends just a bit before the book ends in order to avoid overcomplicating the story, and totally destroying the pacing of the narrative. 'yay, victory, now, before the credits, let's march to isengard and talk to two hobbits looting saruman's warehouse, smoking old toby'. 'lest the audience thinks the film is over, we'll have sam and frodo meet their last great foe before getting to mount doom, conveniently making return of the king a 1.5 hour documentary on two hobbits walking slowly towards a volcano'. not to mention that one of the major villains (saruman), has to be disposed of somehow, and since the scouring of the shire would be the epitome of cinematic anticlimax, it's going to have to be done in isengard, which adds even more importance to the other half of the fellowship (who are, might i add, getting together with merry and pippin again) going to orthanc, and seriously, you can't add all that to the end of a two towers movie, after the incredibly well done helm's deep siege. it just doesn't work. everyone who says they know how to make a better screen adaptation than peter jackson, while keeping truer to the book, please write a screenplay, act it out with the help of storyboards, and time your effort. you'll get a 5 hour movie which would make maybe 50 million worldwide, theatrically. wait for the extended edition, and wait for return of the king before you pass judgement. all i can do for my own part is thank heavens for the genius of peter jackson et al. these movies are the greatest piece of cinema ever made, bar none.";17 January 2003;10;['mild', 'pointless', 'past', 'many', 'trivial', 'grand', 'dramatic', 'more', 'obnoxious', 'aragorn', 'rotk', 'surprised', 'theoden', 'deep', 'impossible', 'deep', 'more', 'various', 'uninitiated', 'great', 'nice', 'nondramatic', 'true', 'same', 'asleep', 'whole', 'old', 'last', 'great', 'major', 'cinematic', 'more', 'other', 'deep', 'well', 'extended', 'own', 'great'];0.197172619047619

661;emeeme2003;"the two towers can hardly be called a ""sequel"" in the traditional hollywood sense, as it's the middle part of the story that fellowship began, but however you label it, i feel that ttt is one of the best examples of it around... whatever ""it"" may be. ahem. anyway, part of the film's success is due to its status as a middle chapter, leaving it free to explore its part of the saga's story without worrying about the heavy weight of world-introduction that weighed down its predecessor at times, or the occasionally redundant post-victory wrapup of return of the king. granted, towers does drag ever so slightly during its midsection, but considering its three hour length, necessary in order for peter jackson to adapt tolkien's rich, epic mythology (with enough still left over to create an extended edition), i can easily overlook that in light of all the great fantasy entertainment we get in return, and even viewed on a ten inch tablet screen, ttt is still one of the most epic things i've ever had the pleasure of watching. in towers, as the now-fractured fellowship journeys ever closer to the dark land of mordor, the battle for middle earth officially becomes an all-out war, with an even larger scale and action setpieces to match, introducing us to new lands as they are inevitably sucked into the war of the ring. however, pj refuses to allow the scope of the film to swallow up its personal element, or resort to relying on stock fantasy roles, as all the new characters here are fully fleshed-out individuals with their own unique problems and desires, and, as the new characters come into the story, jackson doesn't forget to continue the arcs for the old players, in a natural, compelling manner. the devil's in the details, and all the fantasy nonsense in the world wouldn't be worth anything if we didn't care about the characters caught in the middle, but we do, and although there's way too many of them to write about in detail, the multitude of smaller character moments included here ultimately keeps us engaged and invested in the larger struggle at hand. but, as far as the epic fantasy aspects of ttt go, the movie certainly doesn't skimp on that either, expanding on the world & mythology of middle earth brilliantly, hinting at a tragic, deeper history for a certain former hobbit, bringing an undiscovered army of walking, talking trees into the fray, and resurrecting a previously thought-to-be deceased mentor from the dead in an unexpected twist. it's certainly a ton to unpack, but jackson & company do so superbly, and tone-wise, towers keeps things fresh by taking on a surprisingly violent war movie tint, as the armies of men and their allies fight to beat back the forces of sauron that are devastating the land, climaxing in a stormy, chaotic, absolutely grueling battle at the fortress of helm's deep. the battle of helm's deep is certainly a marathon, but never feels pointless or repetitive, and is extremely well-structured, as the overall progress of the clash is signified by easily identifiable turning points, which never get delayed amongst the chaos, and in all the epic battles in cinematic history, it's one of the biggest and certainly one of the best of them as well, only outdone (possibly) by one in the next installment of rings. in all of this, towers is definitely a darker film than its predecessor, often quite literally so, with many scenes set at night, as cinematographer andrew lesnie providing some of the bluest, most striking nighttime footage i've witnessed since terminator 2, which serve as a great contrast to the sweeping, daytime landscape shots, which make perfect use of the beautiful new zealand scenery as middle earth, as howard shore's soaring, triumphant themes boom at us. along with these literal rays of light, the thematic glimmers of hope in ttt are what help keep our heads up amongst all the crushing darkness, and give us that special rush of magic that only grand fantasy can provide. installment, sequel, whatever you want to call this, bottom line, the battle for middle-earth begins right here; join, or die.";5 July 2021;9;['traditional', 'middle', 'good', 'due', 'middle', 'free', 'heavy', 'redundant', 'post', 'victory', 'necessary', 'rich', 'epic', 'enough', 'extended', 'great', 'epic', 'fractured', 'dark', 'middle', 'large', 'new', 'personal', 'new', 'own', 'unique', 'new', 'old', 'natural', 'compelling', 'worth', 'many', 'small', 'large', 'epic', 'middle', 'tragic', 'deep', 'certain', 'former', 'undiscovered', 'deceased', 'dead', 'unexpected', 'fresh', 'violent', 'stormy', 'chaotic', 'grueling', 'deep', 'pointless', 'repetitive', 'overall', 'identifiable', 'epic', 'cinematic', 'big', 'good', 'next', 'dark', 'many', 'blue', 'striking', 'nighttime', 'great', 'sweeping', 'daytime', 'perfect', 'beautiful', 'middle', 'triumphant', 'literal', 'thematic', 'special', 'grand', 'installment', 'bottom', 'middle'];0.1352272727272727

669;Angel-Shadow;like its two counterparts i find it almost impossible to give this lower than a ten. i would say however that this is the worst of the three but worst is not a word i like to use when dealing with such an amazing film. the two towers is unsurprisingly visually stunning in every respect and we see the first motion capture technology put in to film using gollum. after producing a outstanding wonderfully filmed first instalment peter jackson had to follow up with something truly stunning, he did. the two towers follows of from where the fellowship left off and brings the film to the forefront with spellbinding special effects. the film follows the split up members of the fellowship and charts their journeys through middle earth all in the hope to do the most impossible of tasks and destroy the ring. mortensen, bloom, mckellen , wood and sean austin along with all other actors involved are again nothing short of perfect in portraying their characters to tell the story. the two towers was the one film that we anticipated for a whole year and we were not let down with something as intricate and gripping as it was. considering everything else in the film it is andy serkis that steals the show for the two towers in my view presenting the character of gollum in such an amazing way that you again become lost in the story. to add to the already finely done scenes before it jackson produces the unforgettable battle of helms deep. this is without a doubt where the two towers became most gripping, emotive and visually stunning and the way it unfolds is truly, truly brilliant helping the 2nd instalment roll into the third. the two towers may in essence not be as good as amon hen and moria in the fellowship or the ride of the rohirrim in the return of the king but i feel it is still a true masterpiece of film making and kept the trilogy as strong as ever. the two towers in my view deserves nothing less than 10/10.;11 February 2006;10;['impossible', 'low', 'bad', 'bad', 'amazing', 'stunning', 'first', 'outstanding', 'first', 'stunning', 'special', 'middle', 'impossible', 'other', 'short', 'perfect', 'whole', 'intricate', 'amazing', 'unforgettable', 'deep', 'gripping', 'emotive', 'stunning', 'brilliant', 'good', 'true', 'strong', 'less'];0.2190917107583774
670;ejh-60622;i think i've always seen this as the best one in the trilogy. at least i've seen it the most times. the excitement and tension before the battle at helm's deep is one of the most memorable sequences in any film for me. the more i watch these movies i come to the realization that i practically just can't stand the scenes with frodo, sam and gollum though. their whole storyline from when they part with the fellowship at the end of the first movie is just so boring compared to everything else. of course it was intriguing the first time, but now i would just give it a 6/10 while the rest of the movie is 9/10.;21 January 2021;9;['good', 'least', 'most', 'deep', 'memorable', 'whole', 'first', 'boring', 'first'];0.1222222222222222
671;Aidy;the most fervent of lotr fans seem to be those who have read the books. having not read any tolkien i will have to review the movie as a film in its own right. although i have seen tfotr (which i gave 4/10) i still found ttt somewhat of an overload of characters, races and politics. if you like the books and you liked tfotr then there isn't any point in reading a review that doesn't declare ttt as the best movie ever...but for those fans of films i will try and point out the main flaws. the biggest problem for those not fans of the books is that we simply don't care about the characters and nothing is done to make us care. people are introduced to us and 10 minutes later when they are killed/revealed as having unrequited love/had their lands taken from them, we are actually supposed to care. but why would we? the other criticism would be the overuse of trying to make you believe that the main characters might actually die, only to reveal later on that *gosh* they haven't. to my count this was done three times and is rather cliche and boring. quite childish to be honest. to make it on its own strengths as a movie it needs to lose an hour at least, but i realise that would simply disgust people who avidly boast at the number of times they have read the books. i said about the first one what i'll say about this...if you need to have already read the books to like the movie and care about the characters then it is *not* a good movie, and this is not a good movie. i gave it 4/10 also. on the plus side, yes the scenery and computer effects were all wonderful. as were the effects in terminator 2 but i don't hear anyone claim that as being the best movie of all time. ttt is just childish nonsense that fails to appeal to children due to the running time and the fact that nothing really happens.;28 December 2002;4;['own', 'good', 'main', 'big', 'unrequited', 'other', 'main', 'boring', 'childish', 'honest', 'own', 'least', 'first', 'good', 'good', 'wonderful', 'good', 'childish'];0.2563725490196078
672;pandora8;the best thing about this movie is gollum. gollum has always been my favorite character in the books, and they did an amazing job with him. the movie itself is bla. i don't mind that it doesn't stand on its own as a movie (it is a series and the director shouldn't have to waste time reviewing), so i thought it was good to just jump into it. but it never quite jumps. it kind of skips, and then you have this feeling that it is about to fall. it adds things that aren't necessary (arwen and galadriel), and subtracts things that are important (deagle). it expands the battle of helm's deep into this huge thing, what peter jackson doesn't realize is that battles are so boring. wow more orcs attacking! the only time when battles are interesting is when you feel for both sides, and i'm sorry you can't feel for the orcs (now this is not peter jackson's fault but it is his fault to think that what the story needs is more battles). also i can't believe he actually put a bomb in it. the battles are my main problem but also he destroyed faramir's character, making him just like boromir, and i must admit to being in love with faramir in the book so i was just a little upset about that. where the movie really shot itself in the leg though is the ending (don't worry i won't tell you what happens). the end of the book is one of the most suspenceful moments in the book, i actually started the return of the king at book ii to find out what happened to frodo and sam. well the end of the movie is completely different from the book just ending the movie on a low note. eiowyn was cool and just how i imagined her though, so i'm happy about that. so you all probably hate me now for giving it a 3 star rating, but you guys are entitled to like it if you want (just not more than the original star wars trilogy which i think is heavily based on tolkien and actually is a better transfering of the books onto film).;22 December 2002;3;['good', 'favorite', 'amazing', 'bla', 'own', 'good', 'about', 'necessary', 'important', 'deep', 'huge', 'boring', 'only', 'interesting', 'sorry', 'more', 'main', 'little', 'upset', 'suspenceful', 'different', 'low', 'cool', 'happy', 'more', 'original', 'well'];0.2456439393939393
673;kg22384;i just finished reading about 20 reviews that praised this film to no end. i am astonished. please, take it back one and all. do not get me wrong, i'm not saying this was a terrible film, or even mediocre. it was a good film. stronger than most films. but it was so pale in comparison to the first one. fellowship cleverly blended action, epic grandeur, and down to earth emmotion. i felt like i knew the characters of the fellowship. so pete changed a few elements, it bettered the story. it flowed well. it was paced well. it gave us a chance to care for the characters and at the same time understand the intricacies of the plot of the film. this i was expecting from the two towers, and it seems like it was all thrown out the window, which baffles me since this film was shot interspersed with fellowship. towers suffers, in my opinion, from overkill in the postproduction sessions. whoever was helming this portion lost sight of how to treat an audience. i have not read the book, so i don't care about changes, i care about story structure. do i understand what is happening, do i get to know the people, do i care for them when they are in peril? this is all a product of pacing which i feel was sorely lopsided in this film. characters fundamentally changed. gimli was not comic relief in fellowship, why now? i wanted to breath more with eowyn. she seemed like such an amazingly strong character, but we're with her less than two minutes and she's crying and she's a mess and we're suppose to feel sorry for her, and i don't even know who she is. peter's strength of sticking with people in fellowship, of just giving them some conversation to let us trust the characters, to let us want to pull for them is lost in towers. it's cutticy cut all over the place. we never stay with a single shot for more than a few seconds. the scenes with frodo, sam and smeagol are the only ones i felt connected to the characters. i know this was a three hour film, but i think there was entirely to much time spent on setting up fight scenes and special effects. we understand there is a war coming. we can conclude that helm's deep is going to get it's booty kicked. we could have had half as much fighting building up to helm's deep and twice as much character development so that when the fighting happened, we really did care about the outcome and not whether this scene looks as real as the last one. another thing. this film had no structure. no beginning, no end. it was just three hours of middle. now i understand that it's the middle book, but it's still a movie unto itself. again, i just think whoever was in charge of post work was staring at it for so long, he was unable to objectively see whether or not the film was paced right, whether or not the characters were developing, whether or not character's introductions were faithful to the character's initial performance. i mean, thanks to poor editing, faramir was a joke. on a plus note, most of the acting was well done(although i do think editing is responsible for choosing some innappropriate moments of humor in the middle of an intensely dramatic scenes, which undermined any power the scenes may have had). of course, the 2 hours and 45 minutes of special effects are amazing(but we could have used less), and the music is spectacular-- kudos to howard shore for an amazing score, the theme for the people of rohan is breathtaking with it's keltic fiddles. so, people, don't empower pete. don't let him make the third film with even more special effects and less dialogue. we gotta make sure he's gonna give a spectacular closing chapter. let the characters become the center piece of the story once more. and it's up to us to tell him that. no more thoughtless praise of all the special effects. lets crack down. we want a good movie with people we care for. all of us together now.;21 December 2002;6;['wrong', 'terrible', 'mediocre', 'good', 'strong', 'most', 'pale', 'first', 'epic', 'few', 'same', 'gimli', 'comic', 'strong', 'less', 'sorry', 'cutticy', 'single', 'more', 'few', 'only', 'connected', 'much', 'special', 'deep', 'booty', 'much', 'deep', 'much', 'real', 'last', 'middle', 'unable', 'right', 'faithful', 'initial', 'poor', 'most', 'well', 'responsible', 'innappropriate', 'dramatic', 'special', 'amazing', 'keltic', 'third', 'more', 'special', 'less', 'sure', 'spectacular', 'thoughtless', 'special', 'good'];0.0886062717770034
674;cgfry;"i had some real concerns during the last half of the fellowship of the rings about how unrelentingly gruesome, dark, and finally tortuous the movie was. jackson never gave us a break. think about it: we go through moria with gandalf's apparent death; there's no joy in lothlorien; and then the agonizing-to-watch death of boromir. in the book, tolkien had us (and the characters) relax and wonder in lothlorien. then following the breakup of the fellowship, he gave us this funny scene with sam swimming after frodo, who'd just taken off in the canoe, even though they both knew he couldn't swim. it was a place to laugh with them at the great friendship they had. did jackson give tolkien his due, as one of the greatest storywriters of all time? would he simply use common sense, and know that the audience needed something cheerful to leave the movie with. no!! he gives us a slow-motion near-death experience with samwise. yuck!! so my worries kept coming back at me all year. even so, with spectacular special effects in moria, and some great story adjustments (with aragorn, in particular), i was very happy overall with the fellowship of the ring. unfortunately, the two towers shows jackson at his worst. not only is this movie unrelenting in being dark in appearance and in tone (gimli provides a few--far too few--upbeat moments), but now the story ""adjustments"" are way out in left field, and terribly done. as a huge tolkien fan, i won't be able to forgive jackson with this movie. i give the movie only 5/10; as a tolkien fan, i can say that it is only just bearable to watch. gollum was truly terrible. comparisons to the bbc radio production-- gollum is incredibly well done--leave us wondering how andy serkis could have landed the role in this movie. there is very little range in his voice. the animation, perhaps predictably (can anyone say jar jar binks?), does not help at all. the primary problem, as with the movie overall, is the nearly complete lack of humor in gollum's characterization; he comes off as completely unlikable-i find it hard to believe that anyone could even feel pity for him. jackson seems intent on making everything as gloomy and downcast as possible. very slow pacing doesn't help. spoilers in the first movie, ian mckellen was incredibly strong in his performance as gandalf. here he gets very little to work with, and bernard hill as theoden is a miserable substitute. hill's completely unnoteworthy performance was given no help with the screenplay. theoden is written in as a very weak character, hardly a king to admire or care for. for some reason, jackson decided all the other main characters should show weakness as well. aragorn is weak, not as a warrior, but in his relationship with arwen. in the first movie, this was somewhat acceptable as an excuse jackson invented to explain why aragorn had not assumed his heritage as the true king. aragorn's weakness there also helped in contrasting the strength of arwen, a very nice update from tolkien. but in the two tower's, jackson destroys all with arwen losing faith in her own decisions and love. so much that was positive in the first movie was destroyed here. dada says go to the grey havens, being mortal will be too tough for you, and off she goes! > faramir?!?! what the heck did jackson think he was doing here. this whole part of the movie takes a complete departure from tolkien. one of the main points of tolkien's faramir was to show that the wizard in gandalf and the numenor in aragorn still existed in the men of gondor. faramir was a promise that although many good things might fade away, perhaps even better things can come through to the future. the depiction of faramir in the two towers was a final nail in the coffin for me. if my family had not been with me, i might have gotten up and left the theater at that point. these fatal flaws in the screenplay were only compounded by some true silliness in the action. the powerful nazgul has a mighty flying stead (dragon-thing?) that is cowed by a single arrow, and apparently just flies away! please!!! mr. jackson, i've read tolkien, i _know_ tolkien, and trust me, you are no tolkien!!!! cut the super-crappy story changes!!!!!!! jez, i really gotta calm down... the only part of the movie that i thought was reasonably well done was treebeard. his voice and animation were very good. but did jackson slow down and give us a moment with treebeard in his cave serving the ent water to merry and pippin? no. that might have broken the dark, somber, unrelenting tone of the movie. and was jackson satisfied with how tolkein did the entmoot and the finale at helm's deep? no. for no reason at all, he changed both, to the very huge detriment of his movie (it sure as heck is no longer tolkien's in any way, shape or form!). the point of the ents and helm's deep was to show us that men were not strong enough to defeat saruman, much less sauron. after helm's deep, we _knew_ that gondor would have no chance against sauron; only frodo could save the day. instead, jackson wants us to believe that if gandalf can ride out and gather up a few hundred men, anything can happen (what the hey, aragorn, theoden, and a couple other riders can simply ride out through the gates and brush thousands of orcs right off the battlements like a knife through butter!). oh well. this particular fan will stay faithful to tolkien. jackson is no longer in that realm, and should not be forgiven. how depressing...";18 December 2002;1;['real', 'last', 'gruesome', 'dark', 'tortuous', 'apparent', 'funny', 'great', 'great', 'common', 'cheerful', 'slow', 'near', 'spectacular', 'special', 'great', 'particular', 'happy', 'bad', 'dark', 'gimli', 'few', 'few', 'upbeat', 'left', 'huge', 'able', 'bearable', 'terrible', 'little', 'primary', 'complete', 'unlikable', 'hard', 'intent', 'gloomy', 'possible', 'slow', 'first', 'strong', 'little', 'miserable', 'unnoteworthy', 'weak', 'other', 'main', 'aragorn', 'weak', 'first', 'acceptable', 'aragorn', 'true', 'nice', 'own', 'positive', 'first', 'mortal', 'tough', 'whole', 'complete', 'main', 'many', 'good', 'well', 'final', 'fatal', 'true', 'powerful', 'mighty', 'single', 'super', 'crappy', 'only', 'treebeard', 'good', 'dark', 'somber', 'unrelenting', 'satisfied', 'deep', 'huge', 'sure', 'deep', 'strong', 'less', 'deep', 'few', 'hey', 'aragorn', 'other', 'particular', 'faithful', 'depressing'];0.0965835416539642

676;nankipoo;"""the two towers"" is every bit as engrossing and well-developed as its predecessor, plus i believe its new characters (those not introduced in ""fellowship"") are some of the most intriguing ever conceived and put on film. you have gollum, king theoden, eowen, faramir, grima, treebeard and many others. peter jackson chose the absolute best actors for his trilogy, i'll give no ground on that point. one might argue about gollum and treebeard's categorization as ""actors"", but i say that whether they're cg or human, someone had to write the script and imagine the expressions. the existing characters are developed even more deeply in tt. sam's humanity, frodo's compassion, aragorn's evolving kingship, arwen's deep love, gandalf's new transcendent presence, all add richly to the middle chapter of the trilogy. for epic ""sweep"", you'll have to go far to match tt. the scenes at helm's deep, with all of the defenders bunkered in as the numberless forces of sauron converge on them, is the very picture of desperation, and jackson masterfully gives us both breadth and detail. gollum's split-personality conflicts as ""smeagol/gollum"" are nothing short of perfect, and unlike mainstream movies, we aren't spoonfed the reasoning behind his condition, we just get to puzzle it out for ourselves, like intelligent humans! what a relief. howard shore's score is again one i'd buy for myself. i think that the main criticism of tt on this board is that the movie is dull, or that it relies too heavily on special effects. on the ""dullness"" comment, i'd say that what's one viewer's ""dullness"" is another's character development, dialogue, and foreshadowing. it's called ""filmmaking"", along the lines of kubrick and the merchant/ivory team. on the special effects comments, i'd counter that if special effects add to the plot and don't distract, then i'm perfectly ok with them. now, i wouldn't be drawn to a film totally comprised of special effects, but tt is nothing like that. it's employment of them is only for the sake of plot and believeability. would you want some guy playing gollum, heavily made up, and totally false? no thanks. i bought the general release dvd yesterday, instead of waiting for the extended version, which i will purchase also. i only hope that tt's extended version is as fantastic as fellowship's turned out to be.";29 August 2003;10;['new', 'intriguing', 'treebeard', 'many', 'absolute', 'good', 'human', 'deep', 'new', 'transcendent', 'middle', 'epic', 'deep', 'numberless', 'very', 'split', 'short', 'perfect', 'mainstream', 'intelligent', 'main', 'dull', 'special', 'special', 'special', 'ok', 'special', 'false', 'general', 'extended', 'extended', 'fantastic'];0.237051948051948
677;darkcarrington;spoilers within. with the absolute genious of the fellowship of the ring, this movie had a lot of hype to live up to. however, i can safely say that this certainly does a more than adequate job of doing so. this movie picks up shortly after the other leaves off, both in terms of the plot, and in terms of the brilliance of the acting, directing, and cinematography. peter jackson once again proves himself to be the genious that he is. the first movie was more of an introduction piece, allowing those unfamiliar with the story to get acquainted, and those fanatics a chance to reengross themselves in the tale. this installment follows a much different course, as it focuses on the different internal conflicts of the characters. in particular it focuses on aragorn, legolas, gimlee, and frodo. while fellowship of the ring followed the hobbits around, this movie focuses more on the three warriors, gimlee, legolas, and aragorn and has a bit more action because of this. the plot does not suffer from this added action, and still retains the balance of action and plot that was so essential in the first movie. the first movie had fight scenes, but they did not even compare to the fight scenes in this movie. helmsdeep is one of the most impressive battle scenes in memory. tens if not hundreds of thousands of orcs swarming the castle at helms deep fighting against the desperate people of rohan. it is truly astounding. as in the first one, the acting is superb, and they do not ever really let the script slip. on top of all of this, the score is once again amazing and builds the suspense in the movie to an exceptional level. two masterpieces in a row for jackson. rating: 5 out of 5;27 May 2003;10;['absolute', 'more', 'adequate', 'other', 'genious', 'first', 'more', 'unfamiliar', 'different', 'different', 'internal', 'particular', 'aragorn', 'aragorn', 'more', 'essential', 'first', 'first', 'impressive', 'deep', 'desperate', 'astounding', 'first', 'superb', 'amazing', 'exceptional'];0.2882575757575758

679;jessied;"new hideous beasts join the balrog and orcs as audience members return to middle earth during director peter jackson's the lord of the rings: the two towers. frodo baggins (elijah wood), gandalf the white (ian mckellen), aragorn (viggo mortensen), and five other members of the original fellowship continue their arduous journey to mordor to destroy the ring. conditions are often intolerable. powers clash and collide. the battles are fierce and unrelenting. friendships and alliances are tested. innocent people and brave warriors lose their lives. love is found and lost and unreturned. the world is simply a darker place. but even this enormous amount of conflict and drama does not engender a superior sequel to the lord of the rings: the fellowship of the ring. the team of screenwriters (frances walsh, philippa boyens, stephen sinclair, and peter jackson) undeniably undertook a difficult task in reproducing j.r.r. tolkien's epic in script form, but this fact does not excuse the film's slow pace and occasional incomprehensibility. both major and minor characters are introduced too quickly and little or no time is invested in many of these people, which prevents audience members from connecting and sympathizing with the characters. theoden (bernard hill) orders elderly men and young boys to fight an impossible war, but one cannot connect with the weeping women or terrified men as leaders outfit them in helmets and swords and send them off to a likely death. the writers have not given audience members the time or reason to care. the overriding theme in the lord of the rings is that the good in the world is worth a tremendous fight and that evil cannot prevail despite its overwhelming force, but other themes evolve through various characters and subplots. few people can miss the dominating theme; sam gamgee (sean astin) even states this truth at the end of the two towers just in case it has eluded anyone in the story's first six cinematic hours. unfortunately, many other themes are lost not simply because of exclusion from the original text, but again, because the writers did not invest enough time in explaining the details and significance of certain events. allowing galadriel (cate blanchett) to return momentarily to clarify certain points and clever monologues by gollum (voice of andy serkis) avoid complete disregard for intelligibility, but more of these not-entirely-innovative but nonetheless helpful techniques would have benefited the film. gollum embodies the possibility that any inherently good creature can be transformed into something evil. the entire cast delivers laudable performances once again, but this computer generated character steals the spotlight in every one of his scenes. he appears deformed and acts maliciously, but the writers gave him a tremendous amount of depth and so his deformities and deviance is forgiven. gollum is complicated, and he is endearing. he has become a slave to the desire for power, but traces of his former smeagol self penetrate his dominating ugliness--especially in an intense but entertaining forest monologue. unfortunately, gollum also represents the most disturbing reality of the second part of this film series: the two towers relies too heavily on its computer generated characters and special effects and not enough on the story and the abilities of its human actors. legolas greenleaf (orlando bloom) prances off boulders and dramatically flies onto a horse during battle, which elicits laughter during serious moments and detracts from bloom's natural ability to play the part. the fellowship of the ring is not entirely void of these non-human creations, but the focus is on the nine-member fellowship. the actors are responsible for the overall success or failure of each scene in the first film, but the exact opposite is true for the second film and pure spectacle does not afford cinematic greatness. jackson's talented cast is not as present in the two towers, but they make a valiant effort to carry the film even through too numerous sweeping landscape scenes. still, few of the actors exhibit flawless or even nearly flawless performances. wood and john rhys-davies, who plays gimli, occasionally overreact with melodramatic reactions and facial expressions, though it is admittedly the exception to wood's otherwise skillful and intriguing performance. rhys-davies is particularly guilty of this amateurish act, however, and these poor acting choices coupled with a script that portrays him as a fool cheapens the overall story and discredits the fellowship. the most troubling acting problem, however, is the lack of chemistry between the lead male characters excluding the hobbits. every single leader is captivating in his individual monologues and scenes, but their camaraderie seems forced and unauthentic. the camera does most of the work, and the actors rely on background music and other visual effects to compensate for their collective inefficiency. thankfully, the believability of all other relationships balances this inadequacy, and newcomer miranda otto as eowyn shines. the lord of the rings: the two towers lags behind its predecessor, but jackson and his cast and crew have created another film well worth the price of a movie ticket. the story begs for more explanation and the actors are undermined by technology, but the special effects and computer generated characters will keep audience members content through the three hour duration. one ring was forged to bind all creatures in the darkness of mordor--despite the film's faults, don't be the only one to miss this continued journey that will determine if the dark prophecy will come true and send middle earth into catastrophic

680;EvilLost;though not exactly following the books, two towers has excellent action and of course continues frodo's quest. if you are a fan of fantasy in any way i think you will like this, however do *not* watch this if you have not seen lord of the rings: the fellowship of the ring. these movies are a trilogy, however unlike other trilogies (i.e. indiana jones, star wars, etc) this trilogy is more of a continued story. where the first movie ends the second starts, and if i recall correctly the commentary by tolkien in the novel states that he intitally wanted it to be one large book, but due to lenght it is split into 3 parts. in other words, this is technically 1 9+ hour movie (once return of the king comes out :);24 December 2002;7;['excellent', 'other', 'more', 'first', 'second', 'novel', 'large', 'other'];0.2448979591836734
681;stakes;the two towers is an enjoyable, and sometimes very good movie, but was a dissappointment to me in the wake of the sheer masterpiece that was the fellowship of the ring. director peter jackson was able to fill the fotr with a variety of well-developed characters, a sweeping cinematic landscape, a tense and intriguing storyline, and an overall depth that the book itself possessed. i am no expert on the books, but i do know that fotr truly delivered the spirit of the book. now having said that, one could just take all the battles and action, and hordes of armies and violent characters that exist in the books, plunk them into a bunch of fighting sequences, and make great action movies. the fotr went beyond that, and captured the true heart of the original book, which is why it was so good, and will go down as a cinematic classic, much in the same way the books will go down as litterary classics. being peter jackson more or less filmed the trilogy of lord of the rings films back-to-back, i figured that the sheer brilliance put forth in fotr would be present. that is not the case. instead, jackson has delivered the aforementioned action movie. there's epic battle after epic battle, swordsman after swordsman, but little else. the centerpiece of the books and the first film -- the hobbits -- are something of an afterthought in the tt, while swashbuckling swordsman aragorn and bow and arrow marksmen legolas take the spotlight. these are characters who are embody the standard action movie hero in every sense, but again, don't begin to scrape the depths of the book, which is so much more than what is on display here. there's word that jackson did a lot of re-shooting and editing to the tt in the last 12 months. perhaps he felt the pressure to follow up to the mammoth success of fotr, and decided to take the safe way out. but what he may have failed to realise is that what made fotr so great and popular was it's depth beyond your standard action flick. in the wake of the downward spiral of the star wars films, which suffer from the same condition plauging the tt, movie fans were looking to latch on to a new fantasy epic, that could provide the great effects and all of that good stuff, but also deliver the goods in terms of story, charachter, and overall depth. complaints aside, this is still a fun movie. for starters, you know that you enjoyed a movie when it clocks in at 3 hours long, and you don't find yourself getting restless, whcih i did not. additionally, the cgi is ultra-impressive, there are lots of incredible visuals (though not on par with the first film), and the action sequences are truly amazing. i just came out dissappointed because one year ago, i went into the theatre to see fotr not knowing what to expect, and i was given a completley unexpected masterpiece. this time, i went into the tt expect to see another classic, and instead i was delivered a big-budget action flick. fun movie? yes. great special effects? yes. another classic? no. on a closing note, i think roger ebert's review of this movie hits the nail right on the head, and he is able to articulate many of the thoughts i have on this film very successfully.;21 December 2002;7;['enjoyable', 'good', 'sheer', 'able', 'sweeping', 'cinematic', 'tense', 'intriguing', 'overall', 'violent', 'great', 'true', 'original', 'good', 'cinematic', 'much', 'same', 'litterary', 'sheer', 'present', 'epic', 'epic', 'little', 'first', 'swashbuckling', 'standard', 'more', 'last', 'mammoth', 'safe', 'great', 'popular', 'standard', 'downward', 'same', 'new', 'great', 'good', 'overall', 'ultra', 'impressive', 'incredible', 'first', 'amazing', 'dissappointed', 'unexpected', 'big', 'great', 'special', 'able', 'many'];0.2883179804691433

685;stephanmj;this review contains spoilers. this is one of the most boring movies i have ever seen. each plot element was over-drawn out. it took 3 hours to tell what could have been told sufficiently and more interestingly in 90 minutes. the main plot elements were: 1) frodo finds thats the ring is getting heavy 2) saurons forces are rising 3) pippin and merry spend the whole movie in a tree 4) gollum has 2 personalities. the use of helicopter shots became very irritating after the 15th use the technique in the 3rd minute of the movie. also in the middle of the final battle sequence they kept cutting back to a bunch of trees talking, what an idea to keep the action flowing. the long battle at the end was the same thing over and over. not to mention both sides had stupid battle plans. the humans defense wasnt even slightly planned out. it was totally unbelievable. then the boring subplot with arwen aerosmiths daughter, i mean really, who cares if she dies. she was in the first one for 5 minutes anyway. it is also very silly that this movie is already number 9 on imdb top 250 movies of all time. i can easily name 10 movies much better than this. the only reason it is so high is because people want to have a little geek war between star wars and lord of the rings so the movies can have a higher rating. i contemplated leaving early as i started to fall asleep and i had to wake my girlfriend many times. seriously dull movie.;21 December 2002;1;['boring', 'main', 'heavy', 'whole', 'final', 'long', 'same', 'stupid', 'unbelievable', 'boring', 'first', 'silly', 'top', 'well', 'only', 'high', 'little', 'high', 'asleep', 'many', 'dull'];-0.1232894736842105

(in the beginning he said only him and his small legion still fought for rohan). how did they manage to kill off like the remaining 2,000 or so of sauraman's troops. why did that rohan lady fall in love with aragorn... they only met for like 2 seconds. all in all it left me awed but a little unsatisfied. 6.8 out of 10";21 December 2002;8;['cinematic', 'visual', 'astounding', 'awesome', 'good', 'whole', 'inner', 'comic', 'bad', 'first', 'magical', 'flat', 'high', 'musical', 'imo', 'new', 'musical', 'first', 'ambient', 'like', 'female', 'new', 'hard', 'other', 'whole', 'main', 'deep', 'awesome', 'shallow', 'first', 'slow', 'last', 'gandalf', 'last', 'big', 'small', 'awed', 'little', 'unsatisfied'];0.1086937557392103

691;hanifmuhammad92;the lord of the rings: the two towers is a ripping roaring success. it's in the company of great sequels that manage to match the original film in nearly every way. it doesn't quite have the narrative focus the fellowship of the ring has but it more than matches it in overall quality. the film delves much deeper into the lore of middle earth than the original film and adds a host of welcome additions to the awesome roster of characters. in short it's pretty much everything you can ever want and more. as reward for the abrupt ending of the original film the two towers picks up right where the fellowship of the ring left off. our heroes are divided and the narrative continuously switches back and forth between multiple storylines occurring simultaneously. for starters we have frodo and sam on the most important quest. the ring bearer must still journey to mordor and cast the ring into the fiery pit of mount doom but they are accompanied by a new companion. the creature gollum acts as a guide for the two hobbits and imparts his knowledge of the dark lord's minions. he is a vital part of the puzzle but one with a nefarious purpose and an unhealthy obsession with the ring, one that will lead to his downfall. the other primary story follows the remaining members of the fellowship as they respond to the evil that has come to the great kingdom of rohan. we follow aragorn, legolas, and gimli as they grow closer to one another and their friendship tightens. it's not long until they are joined by a revived gandalf who rides to the aid of king theoden of rohan. it is here where the subtitle of the movie is established. the two towers refers to the union and alliance between sauron and saruman. between the evil forces of mordor and isengard. saruman sends a seemingly unstoppable army of ten thousand against the army of rohan and the suspense builds, keeping the audiences glued to their seats until we arrive at the battle for helms deep at the last half hour of the film one of the greatest war sequences in the history of cinema by far! overall this is an excellent movie that's almost neck and neck with the first film. the cast is once again perfect and the new additions to the roster are seamlessly interwoven in the narrative. bernard hill is nothing short of sublime as king theoden. the scene when he breaks into pieces and cries over his son's death should have gotten him an oscar nom alone! a riveting performances! miranda otto is also rather stellar as the king's niece eowyn and the affection and almost child like crush that she develops for aragorn is very believable, tender and a sharp rival to the rich chemistry he has for lady arwen who makes a brief return as well. andy serkis as gollum was a scene stealer and most definitely was robbed of an oscar as well. absolutely love his character, brilliant, naive and impulsive to a fault, this character has more dimension than what you can shake your staff at. he's learned and has an almost unlimited supply of knowledge though his mind is scrambled and poisoned by the ring, he's tender at times, vicious and duplicitous during others, playful and humorous yet frightening. sinister and hideous while also being sympathetic. what peter jackson and company have achieved with this character is nothing short of remarkable. he is the perfect anti hero for a time and is only more believable as a full on 3d villain by the reveal at the tail end of the film. there is nothing i can truly say to you that really does this character justice. this film is as relevant today as it was when it was released. some of the most important lessons and themes about our world are discussed here. from the nature of evil, addiction, greed and corruption, the nature of warfare. hope in the face of insurmountable odds. the arc with treebeard and the ents is great as well and is a poignant metaphor for nature vs industry. the scene when the ents along with the brave hobbits merry and pippin overtake saruman's fortress is inspiring as is the ending with gandalf, eomer and the return of the rohirram, saving aragorn and ending the battle for helms deep at the last minute. sam's final speech to frodo about the good of this world being something worth fighting for ties all of the threads of the story in a neat little bow as does his proclaimation that their story may be one of the great stories that people will tell their children in years past. all in all the two towers is an instant classic and one that will leave audiences eager for the final chapter of this legendary trilogy;18 June 2019;10;['great', 'original', 'overall', 'deep', 'middle', 'original', 'welcome', 'awesome', 'more', 'abrupt', 'original', 'multiple', 'important', 'fiery', 'new', 'creature', 'dark', 'vital', 'nefarious', 'unhealthy', 'other', 'primary', 'great', 'aragorn', 'gimli', 'close', 'long', 'revived', 'evil', 'unstoppable', 'last', 'half', 'great', 'excellent', 'first', 'perfect', 'new', 'interwoven', 'short', 'sublime', 'oscar', 'riveting', 'stellar', 'believable', 'sharp', 'rich', 'brief', 'most', 'brilliant', 'naive', 'impulsive', 'dimension', 'unlimited', 'tender', 'vicious', 'duplicitous', 'playful', 'humorous', 'frightening', 'hideous', 'sympathetic', 'short', 'remarkable', 'perfect', 'anti', 'believable', 'full', 'relevant', 'important', 'insurmountable', 'great', 'poignant', 'brave', 'aragorn', 'last', 'final', 'worth', 'neat', 'little', 'great', 'instant', 'eager', 'final', 'legendary'];0.2662878787878788
692;Doddi;"it isn't easy spending 5+ years of your life making a film version of the most beloved books of the 20th century. peter jackson and his team knew this and have shown such a wonderful respect for the material, and turned it into the film events of the century which has just started. fellowship was an amazing feat, flawless and it warped us into middle earth. it was hard waiting for the next part, but it's here and it is amazing as well. i truly admire peter jackson for the decision on not connecting the first two films with ""rolling text"" or what has previously happened. you just continue the story and it is so powerful. it feels like you're home, like you never left. you have frodo and sam in one quest, aragorn, legolas and gimli in another and then a bit of merry and pippin. plus new characters and creatures and the film flows flawlessly. it's a flawless second act, where the only fault is that we have to wait another year for the conclusion. yes, the two towers parts the most from the novels (pj has himself stated) but it isn't that much. films will never be as great or the same as the books, it is simply not possible, yet the impossible task is near perfection in pj's version of the trilogy. there is a lot more action in the two towers, understandably, yet it finds time to develop the depth behind the new characters, enhance the olders ones and make us feel for them all. i felt the ring's influence on frodo so much, i felt sam's pain as his best and trusted friend, i felt the change in merry and pippin, i felt the transition from the grey to the white, aragorn's fighting skills were superb, as were emotional difficulties with his troubled love to arwen, gimli as the comic sidekick works perfectly and legolas is great as always. there are many scenes i could point out, but me and three friends went together and after the film we all sat in awe and questioned each other afterwards: how is this possible??? the battle at helm's deep must be and will be considered one of the greatest moments in film history. the tension built up until the moment the first arrow is shot... wow - an amazingly big wow!! howard shore has developed his amazing score further and emiliana's ""gollum song"" is hauntingly good, lesnie's cinematography is perfect, costumes, make-up and visual effects ... never better! and if you are in doubt, ask gollum!! a powerful performance by a cgi-character!! (andy serkis was magnificent)... i could count more persons (actors, crew-people) but i'm trying to finish without bursting to tears... yes, i almost cried because i was so heavily influenced. i was in awe! and i still am. this is what cinema is about, pure escapism and more than that... fulfilling it with such a fantastic, flawless second act. pj: thank you for your brilliant piece. it may be slightly better than the fellowship, which i didn't think was possible. it only makes me more anxious in seeing return of the king. this trilogy will go down in history as the greatest trilogy of all time. from the bottom of my heart, i thank everyone involved and responsible for the film, especially the true visionary and greatest director: peter jackson.";21 December 2002;10;['easy', 'beloved', 'wonderful', 'amazing', 'middle', 'next', 'amazing', 'first', 'rolling', 'powerful', 'gimli', 'new', 'flawless', 'second', 'only', 'most', 'much', 'great', 'same', 'possible', 'impossible', 'more', 'new', 'much', 'good', 'white', 'aragorn', 'superb', 'emotional', 'troubled', 'gimli', 'comic', 'great', 'many', 'other', 'possible', 'great', 'first', 'big', 'amazing', 'good', 'perfect', 'visual', 'well', 'powerful', 'magnificent', 'more', 'pure', 'more', 'fantastic', 'flawless', 'second', 'brilliant', 'well', 'possible', 'anxious', 'great', 'responsible', 'true', 'great'];0.3649746087246087
693;gautammayya;first of all what i would like to say is i haven't read the tolkien's books so my views on this movie might not be that perfect. i actually didn't like the movie as much as the others did. i just considered it as a fun adventure movie with nothing in it to be recognized by some of its fanboys as the greatest movie ever made. yeah i understand that it is an astounding and praiseworthy achievement in visual effects and stuff but still other than the epic scenery, the score and the acting of some the movie is just so and so. i am going to break the movie into pros and cons so that it becomes easier why i like and don't like it. pros: 1. the scenery with all the mountains and stuff was breathtaking. it just looked visually stunning. i think this is why so many people adore lotr. 2. the score by howard shore was really beautiful. the entire soundtrack fit the movie perfectly 3. the visual effects..duh!!! 4. the acting especially by sir ian mckellen. i don't think his performance was as good as it was in fellowship but was good nonetheless. 5. gollum!! this character was really interesting and i wanted to know more about him. he(it??) was the only character i feel was deep and three dimensional. it literally had two sides. i think it sincerely loved frodo!! 6. the whole adventure vibe and the world building. now coming to the cons or things which i didn't like: i am going to elaborate on this because a lot of people might not agree with me so i intend to make them understand why i didn't like it. 1.the characters: i mean none of the characters were interesting(except gollum).none of them were deep. i mean either the characters were pure good or pure bad. there was no grey area characters(again except gollum). many might not have a problem with it but i do. there was absolutely no character building or anything. everyone from the start just want to do what they had planned. they never question anything and neither do they face tough psychological choices. especially the hobbits but there were some good moments by faramir but i don't think they were executed to the fullest potential. 2. the jokes: there were not a lot of jokes and those present didn't land at all. gimli the dwarf was a regular joker of the group just because of his height. and even he isn't funny. neither were pippin and merry. it was neither funny nor dark. 3. the fake death scenes: okay gandalf was believed to be dead during fellowship and he came back to life in this and i am happy. i really thought that he was killed in the first one! but they do the same thing to aragorn, pippin and merry and worst of it was no one bought it that they died. it was ridiculous. what was the point of the two scenes where we are supposed to believe they are dead and then surprise!!they aren't !! i just felt irritated by those choices. 4. some writing mistakes: why does aragorn who is a prince and shown to be an honest man who loves eowyn, flirt with arwen!! then she develops romantic feelings toward him. oh come on you should agree that is a bit too much. it felt like a soap opera. 5. the frequent wide shots showing the beauty of middle earth. i mean it just felt too much. showing it a couple of times is ok but showing it again and again, i didn't like it. yeah i can accept that those who have read tolkien's books might like it as they can see the books coming to life or some sort of that. but personally didn't like it overall i liked it to some extent. the cinematography was amazing and middle earth felt truly epic. but it certainly isn't one of the greatest movies ever made. it just felt like watching an mcu movie but with better acting, shots and a little more epicness. so overall i give the movie a 7.;2 June 2020;5;['perfect', 'fun', 'great', 'astounding', 'praiseworthy', 'visual', 'other', 'epic', 'easy', 'stunning', 'many', 'beautiful', 'entire', 'visual', 'good', 'good', 'interesting', 'more', 'only', 'deep', 'dimensional', 'whole', 'deep', 'pure', 'good', 'pure', 'bad', 'grey', 'many', 'tough', 'psychological', 'good', 'full', 'present', 'gimli', 'regular', 'funny', 'funny', 'dark', 'fake', 'okay', 'dead', 'happy', 'first', 'same', 'bad', 'ridiculous', 'dead', 'irritated', 'honest', 'romantic', 'much', 'frequent', 'wide', 'middle', 'much', 'ok', 'amazing', 'middle', 'epic', 'great', 'well', 'little', 'more'];0.2101260094681147

696;UltramarineX;(possible, minor spoilers ahead) the fellowship of the ring (which was part 1 of the lord of the rings trilogy) exceeded every expectation i had. the acting was superb, especially performances by ian mckellen and elijah wood, the music were fantastic, and the special effects were a visual feast. therefore, i was expecting a lot from the two towers. i wanted the two towers to capture all the great qualities of the first movie, and if at all possible to exceed the standard of greatness set by the first movie. did the two towers accomplish this task? of course it did! the two towers is an amazing movie! now, for those of you who want to go see the two towers, but have not yet seen the fellowship of the ring, i strongly recommend you do so right away. the two towers spends little time re-introducing you to the characters and storyline of this series, and as such will likely confuse any newcomers. now some people may dislike that fact, but i think it was the right decision, because the movie drops right into the action, which gives the story of the two towers more forward momentum than the fellowship of the ring. as in the first movie, the acting in the two towers was great, but the stand out actor in this movie was andy serkis, who played (and supplied the voice) to the character of gollum. gollum is a creature with a duel personality, which is torn between helping the main character, frodo, on his quest to destroy the one ring, and taking the ring for himself. serkis portrays this aspect of gollum quite well, and i think his performance is worthy of oscar consideration. but, the best thing about the two towers would have to be the exceptionally well done battle of helm's deep. if you like battle scenes such as those seen in movies like gladiator and braveheart, prepare to be blown away. the sheer scale of the battle, which features an army of 10,000 orc warriors, is sure to delight and impress anyone who sees it. admittedly, the first half of the movie has a few slow spots, but they are quickly forgotten by the end of the movie. fans of the fellowship of the ring will not be disappointed, and even those who did not like the first movie, may change their minds about the series after seeing the two towers. it is my favourite movie of the year, and it should be considered a contender for an oscar. kudos to director peter jackson for another fine movie. i give the two towers 10/10!;27 December 2002;10;['possible', 'minor', 'superb', 'fantastic', 'special', 'visual', 'great', 'first', 'possible', 'first', 'amazing', 'little', 'such', 'right', 'first', 'great', 'main', 'worthy', 'oscar', 'good', 'deep', 'such', 'sheer', 'orc', 'sure', 'first', 'few', 'slow', 'first', 'favourite', 'fine'];0.2454294217687075
697;beam_er;pretty fast paced adventure. i managed to find a spot about 1/2 way through the movie where there was some kissing and hugging when i finally thought i could go get some refreshments and not miss anything. good luck trying to keep up with all the changes, all the backstabbing, and all the fighting. some rather amazing special effects. one thing that amazed me though was the way that the theater delivered the sound. it all came from the front of the theater, even though there were speakers all around the audience. i felt cheated in this regard. i haven't read weather others had this same poor sound experience or not. hopefully. it was just this screwy place and that isn't how the movie is being shipped out. then, 20 minutes into the movie, the sound level dropped and your hearing people crunching popcorn and slurping drinks instead of the movie. grrrr .... luckily, that just lasted another 15 minutes. all in all, a very good movie that i would highly recommend, but only if you saw the first movie. otherwise, i am sure you shall be lost.;7 January 2003;8;['good', 'amazing', 'special', 'same', 'poor', 'screwy', 'sound', 'good', 'first', 'sure'];0.3452380952380952
698;reddpill;after the wonderful job that peter jackson, cast, and crew did on lotr: the fellowship of the rings, i eagerly looked forward to seeing the two towers. unfortunately, all is not well in middle earth. much of the magic of part one of the series has vanished from part two, leaving in its wake what is for the most part a medieval epic. there are some fantasy elements still present: nazgul riding dragons, treebeard, etc., but much of the film deals with the realm of men battling with swords and with arrows. the two towers is, to be sure, amongst the finest medieval epics ever made, but it lacks the charm of the fellowship. still, it is worth viewing and forms a necessary part of the saga that is the lord of the rings, and i would recommend that people who enjoyed the earlier film watch the two towers if only to prepare for the return of the king -- just be prepared to take the film on its own merits, not on expectations based upon its predecessor.;21 December 2002;7;['wonderful', 'middle', 'much', 'most', 'medieval', 'present', 'much', 'sure', 'fine', 'medieval', 'worth', 'necessary', 'early', 'prepared', 'own'];0.2847222222222222

(lol!!!). the soundtrack is moody and greatly integrated into the movie's scenes. all in all, excellent movie. epic fights, beautiful special effects, great soundtrack, top-notch acting and true attention to the book combine to make a great movie. you'll enjoy this one greatly if you love the books, or are simply looking for a great fantasy-action film.";12 December 2011;10;['first', 'other', 'short', 'epic', 'emotional', 'beautiful', 'timeless', 'epic', 'gimli', 'aragorn', 'other', 'first', 'evil', 'creature', 'black', 'great', 'deep', 'gentle', 'fierce', 'evil', 'likable', 'incredible', 'true', 'minor', 'good', 'intact', 'true', 'special', 'impressive', 'varied', 'grimmer', 'first', 'deep', 'awesome', 'epic', 'great', 'top', 'special', 'stellar', 'sound', 'cool', 'bare', 'real', 'moody', 'excellent', 'epic', 'beautiful', 'special', 'great', 'top', 'true', 'great', 'great'];0.3194264069264069

704;MITCH!;"give a man a tower and he'll see across a kingdom; give a man two towers and he'll be blinded by special effects. i'll admit i've never read the lord of the rings trilogy, which may render my commentary meaningless to diehard fans of the series. however, i'll give peter jackson loads of credit for his job on the first two adaptations. thus far, i can't say i've seen any other film positing itself as an ""epic"" lately and actually felt like i was seeing an epic. from the hordes of armies and the bombastic, poetic dialogue to the expanses of new zealand that serve as the beautiful, majestic middle earth, jackson and his dedicated creative team have done a superb job in recreating a world that i know many people love dearly. unfortunately for me, as a film, the two towers (and to some extent the fellowship of the ring before it) leaves me wanting for something. it's hard to believe because there's so much there -- drama, archetype, huge battle sequences, lush cinematography, incredible special effects -- but i came away from the film feeling empty, like i'd just seen a gorgeous work of art that didn't speak to me personally. some might say this is because i haven't read the books; i claim the opposite. i think what i'm missing is a sense of inclusion, of characters, of personal moments. these are the things that make me ""connect"" with any film, and which i didn't see in the two towers. if i sense them lacking, and i haven't even read the books, i can only imagine how half-empty the serious fans of the story are, in that they probably come into the theater expecting every nuance of tolkien's 1000-odd pages to come to life onscreen and leave wondering where all their favorite moments were. the first film had the luxury of being based around interpersonal relationships among the fellowship members, and frodo's reluctance to be a hero, bilbo's mixed feelings about the ring, gandalf's weary wisdom, etc. all character traits, character moments -- building blocks of conflict and story. here, the conflict is primarily external -- aragorn, legolas and gimli must help the people of rohan defend themselves from a swarm of orc soldiers as a show of force, good standing strong against the onslaught of evil. the character moments, particularly those between aragorn and nearly anyone else, feel forced and artificial primarily because they occur opposite underdeveloped characters seemingly introduced solely to further the plot or embody elements of the theme (rohan's king in particular) rather than being integral parts of the story. why rohan? why not any other city, any other characters? why would aragorn be so easily swayed from his original love as to develop eyes for another? it seems like a plot device, not a natural occurrence. even the comedic moments, especially those between legolas and gimli, are unnatural. the elf and dwarf are reduced to comedic foils, buddy characters, recipients of exposition and mood-lightening one-liners. surely the bravest representatives of their races can do more than play second fiddle to aragorn, yet they're given no chance here. they fade into the background, except for gratuitous and suspiciously out-of-tone (and character) comments and actions (legolas on a medieval snowboard?). finally, there's the redundancy and disinterest of the alleged central plot, that of frodo, sam and gollum transporting the ring to mount doom. never before has the main conflict of a story taken a backseat to a subplot (aragorn and the defense of helm's deep) and been so welcome. every time the film cut back to frodo i became increasingly bored. it may be because elijah wood is reduced to playing a primarily one-note character at this point, given that his rational thought and will are eroding throughout the tale. or maybe it's the frustration i felt at seeing them so close to gates of mordor, only to have them decide to go completely around the main entrance to approach from a ""hidden entrance,"" which smacks of plot device. call it theme; i call it flat story. and i'll say nothing of the rest of their end of the film, which features no conflicts we haven't already seen, paired with characters we're asked to care about prematurely, except that their final scene onscreen is a mirror image of the frodo-sam bonding moment at the end of fellowship -- are there no fresh angles to this plotline? the merry and pippin subplot exists solely to topple another subplot, the tower of sauruman. i'm sure the themes involved were more clearly stated in the book; here, they feel tacked-on. the film could have existed without them and been perfectly engaging, if not moreso, since we'd have no momentum-killing cuts from helm's deep to the langorous ents, talking (for comic relief). the special effects are remarkable. the detail is commendable. the movie as a whole is impressive. but the attention to detail cannot overcome what for me is a lack of basic plot and character, deficiencies that hamper the aftertaste of the film. as everyone knows, special effects will never be able to replace a solid, coherent, emotionally engaging story, which the original trilogy likely is and which seems to be at least partially lost in the translation to the screen.";15 January 2003;8;['special', 'meaningless', 'diehard', 'first', 'other', 'epic', 'bombastic', 'poetic', 'beautiful', 'majestic', 'middle', 'dedicated', 'creative', 'superb', 'many', 'hard', 'much', 'huge', 'lush', 'incredible', 'special', 'empty', 'gorgeous', 'personal', 'empty', 'serious', 'odd', 'favorite', 'first', 'interpersonal', 'mixed', 'weary', 'external', 'aragorn', 'gimli', 'good', 'strong', 'forced', 'artificial', 'opposite', 'underdeveloped', 'particular', 'integral', 'other', 'other', 'original', 'natural', 'comedic', 'gimli', 'unnatural', 'comedic', 'brave', 'more', 'second', 'gratuitous', 'medieval', 'disinter', 'central', 'main', 'deep', 'welcome', 'bored', 'rational', 'close', 'main', 'hidden', 'flat', 'final', 'fresh', 'sure', 'deep', 'langorous', 'comic', 'special', 'remarkable', 'commendable', 'impressive', 'basic', 'special', 'able', 'solid', 'coherent', 'engaging', 'original', 'least'];0.1904395604395604

709;surreyhill;"a gift to tolkien geeks and fans of cutting-edge moviemaking everywhere. i think that there will be quite a few people who won't like this movie at all, and even some who might go to see it not even understanding it's supposed to be a middle installment, and not something with a definite beginning and end. but for most of the tolkien fanatics, i feel this movie delivers the visual goodies. whether or not it delivers the heart--well, i say it does, but i can see where others might reasonably differ with me on that. it had a bit of the chopped-up, overly pruned quality in certain sections which i noted in the theatrical version of fotr. those missing sequences were restored in the extended-dvd, and it made for a much better film. i'm sure that will be the case with ttt as well. i have a feeling a lot of fangorn forest and karl urban ended up on the cutting room floor. still, i gave it a ""10"" for the many things about this movie which were either groundbreaking, or soul-satisfying. briefly, the high points were the acting of newcomers bernard hill and david wenham, cgi gollum, the exquisite score including the beautiful rohan theme, the heartbreaking beauty of shadowfax, and the overall complex, demanding, textural richness of the movie as a whole. it will take several viewings to really absorb it all. there is so bloody much here, and the money spent on it is all right there on the screen. the battle of helm's deep is the most impressive battle sequence ever brought to the screen. not only was the effects work impressive, and the agile athleticism and physical heroics of the actors up to the very best action/adventure standards, but someone involved here must have really studied medieval warfare and seige tactics. this engaged the brain as well as the viscera. i think it will bear up extremely well under repeated viewings. i was entertained, thrilled, and educated by it. i'm glad everyone seems to have enjoyed gollum as much as i did. one thing that struck me was that when he first came on screen, i was so repulsed by him that i seriously wondered if i was going to be able to stand looking at him for as much screen time as i expected him to have. but by about five minutes in, i was utterly fascinated by him, then charmed, then amused, and began to look forward to his next appearance. a real credit to all involved in his creation for the screen. btw, my 9 year old son loved gollum. true delights for the tolkien fan included the magnificent realization of the ""fell beasts"" and the use of gimli, the warrior dwarf. dwarves as comic relief were certainly a part of the hobbit, and gimli in this one manages to deliver both the comedic goods, and be a real stud in the battle scenes. the lack of chemistry between gimli and legolas and the underusage of the gimli character was one of my few complaints about fotr, but all that is a thing of the past here, as john rhys-davies gets to show his chops as both gimli, and the voice of the venerable treebeard. oh! what a life! i have seen an oliphaunt! all the actors were excellent in this installment, and there were only three cringeworthy moments: legolas' x-games staircase surf at helm's deep, the maxfield parrish faux romantic interlude between aragorn and arwen, and what immediately followed--did anyone else find it funny when aragorn was dreaming of being kissed by arwen, only to wake up to find his horse nibbling on his face? i hope that was inadvertant. i want to use the rest of this review to address two areas of controversy: 1) elves coming to helm's deep--i liked the elves coming to help out. i think it was done for those viewers who aren't steeped in tolkien. it's not established why the ""time of the elves is passing"", and it just looks like they are cowardly rats leaving a sinking ship if they don't try to help. in this time, when we expect allies of ours who have not been targeted by terrorism to lend us their support, i think galadriel's sending some of her elf archers to help the men was a hopeful message. 2)faramir--faramir has the same issues as boromir did in the first movie, with the addition of knowing his brother set out with a company which included hobbits, and was later seen dead. he has no idea how his brother died, and for all he knows, the hobbits might be responsible or at fault. he did not have the benefit of being at the council of elrond, where it was established how dangerous the ring would be for anyone other than frodo to bear. so i found that his attitude towards the hobbits and the ring were both realistic and rational. seeing with his own eyes, though, the power of the ring at its evil worst, and getting a good dressing-down from samwise, he altered his position and agreed to let frodo and sam continue on, even though it was against the laws of gondor. how could you not get a shiver when he said ""then, my life is forfeit""? movie faramir is different than book faramir. different and more interesting and better. i can hardly wait to see where this character is going in rotk. i like this arc, and want to put my trust in pj and co, because i really do believe they know how to make a movie that will stand the test of time.";20 December 2002;10;['few', 'middle', 'definite', 'most', 'visual', 'certain', 'theatrical', 'well', 'sure', 'fangorn', 'many', 'groundbreaking', 'high', 'exquisite', 'beautiful', 'heartbreaking', 'overall', 'demanding', 'textural', 'several', 'bloody', 'right', 'impressive', 'impressive', 'agile', 'physical', 'good', 'medieval', 'seige', 'glad', 'able', 'much', 'fascinated', 'next', 'real', 'old', 'true', 'magnificent', 'gimli', 'comic', 'gimli', 'comedic', 'real', 'gimli', 'gimli', 'few', 'gimli', 'venerable', 'excellent', 'cringeworthy', 'deep', 'romantic', 'funny', 'inadvertant', 'deep', 'cowardly', 'hopeful', 'same', 'first', 'dead', 'responsible', 'dangerous', 'other', 'realistic', 'rational', 'own', 'evil', 'bad', 'good', 'different', 'different', 'interesting', 'well', 'rotk'];0.2000326797385621

712;reporterman2000;"i gave this movie a rating of 8, only two notches down from the perfect 10 score for ""the fellowship of the ring."" with this film, there's little doubt left that peter jackson has surpassed the original ""star wars"" trilogy in terms of passion, excitement, visual originality, and storytelling power. what a great accomplishment is ""the two towers."" it'll be tough waiting another three months for ""the return of the king,"" which i'm sure will be the best of the three films. (the ""lotr"" film cycle has one huge advantage over ""star wars"": jackson won't be revisiting his original masterwork with any badly written, badly acted, unnecessary prequels.) ""two towers"" does not follow the middle book in tolkien's epic trilogy as closely as some might like, and does take a few liberties here and there, but overall this is a fine adaptation and, let's face it, probably the greatest sequel in film history. jackson once again successfully creates a believable yet fanciful vision of middle earth; his special effects, while not quite as seamless as in ""fotr,"" are nonetheless impressive, and there's great magic in the cinematography, set design and music. the acting is also a level of magnitude above that seen in the last ""star wars"" picture. each actor is able to make his or her character unique and believable within the terms of the story. this movie probably comes the closest of any to resembling a perfect marriage between art and blockbuster entertainment. all of that said, ""ttt"" (as it is popularly known) isn't quite as smoothly paced as ""fotr."" the first 15-20 minutes are a bit choppy; we're thrown from one end of the story to the other in a somewhat frantic attempt to bring us up to speed. and, more than ""fotr,"" the second film feels like it needs footnotes -- in fact, after seeing it in a theater, i went out and read all three books, just so i could have a deeper understanding of this particular film. so i look forward to the extended dvd release, which i understand contains 40 minutes of additional footage. i think ""ttt"" will benefit from the restored footage; this is one of the few epics that might actually make greater sense with a more leisurely pace. ""the lord of the rings"" trilogy is without a doubt the most exciting and important movie franchise of at least the last 20 years. i could give a rip about ""spider-man"" and ""harry potter"" ... what makes jackson's films special is that they tell a complex, moral story in terms of a magnificent adventure. if the scenes dealing with shelob in ""rotk"" are anywhere near as good as the balrog/battle of helms deep sequences in the first two, then this beauty is only gonna get better.";26 August 2003;9;['perfect', 'little', 'original', 'visual', 'storytelling', 'great', 'tough', 'sure', 'good', 'lotr', 'huge', 'original', 'unnecessary', 'middle', 'epic', 'few', 'fine', 'great', 'believable', 'fanciful', 'middle', 'special', 'seamless', 'impressive', 'great', 'last', 'able', 'unique', 'believable', 'close', 'perfect', 'blockbuster', 'first', 'choppy', 'other', 'frantic', 'more', 'second', 'deep', 'particular', 'extended', 'additional', 'few', 'great', 'leisurely', 'exciting', 'important', 'least', 'last', 'special', 'complex', 'moral', 'magnificent', 'rotk', 'good', 'deep', 'first', 'well'];0.277047450185748
713;michaelgs;"this franchise will, in all likelihood, become remembered as a franchise that shaped filmmaking over the next 10-20 years, and will remain a watched film while the industry lasts. the question then commonly asked becomes, ""does this movie deserve to be remembered that long?"" the answer to that question is, really ""deserved"" is the wrong word.independence day will probably still be watched 30 years from now, not because it is necessarily all that good, but because it was hugely successful and spawned a slew of disaster-related flicks. in other words, it defined an era. and with the harry potter series being developed as we speak, and both the chronicles of narnia and his dark materials being made into franchises, one can easily conclude that this film will be remembered as the film that spawned the development of modern fantasy blockbusters (although the harry potter series being contemporary was coincidental). by now, we have come to expect that lesser films will occasionally become classics, while greater films will occasionally fall into obscurity. however, i feel, and i hope you will concurr when you see it for yourself, that this is a worthy addition to those era-defining films that come along every-so-often. in fact, imho, this is one of the best era-defining films since star wars, or at least one of the most enjoyable. several things from this franchise are truly, justifiably, memorable, such as the wholesome innocence of the shire and the hobbits, gandalf's stand against the balrog, the preparation for the climactic battle of helms deep, the double personality of gollum, and...well, since this review is being written in august of 2002 and the return of the king is not out yet, i'll leave this last one blank, but i am confident that this last film will give us something that will make it worth remembering, perhaps even more than the first two. some say that the oscar should and will go to this last film, but i say that the oscar has had mixed reactions to these era-defining franchises (the only film i would classify as an era-defining franchise that garnered an oscar since the 70s was silence of the lambs), and the academy might be better off bestowing the award on another film that will fall into obscurity if not honored, rather than adding garnish to an already classic series. i never garauntee that everyone will like a film. if you go to the casablanca (my personal all-time favorite) page on this website and check the rating stats, you'll find that more than a few people have given it a ""1"" rating. but most probably will find this film at least a highly enjoyable diversion, and that is what film is all about in the first place. 9/10";2 August 2003;9;['next', 'long', 'wrong', 'good', 'successful', 'other', 'dark', 'modern', 'contemporary', 'coincidental', 'less', 'great', 'worthy', 'imho', 'good', 'least', 'enjoyable', 'several', 'memorable', 'such', 'wholesome', 'climactic', 'deep', 'double', 'last', 'blank', 'confident', 'last', 'worth', 'more', 'first', 'last', 'mixed', 'only', 'well', 'classic', 'personal', 'favorite', 'more', 'few', 'most', 'least', 'enjoyable', 'first'];0.175

718;notevenwordshere;"trilogies have one major flaw -- it's not so much a fault, just an inherent difficulty. in the case of the middle film of the original star wars trilogy, the empire strikes back, it was overcome; here, in the lord of the rings: the two towers, it was not. the flaw is the meandering middle, and the first hour of this otherwise fine movie suffers from it. the story begins where the first film ended, and we the audience now have three different paths to follow: sam and frodo; aragorn, legolas, and gimli; and merry and pippin. the latter proves the most entertaining, and unfortunately the duo of frodo and sam -- and later the addition of gollum -- is all but glossed over, given enough attention to inform but only as an end to set up return of the king. these are not necessarily complaints -- this is an epic, not a character tale, and in epics priority is given to battles and large set pieces. the two towers spares nothing in this regard, as the battle for helm's deep is eloquently captured, a delight to watch. finally, though, in the last hour of the movie, we are given a break from the carnage and are offered a little reprieve with the addition of david wenham as faramir. he, as well as elijah wood, solidify this film as more than entertaining filler and deepen our understanding of the characters and their hardships. once again, the special effects are astoundingly good -- and, unlike in the first movie, here they don't draw too much attention to themselves. the set, wardrobe, and production designs serve to illustrate the cultures they represent, to add a history and sadness to the peoples they envelop, shelter, and clothe. gangs of new york was the best film of 2002, but right behind it was the lord of the rings: the two towers.";12 July 2008;10;['major', 'inherent', 'middle', 'original', 'first', 'fine', 'first', 'different', 'gimli', 'latter', 'entertaining', 'glossed', 'enough', 'epic', 'large', 'set', 'last', 'little', 'more', 'special', 'good', 'first', 'much', 'good'];0.2362155388471178

720;Sithlord-20;"contains spoilers let me start by saying that i thought ""fellowship"" was as close to perfection as film gets. a brilliant realization of the classic book, of which i am also a devout fan. but unlike other tolkien devotees, i will not criticize this adaptation simply because it alters certain aspects of the novel. it is a necessary evil in converting a written medium to a visual one. i did not have a problem with arwen's expanded role in ""fellowship,"" nor did i lament the loss of such characters as tom bombadil. all the changes peter jackson made to the first book worked sublimely well on screen. but he was not so wise in his adaptation of ""the two towers."" many changes he made simply do not work. and by ""not work,"" i mean in a purely cinematic sense. my reservations include: 1) aragorn going over the cliff. this is redundant in that the same thing happened to gandalf. it is not suspenseful because in every trailer and tv spot we have seen aragorn fight in the battle of helm's deep. it also dedicates far too much screen time to getting him back to the keep, thus slowing the film and accomplishing nothing save for forcing an unnecessary appearance of arwen. 2) the ents get tricked. the oldest, wisest beings in middle-earth yet they have no idea what's going on, nor do they offer to help until they are tricked by merry and pippin. defeats the whole purpose of the entmoot scene and belittles their characters. 3) shelob pushed to the 3rd film. i don't care what anyone says, this was a huge mistake. as written in the novels, the climax of ""towers"" is a perfect, classic cliffhanger. it would have been on par with ""the empire strikes back,"" when han is whisked away by boba fett and luke learns a little about his family tree. now imagine if ""empire"" had ended before the lightsaber duel between luke and vader and you get some idea of the error jackson made here. he instead gives us a brief, anticlimactic aside to osgilath where nothing really happens that hasn't happened before. worst of all was sam gamgee turning into sam rockne with a ""some things are worth fighting for"" speech that was so corny it made me laugh. i also felt the film didn't flow very well and could have been edited together much better. at several points in the movie i checked my watch and wondered, ""i haven't seen frodo and sam for about 45 minutes. what the hell happened to that story?"" in comparison, watch any of the ""star wars"" films and marvel at how perfectly they balance and fade to several concurrent story lines. ""towers"" lacked this fluidity. aside from these flaws, however, i greatly enjoyed ""towers."" its action sequences are unparalleled and the casting remains perfect. for pure visual flair this series sets the benchmark for everything else out there. i eagerly await ""the return of the king,"" which will hopefully live up to ""fellowship."" the first film in this trilogy ranks a 10, but ""towers"" falters slightly and falls to an 8. score: 8/10";31 December 2002;8;['close', 'brilliant', 'classic', 'devout', 'other', 'certain', 'necessary', 'visual', 'such', 'first', 'wise', 'many', 'cinematic', 'aragorn', 'redundant', 'same', 'suspenseful', 'aragorn', 'deep', 'much', 'unnecessary', 'old', 'wise', 'middle', 'whole', 'huge', 'perfect', 'classic', 'little', 'brief', 'anticlimactic', 'bad', 'worth', 'several', 'several', 'concurrent', 'unparalleled', 'perfect', 'pure', 'visual', 'first'];0.1651334776334777

734;chrishend;well, roughly 720 comments in ... there probably isn't much i can say that hasn't been repeated a few dozen times in other posts. but, oh well, i've always enjoyed redundancy (and i do have a few new things). not to mention i also enjoy redundancy. first off, let's get one thing straight. this is a good movie. a very good movie. compared to any other movie you'll see this coming year, chances are they won't come close. it was action packed, the cgi and setting was engrossing, and the 3hr or so running time went by very quickly. however! this movie simply was not as good as the first one. there were many things that either broke up the flow, or undermined the amount of suspense that could've otherwise been built into the movie. this movie could've been perhaps among the best of all time, but due to some planning errors it turned out to just be extremely good. cases in point: *spoilers throughout* 1. the gandalf fight with the balrog at the beginning. this fight was cool as hell, and was a pretty good way to open the movie, but one of the coolest things about experiencing the story the first time (reading the book) is thinking that gandalf is probably really dead and then when he does finally make his appearance as the white rider, he's the coolest thing on 2 legs. in the movie this is spoiled since we know he's most likely alive from the outset, and then when there's talk of the white rider and gandalf does finally show up it is something we've just been sitting around waiting for, not a shocking surprise that adds to the legend that is (or should be) gandalf. in the book you don't really even know how the hell he got out of that extremely sticky situation, and it almost adds to the awe. 2. aragorn's fall down the cliff. waste of time. happened to gandalf and we knew he was okay. what was the point of doing basically the same thing over again with aragorn? totally redundant and unsuspenseful. 3. gimli the disney character. after reading many posts i see i wasn't the only one annoyed with his complete demotion to comical sideshow. on the plus side he was often funny. on the minus side, he was no longer gimli the bada** from the book, he became gimli the stooge. what's worse than this however, much worse, is his jokes constantly undermined the tension and danger that should've been building with the helm's gate battle. more than a couple times things were looking bad, we were getting worried about our heroes and their present situation, and then gimli says/does something goofy that totally takes us out of the story and reminds us these people are really in no peril at all because they're the heroes and this is nothing but a movie. a basic rule is: when people are engrossed in a dangerous situation, it's usually not a good idea to make them laugh. i know they were just trying to lighten things up due to the darkness of this second film, but jackson should've just gone with the darkness. sometimes things are dark for a reason. 4. the cuts to treebeard treebeard was pretty cool, but everytime they cut to these scenes i could feel the movie go straight into a pile of sludge. pip and merry on his shoulder, helm's deep, pip and merry on his shoulder, repeat, etc. i don't think they could've picked a worse point in time to put the treebeard thread. add in the gimli distractions to these cuts to treebeard and to me it really hurt what could've been an amazing sequence. 5. orcs way too wussy. the first movie also suffered from this pretty badly, but there i don't think it hurt the story. here it does. orcs apparently are easier to kill than flies, and therefore why should i worry about these people at helm's deep? seeing aragorn and gimli alone on the bridge against the entire orc army and not being completely over-run was excessively lame, almost unforgivably so. that scene shouldn't have ever made the movie, and once again took me right out of the story. the horses splitting through the orc army like water as they sped out of helm's deep was also lame. in the actual fighting scenes from helm's deep i never really got the feeling that a battle which could go either way was occuring. it just looked fantastic, and that's all. 6. intrusive music. for all of you that will buy this movie and watch it a million times (like i will probably), watch for this. there are scenes of dialogue and events where not much is happening really, but this dramatic music is just blaring, almost drowning out their speech. i got the feeling that if jackson was to film 2 regular people drinking coffee and reading the morning paper it'd be accompanied by a 50 piece symphonic orchestra playing the most dramatic and emotionally charged music they could find. i found this very annoying. 7. the revamped faramir while this scene was going on i was thinking back to the book trying to remember if faramir ever took them back to gondor. i didn't think so, and i know exactly why ... because it'd be dumb. up to this point we'd been following frodo, sam and gollum go through mordor, head up to the black gate,etc ... they are on this supposedly dangerous trek and then suddenly... oh wait they're back in gondor now. so they get to do everything over again? guess we just wasted our time watching them all this time. hell, let's just stick em back in the shire again and start the movie over. i couldn't see anything that added to the movie by this little stunt of jacksons. if you wanted to put our triumvirate in danger or show the weakness of men or whatever, there's ample opportunities to do so without trivializing trekking through mordor, as if going in and out is like going outside to fetch the mail. plus they treat faramir as a dolt basically, instead of the very cool character he actually is. i found it pointless. unless they've got plans for him in the next movie, they might as well have just cut him out completely and not ruined the vibe sam,frodo and goll had going. that's about it for my peeves tho. overall i did think it was a great movie, there were just a bunch of little things like those above that kept interrupting the flow for me, or that seemed pointless. because of that i have to give the nod to the first movie, since i thought it did what it was suppose to do a bit better than this film.;24 December 2002;10;['much', 'few', 'other', 'few', 'new', 'straight', 'good', 'good', 'other', 'close', 'good', 'first', 'many', 'good', 'good', 'gandalf', 'cool', 'good', 'cool', 'first', 'dead', 'white', 'cool', 'alive', 'white', 'shocking', 'sticky', 'okay', 'same', 'redundant', 'unsuspenseful', 'many', 'only', 'annoyed', 'complete', 'comical', 'plus', 'funny', 'gimli', 'gimli', 'bad', 'bad', 'more', 'bad', 'worried', 'present', 'gimli', 'basic', 'dangerous', 'good', 'second', 'dark', 'cool', 'deep', 'bad', 'treebeard', 'gimli', 'amazing', 'wussy', 'first', 'easy', 'deep', 'aragorn', 'gimli', 'entire', 'lame', 'lame', 'actual', 'deep', 'fantastic', 'intrusive', 'much', 'dramatic', 'regular', 'symphonic', 'dramatic', 'annoying', 'dumb', 'black', 'dangerous', 'little', 'ample', 'cool', 'pointless', 'next', 'great', 'little', 'pointless', 'first', 'well'];0.0355194805194804

736;Youngbuck11;i'd say that this is the most action oriented film of the trilogy. it has so many cgi achievements that it isn't even funny. and, in terms of action, tops the fellowship by a long shot. this is a much more gritty war film, though, and doesn't have the cheery magical feel that the first film has. this is an action packed film that is pretty long. the only problem is, though i wouldn't really call it a problem, that it is kind of slow until we finally get to the big battle at the end. the merry and pippin story is, obviously, the slowest because they are with tree-beard. but i enjoy watching those scenes. they are so awesome from a animation point-of-view. but once you get to the battle and when the ents start destroying isengard, it's awesome!! (not that the whole film isn't). i think, though, that this is of the three films has the worst replay value. this is an awesome film to see in theaters and, maybe, watch it on dvd once or twice. but you can't watch it all the way through like you can fellowship without nodding off a few times. but still, this is an epic film that i love and wouldn't change a thing. -chris;4 September 2006;10;['most', 'many', 'funny', 'long', 'gritty', 'cheery', 'magical', 'first', 'long', 'only', 'slow', 'big', 'slow', 'awesome', 'awesome', 'whole', 'bad', 'awesome', 'few', 'epic'];0.2199999999999999

740;ryanh-00630;"a story generally consists of three acts; the first act is the beginning where you introduce your story & its characters. the second act is the middle part where the majority of the plot surfaces & character development takes place. and the third & final act is where you tie up all the loose ends & bring your entire tale to a satisfying conclusion. before penning down these stories, almost every writer has a very clear conscience of how to begin & end their tales but the most troublesome part for each one of them is always the middle act. because no matter how great the opening or closing part may be, if this vital act isn't handled well, the overall experience of the entire story will unfortunately amount to nothing. and that's true for whether you are writing a book or a play or a movie. the lord of the rings: the two towers is that middle act of peter jackson's on-screen adaptation of j.r.r tolkien's middle-earth saga. and because, just like the novel, the lord of the rings is meant to be viewed as a single film edited into three parts of which the two towers is the second part, there is no definite beginning or ending to this film. plus, what's even more challenging this time is the fact that unlike the first film, which had a single plot to focus on, the two towers deals with multiple storylines & has to make each one work efficiently in order to accomplish its goal. nevertheless, the great news is that even though the two towers doesn't follow the novel's story as faithfully as the fellowship of the ring did, it still succeeds as one rare sequel that improves upon the original and, just like its predecessor, is one of the greatest films of its genre. picking up right from where the fellowship of the ring signed off, the two towers tells the aftermath of the breaking of the fellowship & intercuts three storylines. the first plot line concerns frodo & sam, who are continuing their journey to mordor to destroy the one ring but soon their peril deepens as there is another who hunts the ring. the second plot line deals with merry & pippin, who were captured by uruk-hai in the last film but manage to escape, meet treebeard the ent & help to plan an attack on isengard, where saruman is breeding a massive army. the third plot line covers the trio of aragorn, legolas & gimli who, while pursuing the flock of uruk-hai that took merry & pippin hostage, meet an unexpected ally and then make their way to rohan where saruman has king theoden under his spell while an impending war looms upon those free lands. the title refers to the union between the two towers; barad-dur, fortress of the dark lord sauron & orthanc, stronghold of the wizard saruman. the direction by peter jackson doesn't lose any of its potency for this sequel as the two towers manages to live up to all hype & expectations, which was even more this time considering the massive critical & financial success of the first film. and not only it delivers everything it promised but also shows major improvements in almost all filmmaking departments. the three story lines are extremely well written & narrated and enough time is given to develop every single one of its new characters, without interrupting the development arc of any of the reprising cast. also, the film smoothly switches from one plot to another without confusing its viewers and the decision to conclude this film at a different event from the novel makes sense for it sets a perfect stage for the finale. narrating multiple stories within the same film is never an easy task but peter jackson has done it again & what's even more admirable is that he gave equal importance & value to all three storylines. coming to the technical aspects, all filmmaking departments get significant upgrades & are more fine-tuned this time. the production design continues to impress as the miniatures used to represent rohan, helm's deep & osgiliath are meticulously detailed down to the smallest of things, thus making art direction & set decoration a winning aspect, once again. still, what makes these sets look even more appealing is their ideal fusion with the beautifully photographed landscapes of new zealand. the cinematography immerses the viewers into middle-earth just like its predecessor, and the camerawork is at its absolute best when it comes to the film's action sequences. make-up & costume design stay true to the timeline it depicts. sound feels more authentic this time & is spot-on where it matters most. editing trims the film down to 179 minutes & although it's very effective in that 3 hours of runtime, i recommend the extended version instead as it adds 45 minutes of new & extended scenes and further develops the film's characters, adds greater depth to its plot & enriches the overall experience of the two towers. weta digital made history with the fellowship of the ring when it brought alive middle-earth in breathtaking detail but the enhancements it brings in the visual effects of the two towers is even more groundbreaking. gollum & treebeard are entirely computer-generated & it was a vfx milestone of its time. but it's the battle of helm's deep where the visuals are at its finest and without this team's creativity & breakthroughs, it wouldn't rank today as one of the greatest screen battles of all time. another scene where visuals really shine, but doesn't get as much credit as it deserves, is the flooding of isengard sequence, which undeniably is one hell of an eye-opener you don't see in cinema very often. finally, the background score by howard shore introduces new tracks for rohan, gollum & many more sequences while the music heard in the first chapter further develops & expands into new realms. splendid where it is meant to be, touching where it needs to be & magnificently pleasing to the viewers' senses, the soundtrack of the two towers is an outstanding follow-up to its predecessor and continues to enhance the emotional journey of this exceptional adventure. as far as the performances go, the two towers doesn't disappoint in this aspect & adds even more strength to its ensemble cast. the new cast is no let down but another right step in the right direction while the reprising cast continues to evolve with their respective characters. everyone from frodo, sam, merry, pippin to aragorn, legolas & gimli has a stronger sense of their characters in comparison to the last film. however, ian mckellen, who plays gandalf, gets a fresh makeover in this film & has a new dimension to explore. amongst the new cast, making their presence felt are bernard hill as theoden; king of rohan, miranda otto as eowyn; theoden's niece, david wenham as faramir; boromir's younger brother, brad dourif as grima wormtongue; saruman's agent at rohan, karl urban as eomer; theoden's nephew & john rhys-davies as voice of the treebeard; leader of the ents. but the most notable amongst both the new & reprising cast turns out to be none other than andy serkis' rendition of gollum / smeagol. heartwarming & heartbreaking at the same time, serkis' gives this cgi character its very own soul and delivers such an intense, energetic & show-stealing performance that it's impossible to not love as well as pity this wretched character. easily the finest performance of the saga, so far. director peter jackson & his crew, in spite of deviating greatly from the film's source material, not only succeed in making the middle part of the lord of the rings a smooth continuation of the fellowship of the ring but also a worthy expansion & evolution of middle-earth. the artistic license taken by jackson, walsh & boyens does alter the overall tone & style of the film but they still manage to keep everything very much within the realms of tolkien's world & true to its spirits. also, if one envisions this second chapter as an adaptation of the middle act of tolkien's complete novel rather than conceiving it as an adaptation of only the second volume, then the writers' decisions start to make much more sense. and honestly, apart from few purists, most won't even mind this tweaking because, in spite of all the modifications, the two towers makes up for another successful, spellbinding & engrossing epic that effortlessly blends art & entertainment into a staggering masterpiece. on an overall scale, the lord of the rings: the two towers is another landmark film of its genre that ably meets & exceeds the genre-defining standards set by its predecessor, breaks many filmmaking barriers of its genre with its revolutionary production and signs off as an extremely satisfying sequel which sets an even higher benchmark for the final chapter of tolkien's legendarium.";16 September 2019;10;['first', 'second', 'middle', 'third', 'final', 'loose', 'entire', 'clear', 'troublesome', 'middle', 'great', 'vital', 'overall', 'entire', 'true', 'middle', 'middle', 'single', 'second', 'definite', 'challenging', 'first', 'single', 'multiple', 'great', 'rare', 'original', 'great', 'first', 'second', 'last', 'massive', 'third', 'unexpected', 'impending', 'free', 'dark', 'more', 'massive', 'critical', 'financial', 'first', 'major', 'enough', 'single', 'new', 'different', 'perfect', 'multiple', 'same', 'easy', 'admirable', 'equal', 'technical', 'significant', 'deep', 'small', 'appealing', 'ideal', 'middle', 'absolute', 'good', 'true', 'authentic', 'effective', 'extended', 'new', 'extended', 'great', 'overall', 'alive', 'middle', 'visual', 'groundbreaking', 'treebeard', 'deep', 'fine', 'great', 'much', 'new', 'many', 'more', 'first', 'new', 'pleasing', 'outstanding', 'emotional', 'exceptional', 'more', 'ensemble', 'new', 'right', 'right', 'respective', 'strong', 'last', 'fresh', 'new', 'new', 'theoden', 'young', 'urban', 'notable', 'new', 'other', 'same', 'own', 'intense', 'energetic', 'impossible', 'wretched', 'fine', 'middle', 'smooth', 'worthy', 'middle', 'artistic', 'overall', 'true', 'second', 'middle', 'complete', 'second', 'more', 'few', 'successful', 'epic', 'staggering', 'overall', 'landmark', 'many', 'revolutionary', 'satisfying', 'high', 'final'];0.1986274628149628

747;BigRichAU;i just bought the dvd of this movie - i will also buy the extended version, but i couldn't wait. i have just watched the first hald so far, but i have to say that seeing it again in the kind of detail a dvd allows just confirmed for me what an incredible, awe-inspiring achievement this trilogy is. there is not a scene that passes during which i do not marvel at the vision and the detail that went into the scripting, sets and props in this film. the world of the riders of rohan is particularly impressive with the horse-head details on eomer's helmet and the hilt of theoden's sword. the fantastic detail of gimli's metalwork and the faded glory of aragorn's clothes. the grass growing on the thatch of the halls of rohan's capital. to see the hall of the riddermark built in that fantastic location takes my breath away. even the minor parts like the costumes of the southron warriors who almost catch frodo and sam outside the devilish black gate of mordor are beautifully designed and fit in with the incredible cultural world that jackson's designers have created. just look at the weave of the elvish cloaks. will we ever see another film so beautifully concieved and so adeptly executed? i just wish the votes went up to 11.;22 September 2003;10;['extended', 'first', 'incredible', 'impressive', 'fantastic', 'faded', 'fantastic', 'minor', 'southron', 'devilish', 'black', 'incredible', 'cultural', 'elvish'];0.4148148148148148

755;darrell-garrison;until 'the two towers' came out, i thought 'road to perdition' was the best movie i had seen for the year. 'the two towers' blows everything else away! peter jackson has outdone himself. when i saw trailers for 'towers' i had the feeling it would be more of the same. not so! the plot and character development are complex and fascinating. woe to those who haven't seen the first film, and know nothing about middle earth! the battle at helm's deep is simply the greatest battle scene in movie history! 'star wars ii' and its massive clone armies is sterile compared to this, and all other older movies with huge battle scenes now seem out of date. the buildup to this battle is tremendous, with fights and flights, hatred and wizardy, and moments of love and humor. many new characters are introduced (wait until you see gollum!). the cinematography in beautiful new zealand is outstanding. helm's deep looks as real as it possibly could. the special effects are perfect! this movie could not have been made as well even five years ago. gollum is the pinnacle of cgi! all credit must go to peter jackson, who has driven himself and his cast and crew to the breaking point, and come out the other side intact with a classic trilogy in hand (there is no way that 'return of the king' can be stinker, so i feel confident using the word 'classic'). remember when you saw the gee-whiz sheen and excitement of 'star wars' and then when you saw 'the empire strikes back' you were taken deeper, got more involved, and realized you were witnessing epic history? same here, and on a grander, more mythical scale. if 'fellowship of the ring' didn't win any major oscars, then unfortunately 'towers' won't either. but it will be a shame if peter jackson is overlooked. this trilogy will most certainly be the pinnacle of his career, and he deserves recognition for his awe-inspiring direction commitment. this is grand filmmaking at its finest, and why we go to movies. make sure you see this on the big screen-- twice at least!;25 January 2003;9;['good', 'more', 'same', 'complex', 'fascinating', 'first', 'middle', 'great', 'massive', 'sterile', 'other', 'old', 'huge', 'tremendous', 'many', 'new', 'beautiful', 'outstanding', 'deep', 'real', 'special', 'perfect', 'other', 'intact', 'classic', 'stinker', 'confident', 'epic', 'same', 'more', 'mythical', 'major', 'grand', 'fine', 'sure', 'big', 'least'];0.2636740784468057

757;squodge;"words cannot express the joy i felt when this second installment of lord of the rings hit the screens. my joy was short-lived, however, as i discovered that this second in the trilogy was as painful as exercising on a push bike with diarrhoea. the first of the trilogy was an excellent film, even for someone like me who isn't a big fan on there so-called 'fantasy epics'. did no one mention to tolkien that he'd just rewritten the conan chronicles, with the only difference being that he couldn't even be bothered to make more female characters? okay, so we know tolkien must have been gay for that reason. no matter. the film of the first book was spectacular - battle scenes like i'd never seen before, dialogue that was crisp and sharp, and i really felt for the characters. the two towers was just the opposite. the fight scenes were nothing new - in fact, if they had taken out all the fight scenes, there would have been nothing left in the film! i'm very disappointed that they didn't make this film more dialogue-driven rather than effects and battle-driven. granted that the book has numerous battles, to me this translated badly onto the cellular screen. for me, films must be adapted from books, not merely copied scene-for-scene. one person commented that this film require a new scale because 10 cannot do it justice. erm, 10 means perfection; and as far as i'm concerned, no film ever deserves a 10. the godfather comes close, so does star wars (episode 4), and perhaps casablanca. watching the two towers gave me the same feeling of disappointment that i felt when i watched matrix reloaded - it put me off wanting to watch the final installment. which is a shame, because the last of the trilogy (both matrix and lotr) is much better than the second of the trilogy in both cases. in terms of 'completeness', i would recommend watching this film only because you need it to bridge the first and third lotr films. if you want to watch a film purely for its entertainment value, you're better off watching ""i, robot"". at least you get to see will smith get beaten up many times lol. the two towers scores a generous 3/10 for me, only because you need it to watch the far superior final installment.";10 January 2005;3;['second', 'painful', 'first', 'excellent', 'big', 'only', 'more', 'female', 'gay', 'first', 'spectacular', 'crisp', 'sharp', 'new', 'disappointed', 'more', 'numerous', 'cellular', 'new', 'close', 'same', 'final', 'last', 'well', 'first', 'third', 'well', 'least', 'many', 'generous', 'superior', 'final'];0.1338664421997755

763;turbo_issa;the way it started was very effective in my opinion. to have the scene of where gandalf the grey falls in kazad dum and the words he says to the balrog gets louder and louder while we are looking at the mountains, and then becomes the loudest when we are in kazad dum. then we actually see gandalf fall, and bam! we are with frodo and he has had a dream about how gandalf fell. that was done beautifully. regarding the two hobbits, i think it was done effectively how we see that they cannot go to mordor without gollum. the scenes we gollum were excellent! i loved it how we would see the two sides of gollum, and how we would converse with his two selves. the defeat of 'bad gollum' and the return of 'bad gollum' in the movie was excellent. back to the three companions, aragorn, legolas and gimli and them running after the orcs who have taken pippin and merry. gimli stole the show most of the time. i adored him so much, more than part one in this movie. i loved how the men of rohan stop them and eomer says to gimli what is you name and he says tell me yours first, then eomer goes i will have you killed or something along those lines, and our favourite elf goes 'you will die before you axe falls', i was cheering. i loved that part in the book and i am so glad it was in the movie. the actor karl urban, who played eomer nailed his character. i kept on thinking to myself when he had left the kingdom of rohan, we will see him, we will see him, but we only see him at the end with gandalf. and that part i was going to jump and scream 'yahoo!' he gave his character so much life, integrity, strength and charm that i like the character of eomer even more than i did before. i was a bit disappointed not to have seen more of eomer, but i guess in number three we will see more of him. the woman who plays lady ewoyn was good, and i liked her. okay king theoden, he was good, but not the way i imagined. the way he came back to life after gandalf drove saruman out of him, and then we see saruman fall back was good. now for the best part, the battle for helms deep. i was gripping my hands to my seats, then i'd be covering my mouth in terror and then i would be clapping when they'd have a minor victory. i loved how legolas used the shield armour and did that surf boarding movement and shoot with his arrow at the orcs. i could not help it, i went 'yeah!' and then i clapped, the whole cinema soon followed my lead. gimli was so great in the battle of helms deep. he was the comic relief, also a tough warrior. every scene that our dwarf was in, made the scene that much better. did anyone think there was a bit too much aragorn in this film? why so much kissing with him and arwen? hugo weaving is one of the best actors of our time. he is lord elrond. i really loved the scene with galadrial and how she is talking to elrond and she is telling him of the battle that men are facing, and how the elves are leaving and we hear her speak while the men are getting ready for war. the parts of when galadrial, sam would be talking to another character and the scenes would be on where the different people were, was good in the sense that it kept on reassuring the audience that all, no mater where they were and who they were with were going through the same thing and kept the story moving along. when the elves go to fight alongside the men [i was soooooo happy, i was clapping again] got me all excited, i was like this is it, this is what the movie has been building for. again i will say the battle of helms deep was done to perfection. it was like i was there and i was going to fight, i felt the terror and the excitement all at once. i was upset when halder died. i was shocked and heartbroken. the ents! i really liked them. merry and pippin again fulfilled their roles beautiful. the ents scenes were a treat to watch. the battle of isengard was great with the ents. faramir was more sinister in this film, but very courage's at the end. i can't wait to see the scenes with faramir and his father, because as we now know he has forfeited his life to let the hobbits go. now know that all who have read the books say that the ending was cut out, with sheolob, pippin finding the ball, gandalf knocking on the door and so on. yet remember folks that out of all three books, the third one is the shortest and the end parts are made of appendices entirely. i thought the ending with gollum leaving everyone in suspicion of this 'she' that he is taking them too was good. i stayed up last night thinking, i loved the two towers, so why is there some people who did not, and came up with these theories of why people may have been disappointed in this film, and preferred number one more. 1. the fellowship broke. i know you would all think, duh that's what happened in number one, but i think people did not understand what it would do in number two. they were all in different areas, meeting different characters battling different things. so the audience had to concentrate on the different scenes and what people were doing. 2. the movie suffers from being the middle of the trilogy. my sister said that she needed closure. people may be sitting there going, we started with frodo going to mordor, and he is still going to mordor. 3. new characters to take in 4. it was less emotional than number.;1 January 2003;10;['effective', 'loud', 'loud', 'gandalf', 'excellent', 'bad', 'bad', 'excellent', 'gimli', 'gimli', 'most', 'much', 'more', 'gimli', 'favourite', 'glad', 'much', 'disappointed', 'more', 'more', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'deep', 'minor', 'whole', 'gimli', 'great', 'deep', 'comic', 'tough', 'aragorn', 'much', 'good', 'ready', 'galadrial', 'different', 'good', 'same', 'happy', 'excited', 'upset', 'shocked', 'beautiful', 'great', 'sinister', 'very', 'gandalf', 'third', 'short', 'good', 'last', 'preferred', 'more', 'different', 'different', 'different', 'different', 'new', 'emotional'];0.2451590371803138

778;steve49er;the two towers is the middle piece of tolkien's masterful fantasy, the lord of the rings. although written to entertain children, this story becomes pg-13 entertainment on the screen. this section of the author's tale is actually many stories in one. following the first installment, the fellowship, it continues to follow the surviving characters as they now move along different paths. differing but related plots involve two seperated pair of hobbits, one pair moving toward evil mordor in an attempt to destroy the ring, the second, captured by the enemy, to eventually escape and take on the battle of one of the two towers. other plots involve the transformation of gandalf the gray wizard into a more powerful being, and the battles for two human cities. a new character, once known as gollum is soon recognized as a relative of the hobbits. utterly destroyed by long possession of the ring this character truely bears the name smeagol. he is a wonderfully digitized character. it was most difficult to believe that smeagol was an animation. the story starts with the continuing battle of gandalf and the creature in the caves of moria. it continues, non stop with action and battle after action and battle. the war scenes are terrific. if not a fantasy, these scenes would rate with the battles of private ryan. as with the battle scenes, the entire movie is terrific, rating a strong 5. hopefully, the academy can allow itself to give a best movie oscar to a show made purely for entertainment. if ever a movie didn't disappoint after reading the book, this is it. a warning however, two towers is very graphic. it may have been written for children, but this director undoubtably made it for those of us that first read it years ago, and are now adults. it may give young tots nightmares.;1 January 2003;10;['middle', 'masterful', 'many', 'first', 'different', 'seperated', 'evil', 'second', 'other', 'gray', 'powerful', 'human', 'new', 'long', 'difficult', 'terrific', 'private', 'entire', 'terrific', 'strong', 'good', 'graphic', 'young'];0.083080808080808

781;0rganism;as a fan of tolkien's books, i had high hopes for this movie, which were partially realized and partially dashed to pieces. my reaction was torn, i wanted to thank peter jackson for his dedication and wack him with a frozen tuna, at the same time. the film contains its own internal metaphor in the split character of gollum. in fact, i'll start by praising andy serkis and the cgi team's rendition of gollum. that in itself was worth the price of admission. the supporting actor awards from saturn, ofcs, and ves were well deserved. easy as it might be to find flaws with jackson's renditions of certain characters or plot elements, gollum is above reproach and interacts with the hobbits amazingly well. also well done are the short battle scenes twixt gandalf and the balrog. gandalf's character is generally well played, and most of the scenes with gandalf are satisfying. as a sensory spectacle, everything about this movie is breathtaking. the cinematographers, costumers, and set designers should be lauded for impeccable work. the cgi is overdone at points, but perfect in others. i cannot fault the effects. the sound is solid, and unlike the first film in the series, everything that needs to be heard can be heard. so where is the split? where does it go wrong? well, i can't help but feel that jackson has done a great disservice to tolkien's original vision, at the same time he does it homage. where characters were simply omitted from the fellowship of the ring (bombadil, goldberry, old man willow, barrow wights, etc.), in the two towers they are mutilated beyond recognition. the worst damage is done to the ents and faramir. the ents are among the oldest creatures in middle earth, valuing cautious deliberation and patience above all else. in this movie, they are depicted as hasty. never would i have thought to see a hasty ent! not only that, whereas in the books they decide to assist the rohirrim and depose saruman through patient deliberation, in this film they are duped into it. simply unforgivable. faramir, likewise, makes a transition to the screen which transforms his formerly wise and cautious character into one of paranoia and bungling. rather than the stark contrast with sibling boromir, we get more of the same. it would have been easy enough to conceive a script in which these characters stay true to tolkien's inspired vision without extending it unnecessarily -- indeed, the entire scene at osgiliath is tacked on via faramir's distorted character. these are the real crimes against j.r.r. tolkien, as i see it. the matters of the exodus from edoras, the elven contingent at helm's deep, arwen's interactions with elrond and aragorn, these are all reasonable liberties imho. they further character development more-or-less in keeping with the spirit of the original, and may serve in resolving portions of the final film that omissions in the first film complicate (e.g., where will meriadoc get a blade from the gondolin wars, if not from the barrow wight?). it is those added scenes and dialogs which outright destroy perfectly filmable characters that remind me of melkor's orcish perversion of iluvatar's elves. the movie is still enjoyable, and for those who have not read the books or who care little for source integrity, it will likely be excellent. i give it a 7, overall.;13 November 2003;7;['high', 'frozen', 'same', 'own', 'internal', 'split', 'worth', 'deserved', 'certain', 'short', 'most', 'satisfying', 'sensory', 'impeccable', 'overdone', 'perfect', 'solid', 'first', 'great', 'original', 'same', 'old', 'bad', 'old', 'middle', 'cautious', 'hasty', 'hasty', 'patient', 'unforgivable', 'wise', 'cautious', 'stark', 'more', 'same', 'easy', 'true', 'inspired', 'entire', 'distorted', 'real', 'elven', 'deep', 'aragorn', 'reasonable', 'imho', 'less', 'original', 'final', 'first', 'barrow', 'filmable', 'orcish', 'enjoyable', 'little', 'excellent', 'overall'];0.2343013784461153

784;ccm043;"""the two towers"" is certainly a good film, though, for me, it was not the best of ""the lord of the rings"" trilogy. i preferred ""the fellowship of the ring"", and ""the return of the king"" blew them both out of the water. but ttt is still a good film, and i would recommend it to anyone. being as there are fewer characters introduced, and less exposition for the story, the characters are not bogged down by starting a new story. my favorite plot line is the one that involves frodo, sam, and gollum. gollum is amazingly animated. he is so realistic, and far outdoes dobby from ""harry potter and the chamber of secrets. i also enjoy the relationship between sam and frodo. jackson greatly portrays frodo's descent as he begins to become consumed by the ring. the other plotline, involving aragorn, gimli, legolas, theoden, eowyn, and eomer is still well done, though at times, i feel that some of it could have been left out. the flashbacks to arwen seemed like they were only included to keep her in the memory of the audience. i appreciate jackson's willingness to make this a good film, even if it means making sacrifices to the book. tolkien purists will be even more disappointed with this film than the previous one (though you all probably know that already). a worthy film, one that i would recommend. 7 stars.";9 June 2004;7;['good', 'good', 'good', 'few', 'less', 'new', 'favorite', 'realistic', 'other', 'aragorn', 'gimli', 'good', 'disappointed', 'previous', 'worthy'];0.1944638694638694

786;aucoinandrew;it isn't easy being the middle man in a trilogy but the two towers makes it work. ripe with beautiful scenery, a fully realized middle earth, and a worthy cast, the two towers is an epic in every sense of the word. translating tolkien's detailed work, fraught with tons of characters and plot changes, isn't easy, but peter jackson does a tremendous job albeit the few egregious changes to some of tolkien's characters he felt the need to pursue. but let's start with what peter did well: once again, the production, costume, and special effects teams have transformed middle earth into a living, breathing, world that is intricately detailed and a joy to be a part of (new zealand was a wonderful location to film at). the cinematography is once again top notch, showing middle earth in all its beauty and evil. howard shore once again showcases his beautiful score and enlivens every scene he composed for. the battle of helms deep is, to this day, unmatched in fantasy battles and is easily one of the greatest large scale battles put to film. it is tense, emotional, action packed, and inspiring all at the same time. bernard hill puts on an extremely underrated performance as the king of rohan, bent on saving his people. sean astin, viggo mortenson, andy serkis, miranda otto, and, of course, the great ian mckellan, also cash in with great performances across the board. the second half of this film is absolutely brilliant, using what may have appeared to be a slower first half to propel the action and stakes to new heights. now here's what peter could've done better. to some this may appear nitpicky, but for avid readers of tolkien's work, it's important. treebeard is not this dumb. he is supposed to be wise and reasonable, not ignorant and unstable. peter made his character pretty unlikeable, boring, and childish. they made him look silly when he didn't know about how saruman had destroyed all those trees. faramir is one of my favorite characters in the book, mainly because of his strength. i loved how they treated his character in return of the king but here, they make him into a whiny, slightly self-absorbed, loser, who, in fact, does give into the rings temptations, which, in the book, he does not. this loses a key character trait of faramir and does an injustice to tolkien's view of the character. overall, a strong 9/10. for the most part, save a few character changes, it does justice to the book and continues the story in a nail biting fashion.;22 July 2020;9;['easy', 'middle', 'ripe', 'beautiful', 'middle', 'worthy', 'detailed', 'fraught', 'easy', 'tremendous', 'few', 'egregious', 'special', 'middle', 'detailed', 'wonderful', 'top', 'middle', 'beautiful', 'unmatched', 'great', 'large', 'tense', 'emotional', 'same', 'underrated', 'bent', 'great', 'ian', 'great', 'second', 'brilliant', 'slow', 'first', 'new', 'nitpicky', 'avid', 'important', 'treebeard', 'dumb', 'wise', 'reasonable', 'ignorant', 'unstable', 'unlikeable', 'boring', 'childish', 'silly', 'favorite', 'whiny', 'key', 'strong', 'most', 'few'];0.2357591595396473

789;billreynolds;"i have to say, up front, that i really liked fellowship of the ring a lot. but that movie was three hours long, as is two towers. return of the king is three and a half hours. i understand peter jackson considers this to be ""one"" movie broken up into three parts -- that is, one nine and a half (or eleven, with the extended ""special"" editions) hour movie. that is simply excessive, imho. anytime a movie goes much over two hours it better be for a very, very good reason. when you start talking about a three hour sequel to a three hour original movie, you've got problems -- i don't care how good the original was. maybe godfathers 1 and 2 are the exception. but fotr and ttt are not that good. fotr had a more captivating story line. it was about a small band of brothers on a difficult and daring quest -- to destroy the dangerous ring of power. ttt doesn't have as good of a story line. there is a fundamental problem from the start. it makes no sense that frodo and sam would be left to go to mordor on their own. why would all three of the fellowship's best warriors -- aragon, legolas, and gimli -- go off to save pippin and merry, and not one of them stay with frodo and sam? this makes no sense, and the fact that tolkien wrote it that way is no excuse. isn't the destruction of the ring more important, in the scheme of things, than saving merry and pippin? why not send at least aragorn with frodo and sam -- or send aragorn alone after merry and pippin and send legolas and gimli with frodo and sam? what on earth were frodo and sam supposed to do when they got to mordor on their own? where fotr was a story about a quest, a mission, ttt quickly becomes a tiresome story about a ""war"" between ""good"" and ""evil."" there are so many endless, repetitious, humorless pronouncements in this movie about the stakes of this battle that the theme gets very old very quickly. if i had been the editor i would have excised every line by theoden, aragorn, treebeard, sam, et al. about all that nonsense, cut the movie down to two hours and made it almost pure action. the forces of saruman are presented as so relentlessly, unmitigatingly evil that they are hard to hate. the orcs (or uruk-hai, i assume that's the same thing) are slimy creatures like jim cameron's aliens. they ride cg beasts that look like dinos from jurassic park. sauron is some weird flaming eye on top of a black tower. the only human villain is saruman himself, who has about two lines in the whole three-hour flick. i don't need a lot of motivation for the villains, but i'd like to get at least some idea of why they act as they do. why do they fight? why are they so evil? what's the point? meanwhile, the good guys are all white, the men do all the fighting -- in fact boys of as young as ten or eleven are thrown into battle but not a single woman is. it's just a tiresome, cliched battle of ""good"" against a straw man ""evil."" why are the good guys so humorlessly good while the bad guys are so insanely, relentlessly evil? i was led to believe that smeagol/gollum was the best cg character ever, but in fact he seemed less realistic than jar jar binks and no improvement over the dinos from jurassic park. the only bright spot in the movie was miranda otto. i felt no tension in wondering whether aragorn will choose her or liv tyler -- i assume he will choose tyler, and think he is crazy for doing so. oh, i forgot one other human bad guy -- this ""wormtongue"" fellow. how hard is it to figure out a guy named ""wormtongue"" is up to no good? that's as bad of a name as ""darth sidious.""";13 February 2004;5;['extended', 'special', 'excessive', 'imho', 'very', 'good', 'original', 'good', 'good', 'small', 'difficult', 'daring', 'dangerous', 'good', 'fundamental', 'own', 'good', 'gimli', 'important', 'aragorn', 'gimli', 'own', 'tiresome', 'good', 'many', 'endless', 'repetitious', 'old', 'theoden', 'aragorn', 'pure', 'evil', 'hard', 'same', 'slimy', 'weird', 'black', 'only', 'human', 'whole', 'least', 'evil', 'good', 'white', 'young', 'single', 'tiresome', 'cliched', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'bad', 'evil', 'good', 'realistic', 'jar', 'only', 'bright', 'aragorn', 'crazy', 'other', 'human', 'bad', 'wormtongue', 'bad'];0.0478231292517006

804;cynharm;"contains spoilers rarely do i walk into a movie theatre with this much anticipation and expectations high as they were for the two towers. only when viewing a star wars movie am i this pumped, this high on what i am about to see. i expect an out-of-body experience and dammit, i better get it. the fact that the two towers delivered the goods when my expectations were so high is the biggest compliment i can give this film. like a star wars film, there are so many incredible cinematic moments that make the two towers worth the price of admission; the vertigo inducing fall of gandalf and the balrog which opens the film, the creation of gollum- both as a cg benchmark and as the best new character in the film, the shot of the trolls opening the black gate, the battle between the riders of rohan on horseback and orcs on wargs, the fearful deep bass sound of the nazgul on wings, the exorcism of theoden, the arrow attack on the giant olipants, and of course, the colossal and desperate battle of helm's deep. again, as in star wars, it is the characters that work so well to bring the two towers to life. just like i did when i saw attack of the clones, i spent the first half hour of the two towers with a silly grin on my face... simply because i was in the company of these great characters again. the music too, is also a character. when howard shore's themes first rolled through the movie theatre, i felt like i was visiting an old friend. in the fellowship of the ring, it was frodo and gandalf that carried the film. in the two towers, legolas, gimli and aragon find themselves carrying the weight of the story, with the quest of the ringbearer playing second fiddle to the battle for rohan. gandalf, sadly, plays a small yet pivotal role, while the supporting characters are given a chance step to the forefront. gimli especially, who suffered from trimmed screen time in the theatrical installment of the fellowship of the ring, is brought to life here with fire and brimstone by john rhys-davies - not to mention some much needed, and quite effortless, comic relief for this grim chapter of the story. but who knew about orlando bloom? nothing in the first part of the trilogy prepared me for the charisma and confidence he brings to legolas in the two towers. bloom displays remarkable power and grace in every aspect of his performance, from his quiet moments of pain and confusion when he believes merry and pippen to be slaughtered, to the fear and anger he expresses to agagorn when he knows they are facing certain doom at helm's deep. plus legolas is so damn cool. when he deftly swings himself up onto a horse in slow motion, i almost screamed with delight. but by far the best character in the two towers is gollum. not only is he a masterpiece of cg, but he is wonderfully, performed, written and directed. the scenes of his split personality having heated arguments with himself are the most mesmerizing in the film. especially subtle is the confrontation with faramir when he huddles in a stony alcove with his back to us, his hands gently stroking his own shoulder when smeagol speaks, then shaking with fists of rage when gollum possesses him. brilliant. technically, gollum's cg interaction with frodo and sam are seamless. they fight, grapple, touch each other, grab at each other's clothing - all with utter believability. the scenes at the foot of the black gate are especially impressive as gollum desperately pulls at frodo's cloak. the cg gollum, the cg cloak, and the real cloak worn by elijah wood are all completely believable in the frame. the illusion is perfect. i have but one quibble with gollum: he looks terrible in his very first shot! the first time we see his face when he is crawling down the rock face with the moon behind him is so cg! it's the only shot of gollum that looks bad and it's the very first one! in terms of story, the two towers suffers the same unfortunately fate as the first film - there is simply too much crammed into the three hours. the film needs to breathe and settle down. characters need to be fleshed out and given a moment or two more to develop. the two towers suffers the opposite fate of attack of the clones: it needs to be longer! while the rohan plot-line works superbly and drives the bulk of the momentum, the supporting subplots sputter and falter as the film enters it's second half. merry and pippen start off with all the fixings of their own fantastic little adventure, but then end up literally stuck in a tree for over an hour of screen time. luckily, they march off to war in spectacular fashion with the ents to save the plot line, but for the most part they disappear from the second half of the movie. worse is the plight of the ringbearer in his quest to find entry into mordor. with gollum and sam playing well off their mutual dislike of each other, and frodo fearfully watching the sky for the wraiths circling overhead, all the cards are in place for this subplot to really be spectacular. it isn't. a bored-looking david wenham shows up as boromir's brother, faramir, and the whole quest grinds to a halt. these scenes obviously play great importance to the fate of gondor which will be explored in the final chapter, but here they are thrown at us quickly and with little foreshadowing. we are pulled away from the borders of mordor to deal with a character we know little about, and who's plight isn't particularly interesting, especially compared to the epic drama that rohan is facing. worse, we don't know what frodo, sam, or even aragorn think about the situation in gondor. all we get is some brief voice over from cate blancett. it's far too expository to engage us and the drama falls flat because of it. the main reason this happens is because there isn't any time for peter jackson an company to tell this part of the story. jackson, as he was with the fellowship of the ring, is fighting the clock to try and get tolkien's four-hundred-plus pages crammed into a three hour theatrical release. frodo's quest suffers because of it. faramir needs to be set up with the same drama and intrigue as king theoden is set up, but that would mean lengthening the film by at least twenty minutes - something that jackson doesn't have the luxury of doing. we can only hope that when the dvd comes out that jackson is able to work the same magic as he did with the fellowship of the ring - the special edition.";16 January 2003;10;['much', 'high', 'high', 'about', 'high', 'big', 'many', 'incredible', 'cinematic', 'worth', 'vertigo', 'good', 'new', 'black', 'fearful', 'deep', 'giant', 'colossal', 'desperate', 'deep', 'star', 'first', 'half', 'silly', 'great', 'old', 'gimli', 'second', 'small', 'pivotal', 'gimli', 'theatrical', 'much', 'effortless', 'comic', 'grim', 'first', 'remarkable', 'quiet', 'certain', 'deep', 'cool', 'slow', 'good', 'split', 'mesmerizing', 'subtle', 'own', 'brilliant', 'seamless', 'other', 'other', 'utter', 'black', 'impressive', 'real', 'believable', 'perfect', 'quibble', 'terrible', 'first', 'first', 'cg', 'only', 'bad', 'first', 'same', 'first', 'more', 'opposite', 'long', 'second', 'own', 'fantastic', 'little', 'spectacular', 'most', 'second', 'bad', 'mutual', 'other', 'spectacular', 'bored', 'whole', 'great', 'final', 'little', 'little', 'interesting', 'epic', 'bad', 'aragorn', 'brief', 'expository', 'flat', 'main', 'theatrical', 'same', 'able', 'same', 'special'];0.1167658108175349
805;mdenvee;"actually, correction- nearly the most overrated. the 3rd installment clearly holds that title due to its baffling best picture win. but part 2 is just as awful. coming from a sci-fi and fantasy fan, i take no pride in my distaste for this movie franchise. and part 1 was at least ""watchable"". but part 2 almost succeeded with me walking out of the theatre from boredom. i can state the positive aspects easily- the film has wonderful scenery and special effects. so, if that is the limit of your appreciation of films, then you will love the movie. but all that is left is disappointment and painful boredom. let's begin with the bad acting- everyone overacts, looking too serious at the wrong times and to whimsical and emotional at equally wrong times. the movie and the director makes the assumption that the audience immediately empathizes with the characters in the movie, without proper build/development. it is quite presumptuous of the director to think that most people are as in love with these characters as he is and the loyal fans of the books. next, there are way too many close-ups on the faces and eyes of everyone, showing every pimple and every gray hair... do we need this? this also goes double for the orks and bad guys- how disgusting do they have to be? way overkill- the director tries too hard to exaggerate the grossness. these close-ups are made more painful from the slowness of the filming, which is 3x longer than normal movies- it is like each expression is in slow motion. combine this with tortuously long dialogue- each character carries on forever it seems expressing thoughts that are ""force-fit"" into shakespearean prose. this makes the film incredibly ponderous and worsens the overacting. some further points of disgust for me is the time and focus on the hobbits and making them out to be such a vital part of the good guys winning- newsflash, they are all completely useless and trouble-making and it's annoying and humiliating to have them all play such important roles. other things that bugged me bigtime is the fact that gandolf exhibits little or no sorcery or magic in all 3 films! all he does is make speeches and talk in a deep voice and use his staff as a sword- what is so powerful about him? yawn. another stupid aspect is the ratio of bad guys to good guys during the battles- it's like 100 to 1. and the bad guys each look 10x bigger and stronger, yet are felled by a single arrow in the shoulder? please. the worse thing of the 2nd and 3rd films is the introduction of the special effects gollum creature, whose irritating raspy monologues occupies a large portion of both films- i felt incredibly stupid paying attention to this computer animated creature whine and eat fish. finally, the whole trilogy is about a silly ring which is utterly ridiculous and especially difficult for the audience to believe as so important and earth shattering. and as others have pointed out, the ring (and hobbit) could have been easily flown via gandolf's winged creatures to the fire pit in an hour and avoided all the battles and quests and pointlessness. to any who not seen the film- avoid this slow-moving yawn fest at all costs.";26 March 2013;1;['overrated', 'good', 'awful', 'least', 'watchable', 'positive', 'wonderful', 'special', 'disappointment', 'painful', 'bad', 'serious', 'wrong', 'whimsical', 'emotional', 'wrong', 'proper', 'presumptuous', 'most', 'loyal', 'many', 'close', 'gray', 'double', 'bad', 'disgusting', 'hard', 'close', 'painful', 'long', 'normal', 'slow', 'long', 'fit', 'shakespearean', 'ponderous', 'further', 'vital', 'good', 'useless', 'annoying', 'humiliating', 'such', 'important', 'other', 'little', 'deep', 'powerful', 'stupid', 'bad', 'good', 'bad', 'big', 'strong', 'single', 'bad', 'special', 'large', 'stupid', 'creature', 'whole', 'silly', 'ridiculous', 'difficult', 'important'];-0.1267227469500196
806;nerettyksduredro;"i remember reading a readers letter in some film publication around christmas time, where the question of which two towers the title was referring to, was brought up. the answer the publication gave, in which they quoted a letter from tolkien to his publisher, was orthanc and cirith ungol. they went on to write that, since the ringbearers arrival at cirith ungol is delayed to the third film, the two towers in the film are orthanc and barad-dur. which makes more sense to me, because that is where saruman and sauron ""live"". as for the film, i think it is one of the best ever, and one where they actually made cgi moving. the scene where treebeard sees the destruction of the forest near isengard, and the ents heading for isengard really got to me. move over, greenpeace! i was disappointed, though, by that they didn't include faramir's vision/dream of seeing boromir dead, and later finding the broken horn of gondor washed ashore. if they had included this, some more light could have been shed on the character of faramir, he was a bit too one-note for me. i mean, at least boromir smiled a few times during fotr, but faramir doesn't here, well, not before he is tempted by the ring, anyway. not that i blame him, after all, he is the non-favourite son of the steward of gondor, he knows his brother is dead, but that doesn't make him more favoured, and his country is about to be attacked by a huge army from mordor. the dream-sequense would only have taken about a minute or so of screen time, anyway, and i know which scenes they could have cut down on, but i won't name names. interesting dialogue, though: go to sleep/this is a dream etc., because the lucky members of the audience are asleep/dreaming, while those who are too eager to catch up with the movie when it ""re-starts"", are awake and presumably in pain. enough said.";17 April 2003;10;['third', 'more', 'good', 'disappointed', 'boromir', 'dead', 'broken', 'more', 'least', 'few', 'non', 'favourite', 'dead', 'about', 'huge', 'interesting', 'lucky', 'asleep', 'eager', 'awake', 'enough'];0.0630952380952381

809;bondfan27;"""the lord of the rings: the fellowship of the ring"" started a craze within hollywood over the buzz the series created. the follow-up, ""the two towers"" builds up on it, but in the end leaves us wanting a real ending. the film improves on it's action content, mostly within it's last third act, which we are shown an army of minions battling those against them in helm's deep, a last resort for poor villagers surrounding it from the evil of sarumon. the film takes us on varied journeys of the now broken up fellowship and what each of the fellowship endure to fight for what they believe in: a little hobbit by the name of frodo, who now we see is being taken down slowly by the ring and those who were taken down as well by it, in the form of a little creature known as gollum, a computer generated creation so lifelike and realistic, you take it as just another actor within the film. the film has stunning cinematography and takes the best of new zealand (the location of the filming) for it's depiction of middle-earth. the film, however, may wow audiences with the added action but may leave them lost in a haze from the hard, fast-paced plot setting as new characters, locations, and moments are thrown in left and right. but it's not too much to worry about if you stay focused on the story and don't get overwhelmed from the action. the coordination with the film is put nicely and smoothly, except towards the end of the action where areas and scenes are disoriented and confusing, but it shouldn't matter too much. if there was one problem with the film it'd be for the ending. the film leaves you wanting more, which is a classic film gimmick, but by ""wanting more"" it's meant as wanting a more understandable ending. we're left seeing the hobbits on their way to mount doom through a forest with no reasoning on the others (that is too plausible). but aside from the lackluster ending, the film leads gracefully onto act three of the series and gets you wanting more so bad it'll eat you inside...like a little ring we might know of... my ratings: * * * (out of four) b 8 (on imdb's scale out of 10)";31 January 2004;8;['real', 'last', 'third', 'deep', 'last', 'poor', 'varied', 'little', 'little', 'lifelike', 'realistic', 'good', 'middle', 'hard', 'new', 'left', 'right', 'much', 'focused', 'overwhelmed', 'confusing', 'more', 'classic', 'more', 'understandable', 'plausible', 'lackluster', 'bad', 'little'];0.0522280255975908

814;Citizen_Cam;in my review of the fellowship of the ring, i docked half a mark simply because i had to wait for the next instalment. i must, regrettably, do the same with the two towers. like its predecessor, the two towers is long, but also like its predecessor, it doesn't matter. usually long films fail to hold my interest, but if the two towers was any shorter it simply wouldn't cover what it needs to cover. frodo (elijah wood) and sam (sean astin) have broken away from the others and are selflessly carrying on alone in their quest to destroy sauron's ring. meanwhile, aragorn (viggo mortensen), gimli (john rhys-davies) and legolas (orlando bloom) search for the other two hobbits, merry and pippin, stumble across a reborn gandalf (ian mckellen) and make their way to rohan, where the king has been taken over by saruman (christopher lee). the whole thing culminates in an absolutely spectacular battle sequence at helms deep, where our three heroes and their mighty army battle against the orcs for close to half an hour. the two towers was shot simultaneously with the other two, and is therefore just as visually spectacular as the first part, and presumably, the third part. new zealand is a beautiful country, and middle earth is a beautiful place. even the dark clouds and volcanic activity of mordor has a certain ambiance to it. but it is the cgi effects that dominate and shine in this film. in particular, computer graphics have been used to create gollum (andy serkis), brought to life from the real actor's movements. as in the book, gollum is a tortured soul, who's split personality and desire to possess the one ring (his 'precious') creates a powerful, yet pitiable, character. also, there is treebeard, a walking, talking tree (voiced by rhys-davies again) whose lethargic nature comes across in his ambling gait and droning, slow tones. as the lord of the rings is really one big movie cut into three parts, it is difficult to rate each part as a separate movie. however, the action sequences in the two towers are bigger, better and more frequent than in the fellowship of the ring, and the character development continues nicely. it's probably better than the first one, but i won't be able to judge accurately until i see part 3, due out at the end of 2003. until then, i give it the same mark i gave the first one. good-o-meter rating: 9/10;28 March 2005;9;['next', 'same', 'long', 'long', 'short', 'aragorn', 'gimli', 'other', 'reborn', 'whole', 'spectacular', 'deep', 'mighty', 'other', 'spectacular', 'first', 'third', 'beautiful', 'middle', 'beautiful', 'dark', 'volcanic', 'certain', 'particular', 'real', 'tortured', 'split', 'precious', 'powerful', 'pitiable', 'treebeard', 'lethargic', 'slow', 'big', 'difficult', 'separate', 'big', 'well', 'frequent', 'well', 'first', 'able', 'due', 'same', 'first', 'good', 'o'];0.1619397759103641
815;Bond-33;"having just returned from seeing the two towers, i find my self torn in two between my love for tolkiens original work, and wanting to love this interpretation of it. because that's what this film is, an interpretation of the book. it made a number of changes which i absolutely hate, but can't help to love visually. first off, mr. jackson, get your priorities in order. you do not have to bend to the hollywood formula! you don't need to create all these new love stories and stupid cliche triangles between aragorn, arwen and eowyn. these scenes were never in the book, they were only subtexts. leave them alone. the ents are an incredible creation! show them off!!! the ents needed much more screen time. when we're first introduced to treebeard, merry and pippin talk to him for about 30 seconds before we're off someplace else. he's a new incredibly unique character! can we develop his history and culture a little more? please?? after his introduction, we only cut back to him for periods of a minute or less! how long have merry and pippin been on his shoulders? then suddenly it's the march to war, and we don't even get to see their first charge! suddenly we cut back from helms deep and they're already inside the walls, breaking everything down! no dialogue with saruman. he should be saying things like, ""saruman! the forests are descending on the walls!"" ""what? impossible."" etc. on the battle of helms deep. this was i'll have to admit, incredible. however you should have played down gimli's comic relief just a little bit. we should have seen him with a blood lust in his eyes, hacking away at the armies of the orcs, not being too short, tossed by aragorn and poking people with the end of his axe. however the rest of the battle was incredible. well done. on gollum. very nice indeed. i was worried about his portrayal, and though a tad bit over the top, his dialogue with himself and the aside to the audience was great. and there were just a couple of shots during the movie where i almost believed he was real. impressive. on sam and frodo. kiss already! if you're gonna have them get that close to each other and put all that mushy dialogue in, take it all the way. frodo, stop overacting. sam, stop overacting. your monologues are rediculous. it sounds like you're reciting poetry. all in all, it's a wonderful, incredible film. the visuals are very much amazing, however there were almost too many grand sweeping shots, to the point where rather than thinking ""oh my god, what incredible mountains!"" it was ""oh look, another sweeping shot of more mountains."" however, stick with tolkien, he knew what he was doing. it's all there in front of you. if you complain that you had to cut stuff from the book for time, don't go adding stuff back in that wasn't in the book.";18 December 2002;8;['original', 'new', 'stupid', 'subtexts', 'incredible', 'more', 'treebeard', 'new', 'unique', 'little', 'more', 'less', 'first', 'deep', 'impossible', 'deep', 'incredible', 'comic', 'little', 'short', 'incredible', 'nice', 'worried', 'great', 'real', 'impressive', 'close', 'other', 'mushy', 'rediculous', 'wonderful', 'incredible', 'amazing', 'many', 'grand', 'sweeping', 'incredible', 'sweeping', 'more'];0.3463131313131313

817;gusmcrae;having seen the two towers i found myself fairly speechless. the movie delighted me. i thought i'd have an impossible time sitting through a three hour movie (even though i loved the first). i found myself to not be bored or even confused throughout the entire time. that in itself is an accomplishment. peter jackson did an amazing job of keeping the storyline clear amongst all the action. often it's easy to lose track of what's going on, but ttt really avoided that problem. overall i give it a 10/10. i realize a perfect rating is probably not the wisest to give. because i have yet to see the return of the king, i do not know if ttt is really the best of the trilogy. i did enjoy it even more than the fellowship of the ring, if that is possible, though that movie is tremendously enjoyable too. i'd like to comment on some of the other comments i've read. regarding erowen's large role in the film compared to the book. i have yet to read the books, so i can't really compare her place in each. i do think it's probably a shame that so much time was devoted to developing her relationship with aragorn, causing much else to be left out. it stinks when movies add characters/create new events...but this is an adaptation of the books. sometimes things in the books have to change to make sense on the screen. and sometimes hollywood wants to flesh out interesting characters/scenarios that they think will play well on the screen, such as has been done with the trilogy. also, this film lacks the character development that i thought it would have. frodo clearly is slipping more and more into the evil grips of the ring, but that is not nearly as explored as it was in the first film. none of the other characters are explored as much either, although gimli is given a chance to show his sense of humor (i do hope we get to see some depth in legolas too, although the cold/distant feeling he gives off is really rather appropriate for an elf). these are issues with the movie, but seeing as how it was able to accomplish as much as it did in the time it did, they are easy to set somewhat aside. regardless of the many changes that have been made, i think the films are excellent. i am waiting in great anticipation for the final movie. i can hardly imagine how i'll stand waiting a year! i guess that's what the novels are for, right?? i recommend these movies to anyone over the age of 10 or so. they are great adventure stories. they're a little heavy on the violence at times, but outside of a few unique moves made by legolas (i.e. when he mounts the moving horse, when he 'skateboards' down the stairs, jumps on the cave troll's head), the violance does not seem so stylized or glorified even, as it does in most movies. ttt is a film worthy of tolkien's novels. i'm sure the changes would have pained him some, but seeing the characters come to life as fully as they did, seeing middle earth become such a reality, is truly breathtaking, something tolkien might have appreciated as well.;2 January 2003;10;['impossible', 'first', 'bored', 'confused', 'entire', 'amazing', 'clear', 'easy', 'perfect', 'wise', 'good', 'possible', 'enjoyable', 'other', 'large', 'much', 'much', 'new', 'interesting', 'such', 'evil', 'first', 'other', 'gimli', 'cold', 'distant', 'appropriate', 'able', 'easy', 'many', 'excellent', 'great', 'final', 'right', 'great', 'little', 'heavy', 'few', 'unique', 'most', 'worthy', 'sure', 'middle', 'breathtaking'];0.2148096821877309

823;bahrom1;i've just watched the two towers and i liked it very much but it didn't floor me like the fellowship did. there is a lot to like about ttt. it's truly epic, it's action packed, some of the battle scenes are simply breathtaking and the special effects are great (the cgi gollum simply rocks). ttt is probably the most difficult of all three books to film mostly because story splits into several separate lines. the resulting constant crosscutting is often annoying and momentum breaking. also there are a number of new characters and there is simply not enough screen time to develop them. same goes for many of the the plot lines some of which are very thin. (hopefully this will be partly rectified on the extended dvd). for example, i found the explanation of why faramir lets frodo go entirely unconvincing. btw, there are some plot changes as compared to the book. unlike other tolkien fanatics ( i think i qualify as one having read the books several times a year for the past 10 years) i don't think they were excessive. such changes are always necessary when converting a book into a movie. for all those screaming about too many changes, just compare ttt with something like the three musketeers, the count of monte cristo or any of the disney adaptations and you'll realize that you really have nothing to complain about. however, i found that a couple of the new plot twists simply didn't work. the would be death of aragorn is a prime example. the ploy there is exactly the same as in the fall of gandalf and it doesn't advance the story so why do it? finally, some of the acting performances in fotr (most notably bilbo, boromir and galadriel) were so good that the new guys (such as faramir and theoden) simply pale in comparison. i wish they'd let sean bean play faramir too - just make faramir and boromir twin brothers or use a bit of make up. as far as acting is concerned gollum steals the whole show (huge props to andy serkis who played him). anyway, despite its shortfalls ttt is a very good movie, more than worth the money to watch it.;18 January 2003;9;['epic', 'special', 'great', 'difficult', 'several', 'separate', 'constant', 'annoying', 'new', 'enough', 'same', 'many', 'thin', 'unconvincing', 'other', 'several', 'past', 'excessive', 'such', 'necessary', 'many', 'new', 'prime', 'same', 'good', 'new', 'such', 'theoden', 'pale', 'boromir', 'twin', 'concerned', 'whole', 'huge', 'good', 'more', 'worth'];0.0977077922077922
824;Juansmith;"(minor spoilers herein) having read the series multiple times, i thought the transition to screen was done fairly smoothly for both of the films so far. naturally some elements were changed for better storytelling, but the overall epic seemed untouched. as for the second chapter in the trilogy, let me say this: the entire last hour is probably one of the most well done battle sequences i have ever seen. that having been said, here was the only problem. remember the original star wars trilogy, where three or four ministories would be going on at once, and every five minutes or so the scene would change to give us an update about what was happening with each one? well, jackson tries to duplicate this, with this undeniable problem: when lucas cut between scenes, each one maintained roughly the same intensity level at any given time, so consequently the cuts didn't detract from the drama. in this case, particularly as merry and pippin's story goes, the intensity doesn't reach a sufficient level for ""good cuts"" until near the end. in the meantime, the dramatic battle sequence just seems prone to frequent interruptions, leaving the audience wondering... okay... when do we get back to helm's deep? despite this, it all tied up wonderfully. the ending, which was altered slightly from the original book, seems to add to the suspense they try to build for ""return of the king"", so it works well. definitely one of the more surprising standout characters is gollum. ever since the days of jarjar binks, we've all been dreading the next computergenerated monstrosity that would grace our screens. while gollum does get a tremendously increased number of lines from the previous movie, i'd have to say i was never even once annoyed by him. in fact, a rather schizophrenic exchange between himself... and himself... is definitely one of the funnier moments in the film. also, his computer generated movements and look is virtually flawless. andy serkis has proven to be a very versatile actor both in the motion capture that was used to create the character, and in the very memorable voice to go with it. i would not be at all surprised if this entirely ""fake"" character sets a new precedent by becoming the first of his kind to win the oscar for best supporting actor. really... he was that believable. so as they said of ""empire"", it was far more expansive than the original, and definitely worth your time. enjoy the show.";18 December 2002;9;['minor', 'multiple', 'well', 'overall', 'untouched', 'second', 'entire', 'last', 'only', 'original', 'undeniable', 'same', 'sufficient', 'good', 'dramatic', 'prone', 'frequent', 'deep', 'original', 'surprising', 'next', 'previous', 'schizophrenic', 'funny', 'flawless', 'versatile', 'memorable', 'surprised', 'fake', 'new', 'first', 'good', 'believable', 'expansive', 'original', 'worth'];0.1861201298701298

835;robinanng;i have read the lotr books 4 times, with a few glances back over the years. i daresay i'll read them a few more times before i pass from this earth. i need not say to those who have read and loved those books, how i treasured those novels. they are more than just books. they are stories i have held in my heart long after i put them down. being a film buff as well, i have waited many years,with great longing and anticipation, for a film to bring the magical words of the trilogy to the screen. in my heart i knew it would be an imposing task, maybe an impossible one. in the past year i have seen what peter jackson has made from these books. i believe: 1). mr. jackson labored mightily, and it was his heartfelt wish that these films be as close to the original idea that the books perfected, that his films grasp the feeling and mood and meaning of the words tolkien put down. to this desire i believe him to be true. one can feel and see the labor of love he put into these movies. 2. i also believe that these books are so intense and personal to each loyal reader, and no visual art can truly fulfill every person's individual imagining of the magical places, actions and people of middle earth. while one person might accept the image of jackson's shire to be right on target, another might have thought it less than right. there are bound to be some parts of these movies that disappoint individuals, as each person holds a different picture in their own mind than did jackson,or tolkien did or anyone else. this is the unique and best part of these books, the idea that each of us can fill our own minds eye with whatever we envision as magical. those things being said, i liked both of the movies. did i think them absolutely perfect to my imaginary idea of middleearth? no. did i find them close? yes. can i respect the effort of the writers, directors and the actors who worked hard to bring these ideas to life? yes. the fellowship seemed to follow the book more closely than did the two towers. but the first book is an easier mark to hit, as the story is just unfolding. the second book was incredibly detailed with new characters, plots and separate adventures of the main characters. i think to bring the two towers book to complete justice, one would have to have 2 movies just to cover it all. was i a bit disappointed in some of the liberties jackson took with the story, that eowyn did not take up the sword and faramir was an incomplete character, as i had loved him so in the book? yes, a bit. but the ancient ents were there on the screen and viggo m. brought fabulous life to aragorn. gollum was an incredible character both visually as well as poignantly humanized and helm's deep was dank and dark, the enemy overwhelmingly many.the dead mrshes were truly frightening and i loved all breathtaking scenery, the mountains and the valleys, the imposing gates of mordor. there were some disappointments, but overall the effort and the final product far outweigh the negatives. both movies are cinematically brilliant. to judge them harshly by comparing them to the written word is unfair, as one cannot compare one to the other. the bottom line for me in rating a movie is by the overall effect it has on me, after i leave my seat and get in the truck to go home. i was truly moved by the two towers and the fellowship movies. they are not mere popcorn chomping movies you watch and leave behind in the theatre. they are movies that stayed with me long after i walked away from the screen, impressing me with their strong, umwavering idealization of good and evil, dark and light. the same ideals found in the original written works by tolkien. i'll go see it again and look to next year for the finale.;19 December 2002;10;['few', 'few', 'more', 'more', 'many', 'great', 'magical', 'impossible', 'past', 'heartfelt', 'close', 'original', 'true', 'intense', 'personal', 'loyal', 'visual', 'individual', 'magical', 'middle', 'right', 'different', 'own', 'unique', 'good', 'own', 'magical', 'perfect', 'imaginary', 'close', 'first', 'easy', 'second', 'detailed', 'new', 'separate', 'main', 'disappointed', 'incomplete', 'ancient', 'fabulous', 'incredible', 'deep', 'dank', 'dark', 'dead', 'frightening', 'final', 'brilliant', 'unfair', 'other', 'bottom', 'overall', 'mere', 'strong', 'good', 'evil', 'dark', 'light', 'same', 'original', 'next'];0.1652236652236652

837;DamRho;i never thought a fantasy movie could achieve greatness after star wars (although star wars has his percentage of science-fiction, it still is a fantasy movie) but peter jackson seems to want me proven wrong. and he accomplished it. the fellowship of the ring came pretty close to the top and the matrix still has to pass the test of having a capable sequel, but the two towers can easilly be already acclaimed the best fantasy movie ever - at least until the release of star wars episode iii. if you are one of those die-hard book fans who can't stand when the wrong character says that favourite line of yours then you shouldn't watch this movie hoping that it is a perfect adaptation of the book. it isn't. it is based on the book, which is a great masterpiece in literature, but it can make it better and come to life. viggo mortensen does a great job with aragorn and ian mckellen is... well... ian mckellen but the greatest of all actors in this movie is a cg character named smeagol, or gollum. this movie is worth paying the ticket just for watching gollum come to life. absolutely amazing work. if you think the cg characters in some popular movies like star wars or spiderman looked real that is because you haven't seen gollum yet. gollum is the best actor in this movie and if it wasn't for being a cg creation then i would say give him the oscar right away. of course if the academy awards go on with the pathetic decisions they made last year the two towers will probably win nothing but technical awards. go watch the two towers, go watch it again, and again. i'm sad that there isn't an 11 in imdb's rating scale because this is the best fantasy movie ever. no doubts. it is fantastic, it is epic - and the soundtrack is brilliant -, it is beautiful. it is... precious. the wait for the return of the king is unbearable.;4 February 2003;10;['wrong', 'capable', 'good', 'least', 'die', 'hard', 'wrong', 'favourite', 'perfect', 'great', 'great', 'aragorn', 'great', 'worth', 'amazing', 'popular', 'real', 'good', 'pathetic', 'last', 'technical', 'sad', 'good', 'fantastic', 'epic', 'brilliant', 'beautiful', 'precious', 'unbearable'];0.2982638888888889

842;witch king;"it is the rare film which is an improvement upon its original. ""the lord of the rings: the two towers"" has eclipsed ""the fellowship of the ring"" in sheer cinematic story-telling. perhaps its only serious rival in this regard is ""the godfather, part two"" [1974]. director peter jackson opens ""the two towers"" boldly--without plot summary or other device and plunges us into the tale. he risks much at the outset--the fight to the death between gandalf and the balrog, but this ratchets up the tension from the outset, and for nearly three hours, jackson never loses his grip. as in ""the fellowship,"" jackson has taken certain liberties with tolkien's original; i thought i would find them annoying and disturbing, but he really has done an admirable job compressing the labyrinthine complexities of tolkien's story. after many readings of the tale, there is still no character i love more than another. the acting in ""the two towers"" impressive. viggo mortensen's aragon is heroic in a brooding way. legolas [orlando bloom] and gimli [john rhys-davis] are less easy to cast, but both actors give their characters life and, more importantly, strength. i was deeply affected by hugo weaving's [elrond] and liv taylor's [arwen] discussion of her fate if she marries aragorn. in tolkien, i think it is obvious that the elf lord loves arwen, but the scene in ""the two towers"" is overwhelming. the heart-breaking scene gives a human dimension to the cinematic tale that only hard-core tolkien readers know about from reading ""the tale of aragon and arwen"" from the appendices following the end of the book. the violence in the film cannot be discounted and unsuitable though it may be for the very young, it is implicit in tolkien. use your imagination. gollum is a wonderful creation. jackson plays it close to tolkien's original without its being a mere copy. the only incident which i didn't care for was frodo's drawing his sword on sam, but i also understood it. tolkien could spin out his tale of frodo's slow enslavement to the ring, but jackson cannot. this great film's virtues are many and its flaws minor, almost irrelevant. howard shore has proven to be a master musician in darkening his score to underscore the action. jackson has painted a gorgeous portrait of a most difficult theme...and he's not finished yet.";23 December 2002;10;['rare', 'original', 'sheer', 'cinematic', 'only', 'serious', 'other', 'certain', 'original', 'annoying', 'disturbing', 'admirable', 'labyrinthine', 'many', 'more', 'impressive', 'heroic', 'gimli', 'easy', 'obvious', 'overwhelming', 'human', 'cinematic', 'hard', 'unsuitable', 'young', 'implicit', 'wonderful', 'original', 'mere', 'only', 'slow', 'great', 'many', 'minor', 'irrelevant', 'gorgeous', 'difficult'];0.1355339105339105

846;Sandy-99;"by this time last year, i had seen fotr twice and contributed to several message board discussions. i rated it 10/10 and was of the firm opinion that it was the best movie that i had seen for a long time. i had no complaints about the differences between the screenplay and the book; the changes were appropriate, given the book's length, detail and differences of emphasis. inevitably, the passage of time and further viewings at the cinema, on video and the extended dvd prompted further thoughts. whilst peter jackson's film is exceptionally good, it is not flawless. the most significant is elijah wood's frodo who is too passive and insufficiently worldly-wise. the frequent shots of his doe-eyed gaze into middle-distance suggest someone who is transfixed by and unreactive to, all that happens to him. still, the two towers would surely see his gradual change to a more ""human"" hobbit, as the ring increases its influence. i have so far seen the two towers only once. my first impression is that, whilst peter jackson has created a worthy sequel, its impact has been diminished simply because it was preceded by fotr - the visual style, effects, characterisation, pace are now rather too familiar. this does not make ttt a bad film. peter jackson knew that this would be a problem and appears to have spent the last year fiddling to counteract it. the promise was that since all three films were ""made"" at the same time, there would be a consistency that other similar projects lacked. this was of course not entirely true, and with so much post-production taking place after the release of fotr, it is difficult to imagine that the director's work on tt was completely unaffected by the reception of its predecessor. without the same impact, (or the hype!) the film can instead be considered on its merits. for example, has the aforementioned weak characterisation of frodo been improved? at first viewing, only marginally so, but his anger at sam in the ruins of osgiliath promises further developments in the final film. if i were peter jackson, it is this that i would spend the next year fiddling with, and not the visual effects. of course, if i was a ""tolkien virgin"", i might have had a profoundly different view. my niece, who has not read the book and has seen fotr only once, laughed aloud every time gollum appeared. her reaction, that he was a figure of fun, was completely at odds with mine, that he is a figure of pathos...but was i right to be irritated at her response? i would love to have been able to set aside my own familiarity with the books and previous dramatised versions and have come to these films afresh. given that this is not possible, the best i can do is to take time to ponder; to see it again and not to leap to hasty conclusions as some other users seem to have done. i was certainly absorbed for three hours, and there was much to enjoy, as well as much to question, as others have done. for that reason, it will probably be a film that i will want to see not just once more, but many times more. i have no all-time favourite movie, although ""oh mr porter!"", a bargain i picked up on video this christmas and which i have loved ever since i saw it as an eight-year old, offers endless charming amusement. could the two towers occupy a similar place in my affections in another 40 years? take time to ponder...";1 January 2003;9;['last', 'several', 'firm', 'good', 'long', 'appropriate', 'further', 'extended', 'further', 'good', 'flawless', 'significant', 'passive', 'wise', 'frequent', 'eyed', 'middle', 'gradual', 'human', 'first', 'worthy', 'visual', 'familiar', 'bad', 'last', 'same', 'other', 'similar', 'true', 'much', 'post', 'production', 'difficult', 'unaffected', 'same', 'aforementioned', 'weak', 'first', 'further', 'final', 'next', 'visual', 'different', 'right', 'able', 'own', 'previous', 'possible', 'good', 'hasty', 'other', 'much', 'much', 'more', 'many', 'more', 'favourite', 'old', 'endless', 'charming', 'similar'];0.1529878618113911

851;MikeG-1221;"spoilers comin' up! be ye warned! i agree with everyone here who says that the book and movie are separate entities. it is unfair to expect the same exact plot regurgitated onscreen. that's not what a movie should do. but... the two towers is visually stunning and scored wonderfully. if nothing else, peter jackson is a near-perfect director from a technical standpoint. his shots of aragorn, legolas and gimli running and then riding across middle earth are beautiful and awe-inspiring. the battle at helms deep is also a tremendous accomplishment in terms of the reality of a medieval battle as one might imagine it. jackson also does make the three plots from the book work in the movie. abandoning frodo and sam for the first half of the movie would have failed miserably. he does a very good job of mixing up the three stories enough so that you're not wondering what the heck happened to any set of characters (a suspense tactic that works well in the book that wouldn't work in the movie). however, there are problems that keep this movie far from epic status. the two glaring holes in ""the two towers"" are a) a lack of explanation of what certain characters or places are and b) little or no characterization (character traits or actions that wouldn't make sense unless you read the book). the transition from ""fellowship"" to ""towers"" is great...but then it gets a little disjointed. there's no explanation of what rohan is, and what it has to do with the destruction of the ring. as the movie goes on, the plot diverges so far away from the ring that it almost becomes forgotten, except for the obligatory scenes where frodo gets moody or angry or violent. by the end of the movie, the story has moved so far away from the significance of the ring, and so near the ""battle for middle earth"" that it's almost a mystery what these people are fighting for. but my biggest problem with both movies is the lack of characterization, for the most part. what little characterization there was in the first movie is almost completely lost here. frodo's character - probably the strongest in fellowship - disappears here, with jackson giving elijah wood little to do but stare with those big blue eyes into the camera and go through mood swings. gimli becomes an even bigger joke, aragorn is a mystery (why is he such a leader? never truly explained.) and everyone is swept away by events without ever really participating in them. this would be fine if the events were built up to, but they never really are. things just happen in jackson's version of ""rings,"" and the reasons are seldom satisfactory. one of the greatest scenes in the star wars trilogy (and perhaps one of the greatest movie scenes of all time) is when luke skywalker decides to leave dagobah to save his friends from darth vader. he's torn by the decision, but he knows that he has to be true to who he is. it's a human decision made in a supernatural world. at that moment, we feel for him, and admire and care for him because we probably would've done the same thing if placed in his position. tolkien also had his characters make these kinds of decisions. in ""fellowship"" the book, the fellowship decides to go through the mines of moria by vote, whereas in the movie they have no choice. this lack of choice is even starker in ""towers"". saruman influences theoden's character in the book, but theoden falls under the wizard's spell in part because he is willing to do so, not because he's literally possessed. in the book, aragorn gives up the search for merry and pippen because he decides that it is more important to help rohan, even though the decision tears him apart. in the movie, peter jackson takes these decisions away from the characters and, by doing so, nullifies what makes them seem real. without this strength of character, ""the two towers"" becomes a movie where fate overwhelms the human strength that makes characters - and movies - worth remembering. and the dialogue - what little there is - is slightly below average, at best. theoden, in particular, has two clunky speeches, and the one about ""the father outliving the son"" was extremely cringeworthy. ""the two towers"" falls short of epic by a long shot. it definitely doesn't belong in the best picture/greatest film of all time realms either. bascially, this is a nice looking film that has its moments, but fails to cohesively bring them together. it's clear that peter jackson has a love of these books, but the screenwriters' working on this film don't have the ability to pull it all together. it's as if the expectation is, ""well, you've seen enough of these types of movies by now to know that aragorn is the strong hero, and saruman the bad guy, and frodo the classic underdog."" apparently, the majority of comments on this movie put me in the microscopic minority, but i just don't get why everyone is drooling over this film. i'm not sure if it's because of a love of the books and seeing the characters come to life or a feeling that, ""well, now our generation has our star wars trilogy."" i give this movie a 5/10, and hope that if oscar feels the need to give a nom to a mainstream movie, that they give one to ""minority report"" or ""the road to perdition"" - two films with better performances, better characters and superior stories.";21 December 2002;5;['separate', 'unfair', 'same', 'exact', 'stunning', 'perfect', 'technical', 'gimli', 'middle', 'beautiful', 'inspiring', 'tremendous', 'medieval', 'first', 'good', 'epic', 'certain', 'little', 'great', 'little', 'obligatory', 'moody', 'angry', 'violent', 'middle', 'big', 'most', 'little', 'first', 'strong', 'little', 'big', 'blue', 'gimli', 'big', 'aragorn', 'fine', 'satisfactory', 'great', 'great', 'true', 'human', 'supernatural', 'same', 'willing', 'aragorn', 'important', 'real', 'human', 'worth', 'little', 'average', 'good', 'particular', 'clunky', 'cringeworthy', 'short', 'epic', 'long', 'good', 'great', 'nice', 'clear', 'enough', 'strong', 'bad', 'classic', 'microscopic', 'sure', 'well', 'well', 'superior'];0.1981629720853858
852;Dragonshadow0;warning - spoilers how can a book so well known as this need a spoiler warning in its film review? partly because peter jackson has (necessarily) changed the story in order to give the viewer some of the background story that tolkien put in the appendices, and partly to make it more cinematic. i can put up with the need to include liv tyler, despite the fact that arwen does not appear in the book at all, and i can just about put up with the film finishing a couple of chapters early - but why completely change a character? faramir is made out to be some kind of monster, carrying on where his brother left off. to me the whole character in the book was the antithesis of boromir, well cultured and studious, a character which will be required in the third film, but here this has been hindered by the handling of the minor part he played in this film. the effects in the film are generally good and i can't complain that they don't fit with my minds picture of them from the book. the nazgul's flying beasts are superbly done, but the gollum is unbelievably seemless. it is the best piece of cgi i have ever seen, and deserves an oscar for that alone. a bit too cute for my liking (the ralph bakshi gollum fit the character better for me) but andy serkis deserves the oscar for supporting actor for the voice acting alone. some of the other acting was a bit wooden in places (and i don't mean the ents), faramir for example, and grima was just not acted at all, just the lines read out. sam and frodo didn't shine here either. finally too much was made of the comedy of gimli, here and there, yes, but one left the film feeling that he was a bit of a joke. overall, 9 out of 10. let's hope the return of the king returns to the form shown in fellowship.;19 December 2002;10;['cinematic', 'whole', 'cultured', 'studious', 'third', 'minor', 'good', 'seemless', 'good', 'cute', 'ralph', 'other', 'wooden', 'much', 'gimli'];0.2125
853;jokercard88;there are a few flaws this movie suffers from, and let me clear them away first, then i'll say why fellowship is better (and it is). for one, merry and pippen's story wasn't nearly as long as the aragorn/legolas/gimli story or the froddo/samwise/gollumn story. this is a shame as merry and pippen's story was the best. pippen transforms into a much more leader quality person. he's the only character in two towers that show signs of character development. his disision (!possible spoilers in this next sentence!) -to convince the tree-men to attack isengard- (.end of spoiler.)was brilliant and probably my favorate part in the movie. second, the part where (!yet another spoiler!) -aragorn falls off the cliff, then later arrives (late) at the fortress of helm's deep- (.end of spoiler.) was very forced and affected the next few scenes in the aragorn/legolas/gimli story. taking those flaws into account, the movie still might've been better than the first in the trilogy, but there's more that makes it not as good as the first. this isn't a flaw though, it's just a different style, and one that i don't like as much (or just aren't used to). while the first movie was straightford with all the characters in the same spot, the second has three seperate stories. the one with the most screen time is my least favorate, the shortest story is my favorate. the switching between stories is well done, but let's hope at some point everyone will get together (or just the four hobbits, that's also fine) in the third movie, and i also hope the hobbits get as much screen time as the other three. there go all my complaints. otherwise, two towers is everything i wanted and more. the battle at helm's deep is an epic battle in every sense of the word (legolas sliding down a staircase on a sheild is classic). the camerawork is spectacular and a milestone in movie history. love the ending!;5 January 2003;8;['few', 'well', 'aragorn', 'gimli', 'good', 'more', 'only', 'possible', 'next', 'brilliant', 'favorate', 'late', 'forced', 'next', 'few', 'aragorn', 'gimli', 'well', 'first', 'more', 'good', 'first', 'different', 'much', 'first', 'straightford', 'same', 'second', 'seperate', 'most', 'least', 'short', 'fine', 'third', 'much', 'other', 'more', 'epic', 'classic', 'spectacular'];0.1692528735632183

856;formala44;after falling asleep watching the fellowship i decided to give the two towers a chance. it sadly is more of the same unimaginative black and white world depiction like the fellowship. there are only 2 kinds of people, the good guys and the bad guys in the lord of the rings movies. the good guys look nice, fresh, heroic and smart. the bad guys have hideous faces, wear old clothes, are conniving and not too bright. in the two towers frodo continues his way to mordor to destroy the ring. this time accompanied and guided by gollum, some cgi created creature. again they walk an awful lot and encounter some danger which they narrowly manage to avoid. at the end of the movie though, they still haven't managed to make it so well need a 3rd movie to find out if frodo will succeed. i have a strange feeling that he just might. the 2 captured hobbits escape and seek refuge in a walking tree. i've been told they spend 58 hours per frame to make it look real. to me it looked straight out of sesamestreet and i had trouble not to laugh. suddenly gandalf appears out of nowhere and wasn't killed after all in his demon battling in film number 1. ahh, what a shame. you really cant believe anything in this movie. after some bickering in the land of horsemen we see a huge battle between the (300) good guys and the (10000) bad guys. off course, the good guys win. how surprising. by then i finally dozed off into a deep sleep whilst knowing this is a perfect film for children aged 3 to 10. it wasn't as bad as the fellowship but it was still waaaaaaaaaaaaay too predictable and simplistic. i didn't give it a 1 but a 3 because i did like the cinematography and the locations where nicely chosen.;21 December 2008;3;['asleep', 'more', 'same', 'unimaginative', 'black', 'white', 'good', 'bad', 'good', 'nice', 'fresh', 'heroic', 'smart', 'bad', 'hideous', 'old', 'bright', 'awful', 'strange', 'real', 'huge', 'good', 'bad', 'good', 'surprising', 'deep', 'perfect', 'bad', 'predictable', 'simplistic'];0.1345238095238095

860;tnzk;"one of the best sequels of all time, and that's saying something when the first one is one of the greatest movies of all time. the two towers picks up pretty much where the first one left off: frodo and sam are traveling on their own to mordor, merry and pippin have been taken by a band of orcs and uruks with aragorn, legolas and gimli hot on their tail. saruman is now building a great army, merry and pippin run into a giant race of middle earth, aragorn and co. go forth to save the kingdom of rohan, and frodo and sam have some unexpected company in the form of gollum. new paths are crossed, old ones are found; each and everyone of them as captivating as possible. once again, everything is exceptional. from the sets to the acting to the visual effects - everything is top notch. peter jackson and crew have done a tremendous job of topping the original in terms of storytelling. the lines are bolder, the cinematography even better, and the direction spot on. throughout the film, you can see frodo being taken in by the ring's power. it is also obvious that sam is trying hard to keep frodo from falling into the ring's power, whilst gollum's character arc is one of the most enjoyable aspects of the movie. aragorn's struggle as he comes to face the realization that he must take on the responsibility of his forefathers' is done extremely well. comic relief comes in the form of legolas and gimli's relationship (elves and dwarfs don't usually get along), and how hobbits merry and pippin react to the ways of the ents. by no means aren't they informative, because they are, but they are at the same time humorous. the action pieces are once again on par with the drama and have clearly gone beyond what was done in ""fellowship"". from the warg attack to the climactic battle at helms deep, peter jackson truly shows his imagination is leaps and bounds beyond any other director. the cinematography is once again superb, and it deserved every bit of the oscar it won. sets are realized on a greater scope than fellowship of the ring. edoras is truly a magnificent town upon the hill, whilst osgiliath looks like it really has been war-torn. i didn't mention howard shore's score in my review of ""fellowship"", but my thoughts on his music for the first film are the same for this one: it's amazing. simply amazing. the score is now synonymous with the term fantasy. a melodious orchestra piece highlights the drama, whilst the trumpet sounds as the the bodies pile up during the fights. like the first film, my gripe is that this is quite a long movie. this is necessary for an adaption which source is amazingly detailed, and besides, you won't get bored easily. also, major characters could be off screen for over half an hour, almost as though they have been forgotten. but you'll be so intrigued by what's going on screen, that you too will forget about the other characters. it also helps that the change in character plots are seamlessly changed from one to the other. peter jackson has once again made a must-see movie. this will be loved by the most die hard tolkien fan to the most ignorant of fantasy. as saruman said in the two towers: ""a new power is rising"". with hindsight, we now know what that means.";23 January 2007;8;['good', 'first', 'great', 'first', 'own', 'gimli', 'hot', 'great', 'giant', 'middle', 'aragorn', 'unexpected', 'new', 'old', 'possible', 'exceptional', 'visual', 'top', 'notch', 'tremendous', 'original', 'bolder', 'obvious', 'enjoyable', 'comic', 'informative', 'same', 'humorous', 'climactic', 'deep', 'other', 'superb', 'great', 'magnificent', 'torn', 'first', 'same', 'amazing', 'amazing', 'synonymous', 'melodious', 'first', 'long', 'necessary', 'bored', 'major', 'other', 'other', 'die', 'hard', 'ignorant', 'new'];0.2583795269770879

865;lasse-uk;this film is one of the best films ever made. this film is almost as breathtaking as the first film but in the end the minor flaws it has makes it worse than the first film. what i consider to be the biggest flaw of this film is the character of gimli. john-rhys davies is a wonderful actor and i do not blame him for the way the character turned out. i blame it on the directing (shame on you jackson). being that merry and pippin are not as much in the second films they were in the first they could not act as comic relief. thus the choice was made to make gimli the comic relief. while the things he says are both funny and well timed it becomes to much by the end. a second flaw that pulls the film down a bit is the fact that they deviated too much from the original book. the theoden character is very different in the book as is faramir. these flaws were probably necessary to make the film but the hard core tolkien fans such as myself were disappointed to see faramir drag poor frodo and sam to osgilliath which is only mentioned in the book but never seen. this far i have only focused on the bad things in the film but there are very great film historic moments as well. e.g. the battle for helms deep is aside from the battle on pelleanor fields the greatest film battle ever conceived on screen. the acting in the film is generally on a very high level. especially ian mckellen and viggo mortensen do very well in the film but also john-rhys davies and elijah wood are very good. aside from the fact that their roles were not as well written as they could have been bernard hill and david wenham do very well. the effects in the film are flawless and on a higher scale than in the first film and the attention to detail is overwhelming. all in all a worthy sequel but ultimately the worst out of the three.;6 November 2004;10;['good', 'breathtaking', 'first', 'minor', 'bad', 'first', 'big', 'wonderful', 'much', 'second', 'first', 'comic', 'gimli', 'comic', 'funny', 'much', 'second', 'original', 'theoden', 'different', 'necessary', 'hard', 'such', 'poor', 'bad', 'great', 'historic', 'great', 'high', 'good', 'flawless', 'high', 'first', 'overwhelming', 'worthy', 'bad'];0.2011458333333333
866;MrSharma;"whilst peter jackson's directorial talent and the wonderful imagination of tolkien himself are the fundamental backdrop of the second installment of the ""lord of the rings"" franchise, i increasingly get the feeling that this film was an excellent one, but one that was a little patchy at times. overall, a visual and emotional extravaganza, but the film slows slightly and stands as a notch below both its predecessor and its successor. the cgi is absolutely brilliant, and the ability that jackson and his team at weta were able to use state of the art technology to create the character of gollum is remarkable -- his performance is as strong as frodo and sam's, and this wonderful and realistic chemistry highlights much of the film's merit. the expansive battle at helm's deep is quite breathtaking, as is the march of the ents on an unsuspecting isengard. it is not in the visual effects that the film falls a little flat. viggo mortensen, whilst looking the part of aragorn, seems to be patchy in his portrayal, representing his fair inexperience within the world of hollywood. his delivery of lines is, at many times, stale and thus puts a substantial patch on the credibility of what is one of the more important characters within the story. that being said, he does possess a steadfastness and visual courage that is practically unmatched by all of the other cast -- it's when mortensen is really challenged that he seems to struggle slightly. orlando bloom is terrible and remedial as always, once more looking the part brilliantly but not even possessing the basic ability to recite a line without showing conflicting facial expressions, and a real inability to understand both his character and the direction of the story. the other members of the supporting cast are excellent - elijah wood is fantastic as frodo, a hobbit perpetually under the emotional and mental attack from the one ring. sean astin is unwavering as sam, and christopher lee plays an increasingly evil saruman to a tee. sir ian mackellan is positive and competent as gandalf. the score, whilst being quite good, falls flat slightly. the cinematography, especially the wide expansive shots amongst a beautiful and untouched new zealand countryside, is nothing short of breathtaking. the introduction of new characters, such as those that dwell in rohan, is excellent. even the addition of the ents is a worthy one, and one posing many thrills and laughs along the way. all in all, this film aimed for perfection but didn't quite get there. it was not as raw or majestic as the first film, and wasn't as emotionally expansive as the final chapter. standing alone, the film is endearing and entertaining. however, some patchy acting from main cast members and the patchiness of both the script and the score taint this film from what it could potentially be. an 8 out of 10 -- a remarkable achievement, standing alone, but quite easily the patchiest and most inconsistent of the film franchise.";7 July 2006;8;['directorial', 'wonderful', 'fundamental', 'second', 'excellent', 'little', 'patchy', 'visual', 'emotional', 'brilliant', 'able', 'remarkable', 'strong', 'wonderful', 'realistic', 'much', 'expansive', 'breathtaking', 'visual', 'little', 'flat', 'patchy', 'fair', 'many', 'stale', 'substantial', 'important', 'steadfastness', 'visual', 'unmatched', 'other', 'terrible', 'remedial', 'basic', 'facial', 'real', 'other', 'excellent', 'fantastic', 'emotional', 'mental', 'evil', 'positive', 'competent', 'good', 'flat', 'wide', 'expansive', 'beautiful', 'untouched', 'short', 'new', 'such', 'excellent', 'worthy', 'many', 'raw', 'majestic', 'first', 'expansive', 'final', 'entertaining', 'patchy', 'main', 'remarkable', 'patchy', 'inconsistent'];0.2439073426573427
867;cragsby_kellogs;in my view the two towers will go down as my second favourite film of all time behind (obviously) lotr: return of the king. the film proved to be a much better film than the fellowship of the ring mainly because of two things. helm's deep and gollum. helm's deep proved to be the most exciting siege film since the alamo. 10,000 urik-hai against a small guard of farmers, old men and stable boys proved to be like david against three goliaths. at the end of the battle mass audiences were stunned to witness a battle sequence as stunning as braveheart in the part where gandalf rides down the steep mountain with the rohirrum as they attack the urik-hai to win the battle. this film had a bit of funny moments such as gimli telling legolas that he could have picked a better spot to see the mass army. plus the same two characters counting how many urik-hai they were killing during the epic battle scene. new characters in the two towers included miranda otto (from war of the worlds) playing aragorn's secret love interest, bernard hill (titanic) playing king theardon and david wenham (van helsing) playing boromir's brother faramir. but the new character who led well was the cgi character gollum who joined frodo and sam on their quest to destroy the one ring. his mutters of 'my precious' had giving cinema a new movie line to join others. also impressive where the tree ents who helped hobbits merry and pippin to destroy isengaard with an exciting action sequence. overall i preferred this film to fellowship of the ring and would say that it is my favourite 'second film' to a trilogy! awesome!;7 May 2005;10;['second', 'favourite', 'well', 'deep', 'deep', 'exciting', 'urik', 'small', 'old', 'stable', 'stunning', 'steep', 'funny', 'such', 'gimli', 'well', 'mass', 'same', 'many', 'urik', 'epic', 'new', 'secret', 'titanic', 'new', 'new', 'impressive', 'exciting', 'favourite', 'second', 'awesome'];0.1904545454545454

869;TheJudge-2;"everything that can be said about peter jackson's two towers by now has been said, and i'm not one for repeating the same well-earned praise. suffice it to say that the movie delivers entirely on the expectation levels set by the first part of the trilogy, the set pieces are spectacular on a biblical scale, the cinematography is flawless and the scenery just awesomely epic. jackson as everyone knows filmed all three parts together, which was a very bold move, but it's clear (as if it wasn't before) that both the audience and the studio's financial investments are in good hands. the two towers is a much darker film than the fellowship of the ring, and this is deliberate, matching the growing sense of dramatic pressure and impending doom in the books. lighting, cinematography and musical score all merge seamlessly to evoke this atmosphere, and all traces of the ""cutesey"" have vanished. viggo mortensen as aragorn comes to the fore, expanding the fierce nobility of his role with consummate skill. ian mckellern continues to make the part of gandalf his very own, elijah wood reprises his role as frodo with the same accomplishment, and best yet, the remaining three hobbits are all fleshed out far better, given more on-screen time and thus made more three-dimensional and credible. christopher lee remains a superbly-cast saruman, and the newcomers brad dourif as the venomously evil grima wormtongue and bernard hill as theoden are both excellent. i have to mention how brilliantly gollum as a character has been handled. the cgi is flawless, and andy serkis' realisation of the role show a scope of perceptivity and imagination that is literally jaw-dropping. the usage cgi as a whole in the movie has been executed superbly, both in terms of character and set pieces (the attack of the warg-mounted uruk-hai, the battle of helm's deep etc) and i was especially interested to see how jackson would handle the ents, which i suspected would be the most difficult thing to do without breaking the suspension of disbelief. needless to say, he gets away with it. a number of rabid tolkien purists on this message board have carped about a number of chapters having been ""cut"" from the end of the original book - well, i'm sorry, but i just don't see the issue. the fellowship ""stole"" briefly from the start of the two towers with the death of boromir, because it was a more natural end-point, and the two towers ends with frodo and sam's passage to cirith ungol. what happens next won't be cut (and it's only two chapters) - it'll be in at the start of the next movie. you have to remember that this isn't a weekly serial - we have to wait a year for the final part - so ending the two towers on the same unbearable cliffhanger as the original book would not be the move of a smart director. plus of course, the final book, the return of the king is much shorter. it doesn't look it on the shelf, but it's half-full of appendices and background historical information which won't be relevant to the final movie, so jackson will have been happy to have moved the final episode into the last movie. admittedly i don't see any real reason why jackson should have had faramir take frodo and sam to osgiliath for another albeit small set-piece (this does not occur in the book - they part company before this point), but apart from pointlessness, i have no issues with this. maybe jackson thought that the ring's growing hold on frodo needed restressing from a dramatic point of view. i'll go with his judgement on this. the same thing with the arrival of haldor and the elves at helm's deep. not in the book, but not an issue. maybe jackson felt he needed to point out that the forces of good in middle earth were stretched to breaking and that there no huge reserves waiting in the background. so after all this praise, why ""almost perfect""? i feel almost guilty to carp after such praise but there were a few little niggles that unsettled me. firstly, the character of faramir. there's nothing wrong with david wenham's acting, but the character has been radically changed. faramir is meant to be a gentler wiser version of boromir, not prone to unthinking rashness, but labouring under the fact that his father holds him in no value, compared to his bold foolhardy dead brother. the movie version of faramir is far less grandiose. then there's eomer's rohirrim. where are they all? there's meant to be 2,000 of them running around, but the bunch we're shown looks like a small mounted version of some hell's angel chapter. not very impressive. i'm still not happy with the way gimli is portrayed. yes in the books there is some comic relief provided in the banter between gimli and legolas, but jackson still uses the character as not much more than a comedy dwarf. it's stereotypical and shallow - gimli either fights or argues. there's no sense of the majesty of the dwarves, just as in movie #1 there was no evocation of gimli's sense of loss at the fall of moria, the culminating achievement of his people. plus why oh why did they use john rhys-davies to voice treebeard as well? it can't have been a matter of budget, and it's very obviously the same actor being used. finally, and this i found shocking in how much it clanged, how much a single 5 second sequence totally destroyed the grandeur and the sense of the epic, how completely it shattered my sense of disbelief - legolas, the snow-boarding elf on the shield. i cannot believe that a director with the perception and the subtlety of touch that jackson has demonstrated ever even filmed this scene, let alone left it in the final cut. why oh why is it there? it's self-indulgent, utterly unnecessary, completely out of place and destroys atmosphere at a single stroke. yes i know orlando bloom is an extreme sports fan, but why is it necessary to leverage this and include this scene? it's a mark of how well the rest of the movie has been executed that it survives this piece of trite ludicrousness. i think jackson really lost the plot with this incident, and it's made to stand out even more because the rest of the movie fits together so seamlessly. peter, you're not good with comic touches, and they're not needed, so please please stop thinking you need to hammer them in. however, despite these niggles, the movie is a triumph. roll on december 18th and the return of the king. a worthy 9 out of 10.";1 April 2003;10;['same', 'first', 'set', 'spectacular', 'biblical', 'flawless', 'epic', 'bold', 'clear', 'financial', 'good', 'dark', 'deliberate', 'dramatic', 'impending', 'musical', 'fierce', 'own', 'same', 'good', 'more', 'more', 'dimensional', 'credible', 'evil', 'theoden', 'excellent', 'flawless', 'deep', 'interested', 'difficult', 'needless', 'rabid', 'original', 'sorry', 'natural', 'next', 'next', 'weekly', 'final', 'same', 'unbearable', 'original', 'smart', 'final', 'short', 'half', 'full', 'historical', 'relevant', 'final', 'happy', 'final', 'last', 'real', 'small', 'dramatic', 'same', 'deep', 'middle', 'huge', 'perfect', 'guilty', 'such', 'few', 'little', 'wrong', 'gentle', 'wise', 'prone', 'bold', 'dead', 'grandiose', 'small', 'impressive', 'happy', 'gimli', 'comic', 'gimli', 'more', 'stereotypical', 'shallow', 'gimli', 'same', 'shocking', 'much', 'much', 'single', 'second', 'final', 'indulgent', 'unnecessary', 'single', 'extreme', 'necessary', 'trite', 'good', 'comic', 'worthy'];0.1103450874020494
870;Harry-57;"""two towers"" was very different from the first lotr film, which surprised me given that all three movies were shot simultaneously. i enjoyed it very much. it wasn't perfect: characters like galdalf, saruman, merry, and pippen didn't get much screen time (the extended dvd will certainly fix that problem to some extent); samwise got a little talky near the end (in a way that tolkien would have liked, though); and the battle of helm's deep and frodo's adventure unfolded in much different ways from the book, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but i thought the helms' deep battle could have benefitted from some type of wrap-up. but, like the first movie, two towers' flaws did not work to hurt the overall film all that much. it is an incredibly entertaining movie. the visual effects range from very good to over-the-top great. oftentimes, a truly great effects shot was placed amongst shots that were not as good, but still enjoyable. the helms' deep battle, though, was extremely well-done (it reportedly took four months to film). some have criticized the movie because it kept breaking away from that battle to show merry and pippen with the ents, but the battle was pretty intense and probably needed a couple breaks, and i thought that breaking from a ferocious battle where everything was on the line to the slow-moving ents who couldn't make up their minds added tension to the close of the film. gollum was amazing -- serkis and the effects team should win some type of special oscar for that character. i was worried about whether the effects people could pull off the ents, but i thought they did a great job with them, and the final scenes with the ents contain some truly inspired special effects. anyway, i think it's a major accomplishment. i did get the feeling at times that i was watching a sneek preview for the special extended dvd that is sure to be superior to the theatrical release. but what do you do? for some reason, a three-and-a-half hour movie is out of the question these days for the studios, so i guess we just have to live with the fact that we are not yet seeing the final product.";29 December 2002;10;['different', 'first', 'perfect', 'much', 'extended', 'little', 'deep', 'much', 'different', 'bad', 'deep', 'first', 'overall', 'much', 'entertaining', 'visual', 'good', 'great', 'great', 'good', 'enjoyable', 'deep', 'intense', 'ferocious', 'amazing', 'special', 'worried', 'great', 'final', 'special', 'major', 'sneek', 'special', 'sure', 'superior', 'theatrical', 'final'];0.2821428571428571

872;Gaub;"both in relation to the book and as a movie in its own right, the fellowship of the ring was far better. if the two towers is a must-see nevertheless, it is thanks to the computer-generated character of gollum. he comes out incredibly life-like, which is even more remarkable as that creature does not resemble anything on earth, at least not in appearance. this is the one point where the movie actually surpasses the book. i am willing to forgive the addition of a loincloth to gollum's body (naked in the book) because i understand that otherwise there would have been trouble, especially in the usa. if for the sake of action moria was overdone in the fellowship of the ring (a scene reminding me of indiana jones), here the same happens to the battle of the hornburg. among the changes to the plot the one that annoyed me most was faramir's taking the hobbits as far as osgiliath and to release them without obvious reason. boromir was faramirized in the fellowship of the ring, recognizing aragorn as his king (""king"" being his last word - oh, how i loathed that!), and now faramir is boromirized.

876;Cadriel;"peter jackson's film the two towers encapsulates a heavily edited and modified version of parts of book iii and book iv of j.r.r. tolkien's the lord of the rings, which are normally published as the two towers (following the original printings). indeed, there are many places in the second entry where it only bears a superficial resemblance to the source material. but that, in and of itself, does not automatically condemn a film. the problems with peter jackson's the two towers are many. aside from the lackluster direction that action fans are depressingly willing to look away from, and the eminently forgettable score, most of them lie in the telling of the story. jackson cross-cuts between three different stories in his course; at most, tolkien only ever did with two. unfortunately, these stories are not at all similar in tone, and there are points in the major battle sequence where we cut away to rather tranquil scenes. he already had enough difficulty creating anything of a pace or a mood in his subpar fellowship of the ring; with the two towers he simply falls flat on his face. it is understandable that tolkien's generally more leisurely step was not well suited for transition to the screen; unfortunately, i don't think the problem was solved even quasi-adequately. jackson's storytelling skills are highly overrated by fans who have read the books, and i think that on their own the films don't tell the story well enough for any subtleties to be grasped. worse than this are jackson's rewrites to the story. i'm not approaching this from a ""how dare he rewrite a classic!"" aspect, mind you. what upsets me are the way that he alters plot elements and turns them into banal cliches. theoden's possession, aragorn's near-death experience, faramir's temptation, the elves at helm's deep (it was clear that, until the battles in book v, it was all men making their stand and not the other peoples of middle-earth), the insultingly insipid ""gandalf arrives with cavalry"" (why not just have him descend from the heavens and wipe out the orcs with a mighty blast of magic?)...not just alterations, but blatant and frankly boring elements that have been done a hundred times before. i could have accepted plot changes if they had made the story better, or even if they had been adequate replacements that worked for a superior filmic pacing, but these are just plain awful and make the resulting film worse. and there were large swaths of material lost in favor of this waffle, which only adds insult to injury. characters are changed without needing to be; again, the result is always worse. the faramir depicted in the film, for instance, doesn't serve any real purpose as he did in the book. most actually seem less three-dimensional here than either in the novel or in the first film, which is quite an accomplishment. to put in something of a positive word, gollum was a technical achievement (though when i saw it in the theatres twice, audiences laughed - not an effect that seems intended by the source material). nothing in this mess improved on the source material or even came close to matching it. as a film, it's a passable entertainment if you can overlook the severe pacing issues; as an adaptation it's a miserable failure.";14 August 2003;4;['original', 'many', 'second', 'superficial', 'many', 'lackluster', 'willing', 'forgettable', 'most', 'different', 'most', 'similar', 'major', 'enough', 'subpar', 'flat', 'understandable', 'leisurely', 'suited', 'quasi', 'storytelling', 'own', 'bad', 'banal', 'near', 'deep', 'clear', 'other', 'middle', 'insipid', 'mighty', 'blatant', 'boring', 'adequate', 'superior', 'filmic', 'awful', 'large', 'bad', 'real', 'most', 'dimensional', 'first', 'positive', 'technical', 'passable', 'severe', 'miserable'];0.0150703463203463

884;gary_brennan;peter jackson's movies seems to just get better and better. i thought that fellowship was pretty near perfect, but then i watch this and learn that it has included a lot of what the first film was lacking probably due to character introductions et al, action. this instalment has so much action, you may need a day off work to recover from just watching it. from the opening scene where gandalf is tumbling down the cave with the balrog (amazing) you know you are in for a treat. i just could not stop smiling. the battles are much bigger and the enemies are more evil, at times attacking one another in a scene near the beginning of the film. the work done on gollum is just astounding, after about five minutes of trying to work out where the polygons and lines are, you kind of forget altogether that he is computer generated and feel for him as a real person. you can really see andy serkis' performance shine through this character. another hit, another must see.;14 March 2003;8;['well', 'perfect', 'first', 'due', 'much', 'amazing', 'big', 'evil', 'astounding', 'real'];0.190625

886;ringbearer87;"well, it's a question not to be answered lightly. it leaves one feeling as though they are stuck in the middle...did we like it better then the first or didn't we? we can't answer! we don't know! ttt is so different to fotr yet at the same time is so the same. the tone of the film is different and some characters are developed more eg frodo & gollum. while many are not eg saruman. new characters were introduced and all were acted brilliantly yet unfortunately we didn't get the chance to form a bond with them as we did with the fellowship in the first film as there just wasn't enough time to get to know them. the 2nd book is undoubtedly the hardest of the 3 books to translate into film. it is also the hardest to read. there are three different stories to follow and though the film interchanged between characters seemlessly unfortunately the story seemed to stray a little from it's main focus: frodo and his quest to destroy the ring. yet the film was brilliant, don't get me wrong. everyone went in with very high expectations which is never a good thing when seeing a film, yet none left feeling very disappointed. the opening scene was one of the best, with the camera panning over mountains with whispers of dialogue from the first film to be heard in the background and then the reply of gandalfs ""death"" but from different angles to keep fans from feeling cheated. the music was also a huge highlight keeping old themes and adding new ones. the actor who developed the most in this film and who is also terribly under-appreciated was elijah wood. his character changed so much from what it was like in fotr. he is obviously and believably falling ill to the ring and his evil spells were very disturbing to watch as was the relationship between himself, sam and gollum - perhaps the best ever cgi character to date. it would have been nice to see a little more of them and also a bit more of merry and pippin. bilbo's complete absence was also a down point. a little less arwen to make room for bilbo wouldn't have gone astray, yet the flashbacks let us learn the true depth and strains of arwen and aragorn relationship. over all ttt is a brilliant film though i seem to have focused on mainly the bad points. it is alot funnier and darker and more unsettling. the beautiful scenery in still there looking wonderful and all the actors were magnificent. peter jackson had done a marvelous job translating the hardest of the 3 books into film! i give it a 9/10 and i will certainly be going to see it for the 4th time tomorrow!";29 December 2002;10;['first', 'different', 'same', 'same', 'different', 'more', 'many', 'new', 'first', 'enough', 'hard', 'hard', 'different', 'little', 'main', 'brilliant', 'wrong', 'high', 'good', 'disappointed', 'good', 'first', 'different', 'huge', 'old', 'new', 'most', 'ill', 'evil', 'disturbing', 'good', 'nice', 'little', 'more', 'more', 'complete', 'down', 'little', 'less', 'true', 'aragorn', 'brilliant', 'bad', 'funny', 'dark', 'unsettling', 'beautiful', 'wonderful', 'magnificent', 'marvelous', 'hard'];0.1407934343434343

888;jrhee;"i think ttt is *much* better than the fellowship with the sole exception of gandalf who doesn't get nearly enough screen time. other than that, ttt is pitch perfect. who cares if pj ""deviated"" from the written word? translating something from one medium to another always results in changes, and there are always purists who complain - i'm sure when tchaikovsky wrote ""onegin"" the purists were screaming he was murdering the poem, but it's still a great opera. if you want lotr as tolkien wrote it, then go read the book. frankly, i really didn't like the book much at all and thought it was a complete bore (what's with all these unnecessary and irritating characters like tom bombardil? and why do they have to declaim a very long and bad poem every time they decamp somewhere? and it takes the hobbits friggin' *20* years to leave the shire with the ring, after they've told just about everybody who wants to hear they're setting out on this adventure, and packing enough provisions for the entire army of orcs - come on!!). so when the fellowship came out, i went in there reluctantly, expecting nothing in particular, and came out so captivated with gandalf that i saw the movie 7 times. and ttt is even better. is there anything like the battle at helms deep in movie history? i'm going to have to see it again a couple more times to take in the whole thing, because it's a wild movie, and almost overwhelms the viewer, but it's simply great. stop flipping through the pages of the book to see what pj changed and just enjoy yourself.";22 December 2002;10;['much', 'well', 'sole', 'enough', 'other', 'perfect', 'sure', 'great', 'complete', 'unnecessary', 'long', 'bad', 'enough', 'entire', 'particular', 'well', 'more', 'whole', 'wild', 'great'];0.1717592592592593
889;Marmaduke Grove;"surprising absolutely nobody on this planet, this film is in fact very similar to the fellowship film. on the plus side, it's got all it's strengths (cgi, new zealand, mostly wonderful acting, new zealand, length, costumes, music, etc. etc.) on the minus side, it's got most of its weaknesses (mainly the kinda hokey medievalese dialogue, the weird pronunciation of the r's and elijah wood). so assuming you've seen the first one (and if you haven't, and haven't read it, you'll have absolutely no idea what the hell is going on) here are the major points of difference: -the sir ians don't appear much in this one. also boromir doesn't, for obvious reasons. so, the three best actors are barely in the movie. thankfully, bernard hill, who does theoden, makes up for it with a great performance. and the drawing of poison scene with theoden is one of the most imaginative in the film, which is saying a lot -gimli and legolas aren't so gratingly annoying. well, at least legolas isn't. gimli is comic-relief for some reason (although some of it is funny, like when he tells aragorn ""toss me!"") -smeagol-gollum. oh, man, how wonderful is this? the gollum is so fantastic, it kicks the proverbial ass of all previously created cgi characters (even the ones in the final fantasy movie). i don't know if andy serkis (who is billed in the role of gollum) had a lot to do with his 'acting' but if he did, congratulations to him on a great performance, and if he didn't, well, it's kinda creepy that cg can make better actors than most people actors now. -rohan. might as well be called 'the-land-where-all-men-look-like-chad-kroeger-from-nickelback.' otherwise, however, it is superbly done in a true to norse mythology style. the gloominess of the place is at times palpable. -meriadoc, peregrin, samwise actually get to do something in this movie. which is great, 'cause it was a little bit annoying to me to see those three as bumbling idiots over and over again. -faramir. he's not a syrupy-sweet good guy in this one, unlike the book. which i think is an excellent change, even though some say this is some sort of tolkien blasphemy. other changes from the book are also good (well, when they're changes. straight omissions are a little harder to swallow, simply because one is interested 'how would they have done that?' even if it really wouldn't have mattered) -battle of helm's deep. overlong. kinda boring for me. yet no one can say this isn't a movie-making feat worth celebrating. -disjointedness. good on one hand, as elijah wood isn't there so much. bad on the other hands, since it can be confusing as to what is going on where -ents. there is a school of thought that says you can't help but screw up visualising ents. although i disagree, this movie seems to give credence to that notion. how could people that did so well in other ways mess up so embarrassingly here? these ents are comic to me, when they're supposed to be majestic. i don't remember how it was described in the book, and maybe they stayed true to that description, but it just doesn't make sense to me for ents to be smaller than trees, two-footed and quick runners. i was disappointed that the buckland and old forest scenes were omitted in the first one, but now i see why - they just don't do forests that well. it's kind of a shame, really. well, there you have it. i can't give it a ten, cause of the general hokeyness, and cause of the ents. a nine it is, then.";19 December 2002;9;['surprising', 'similar', 'wonderful', 'most', 'kinda', 'hokey', 'medievalese', 'weird', 'first', 'major', 'much', 'obvious', 'good', 'great', 'imaginative', 'annoying', 'least', 'gimli', 'comic', 'funny', 'aragorn', 'wonderful', 'fantastic', 'proverbial', 'final', 'great', 'well', 'most', 'true', 'palpable', 'great', 'little', 'annoying', 'sweet', 'good', 'excellent', 'other', 'good', 'straight', 'little', 'hard', 'interested', 'deep', 'boring', 'worth', 'good', 'bad', 'other', 'confusing', 'other', 'comic', 'majestic', 'true', 'small', 'footed', 'quick', 'disappointed', 'old', 'first', 'general'];0.1610833333333333

896;zworg2;stunning film. graphically superb, visually impressive all round a brilliant amazing sequel to a brilliant film. and we are told that this is just a taster of what is to come, as the third part of the trilogy, the return of the king, is supposed to be even better than both of its predecessors. it has an all star cast lead by ian mckellan and elijah wood and co starring the likes of liv tyler, cate blanchett and bernard hill. but to single out any of the actors is to do an injustice to the rest of the cast. all the performances were stunning doing justice to what is a long enduring story. j. r. r. tolkien wrote this story over one hundred years ago and it is still read and told to children today. my wife and i are now counting the days (well not quite but it feels like it) till the return of the king is released. the story grips your mind from start to finish. each time i have watched this film (twice so far) i have totally engrossed in the screen with nothing else distracting me.;12 November 2003;10;['stunning', 'superb', 'impressive', 'brilliant', 'amazing', 'brilliant', 'third', 'well', 'stunning'];0.675

899;Greg-o-rama;"i just saw ""the lord of the rings: the two towers"" at a preview screening, and it was every bit as good as i expected it to be. the technical elements are cutting edge, and as in ""the fellowship of the ring,"" perfect examples of special effects expertly used in the service of the story. this film will leave you breathless in places, awestruck and bowled-over with the fast-paced action and excitement. ""the two towers"" is certainly darker and grittier than the first film-- as it should be. obviously, the question with this new peter jackson film, as with the last, is: is it true to the book? yes, it captures the spirit of tolkien's writing, and in many places surpasses the dramatic tension of the books. does it stray from tolkien's plot: yes, to a degree. to those that love the books, the differences will be obvious-- and maybe a little jarring-- but once you weigh the changes against the dramatic & visual impact the changes make, you reach the conclusion that these were the right choices for the movie. after all, this is the movie, not the book. don't go expecting to ""see the book,"" with every little plot detail and line of dialogue on the screen verbatim. it doesn't work that way. what jackson has again given us is his visual interpretation of the spirit of tolkien's middle earth, and the results are grand, epic, stunning, literate, surprising, vivid and unforgettable. a vastly entertaining film. sadly, we now just have to wait another year to see the end of the story-- but that film, like this one, will surely be worth the wait.";4 December 2002;10;['good', 'technical', 'perfect', 'special', 'dark', 'gritty', 'first', 'new', 'last', 'true', 'many', 'dramatic', 'little', 'dramatic', 'visual', 'right', 'little', 'visual', 'middle', 'grand', 'epic', 'stunning', 'literate', 'surprising', 'vivid', 'unforgettable', 'entertaining', 'worth'];0.2115760782427449

901;Opus-16;"i saw this film a day ago, and i am still sorting out my feelings for it. whew! with a year to build up anticipation and expectation, it had a lot to live up to. exactly like my reaction to the fellowship of the rings when i first saw it, i left the theater with my expectations both rewarded and dashed. i have read the novel several times, and again the the week before the two towers opened nationwide. i kept thinking, ""wow! that's incredible!"" followed by ""wait a minute--- that's not right!"" due to my own vision of what should have been left alone and what should have been changed for the theatrical version. any 1000+ page epic like the lord of the rings novel leaves each person with their own interpretation, focus, and feel for what they read. peter jackson took on the un-envious task of creating a cinematic vision that would appeal to hard core and casual readers of the novel as well as those who have never picked it up. i'm sure some hard core fans that can't let go of their own vision will be disappointed or even angry, while some non-readers will be befuddled or uninterested. so be it. i myself left the theater dazed and amazed, and with a positive yet somewhat jumbled opinion due to the changes made. now that i've had some time to adjust to the changes and contemplate the film, however, jackson's vision is growing on me. i was vaguely disappointed with ""fellowship"" at first, also, but that initial disappointment has given way to great admiration for fellowship. i now love the first film for it's own sake, separate from the novel. i think the same is going to apply for me with the two towers, especially if the altered story arc comes to a unified and satisfying end in the next part. the visuals, sets, musical score, and costuming are beyond reproach. the pacing is perfect in my opinion. the acting is superb once again. the dialog itself is a mixed bag, but serves its purpose, and is spoken with authority. you can nitpick a few things, such as blue screen lines being visible in some scenes, but for me they never distracted from the overall look of and feel of the film at all. overall, it is an incredibly crafted film, and superior to most of the so called ""blockbuster"" films of late. it is full of action, drama, humor,love, hate, beauty, ugliness, hope, and despair. it's all wrapped up in a visual treat that is compressed into 3 hours of movie magic that if anything feels too short. unless they have no interest whatsoever in the action/fantasy genre or are tolkien purists, i can't see anyone outright disliking what the two towers gives. i, for one, am really looking forward to how jackson is going to wrap up his vision in the third installment. bring on the return of the king! now another year of anticipation and expectation.....";19 December 2002;9;['novel', 'several', 'incredible', 'right', 'own', 'alone', 'theatrical', 'epic', 'own', 'un', 'envious', 'cinematic', 'hard', 'casual', 'sure', 'hard', 'own', 'angry', 'non', 'uninterested', 'amazed', 'positive', 'disappointed', 'initial', 'great', 'first', 'own', 'separate', 'same', 'altered', 'unified', 'satisfying', 'next', 'musical', 'perfect', 'superb', 'mixed', 'few', 'such', 'blue', 'visible', 'overall', 'superior', 'most', 'blockbuster', 'late', 'full', 'visual', 'short', 'third'];0.1757803599908863

905;Adeir;here in belgium, lots of movie critics were not satisfied with this film. i don't know what they expected instead, maybe they're just prejudiced. anyway, it's a must see. it's how the story had to continue to stay true to the book and at the same time be a compelling movie in itself. it's no longer a simple straightforward tale from north to south anymore, the plot thickens, the evil manifests itself more openly and despair grows. the careless shire is long behind us, it's for real this time. the aragorn-arwen thing might be boring to some, but they're forgetting that their story formed a whole appendix in tolkien's work, so it belongs in the major story. besides, it explains the tough choice arwen must make, just like any other character in the movie, they all have to realize the good old times will never return. but for me the best part in the whole movie was gollum. sweet, deceitful, tragic gollum. you can't help feeling sorry for him. his voice, his expression, his dialogues with smeagol, it all makes him one of the most complex and interesting characters of them all. it's just great how they created him, and developed his character so thoroughly in this piece of cinema with an over 30 man strong cast. and for anyone who dislikes it, i'd like to see you get those millions of dollars from the studios and make something better. this what you got, and it's worth every damn penny. counting down from now till december 2003, with hopefully an excellent extended dvd version to keep us sweet in between.;18 December 2002;10;['satisfied', 'prejudiced', 'true', 'same', 'compelling', 'simple', 'straightforward', 'evil', 'careless', 'real', 'aragorn', 'boring', 'whole', 'major', 'tough', 'other', 'good', 'old', 'good', 'whole', 'sweet', 'deceitful', 'tragic', 'sorry', 'complex', 'interesting', 'great', 'strong', 'well', 'worth', 'damn', 'excellent', 'sweet'];0.1020337301587301

908;sasya;"geek alert - this is written by a fan of the original books. if you never read them, my guess is that you won't find this review very illuminating - i just had to get it off my chest :-) after being completely swept away by the amazing fellowship of the ring, this was a disappointment. i completely agree that there must be changes when a book is made into a movie. in the fellowship of the ring, most of jackson's changes to tolkien's tale were judicious - to diminish the amazing number of subsidiary characters somewhat (substitute arwen for glorfindel), even to cut out long sequences made sense to keep the length of the movie reasonable (no old forest) since there really wasn't one minute i would want to cut from what was actually in the movie. not so with the two towers. many of the most exciting scenes from the book are gone or altered beyond recognition and in their place are long and (i hate to say it) boring sequences which don't further the plot or anything else. {spoilers, film and book} * the book's fight over merry and pippin between sauron's and saruman's orcs, essential to why the book and the movie is called the two towers, is completely gone. * the unexpected beauty and courage frodo and sam according to the book found in ithilien on the threshold of mordor are in the film changed to depict violence and power abuse. faramir's role in the movie is instead a quick and superfluous recap of boromir: he wants to use the ring, but in the end he comes round. * in the film frodo here comes face to face with a nazgul - but if sauron thus knew the ring was just outside mordor, he probably wouldn't march on minas tirith, as he (i presume) will do in return of the king. * the added scenes include aragorn being left for dead and dreaming of arwen, who is being bullied by elrond into leaving middle earth. this seems completely pointless, and i find the added scenes with arwen annoying to a degree that makes me root for eowyn as queen of gondor. * another added scene is haldir arriving at helm's deep with an elf army out of lorien - this may seem to be a detail, but it changes the story on a fundamental level, so instead of being about man rising to the challenge it becomes elf going out with a bang. also, it contradicts the opening sequence where the voice-over (quite rightly according to the book) states that the defeat of sauron by elendil and gil-galad was ""the *last* alliance of man and elf"". * another change for the worse is to the ents. first of all, fangorn brings the hobbits to gandalf to ask him what to do. would the leader of the most ancient species do that? second the ents' decision of going to war. in the film, the entmoot is a joke - it goes on forever because entish is a very slow language (as in the book) but they decide not to do anything (unlike in the book). however, when fangorn sees the trees felled by orcs (how come he didn't know about that already - he is after all tree-herd of the forest) he can suddenly give a lot of information in a single shout and in the blink of an eye all the composed ents are suddenly marching to war. * then there is the film's crude exorcist scene with theoden. that would have been a lot more effective if it had been more subtle. and i sorely missed the dialogue between theoden, gandalf and wormtongue which is among the book's finest. * lastly, we see nothing of the book's growing, unlikely friendship between legolas and gimli. instead gimli is only in the movie as comic relief. a movie needs comedy, but maybe it could have been distributed a little more evenly so a whole character didn't have to be eliminated. {end of spoilers} besides these alterations to the story, i just found the movie long and at times boring. where its predecessor jumped from one amazing scene to the next and almost seemed too compact (i enjoyed the extended version even more), for all its battle scenes this movie is at times almost at a stand-still. all that aside, jackson continues the most vivid and captivating visualisation of middle earth ever. gollum is really spot-on. the viking theme chosen for rohan works out well. this movie gets 6 from me.";24 January 2003;6;['original', 'illuminating', 'amazing', 'most', 'judicious', 'amazing', 'subsidiary', 'long', 'reasonable', 'old', 'many', 'exciting', 'long', 'boring', 'essential', 'unexpected', 'quick', 'superfluous', 'dead', 'middle', 'pointless', 'deep', 'fundamental', 'last', 'bad', 'fangorn', 'ancient', 'entish', 'slow', 'single', 'crude', 'effective', 'subtle', 'theoden', 'fine', 'unlikely', 'gimli', 'gimli', 'comic', 'whole', 'long', 'amazing', 'next', 'compact', 'extended', 'vivid', 'middle'];0.0469187675070028

910;John Doe 316;"the day before going to see ""the two towers"" i watched ""the fellowship of the ring"". this movie is truly a masterpiece, better than all of the original star wars movies put together. watching it, i thought to myself, ""the two towers can't possibly be any better than this!"" well, it was. this review does have some mild **spoilers**, but nothing that will ruin your film viewing experience if you read it. one major complaint among many, myself not included, was that nothing much actually happened in the original. well, no one will be saying that about this movie. three hours isn't enough to cram in all the action, and that's with the beginning and the end of the book moved to ""the fellowship of the rings"" and ""the return of the king"" respectively. in terms of excitement, the opening alone matches the original's most thrilling moment. in fact, it expands on it. i won't explicitly spoil it. i'll just say one word: falling. of course, things get more and more exciting from there, with things most definitely building up to a thrilling climax. the climactic battle for helm's deep takes up the best part of the film's last hour, and is worth the wait. quite possibly the greatest cinematic battle ever. in between this great opening and climax are countless fantastic set-pieces and some great acting of a calibur rarely seen in such big-budget movies. the story of the ring, following sam and frodo, is surprisingly the film's secondary story. of course, elijah wood and sean astin are on top form as frodo and sam. we can see the ring is gradually beginning to overcome frodo, and how this is tormenting him. sam, a comic relief of sorts in part one, becomes the more heroic of the two this time round. astin is a wonderful subtle actor. however, both get mercilessly upstaged by a computer generated character. gollum, trying to regain the ring, his ""precioussss"", is caught by the two hobbits, and forced to act as their guide. we see the struggle betweedn the two sides of gollum. one is smeagol, the friendly hobbit-like creature who wants to help his new-found master, the other is gollum, the evil, vindictive creature whose only love is for the ring. the arguements gollum has with himself are amusing and disturbing in equal measure, and actually display the best acting of the whole film. andy serkis, who voices gollum, definitely deserves an oscar nomination for best supporting actor, and could maybe even win where ian mckellan couldn't. i'd love to see a computer-generated acceptance speech from gollum, but that sadly won't happen at the boring academy awards. the acting is also top-notch in the film's main storyline: the battle for the people of rohan. viggo mortenson has emerged as quite the action hero this time round, with aragorn playing a key role. he has the charm, the acting chops and, yes, the fighting skills to become the next big thing. in this film, orlando bloom actually deserves all the teary-eyed admiration he gets from 8 year old girls everywhere. being male, i was seriously skeptical of legolas last year. however, in ""the two towers"" he actually kicks some ass, making mundane things like getting on a horse and going downstairs something thrilling. as gimli the dwarf, john-rhys davies really comes into his own in this picture. gimli takes up the role of comic relief in this film, and, unlike many comic relief characters (i'm not going to mention jar jar binks's name) he is actually funny, relieving moments of severe tension by providing the audience with something to laugh at. it goes without saying that sir ian mckellan is great as gandalf. it's a crime he didn't win an oscar earlier this year. the three main new arrivals are miranda otto, bernard hill and brad dourif, as eowyn, theoden and wormtongue respectively. all are great, but the best is dourif. wormtongue is a walking ball of slime, and every time you see him you want to reach your arms into the screen and ring his puny neck. special mention has to go to christopher lee, a true screen legend. as saruman, lee provides the audience with a tangible villain in addition to the lidless eye of sauron. while in the books saruman was quite a pathetic character, in the movies he is a genuinely chilling villain, one of the best of recent years. in part one, by merely sitting on a throne with an evil look on his face, he established himself as one of the best villains of recent years. in part two we get to see a lot more of the wizard. not only does he have a chilling monologue, but he also has the film's best line: ""there will be no dawn for men."" while he does get a comeuppance of sorts in this film, i look forward to seeing what he gets up to in ""the return of the king"", and i don't know how sauron (in physical form) will top him in terms of villainy. the only point at which the movie slows down is when the action returns to rivendell, with a teary-eyed arwen trying and failing to do some scene-stealing. but even this adds depth to the movie. before you know it, you will be left with a cliffhanger ending even more agonising than that of ""the fellowship of the ring."" 2003 is gonna be a long year. okay, its different from the book, but in my opinion, the first two movies have been better than the books. and by all accounts, ""the return of the king"" is set to be even better.

911;mmitchell-1;if you liked or loved lord of the rings: fellowship of the ring (hereafter: fotr) you'll most likely be very satisfied with the two towers (hereafter: ttt). i was able to catch an advanced screening and i must say that i was quite impressed with the second installment of this trilogy. i must confess that while i've read the books (once in elementary school and again about a year ago), i'm not a devote to the written version. the tone and pacing of ttt is much different than that of fotr, it's faster, darker, and a bit more confusing. now by confusing, it's not as if you ever lose track of what's going on, but rather, since it is told by inter-cutting the 3 main story lines it's harder to relate the story lines to one another than i remember it being in the book. it helps keep the momentum of the movie moving along, but i felt as if it hindered the momentum of the individual storylines. mostlikely a catch-22, so i suppose there's no getting around it. the movie does not stand alone, if you're going to see it, but haven't seen the 1st one or read the books, do yourself a favor and spend the $4 to rent the movie or $7 to buy the book. without this prior info you'll struggle to figure out who these people are and/or what their motivations are. ok, to the stuff you want to know. the battle at helms deep is massive and amazing. gollum is everything you could hope to get from a cgi character and more, not perfect, but probably as perfect as can be at this point. the ents, to me at least were a bit disappointing, both in their rendering on screen and how their story was developed. if anything is slighted in the movie it's the development of the ent characters. bottom line, a very good movie, probably in line with fotr (although having just seen the extended version, which i see as a significant improvement of fotr, i might be overvaluing it somewhat). ttt will also, no doubt, benefit greatly from an extended treatment. the doom and danger in ttt is palpable and the movie rarely disappoints. i'm sure that repeated viewings will only serve to improve the movie, as it is a lot of visual and informational material to ingest in one sitting. i'd rate it at 8.5 (i'd rate fotr a 9.0 and fotr extended version a 9.5 or higher), but again with another viewing or two, i'd probably like the movie even more. go see it now, er...as soon as you can, despite my soft-selling it, you won't be disappointed! after all, if i can enjoy it sitting in a cramped screening room with a head and chest cold and little sleep, i can only imagine that in a real theater in good health you'll enjoy it that much more. i don't want to add to the hype, but this is a damn nice movie.;10 December 2002;9;['satisfied', 'able', 'advanced', 'impressed', 'second', 'elementary', 'different', 'fast', 'confusing', 'main', 'hard', 'individual', 'prior', 'massive', 'amazing', 'more', 'perfect', 'perfect', 'least', 'disappointing', 'bottom', 'good', 'extended', 'significant', 'extended', 'palpable', 'sure', 'visual', 'informational', 'high', 'soft', 'cold', 'little', 'real', 'good', 'more', 'nice'];0.244453125

922;vrillusions;"first off, i just want to say that i have not read the actual books, so can't compare them to the movie. this was the best three hours i have had in a movie theater, period. the cinematography was great and the acting was excellent. gollum, who was focused on a lot of the movie, was done very well. i was afraid we would have another ""jar jar binks"" character. fortunately he isn't annoying, and is intriguing enough that you can't help but watch. although i'll admit some of his close-ups were a little overdone (too drawn out). as for the numeric rating, there are a few things that i take into consideration; variety and intelligence are the main two. when i talk about variety, i am talking about all the different elements that are in a movie. not everyone enjoys the same thing in a movie, so to me variety is key to have something everyone will enjoy. this movie does just that. there is comedy, action, suspense, romance, sentimental moments, fantasy, and that's just what i can think of right now. there will be at least one point in this movie that practically everyone will enjoy. intelligence can be described as the think-ability factor; do you have to think a little when watching it? very few movies out there are like this. the majority of films present everything to you and leaves you, the viewer, with nothing to really think of. the movie is presented in an interesting way, there are three main story lines happening throughout the film. you basically are following one story line for a while, then it moves over to something else. other's probably describe this as ""jumping around"". i personally enjoyed it when after a few minutes into the movie i realized that's what was happening. it makes you think. you have to almost construct three stories happening at the same time. i also liked the fact there was no recap at the beginning of the film, it just starts. that being said, if you haven't seen the first one, you will not enjoy this at all. since both of those rated really well, and i enjoyed it, that's why i'm giving it a 10 out of 10";24 December 2002;9;['actual', 'good', 'great', 'excellent', 'afraid', 'annoying', 'close', 'little', 'numeric', 'few', 'main', 'different', 'same', 'key', 'sentimental', 'little', 'few', 'interesting', 'main', 'other', 'few', 'same', 'first'];0.0396825396825396
923;Bear-77;there are a lot of comments here that will tell you how good this movie is. i agree, it is a wonderful movie, however i would like to comment on a few things that i didn't like. these things have more to do with the adaption of the book rather than the quality of the movie itself. firstly where is faramir? i noticed his name appeared but his character as in the book is nowhere near. faramir is supposedly his brother's opposite, showing that men aren't all bad. also that boromir's fate wasn't bound to the fact that his father is steward (king) of gondor. faramir is exactly like boromir, greedy, thinking first of his own glory rather than the survival of middle earth. ** perhaps spoiler ** another thing is aragorn's 'fake' death. pretty pointless, clearly not from the book and does nothing for the plot of the movie. he just disappears and the reappears a little later. peter jackson could have left this part out easily and instead spent more time on the ents for instance. i however cannot complain about this movie because it is visually stunning and the acting is very impressive, especially from andy serkis. 9/10 (because i am a big fan of the books).;3 January 2003;9;['good', 'wonderful', 'few', 'more', 'near', 'bad', 'steward', 'boromir', 'greedy', 'own', 'middle', 'aragorn', 'fake', 'pointless', 'little', 'more', 'stunning', 'impressive', 'big'];0.2041666666666667
924;S_Rhea;"i would like to know what movie some of the nay-sayers saw, because evidently i didn't see the same movie. let me say that as someone who has read the series no less than five times (and the silmarillion twice), it is very hard for me to be objective about what i still consider to be the crowning glory of fantasy literature. as such, i was extremely cautious when it came to giving any seal of approval to these movies. that jackson made a believer out of me (and several others i know who are even more inflexible in their visions of what middle earth should and should not be) speaks volumes about his directing ability. yes, upon first viewing i saw some definite divergences from the book. however, upon careful analysis i can honestly say the changes are not gratuitous. some roles have been subsumed by others (glorfindel by arwen, the rangers of the north by haldir and the lorien bowmen, etc) and there have been some omissions and even a few minor embellishments. however, the end result is a movie whose spirit is very true to tolkien and translates visually what must have been a monumental task given all the collected prose, elaborate notes, and art of tolkien's beloved world. nevermind the expectations of the fans which hinge on how closely these movies match the internal direction of their own imaginary adaptations of probably the most beloved series of all time. it is my opinion that those who were disappointed by this (and the previous) movie fall into two categories: 1) the nitpickers; those who would not be happy even if tolkien himself had directed. i have heard all the arguments: tom bombadil was missing from the first movie, faramir wasn't supposed to take frodo to osgiliath, the first movie cuts into chapters from ttt and the second movie ends before the literary ending of ttt. to which i respond with a rousing who cares??? do those divergences detract from everything that was done right? do they really change the story? no. 2) those who have never read the books and who are essentially mundane in scope of imagination, inflexible in their views of what fantasy should be, or don't understand that lotr was the defining element of fantasy literature...yes it's a bit cliche, because so many other stories have been based on this story. so, all that being said, i think this movie is stunning and its director very worthy of getting a nod as best director. it did everything i could ever have hoped it would: primarily by recreating the sense of awe and wonder i got when i first read these books. and it has also drawn so many people to reading the books for the very first time. and lastly, it has successfully delivered an epic fantasy to the big screen...something hollywood has tried and failed at for years and years.";26 December 2002;10;['same', 'less', 'hard', 'objective', 'such', 'cautious', 'several', 'inflexible', 'middle', 'definite', 'careful', 'gratuitous', 'lorien', 'few', 'minor', 'true', 'monumental', 'collected', 'elaborate', 'beloved', 'internal', 'own', 'imaginary', 'beloved', 'previous', 'happy', 'first', 'first', 'second', 'literary', 'mundane', 'inflexible', 'defining', 'many', 'other', 'stunning', 'worthy', 'good', 'many', 'first', 'epic', 'big'];0.1268518518518518
925;Miqque;having followed the entire production from green-light, i was entirely pleased with fellowship of the ring and return of the king. however, i did prefer the extended versions on dvd, with the voice-over commentaries and all. the shorter theatrical version of the two towers holds a very special place as perhaps the most exciting film ever made. true, it is not 100% accurate to the novel. it stands on its own. theoden's speeches, the lighting used, the great warg battle, and of course gollum working as well as he did all contributed to an eminently satisfying experience. every actor has taken their role and made it completely their own. the spectacular sets, particularly those of isengard, blend so well with the natural beauty of new zealand to provide both eye candy and attention to the fine details of model-making. the dramatic changes of scene to the approach to mordor are dynamic. and brad dourif gives yet another creepy performance, being one of the finest living actors who has carved out his own niche. perhaps this is a bit violent for younger children, but once they turn ten or so they will likely eat this up with a spoon. never does the gore overwhelm, nor do the spectacular effects dominate the intricate story. great stuff!;6 August 2006;10;['entire', 'green', 'light', 'pleased', 'short', 'theatrical', 'special', 'exciting', 'true', 'accurate', 'own', 'great', 'satisfying', 'own', 'spectacular', 'natural', 'fine', 'dramatic', 'dynamic', 'creepy', 'fine', 'own', 'violent', 'young', 'spectacular', 'intricate', 'great'];0.2502747252747252

933;grahamdavidhughes;it's so depressing that after over a century of film, we are still hearing the same pathetic whinge that movies are not as good as the books on which they are based. i expect this hackneyed cliche to be spouted from some lazy tabloid hack, but it beggars belief that people choose to post such rampant idiocy on a movie website. you are supposed to be movie fans, for god's sake - get a grip! a book is a completely different medium than a film. would you say that the painting of the last supper by leonardo da vinci is not as good as the events described in the bible? would you dream of lambasting the ballet performance of romeo and juliet because all your favourite lines from the play where missing? to review a film on the basis that the director's imagination didn't quite live up to your personally-invoked imagination is not only childish, but ignorant, bigoted and highly offensive to the thousands of people who work their arses off in order to keep us genuinely entertained for a couple of hours each week. to bring an epic of this scale to the silver screen takes years of determination, focus and sheer hard graft. to make a sequel that is far and away the best film of the year takes absolute genius. hats off to peter jackson. john ronald reuel would have been proud. so then, why i am saying the film of the two towers is better than the book? ah, that's because it only takes three hours to watch the film. it took me ages to read the book! sounds silly doesn't it? it should. now, next time you choose to share your informed opinion with the millions of other users of imdb, please bear that in mind.;18 December 2002;10;['depressing', 'same', 'pathetic', 'good', 'lazy', 'such', 'rampant', 'different', 'last', 'good', 'juliet', 'favourite', 'childish', 'ignorant', 'bigoted', 'offensive', 'silver', 'sheer', 'hard', 'good', 'absolute', 'proud', 'well', 'silly', 'next', 'informed', 'other'];0.0074074074074073

936;Groovey;"this is an awesome movie. i've seen it twice now, and i'll probably see it twice more before it leaves the theatres. part two continues the outstanding work done on lord of the rings: the fellowship of the ring. there is a bit more liberty taken with the plot in this one, but with good pacing and balance. the book tends to drag quite a bit in the second volume, as very long plot lines are developed, and the movie does a very good job of keeping things moving with both action and plot development. the special effects are state of the art, and very creative. the ents were particularly well done. wargs, which look more like the hyenas in ""the lion king"" than anything else, were quite good as well. the flying nazgul didn't quite fly right, but was otherwise very realistic. gollum is heart-wrenchingly pathetic, and utterly believable. the cinematography is actually better in this movie than the first, if you can believe it, and the acting shows at least as much depth. go see it in the theatre! don't sit in the front rows for this one, unless you are not prone to motion sickness. there are *many* full-speed, full-screen action shots that are breathtaking, but could be rough on your inner ear if you are up front. there are some surprises in here for tolkien fans. the writers worked some new things in for aragorn, presumably to make the relationships with eowyn and arwen develop well on-screen. the new twists work, and are like the substitution of arwen for glorfindel in the first book: they actually strengthen the plot rather than weaken it. there is one major departure from tolkien which bothers me about this movie, however, and it is the same thing that bothered me about fellowship of the ring. tolkien was painting a very believable fantasy world in which there was nevertheless true nobility in the midst of easily swayed and tempted creatures. aragorn represents a return to a more noble state of humanity -- elrond even calls him the image of the earliest kings in glory undiminished from the beginning. yet aragorn in the fellowship movie comes across as a lost soul who has turned away from his destiny, rather than the true king awaiting his time. he does seem to be developing his character in the two towers, however, and is beginning to show something of a kingly nature. in the same fashion, faramir supposedly hearkens back to the earlier days of gondor, in which there was true greatness among the people of gondor. yet in the movie, faramir is just as weak, just as fallen, as boromir. his actions towards frodo, sam, and the ring are even more debased than boromir's, and more alarming. he does realize his error, but it seems unnecessary. boromir's and faramir's father denethor (not in this movie, but in the next) we can expect to be like this, so faramir represents the counterpoint. denethor and faramir are good and great men, father and son. one chooses pride as a way of life, and lords it over a kingdom as steward in a losing war. the other chooses humility as a way of life, and finds in service a greatness beyond that of his father. part of what makes lotr one of the greater literary works of the past century is its ability to communicate that we all do face choices between valinor and mordor (essentially heaven and hell), we do not have to be born the heir of kings to live nobly, and real examples do exist, for we all have the seeds of greatness within ourselves. frodo, sam, merry, and pippin are all very ordinary characters, but they all achieve a kind of greatness through their struggles. i think tolkien would say, ""so may we all.""";19 December 2002;10;['awesome', 'more', 'outstanding', 'more', 'good', 'second', 'long', 'good', 'special', 'creative', 'good', 'realistic', 'pathetic', 'believable', 'well', 'first', 'least', 'much', 'front', 'prone', 'many', 'full', 'full', 'rough', 'inner', 'front', 'new', 'new', 'first', 'major', 'same', 'believable', 'true', 'noble', 'early', 'lost', 'true', 'kingly', 'same', 'early', 'true', 'weak', 'boromir', 'debased', 'alarming', 'unnecessary', 'next', 'good', 'great', 'other', 'great', 'literary', 'past', 'real', 'ordinary'];0.2181312347073216

""definitive"" is not strong enough of a word. if you still view jackson's epic with scepticism i implore you to put down your preconceptions and your prejudices, but most of all put down the books... this is beautiful way to see middle earth, don't pass it up - the books are the ultimate fantasy epic - the pictures you draw in your head are better than anything you can imagine, but the lord of the rings ""the two towers"" is one wonderful interpretation of that epic story. go, laugh, cry, and sit in awe of this cinematic treat.";19 December 2002;10;['ridiculous', 'own', 'brave', 'second', 'beautiful', 'previous', 'juliet', 'accurate', 'excellent', 'annoying', 'many', 'many', 'emotive', 'powerful', 'disturbing', 'amusing', 'lovable', 'superb', 'evil', 'wormtongue', 'skillful', 'definitive', 'theoden', 'first', 'deep', 'visceral', 'sensitive', 'aragorn', 'induced', 'least', 'new', 'aragorn', 'dextrous', 'physical', 'sensitive', 'empathic', 'warm', 'human', 'super', 'human', 'definitive', 'strong', 'most', 'beautiful', 'middle', 'ultimate', 'well', 'wonderful', 'epic', 'cinematic'];0.2320286195286195

(in the books, the elves explained to sam that some of their skills could have been learned by even a humble hobbit had they the time to study them) for me, the battle of helm's deep was always one of the slower moving parts oif the original books; but here, it is fast-moving and chock full of nail-biting action. as usual, certain compromises between text and film are made, and the one part that does not sit well with me is the character of faramir. this was not the faramir of tolkien, and the character is never quite well realized. but also as usual, the settings are wonderfulthe acting superb, and the music breathtaking. the principle characters who are new, or may as well be new, include the sad princess eowyn, her uncle king theoden, her brother eomer, and the slithery traitor, ""wormtongue"". and, of course, the ruined hobbit known by all as ""gollum"". gollum threatens to steal the show, all the more so because he is a cgi character, brilliantly ""portrayed"" by andy serkis. once you've watched the extended version, you will never watch the theatrical release again. this extended version is much more tolkienseque, more complete, and more fun.";18 September 2008;6;['gandalf', 'demonic', 'wonderful', 'new', 'wonderful', 'fond', 'old', 'huge', 'double', 'deep', 'interesting', 'great', 'advanced', 'certain', 'mysterious', 'high', 'middle', 'mysterious', 'magical', 'humble', 'slow', 'original', 'chock', 'full', 'usual', 'certain', 'usual', 'principle', 'new', 'new', 'sad', 'slithery', 'wormtongue', 'extended', 'theatrical', 'extended', 'more', 'complete', 'more', 'fun'];0.2039568496020109

967;NikolaiDante;"right, first off - this film is awesome - the wide sweeping pan shots are used to the full extent against breathtaking scenery; the special effects blend beautifully with the live action and the battle scenes are simply amazing. now i've read a lot of gripes about how the director strayed from the book, but to these people i say this - you are watching a film, not reading the book. the medium is different and a massive story has to be condensed to 3 hours. also there are large sections of the book that work well as prose but if filmed would be deadly dull so a certain amount of artistic license has to creep in. also if the story was told exactly how the book ran, what sort of surprises and twists would there be for those people that know the books well? as someone who is familiar with the books but not read them for about 20 years, the story did not jar at any point, it flowed nicely from point to point and also the director cut between the three threads (sam & frodo, pippin and whatsisface and finally the battle for rohan) very nicely. there are going to be a lot of mixed feelings about this film considering it is of one of the most famous and well known stories on the planet. my suggestion is that you should just watch it and enjoy it for what it is. there was humour and i think (although some will disagree) it defused the situation just the right amount. no spoilers but things to watch out for and enjoy: the battle of the keep, the attack of the ents, the battle of gandalf and the balrog, dragons, gollum. this film is better than the 1st - i hate to think how good the third would be. the only negative thing i can think of is that as the film ends you realise you now have to wait a year for the final chapter!! this scores 9.9 out of 10";18 December 2002;10;['awesome', 'wide', 'sweeping', 'full', 'breathtaking', 'special', 'live', 'amazing', 'different', 'massive', 'large', 'deadly', 'dull', 'certain', 'artistic', 'familiar', 'mixed', 'famous', 'right', 'well', 'good', 'only', 'negative', 'final'];0.2559266130694702

969;mecandes;"i loved fotr and have seen the se dvd about 8 times already. and yet, i left the two towers a little disappointed, and a little bewildered by all those reviews that claim it is ""better"" than fotr. now, don't get me wrong -- the two towers is a fantastic movie. in fact, it's hard for me to put into words what i think is ""wrong"" with it -- if that's even the right way to say it -- it just didn't have the... sparkle?... of fotr to me. here's a few specific nitpicks: - we just don't see enough of the characters, and they don't interact with each other as poignantly as in fotr. sure, there's more action, more battle -- but less... life... somehow. - does grima have to look so obviously evil? did jackson say, ""the audience is too stupid to realize he is a bad guy, so we need to make him look like a walking corpse so that the idiots watching this movie will understand."" - what's the deal with the way theoden looks when we first see him? i guess they wanted to show his corruption ""visually""... but they went too far, and the difference is drastic enough to prevent the suspension of disbelief. he should have looked sick, or dark, or something, sure... but not 200 years old. - not sure what all the hype about gollum is... he was well done, but the performance didn't blow me away. it was a bit hard to swallow the constant shifting between him being 100% murderous to 100% childlike... i felt like i was constantly ""filling in the gaps"" with my knowledge of him from the book -- not sure how a non-book reader would take gollum... he's kinda stuffed down your throat in the movie. - the dream sequences with arwen were pretty dull. i think they would have been better to stick more closely to the appendix -- show how they met, etc. shoulda played up the conflict between aragorn and elrond more, or something. - the changes to faramir didn't thrill me. i think it was the point where he puts his sword to frodo's throat that it just goes to far. i just don't see why this darker faramir was better for the movie than the gentler book version (though i said the same about the darker prancing pony in fotr... ). and in what way was the osgiliath trip an improvement? it didn't seem to do anything besides introduce a new set. - eowyn seems under-used, alas. during the battle of helm's deep, my wife leaned over and said to me, ""what ever happened to eowyn?"" -- she needed some sort of role there -- not battling, but at least doing something. - i didn't mind them bringing the elves to helm's deep... but there is a cynical side of me that thinks they only did it because they wanted to bring in haldir... someone known and yet expendable. i can't think of anyone else who would have been better suited -- and so it makes me think that they said, ""okay, who can we kill off that will bring at least a little emotional impact. sure, haldir. okay, now how do we get him to helm's deep?""... ;) - i really wish they hadn't used john rhys davies as the voice of treebeard. it's not that there was anything wrong with it -- it's just that i could only hear gimli whenever treebeard would speak, and so it ruined the suspension of disbelief for me... (what reminds you that you're only watching a movie more than the same actor in two different roles?) i mean really, couldn't they find someone else? ...so, all of these nitpicks probably make it seem like i didn't like the two towers, and yet that's not the case at all. it's a better movie than most, that's for sure! but fotr was sooo good, it had my hopes up a bit too high for ttt, i guess. (i don't think ttt is going to be nominated for 13 academy awards the way fotr was... i'd say they'll get a special effects award, but that'd be about it, i think.) anyway, i'm happy to report that the special extended edition dvd of the two towers goes a long way towards addressing my original reservations. in the extended edition of fellowship of the ring, the ""most improved character"" award goes to galadriel -- but here, in the two towers, that award definitely goes to faramir. you get much better insight into his motivations during the flashback with boromir (always great to see more of sean bean!) and his father, denethor. in the book, of course, he is never even slightly tempted by the one ring -- wouldn't even pick it up if he found it lying by the side of the road -- and so it is nice to learn in the extended edition of two towers that he's not tempted by the ring in and of itself: he is only thinking about pleasing his father. another noteworthy addition comes when faramir first captures the hobbits -- in the extended edition, there's a glimmer of faramir's character from the book when he walks over to the body of the fallen enemy and delivers some poignant lines (which i think were originally sam's in the book): frodo: ""those who claim to oppose the enemy would do well not to hinder us."" faramir: ""the enemy? his sense of duty was no less than yours, i deem. you wonder what his name is... where he came from. and if he was really evil at heart. what lies or threats led him on this long march from home. if he would not rather have stayed there... in peace. war will make corpses of us all.""";13 June 2007;9;['se', 'disappointed', 'little', 'bewildered', 'well', 'wrong', 'fantastic', 'hard', 'wrong', 'right', 'few', 'specific', 'enough', 'other', 'more', 'more', 'less', 'evil', 'stupid', 'bad', 'theoden', 'drastic', 'sick', 'dark', 'sure', 'old', 'sure', 'hard', 'constant', 'murderous', 'sure', 'non', 'book', 'dull', 'well', 'more', 'dark', 'well', 'same', 'dark', 'pony', 'new', 'deep', 'least', 'deep', 'cynical', 'expendable', 'suited', 'least', 'little', 'emotional', 'sure', 'deep', 'wrong', 'gimli', 'treebeard', 'more', 'same', 'different', 'well', 'most', 'sure', 'good', 'high', 'special', 'happy', 'special', 'extended', 'long', 'original', 'extended', 'improved', 'well', 'great', 'more', 'nice', 'extended', 'noteworthy', 'extended', 'poignant', 'less', 'evil', 'long'];0.0074790764790764
970;tee_owe;"there are two ways, really, to look at a movie: you can deconstruct it and look at the component pieces, or you can look at it whole and just see how it feels. let's start by looking at the lord of the rings: the two towers the first way. the action is beautifully filmed, with the vistas creating the proper sense of vastness or intimacy. the acting performance are again all better than mediocre; i mean they were all wonderful and credible, even if there were no (live action) standout performances such sir ian mckellan's in the fellowship of the ring. the musical score once again lent its epic sensibility; pounding intensely during the battle scenes and smoothly easing the audience in interludes to the action, but never getting in the way. howard shore rules our earways. the screenplay had some minor issues, and there were a few significant deviations from the book, but the dialogue never seemed awkward. gimli provides some comic relief. faramir, for example, comes off as a much less level-headed guy than he was in the source material. the ent scenes left out a lot of tolkein's art. and shelob is onhold til the third installment... the direction impacts the prespective of the shooting, the characterizations and the overall pace. once again peter jackson nearly aces this stuff. the battle scenes are especially memorable and terribly realistic. as reader of the novels, the pacing seemed awkward at times to me, but this is likely a function of the movie being in the middle. there are three plot strands with the same origin, and the same ending point, which are both out of scope for this film. which brings us to the plot. the classic good versus evil struggle is maintained with pleasingly clear boundaries, at least at the higher level. the film never gets boring, and is never really trite. but the real star of this movie is the special effects. and the headliner here is gollum. one review i read said gollum still looked computer generated at first, but then we forgot all about that. i agree. gollum is simply captivating he alternately creepy and pitiful, homely and at times so ugly he's almost cute. the actor, andy serkis, who wore a motion capture suit during filming, voiced the character beautifully. as one of my friends who saw the movie with me said, ""this is better than anything the star wars ever put out."" the fury of the ents is something to behold. although the ents themselves are not quite as spectacular. a scene like that might have been corny in a lesser-crafted film, but here it was just awesome. my thoughts when looking at the film as whole? not quite as nice as fellowship, but still nice. my main and only complaint is that i never got invested into aragorn and the others enough to really deeply care about their adventures. i cared but not just as much as i thought i should. this was likely because there was so much plot in the film. so technically, ttt was a slighty better film. but i thought fotr was a marginally better movie, made even more complete in the extended version. i look forward to ttt's extended version, where i expect the minor flaws will be addressed. 9/10";19 December 2002;9;['whole', 'first', 'proper', 'well', 'mediocre', 'wonderful', 'credible', 'live', 'such', 'musical', 'epic', 'minor', 'few', 'significant', 'awkward', 'comic', 'third', 'overall', 'memorable', 'realistic', 'awkward', 'likely', 'same', 'same', 'classic', 'evil', 'clear', 'least', 'high', 'boring', 'trite', 'real', 'special', 'creepy', 'pitiful', 'cute', 'well', 'spectacular', 'corny', 'awesome', 'whole', 'nice', 'nice', 'main', 'only', 'likely', 'much', 'well', 'well', 'complete', 'extended', 'minor'];0.0815599516762307

972;eb_redbaron;as a fan of the books and a really big movie buff, i was nonetheless disappointed with ttt. maybe because the first one was so excellent, especially the extended version, which unfortunately one can only watch television-size. it seems to me that a pattern in emerging, where you leave all the quiet, but very important, scenes between actors out of the theatrical version, and instead concentrate on the action pieces. but the tenth shot of an uruk-hai bellowing or of women and children looking frightened becomes boring or pathetic pretty soon. and of course there are the story changes: most of them totally unnecessary and not helping the plot at all. i dont mind the scenes between elrond and arwen (although elrond is really painfully miscast) and the conflict of mortality that arwen faces. in fact, those dream-love scenes were a welcome respite from the action pieces. speaking of which, the whole warg-attack was so useless and stupid! it reminded me of star wars, not a good comparison in my mind. and that aragorn drops off the cliff was dramatically ridiculous. not even people who havent read the book will believe that one of the main characters would die like that in the middle of the movie. furthermore it just mirrored gandalfs fall in the first movie, but at the same time belittled that event. i could go on and analyse the whole movie like that, but whats the point? the addition of laborous action pieces seems the main intent, and not staying closer to the book in terms of story-telling. i think its wrong to consider those movies as pure action-flicks that have to cater to teenage boys. after all, the books are very much loved by men and women alike. so i can only wait for the extended version, where all the really important scenes might have been put back again.... i really love the first movie, but after ttt im sadly pessismistic about part three. the filmmakers left out so many important story-elements, they will never be able to finish the story in any way that resembles tolkiens book!;7 January 2003;7;['big', 'disappointed', 'first', 'excellent', 'extended', 'quiet', 'important', 'theatrical', 'tenth', 'uruk', 'frightened', 'boring', 'pathetic', 'most', 'unnecessary', 'miscast', 'welcome', 'whole', 'useless', 'stupid', 'good', 'aragorn', 'ridiculous', 'main', 'first', 'same', 'whole', 'laborous', 'main', 'pure', 'teenage', 'extended', 'important', 'first', 'pessismistic', 'many', 'important', 'able'];0.0729064039408867
973;bryanlaszlo;i must begin by congratulating the cast and crew- especially peter jackson- on a magnificent job. bringing one of the most analyzed, beloved and discussed book-trilogies to cinema is a true feat. the two towers continues what began as a masterpiece and pushes it to legendary status. i firmly believe the final installment will make the series a true classic. the two towers begins pretty much where fotr left off. i'll spare you the synopsis as so many have been given already. the movie does a remarkable job in tying together the widespread events that form the second book of the rings trilogy, and of course the director had to make several adaptations to make the journey enjoyable and sensible for the viewer. also, the story becomes less intimate as the characters are swept up into events larger than themselves (though, naturally, their contributions weigh heavily in the outcome). i say this because purists are howling and gnashing teeth about the numerous story changes. where they all 'necessary'? maybe not, but if you judge the movie on its own merits, it is an amazing triumph. the effects are incredible. gollum, the much-mentioned cgi character voiced (and motion-acted) by andy serkis, is the new standard for such characters. the battle for helm's deep is intense and epic in scope. the ents are enjoyable and a nice take on a tolkien's vision. overall, the picture is technically superior to fotr largely because of gollum. pacing-wise, the movie will need a little help that hopefully will be addressed in the inevitable 'extended-cut'. there are scenes between aragorn and the elves which seem a little disjointed and negatively affect the flow of the story. these scenes are a minor blemish in an awesome overall effort. see the movie, enjoy it, and make a note to never, ever tick off the ents!;24 December 2002;9;['magnificent', 'analyzed', 'beloved', 'true', 'legendary', 'final', 'true', 'many', 'remarkable', 'widespread', 'second', 'several', 'enjoyable', 'sensible', 'intimate', 'large', 'numerous', 'necessary', 'own', 'amazing', 'incredible', 'new', 'such', 'intense', 'epic', 'enjoyable', 'nice', 'superior', 'little', 'inevitable', 'little', 'disjointed', 'minor', 'awesome', 'overall'];0.3379241726015919
974;kg61410;as the summary points out, i didn't find the two towers nearly as enjoyable as the first episode. reasons for this are i believe quite obvious: the two towers is a mix of many things and tales and fails to grab the audience in the manner the first one did. in fotr you felt enchanted as we were treated with beautiful images (and emotions in particular!) from the shire and from along the journey of the fellowship. in ttt there is really no single plot. the movie consists of the combined tales of different characters and groups and they fail to connect. even gandalf, who in the first was a loveable wise man has become more of an action oriented character. in fotr for ex. you could see gandlaf pondering matters of great importance, and then find out that his wise decicions were based on a better odor in this corridor than the others. this kind of subtle humor and intelligence is missing in the second film. acting is excellent, as is everything else - technically. soul and feeling is what is absent. and the ring. the ring is all but gone, it just hangs on frodos neck. having said all of the above, i still liked the film quite a bit. it's just not as good as the first one, which is obviously the only film you can really compare this to. i give this one 7/10, which is a good grade.

985;briana-1;a year ago, i came out of fellowship desperately wanting more. this week i came out of two towers feeling empty. there were just too many changes from the books this time. not just omissions (like the trip to bree/tom bombadil in fellowship) or enhancements of character (arwen in fellowship), but complete changes of the story. parts were added that i'm sure jackson thought were necessary, but will only serve to alienate the tolkien loyalists. *** spoilers follow ****** i know they wanted to play up the arwen/aragorn romance and maybe even upgrade eowyn's crush on aragorn, but why add the scenes where aragon apparently dies? elves at helm's deep? where was the ent council? as if merry & pippen could really trick the ents into battle. they completely changed the character of faramir and foolishly took frodo, sam & gollum to osgiliath. faramir was to be the counterbalance to boromir, but looked like he was cut from the same cloth (yeah, i know, they're brothers). maybe they're setting something up for return of the king, but tolkien did just fine with all that. would have preferred they cut the new scenes and taken the movie as far as the 2nd book does - including cirith ungol & shelob and gandalf facing saruman at isengard. presumably these will be the beginnings of return of the king. i was also expecting a flashback to lorien and the giving of the gifts by galadriel. ******** not that this was a bad movie or anything. maybe by design it would be the hardest to fall in love with. fellowship had the advantage of developing most of the main characters. return will have the advantage of the climax(es). tt was stuck in the middle without either. jackson further burdened it with the story changes. i loved gollum (most of the time). i loved the internal debate between slinker and stinker. i liked the humor they added with gimli (except the dwarf tossing reference...it worked in fellowship but seemed forced in tt). the battle scenes were good. i liked the physical transformation of theoden after grima had been sent away. i gave the movie a 6 because of the changes they made. maybe not a true rating of the movie itself, but a story this well known must be judged against the book it came from.;23 December 2002;6;['more', 'empty', 'many', 'complete', 'sure', 'necessary', 'aragorn', 'deep', 'same', 'fine', 'new', 'gandalf', 'bad', 'hard', 'most', 'main', 'most', 'internal', 'gimli', 'good', 'physical', 'true'];0.1725279106858054

993;stormlord;i have to say that on the whole i certainly did enjoy ttt. however it failed to grab and hold me in the way that fellowship did. perhaps it was the characters, or the long sitting time but i felt myself getting restless during the whole film and certainly noticed the three-hour sitting time unlike fellowship. the battle at helms deep was by far the most impressive feature of the entire film. in fact if you take the battle away the rest is pretty unremarkable. gollum. he was done very well. after the debacle of jar jar binks in the new star wars films i was dreading the thought of another cgi main character. however old gollum was a delight to watch and listen to. the character portray was just about perfect and the cgi far more impressive that mr lucas lame effort. gollum was by far the most interesting character in the entire movie, he certainly had the most personality, a bit like the holographic doctor in star trek voyager. i know everyone raves about aragorn and legolas but i personally find them to be pretty bland individuals who get by on their brooding manner and handsome faces. they are not very gripping characters and their continual moping wears on you after a time. merry and pippin are far more fun to watch. as stated at the beginning i did enjoy the film but i felt it lacked the emotional impact of fotr. there was no tear jerking moments like when gandalf fell in moria or the death of boromir, it was just a big slugfest and special effects showcase. frodo and sam wandered about in circles most of the time and i felt a bit lost right along with them, like the film was wandering and trying to find its way. non the less return of the king will hopefully put a bit of emotion back into the films and have us pulling at the heart strings like fellowship did so well. 7/10;31 December 2002;8;['long', 'whole', 'impressive', 'entire', 'unremarkable', 'new', 'main', 'old', 'perfect', 'impressive', 'interesting', 'entire', 'most', 'holographic', 'aragorn', 'bland', 'handsome', 'continual', 'more', 'emotional', 'big', 'slugf', 'special', 'most', 'less'];0.3038419913419913

997;Myrilandel;i absolutely adored fotr, even with my impossibly high standards due to my reading the entire series twice. jackson not only was faithful to the plot but also created a movie that was enjoyable on its own. then, the sequel came to theaters. after hearing many rumors of how the plot was going to be altered, i admit, i was apprehensive as i sat down in front of that large screen. my fears were soon justified. yes, the visuals were stunning. yes, the cgi was beyond anything i could have imagined. still, the character development was noticeably lacking. legolas got a little more screen time than in the first movie, but nothing significant, and poor gimli was reduced to comic relief. then, jackson made really unnecessary additions to the plot. between aragorn's repeated fantasies about arwen, and the incident where he almost perished after falling from a cliff, not to mention the kidnapping of sam and frodo by faramir, who was supposed to be wiser than his late brother, i was wondering if the book had been so boring that they had to create an entirely new plot. there were also numerous plot holes. why were merry and pippin brought before the newly-revived gandalf, and then in the next scene it was like it never happened? even with elvish abilities, why did it take such a short time for the lothlorien elves to arrive at helm's deep? for that matter, why were they there in the first place? i realize that artistic license must be taken to bring any book to the big screen, but the unnecessary changes only served to hurt the movie as a movie, book aside. i'm hoping that the final film of the trilogy will return to the original plot and give the characters the depth they deserve.;11 January 2003;9;['high', 'entire', 'faithful', 'enjoyable', 'own', 'many', 'apprehensive', 'large', 'stunning', 'lacking', 'little', 'more', 'first', 'significant', 'poor', 'gimli', 'comic', 'unnecessary', 'wise', 'late', 'boring', 'new', 'numerous', 'merry', 'next', 'elvish', 'short', 'lothlorien', 'deep', 'first', 'artistic', 'big', 'unnecessary', 'final', 'original'];0.1055886672850958

1001;SteveB Ohio;"what more can anyone say about this installment of lotr? it just gets better and better. for those who have complained about this movie being too long, too confusing, having too much violence, having too much added or taken away from the books, etc: how can i politely say this? well, here it is -- quit whining! this is as good as it gets. it should be understood that the task of capturing a story as huge as lotr on film is probably the most ambitious cinema project ever attempted, and peter jackson has succeeded in a huge way. the two towers is epic, grand, awe-inspiring, colossal, and did i say epic? ok, all hype aside, the only one thing that can justifiably be said to criticize this film really can't be helped. as a stand-alone movie, it can be darned confusing. anyone who hasn't seen fellowship of the ring will be hopelessly lost and confused. those who haven't read the books might have a hard time following the fine points of the story. but even people who fit into those categories will be treated to lots of eye candy and spectacular cinemaphotography. ttt is in the unfortunate position of effectively being the middle three hours of a nine hour movie. just like the middle child of a family, it has to struggle a bit to get the attention that its siblings do. fellowship was groundbreaking and emotional; return of the king will likely be spectacular in bringing the story to closure; but ttt has the difficult job of connecting those portions together while still holding the attention of the average movie goer. those of us who are familiar with the books know what is coming next, and how the events of ttt are crucial to setting it all up; while those who don't know the books might well wonder what the point of this movie is. with that rather long preamble, let me say that this movie has it all: drama, humor, action, emotion, spectacular sets and costumes, great acting, special effects that blow you away yet don't call attention to themselves. gollum is nothing short of amazing. he is exactly as he is depicted in the books. his voice sends shivers down your spine and you actually feel sorry for him as he is still tortured by the ring. the ents are superb. the riders of rohan and the city of edoras are just as i imagined them to be. the battle of helm's deep is some of the most incredible battle footage i've had the pleasure to watch in any movie of any genre. etc, etc. ok, now for the nitpicking. (spoiler country ahead!) there were some significant modifications to the story. in the books, the ents didn't have to be tricked into destroying isengard. faramir wasn't really a clone of his older brother in trying to seize the ring for gondor. elves didn't really show up at the last minute to defend helm's deep. the movie left out the role of the huorns (trees with an attitude) in defeating the orcs after the battle. aragorn never took a fall over a cliff only to miraculously return. shelob was left out entirely. (although i fully expect that part to be included in the next and final chapter, since gollum clearly set it up with his talk of ""she'll kill them.."") i can't say if the modifications made the movie better or worse; i'll just trust peter jackson and company's judgment that the changes were necessary in order to adapt a long and detailed written story to a manageable visual one. if every single detail of the books was turned into film, the title might very well need to be changed to ""bored of the ring."" for a purist, the changes might be blasphemy. but in reality, the changes added to the suspense and flow of the movie. no question about it, this one earns a solid 10/10 !";3 January 2003;10;['more', 'well', 'long', 'confusing', 'much', 'good', 'huge', 'ambitious', 'huge', 'epic', 'grand', 'colossal', 'epic', 'only', 'alone', 'confused', 'hard', 'fine', 'spectacular', 'unfortunate', 'middle', 'middle', 'emotional', 'spectacular', 'difficult', 'average', 'familiar', 'crucial', 'long', 'spectacular', 'great', 'special', 'short', 'amazing', 'sorry', 'superb', 'deep', 'incredible', 'significant', 'old', 'last', 'deep', 'aragorn', 'next', 'final', 'well', 'bad', 'necessary', 'long', 'detailed', 'manageable', 'visual', 'single', 'bored', 'solid'];0.1287900874635568

(i've never thought that i will be bored during this movie.) now some good words. gollum was really brilliant - too sad he is a computer graphic, not a human. he deserves an oscar for his part. the effects in general were ok, though, during the battle for helm's deep the orcs were flying aside like toothpicks. the crossing of the dead marshes was creepy enough to scare me out of my wit. the two towers time and time again reminded me that new zealand has a very pretty nature and made me wish to go there. once again, the film is not bad at all, but could have been better. no matter what i will go and see it again any time soon.;3 January 2003;9;['bad', 'good', 'more', 'brilliant', 'high', 'hardcore', 'innumerable', 'bad', 'brilliant', 'exciting', 'endless', 'certain', 'original', 'well', 'possible', 'right', 'crucial', 'deep', 'horrible', 'much', 'possible', 'meager', 'sure', 'following', 'horrible', 'certain', 'bored', 'complete', 'good', 'brilliant', 'sad', 'general', 'ok', 'deep', 'dead', 'creepy', 'pretty', 'bad', 'well'];0.030126050420168

1008;miko4444;if you are a fan of the first movie, don't bother reading any reviews, just get down to the theatre. pj takes more liberties with the second installment of lotr but you'll get over it. my point of view is that of someone who has practically memorized the books, and who liked the first movie, especially the extended version. my comments will be most useful to those who have already seen the second film and also know lotr well. spoilers! one thing i've learned: it's important to see the movie twice, because the first time around i'm distracted by the changes to the dialogue and story. the film opens with a fantastic vision of gandalf's battle with the balrog, and it never lets up except for some slow flashback scenes attempting to pad out the aragorn/arwen romance. i never rooted for eowyn's chances more. a big change from the book is we see arwen apparently head off to the grey havens. in the books, plenty of pressure has been put on aragorn already by elrond, who tells aragorn his daughter won't be marrying aragorn unless he can make her queen of gondor. ain't that enough? all the scenes of elrond and arwen seem to take place in some type of elvish livingroom, making them feel static. the battle of helm's deep makes you forget all about these problems. not only is the story closely followed, it is simply the best battle scene ever in any movie. the ents are delightful, but they get short shrift. this section feels disjointed and undoubtedly some scenes were cut. the same disjointed feeling happens with faramir. i expect the extended version will be far better in these areas. gollum is so good he is just as painful as he is in the book. he speaks a great deal of unaltered dialogue to great effect. frodo is getting on my nerves. nothing wrong with elijah's performance, i'm just tired of his eyes glazing over and almost blowing the quest by handing off the ring to a passing nazgul. the movie ends before the book does. no shelob, alas! but i'm okay with it because a great deal of book iii can and should be trimmed for the movie [the very long journey of the riders of rohan, the trip back to the shire, etc. i'm guessing pj is going to have frodo hop straight on a boat after a much abbreviated version of the scouring of the shire. i am wondering how arwen is going to get back on track. and where the heck are the sons of elrond?;19 December 2002;9;['first', 'more', 'second', 'first', 'extended', 'useful', 'second', 'important', 'first', 'fantastic', 'slow', 'aragorn', 'more', 'big', 'aragorn', 'aragorn', 'enough', 'elvish', 'static', 'deep', 'good', 'delightful', 'short', 'same', 'disjointed', 'extended', 'well', 'good', 'painful', 'great', 'unaltered', 'great', 'wrong', 'tired', 'okay', 'great', 'long'];0.2392857142857142

1027;Anthony_Boyd;"although i'm not going to comment on what the ending was, there are spoilers here. be wary. i read the first 200 comments (or so) that came in. and now that i've seen the movie, i mostly agree. treebeard did look like a puppet, with the background obviously bluescreened in (the lighting was different between the foreground and background). i also agree, after galdalf appeared at helm's deep, the battle scenes pretty much just stopped and the movie moved on. that made a terrifying battle feel less powerful, because the audience didn't get much of a taste for how the battle turned. and i agree that faramir is a different man onscreen than in the book, and gimli is made to look far less threatening since he's the brunt of a lot of jokes. and i'll throw in a couple gripes of my own. the ents took a long time to decide to stay out of the battles. lots of discussion. but then treebeard lets out a howl when he sees some trees cut down, and suddenly all the ents march to war without comment. that made the ents appear inconsistent with their own ways. made 'em look like a plot device. another gripe: sam gives a speech that didn't sound like it was written by tolkein. perhaps it was, but it felt more to me like outsiders were messing with the writing. finally, when the last few men of helm's deep ride out on horses, the enemies basically fall like dominoes as the riders pass. this is unrealistic. part of what i liked about the first movie was that, although the odds seemed impossible, the movie showed you how they survived, how heroic the men were. but in this scene with the riders, there is no way to explain what is happening, it's just cheap. but having read and agreed with almost every complaint, i still give the movie a ten out of ten. faramir's character wasn't destroyed, he'll be fine in rotk. the ents were still quite cool. the audience i was with needed some comic relief after all the seriousness (and the sheer length of the movie!) and welcomed it from gimli. the battle at helm's deep was still spectacular -- i whispered, ""i'm actually scared for them"" even though i knew who would win. you see, all the little gripes that people write about the movie are exactly that... little. on the things that mattered greatly -- did the plot move forward, was the scope of the battle properly conveyed, did the audience feel that they were experiencing a fantasy world with a rich and interesting story -- on all fronts, i say yes. i was fascinated. riveted. and i'll go back to see it a second time without hesitation.";25 December 2002;10;['wary', 'first', 'different', 'deep', 'terrifying', 'powerful', 'much', 'different', 'onscreen', 'gimli', 'threatening', 'own', 'long', 'inconsistent', 'own', 'more', 'last', 'few', 'deep', 'unrealistic', 'first', 'impossible', 'heroic', 'cheap', 'fine', 'rotk', 'cool', 'comic', 'sheer', 'gimli', 'spectacular', 'scared', 'little', 'little', 'rich', 'interesting', 'fascinated', 'second'];0.096551724137931

1029;ableape;"we showed up at 5:00 for the 5:30 showing and the rest of the shows were already sold out for the night. fortunately, i had purchased our tickets online last week (at the matinee prices, no less). after sitting in the third row, center, we were shown ads for drivel such as legally blonde 2 and dumb & dumber 2 (titled dumb & dumberer). this is their target audience? shrugging off the insult to my intelligence, i was treated to the visual and intellectual ride of my theater-going life. the first few minutes are simply intense, and will make you want more, which the final hour of the 3-hour tour provides. i will try not to reveal or spoil too much for those not finished with the books yet. let me first say that peter jackson has skillfully remained faithful to the books, but yet still created his own version of the story by taking creative license when he deemed necessary. some events are invented, rearranged, or removed, but it is easily apparent when taking into consideration the task at hand. my overall impression is that what may have gone overlooked in the books is highlighted enough to show emphasis, yet not overemphasized as to feel insulted. the movie handles most of the second book, ending way before the ""other side of the mountain"" is even reached. it made sense to be a good place to pause the story, since the main climaxes had just happened (helm's deep, and isengard). gollum is featured prominently (and almost repulsively), and faramir's roll is enhanced a little. there is also more emphasis on arwen & aragorn's relationship, too, but that's for the chicks, i think. aragorn has a large roll throughout. the special effects are, again, intense. the 10,000 computer-generated orcs are quite convincing. my trained and critical eye had a hard time finding any flaws, and i think i only found one (i could be wrong). if anything, the battle scenes seemed a bit too flashy, and by that i mean the action zipped by the screen so fast that i could hardly tell what was happening. truly a candidate for next-gen video game youngsters on speed with slo-mo remotes. (or am i just getting old?) otherwise, superb. and the cinematography is, well, how can anyone take a bad picture of new zealand? spectacular. even the musical score seemed improved (and note that enya does not contribute to the soundtrack this time). everyone's acting is nothing less than excellent. gimli the dwarf plays a large part in providing comic relief, almost unexpectedly sometimes, which truthfully i thought the books lacked. again, here is but one of the many examples where the film provides what seems like added ""bonus"" material to the books, without leaving you feeling disappointed about what they left out or changed. overall, i rate this film a carefully weighed 10, which is a grade not readily handed out in my book.";18 December 2002;10;['last', 'less', 'third', 'such', 'blonde', 'dumb', 'dumb', 'visual', 'intellectual', 'first', 'few', 'intense', 'more', 'final', 'faithful', 'own', 'creative', 'necessary', 'apparent', 'overall', 'most', 'second', 'other', 'good', 'main', 'deep', 'little', 'more', 'aragorn', 'large', 'special', 'intense', 'convincing', 'trained', 'critical', 'hard', 'wrong', 'flashy', 'next', 'old', 'bad', 'spectacular', 'musical', 'improved', 'less', 'excellent', 'gimli', 'large', 'comic', 'many', 'disappointed'];0.0840191511387163
1030;epyon-2;"being a fan of lotr for a long time now, and after reading it through several times as well, i was disappointed with the changes that were made in this installment of the movie trilogy. i feel that the changes made in this movie didn't help in any way to advance the plot, nor make it easier to understand for people that have never read the books. certain changes are unforgivable in my mind as well (changing the noble character of faramir in the books, to something along the lines of boromir = totally unnecessary). once again pj has expanded the role of arwen, to my chagrin. however, including her part didn't change any plot points in the story, which i guess i can accept. the numerous changes to the helms deep side of the story (saruman controlling theoden,and eomer's exile; just to name a few) while being minor in some cases, are still totally unneeded. why on earth did they create an elf army to help out?!?!?!?!? i will admit that pj was able to handle the duality of gollum/smeagol quite well. he was one of the few parts of the movie i truly enjoyed (sean astin's portrayal of samwise being the other). while the battle sequence was neat in parts, the unfortunate comic relief that they included irritated me greatly. there are only so many times you can throw in a dwarf tossing joke into a movie (and so far they've had 2 too many, including the one in fellowship). i can see how this movie would be enjoyable to people that have never read the books, but i believe that tolkein fans worldwide let out a universal grumble at many of these changes.";31 December 2002;4;['long', 'several', 'disappointed', 'easy', 'certain', 'unforgivable', 'noble', 'unnecessary', 'numerous', 'deep', 'few', 'minor', 'unneeded', 'elf', 'able', 'few', 'other', 'neat', 'unfortunate', 'comic', 'many', 'many', 'enjoyable', 'universal', 'many'];0.0820294784580498
1031;mhalvorson;what a full on final hour! this was real edge-of-your seat stuff and to be honest i will have to go again to take it all in. this was great action cinema. i found the contrast in pace of the three threads of the story quite good in terms of keeping your interest, otherwise the tone of the film would have been too frantic. ***spoilers*** good bits. gollum - what a great job was done on smeagol! there will be no best supporting actor nomination, but it should be acknowledged as a major step forward in use of technology while maintaining the emotional quality of the acting. the nasty, pathetic, tragic nature of this character was perfectly shown and the split personality dialogue was brilliant. action - none better. was a bit much for my wife but i loved it. comedy - needed to break up the mood. gimli lights up a small part of the gloom (second movies in trilogies seem to always be the darkest). bad bits. not many and frankly i feel that it's a bit picky, but i thought the nobility and tragedy involved in the ents was not brought out as well as it might have been. different bits. there has been enough said about the movie vs book changes so far so i'll keep it brief. there was enough battle without the wargs, which were merely an excuse for liv tyler and hugo weaving to get screen time via a dream sequence. i can see the need, but it was a distraction. elves at helm's deep. basically this appears to have occurred to try and balance that fact that the elves had been painted as letting the poor humans do all the work to this point. fair enough. also, we needed a character to kill off, as tolkien didn't really see the need for anyone to die in most of his trilogy, which is a bit silly in what is basically pages and pages of fight and flight. fair enough again. can't wait for number three.;5 January 2003;10;['full', 'final', 'real', 'honest', 'great', 'good', 'frantic', 'good', 'great', 'major', 'emotional', 'nasty', 'pathetic', 'tragic', 'split', 'brilliant', 'much', 'gimli', 'small', 'second', 'dark', 'bad', 'many', 'picky', 'different', 'enough', 'brief', 'enough', 'deep', 'poor', 'fair', 'most', 'silly', 'fair'];0.1056034482758621

1033;mitchell_k81;i hadn't read the story until last summer. i read it all. i hadn't given it a second look by the time two towers came out. one thing about the storyline needs to be addressed asap: there were no elves at helm's deep! nowhere in the text are any more than one elf, legolas, even mentioned. there is no mention of the last alliance of men and elves at the defeat of sauron, like in the prologue of fellowhip. eowyn was not at helm's deep, but that addition to the story is understandable, it makes female parts bigger. there is no mention of the entwash and no mention of when merry and pippin drink from it, they end up being four or five inches taller than they were before drinking the water. the entmoot was smaller in the movie, but digital characters take a lot of time to render, so that is understandable as well. i think that new line and the producers of this movie messed big time even before releasing the movie. they showed gandalf in the trailers. that is one of the best parts of all the middle earth stories, when gandalf comes back from death and you think it's saruman. by showing in the trailers that he is alive, it removes almost all of the suspense. i think that this was an idea of the people of new line more than it was on the part of mr. jackson. i think he would have realized this but new line had the final say. i hope this was the case. i give this theatrical version an 8 out of ten because of all the missing stuff and craptacular addition of the elves at helm's deep.;7 January 2003;8;['last', 'second', 'deep', 'more', 'last', 'deep', 'understandable', 'female', 'big', 'tall', 'small', 'digital', 'understandable', 'new', 'big', 'good', 'middle', 'alive', 'new', 'new', 'final', 'theatrical', 'craptacular', 'deep'];0.0729545454545454

1035;RowdyJimmy819;"this was a truly awesome movie. i knew it was going to be awesome before i even walked into the theater. i knew this because (1) it is the sequel to lord of the rings: the fellowship of the rings and (2) the book is awesome. i had read about half the book when i saw the two towers, and i must say it followed the movie very closely. the pacing of the book and movie is different in that the book tells all of aragorn and friend's story first then frodo's story. the two plots parallel each other in the movie, but i'm cool with that. let's talk about the good things in this movie. once again, elijah wood, ian mckellen, viggo morteson, and all the rest provide us with great acting jobs. i guess they just really get into their characters. the script was great also; it was faster, funnier, darker, and more intelligent then the original. second: howard shore and his brilliant score. i love his use of themes here. from the fiddle for rohan to the tried-and-true lothlorien theme, it was all great. it wasn't all fast paced drums, strings, and brass for the battle sequences either, although the music certainly got your pulse throbbing at some points. third: gollum. i didn't know what to expect of this creature. i had heard great things about him, but i had not read his part of the story when i saw the movie. i still wasn't sure what to think of him after the movie. but i'll be damned, that is the finest piece of computer generated acting i have seen. and of course, the cinematography and special effects were awesome. if you've seen the first movie, expect more of the same and then some. case in point: the battle of helm's deep. *spoiler!*spoiler!* now for my one complaint. it left a very important scene from the book out of the movie. i won't go into great detail for those of you reading the book, but there is a scene in the middle of the two towers (it would be at the end of the movie) where gandalf and saruman have a confrontation, only this time the tables are turned. it would have been awesome to see these two wizards duking it out once again, but alas it was not to be. hopefully it will be included in the third installment of the series. that is the only reason i do not give this movie a perfect 10. i wanted to see more saruman and gandalf, but jackson did an awesome job with this movie anyways. from the opening shot to the last reel, it is a spectacle to behold. rating: 9/10";23 December 2002;9;['awesome', 'awesome', 'awesome', 'different', 'aragorn', 'other', 'cool', 'good', 'great', 'great', 'fast', 'funnier', 'intelligent', 'original', 'second', 'brilliant', 'true', 'lothlorien', 'great', 'third', 'great', 'sure', 'fine', 'special', 'awesome', 'first', 'more', 'same', 'deep', 'important', 'great', 'awesome', 'third', 'only', 'perfect', 'more', 'awesome', 'last'];0.4992517006802722

1037;Ian Livingstone;this movie was a disappointment for me, i am a huge tolkien fan and i loved the fellowship movie, but two towers has some big flaws that prevented it from being as good as the first in the trilogy... 1. very americanized, they put alot of cheesy hollywood gimmicks into it, they also obviously added more of viggo and orlando, because of the sucess of the previous film. i found these thing disturbing, and it shamed tolkien's perfect tale. 2. bad editing/pacing. they felt they had to juggle all of the characters more and more throughout the movie, it is very distracting because in the book, tolkien perfectly went from one group to the next, right when you're getting really excited, so it kept the interest of the reader high. this was not done in the movie however. 3. more changes in the story. the film's biggest flaw, they changed more of the story, added some lousy scenes into the movie that weren't in the book, and had some bad add-ons also. this disappointed me because they were pretty good about keeping the movie close to the book in the first movie, what i felt this movie was is a gift to the stupid audiences to make more money. i just wanted to stress these major flaws because all the reviews i have seen say this movie was great, even better than the fellowship. but there are a couple good features in this film, like gollum is spectacular, i have to take my hat off for the special effects people, because that character was extremely well done. and i was impresses with elijah wood's acting in this movie, he was outshined in the first one, but he really showed his talent in a couple scenes in this one. overall, i would say this movie was 7.5/10, but perhaps people would like it if they haven't read the books, and had nothing to compare it to.;7 April 2003;7;['huge', 'big', 'good', 'first', 'americanized', 'more', 'previous', 'disturbing', 'perfect', 'bad', 'next', 'right', 'excited', 'more', 'big', 'more', 'lousy', 'bad', 'good', 'close', 'first', 'stupid', 'more', 'major', 'great', 'well', 'good', 'spectacular', 'special', 'first'];0.1986552028218695

1043;aaronjustice;"*spoilers, beware* for my birthday i saw the two towers with about ten of my friends. never before have i seen such an unbelievable spectacle of cinema accomplishment. my biggest problem with the whole movie was some of the shots of the hobbits on the shoulders of treebeard. that's about it. gimli, the stout little dwarf who was pretty much in the shadows last time, is now out in front with his quirky and very funny scenes. there was hardly a scene in which the surly ""man"" didn't give a laugh. dead wargs piling on top of him, his complaint of a lack of a view at helm's deep, and his unbelievably humorous shot of him gouging a berserker uruk-hai in the crotch with his axe. that's funny. i was so pleased with gollum. he interacted so perfectly with the live actors it was hard to looks at him and remind yourself he wasn't real. the close-ups on his face are what give him such a dimension of a real, physical character. yes, dobby and yoda did look quite good in their respective movies (harry 2 and star wars 2) but gollum not only looked better, he performed much better. see the movie to understand what i mean. well, i have found two other complaints. merry and pippin were virtually forgotten in this movie. their scenes were almost as if they were put in only because they had to. also the overall feel to the movie made it drift away from the first, and sometimes, even though i have read the books and seen the first movie quite a few times, i found myself somewhat lost or puzzled by the movie. however, this movie was filled with scenes that more than made up for the weak points of the movie. depending on what kind of movie you prefer, this movie is better than the first. if you like the first one better, that's because these two movies share almost nothing in common, and i understand why some people liked the first one better. however, other than the first movie, there is one thing that i have never heard in a movie theater, and i've seen nearly every worthwhile movie since gladiator. applause. the theater erupted in applause by the film's end. that is the testament of the strength of this series, and may the return of the king prove us all wrong that movie making can't get any better than this. 10/10.";23 December 2002;10;['unbelievable', 'big', 'whole', 'gimli', 'stout', 'little', 'last', 'quirky', 'funny', 'surly', 'dead', 'deep', 'humorous', 'funny', 'pleased', 'live', 'hard', 'real', 'close', 'real', 'physical', 'good', 'respective', 'harry', 'other', 'overall', 'first', 'first', 'few', 'weak', 'well', 'first', 'first', 'well', 'common', 'first', 'other', 'first', 'worthwhile', 'wrong', 'well'];0.0681936553030302

1046;Zulu_King;i purposely held off reading anything on imdb (except for a nyt review) on this film by wanting to experience this film-as its predecessor-as 'clean' as one can view a film without any preconceptions. i have not even read the novels the film is based on as half the world has. so, i come to this epic unadorned but enthralled. without a doubt, this second installment is a powerful-perhaps even more so-than the first. this story itself is not burdened with set up and character development, as the first was, and opens where the last stops-with the band of brothers separated and scattered to the four winds. jackson very quickly establishes the scene and moves the film forward, culminating in the battle at helms deep. there are few wasted moments as the film continues at a frantic but never rushed pace throughout. when merry and pip end up with then ents, only then does the film slow a bit but not to its detriment. the film crosscuts between the separated principles but the viewer is never confused. the actors all seem to be defined by their characters (as opposed to the other way around) and a very comfortable in the company of others. truly amazing considering all three films were shot concurrently and out of sequence. there are many, many outstanding moments in this three-hour film starting from the first, where we see what happens to gandolf after his fight at the bridge and as he falls into the abyss. the second is the visualization of gollum. the third would have to be the ents. and the four-oh boy-the battle at helms deep is quite simply a stunning, excessively violent exercise in cinematic genius. and it is only genius that can make a complicated battle and all its confusion accessible. and it is nothing short of genius to be able to deal with seven years of pain and deliberation, passion and art, actors and actresses, crew and extras, artists and artisans. i wish my father were alive to see this epic. lotr was a favorite of his as a novel. alas, he died just a cgi effects where really starting to make a tremendous impact in the world of cinema and missed many-a fine film-from twister's kitsch to titanic's operatic doom. but lotrs would have particularly pleased him. peter jackson has left an indelible mark and permanent mark on cinema, making what was regarded as impossible possible. but look how he achieved this-this was no mere achievement by a single studio but by a whole country. to the kiwis, lotr became akin to a national obsession by marshalling casts and crew of thousands for years and years, using the entire country as a backlot. imagine most of hollywood working on a single film for five years! mind boggling and now legendary. we will never see anything like it again. the harry potter films could have approached this (in that there are seven novels with four give green light) but are laughably inferior and infantile to a fault. perhaps, now, the green light could be given to some other long series such as asimov's foundation saga or cs lewis's narnia series.;22 December 2002;10;['clean', 'epic', 'unadorned', 'second', 'powerful', 'first', 'first', 'last', 'deep', 'few', 'frantic', 'confused', 'other', 'comfortable', 'amazing', 'many', 'many', 'outstanding', 'first', 'second', 'stunning', 'violent', 'cinematic', 'complicated', 'accessible', 'short', 'able', 'alive', 'tremendous', 'many', 'fine', 'operatic', 'indelible', 'permanent', 'impossible', 'possible', 'mere', 'single', 'whole', 'akin', 'national', 'entire', 'most', 'single', 'legendary', 'green', 'inferior', 'infantile', 'green', 'other', 'long', 'such'];0.0939123376623376
1047;stabo;all the hype and glamour surrounding this movie has, in one way or another blinded people. if one sits back and takes an objective look at these two movies that can see how truly great they are. so much effort and thought went into the making of lord of the rings. it deserves a lot of credit, as it is one of the most complex stories ever written. the locations, the actors, the dialogue, the humour and the music are all top notch. both movies ooze class on all grounds, and we're too blind to see it. even those who enjoyed the films may have been swept up in it all, and could come to love it even more if they are more observant. i feel sorry for anyone that didn't enjoy both movies, your mind must be completely shut and void of all imagination. if you did your research into the magnitude of the story, you will know that no one could ever had directed, or made the movies any better. the sheer volume of material that had to be included would leave anyone for dead. but peter jackson managed to pull it off. of those who don't care for a story of such brilliance and magnitude, at least have the intelligence to acknowledge the quality of the production. we live in a world where everyone thinks they're movie experts. clear and detach your mind from all preconceived notions, sit back and watch both films again. only then will you be able to appreciate the splendour of the story and the movies. i will be very surprised if anything even comes close to this trilogy in the next decade. it is truly worth 10/10.;26 December 2002;10;['objective', 'great', 'much', 'complex', 'top', 'blind', 'observant', 'sorry', 'void', 'sheer', 'dead', 'such', 'least', 'clear', 'preconceived', 'able', 'surprised', 'next', 'worth'];0.0333333333333333

1054;BIGHAIRY-1;'i hope this is as good as the fellowship'. that was my initial thought when i sat down to watch 'the two towers' at the cinema on the 18th december 2002. thankfully this lived up to my expectations as much as the first movie did. mr jackson, like the plot, had continued where he had left off in 'fellowship'. the two towers looks & feels perfect. the pace is quick, but never rushed, the acting is excellent & is never allowed to become to camp or 'hammy' & it all looks beautiful, thanks to the use of new zealand as middle earth & some of the greatest visual effects ever seen on celluloid. the plot continues where the first film left us. frodo & sam (elijah wood & sean astin) have gone off alone to mordor to try to destroy the ring & aragorn, gimli & legolas (viggo mortensen, john rhys davies & orlando bloom) have decided to pursue the uruk hai who have captured merry & pippin (dominic monoghan & billy boyd) & are taking them to see good wizard gone bad saruman (christopher lee). along the way we are introduced to more characters, some good, king theoden of rohan (bernard hill) his niece eowen (miranda otto) & her brother eomer (karl urban) & faramir of gondor (david wenham) who is the brother the now dead boromir. we also meet the scheming grima wormtongue (brad dourif) & gollum/smeagol (andy serkis). we also meet new fantastical creatures such as ents (giant walking trees) & fell beasts (flying lizards that the nazgul now ride). the film has a plethora of wonderful set-pieces that take your breath away. there are the wonderfully imagined ents, 2 fantastic skirmishes between riders of rohan & orcs, one of which involved large wolf like creatures called wargs. then there is the battle at helm's deep (the fortress stronghold of the people of gondor). this has to rank as one of the greatest battles ever seen on film. it truly does take your breath away when you see an army of 10,000 orcs marching towards a fortress built into a mountain, manned by only 300 soldiers & 150 elves. the battle scenes are intense, violent & fairly graphic, but thankfully the violence is never gratuitous. but all of that is almost forgotten in comparison to the single greatest special effect ever to grace the silver screen. gollum. actually, to call gollum a special effect is being unfair to andy serkis. because, although what you see on screen is a computer generated image, gollum is brought to life by the magnificent serkis. his voice, movement & performance are what brought the best out of weta when they were designing gollum & without him they wouldn't have created this phenomenon. and this creation is so good that you forget the he is cgi. not only this, he steals every scene he is in, whether he is the gollum seen in the opening attack on frodo & sam to the cowering, snivelling subservient wretch that is smeagol. he also provides the highlight of the film. when the personalities of gollum & smeagol come head to head in a moonlight confrontation, it is like being hit in the heart with a 500lb emotional sledge hammer. this is a film that deserves to be seen by everyone on the planet. my only gripe is that the magnificent andy serkis wasn't nominated for an oscar for his powerhouse performance. see this film, i implore you all.;23 June 2004;10;['good', 'initial', 'first', 'perfect', 'quick', 'excellent', 'hammy', 'beautiful', 'middle', 'great', 'visual', 'first', 'uruk', 'dominic', 'good', 'bad', 'more', 'good', 'dead', 'new', 'fantastical', 'such', 'giant', 'wonderful', 'fantastic', 'large', 'deep', 'great', 'intense', 'violent', 'graphic', 'gratuitous', 'single', 'great', 'special', 'silver', 'special', 'unfair', 'magnificent', 'good', 'good', 'emotional', 'only', 'magnificent'];0.3070984570984571
1055;Person555;vote: 8.8 (rounded up to 9) the lord of the rings: the two towers is an amazing movie that any tolkien fan, adventure fan, or war fan should see. acting: elijah wood as frodo is amazing. he really captures the pain that the poor little hobbit must be going through. ian mckellen as gandalf is excellent,even though he has a much smaller role than in fotr. viggo mortenson as aragorn was another good choice and you could really experience what he must be going through. john rys-davies was really good as gimli, but his jokes got really tiring before the end. sean astin as sam fit the description of good old sam well and also acted out the character perfectly. bernard hill as theoden, brad dourif as grima, miranda otto as eowyn, karl urban as eomer, david wenham as faramir and liv tyler as arwen were all excellent actors. gollum was really amazing. andy serkis deserves some award, for the perfect cat coughing up fur ball voice for gollum, and kudos to the design team who made the motion capture suit. i wish we could have seen more of christopher lee as he is a superb actor. orlando bloom as legolas, on the other hand, sucked. he had absolutely no emotion and if it wasn't for his fighting scenes then the character would have been totally wasted. dominic monaghan as merry and billy boyd as pippin were also good actors. directing: peter jackson did another excellent job in this movie, though as i said in my fotr review, his career as a horror movie maker hurt him. the scene where all the dead orc bodies were piled up and one of their heads was on a pole wasn't really necessary (and then gimli was going through the burning remains (hmmmm orc barbecue), and there was another stupid scene were you saw the uruks being born out of mud sacs. screenplay: good, the only scene they needed was the one in the extended edition of the flashback between faramir, boromir and denethor. that scene was really necessary to describe faramirs character special effects: too amazing for words. the battle of helms deep was so perfect you couldn't tell what was cgi and what wasn't. gollum didn't look like a fake. the battle of isengard was also well done and when the ents broke the dam and isengard was flooded i was reminded of a disaster flick. the special effects alone were worth the price of admission. other: again the cinematography was beautiful and just jaw-dropping gorgeous. makes me really want to visit new zealand just to see the places they filmed. rohan, and edoras especially were beautiful. howard shore's score was excellent. the rohan theme song fit the beautiful scenery perfectly. overall: an excellent movie worth seeing. if the filmmakers weren't so stuck up about themselves this movie would be even better.;13 February 2005;9;['amazing', 'amazing', 'poor', 'little', 'excellent', 'small', 'good', 'good', 'gimli', 'tiring', 'good', 'old', 'theoden', 'excellent', 'amazing', 'perfect', 'more', 'other', 'dominic', 'good', 'excellent', 'dead', 'necessary', 'gimli', 'stupid', 'good', 'only', 'extended', 'necessary', 'special', 'amazing', 'perfect', 'special', 'worth', 'other', 'beautiful', 'beautiful', 'excellent', 'beautiful', 'excellent', 'worth', 'well'];0.4364795918367348

1059;quickdog;"i have read the books several times and remember their messages. peter jackson and his team have not lost those messages or what the peoples of middle earth represented in tolkien's time. in the first movie the messages where: ""not how much time you have but what you do with the time that you have."" ""even the smallest person can make a difference."" and there is, of course, temptation and corruption. sarumon fell to corruption. borimir fell to temptation. the two towers main message is about isolationism. treebeard will not help. ""it is not our problem. this is a war of men."" much like the times tolkien lived through in world wars i and ii when the united sates did not want to fight a european war. when the hand of evil can stretch across the globe it affects all the world and thus all the world must stand up against evil as the united states eventually did. genghis kahn. napolean. adolf hitler. mussolini. stalin. khadafi. saddam hussien. osama bin laden. the times change. the names change. the evil remains the same. of course there is the burden people must bare throughout history. frodo bares this burden by carrying the ring of power to see to its destruction. there are many more messages in this film and in the books. i challenge all to find them. the movie itself is breathtakingly filmed and very well acted. i would like to put in a word for best supporting actor for andy serkis as gollum and the animation team. they would rightly deserve the honor. this film will definitely take home an acadamy award for special affects for the battle of helm's deep. i cannot say more. no words can really describe the granduer of this movie. it is a must see and one of the best movies i have ever seen.";23 December 2002;10;['several', 'middle', 'first', 'much', 'small', 'main', 'treebeard', 'european', 'same', 'many', 'more', 'good', 'acadamy', 'special', 'deep', 'more', 'good'];0.2445578231292516

1062;soukie;all in all, a wonderful adaptation of the middle part of the lord of the rings story. the first 5 minutes get the viewer back to tempo and tension of the first movie ending. what follows is an incredibly intricate weaving of the many story lines that together resonate as a true symphony. smeagol/gollum portrayal is breathtaking (and i do not mean the computer graphics). the slight change in the character of faramir towards being more tempted by the ring is minor (since it only furthers a trace suggested by the book) and it works miracles. frodo is fittingly shown as having a lot in common with smeagol. the character interaction between frodo, smeagol and sam tells us so much in so little space. all other members of the fellowship grow immensely too. if only there was more development between gimli and legolas. but since the extended version of the fotr gave more of this, i hope to see gimli in the caves and making a deal with legolas in the extended version or in the return of the king. the ending of course-- i cannot suggest a better point at which to end the middle movie so i am not going to complain. i am glad that the movie really has the feeling of a middle part of the movie and that it does not try to work as a stand-alone story.;18 January 2003;9;['wonderful', 'middle', 'first', 'first', 'intricate', 'many', 'true', 'slight', 'minor', 'common', 'little', 'other', 'more', 'gimli', 'extended', 'more', 'gimli', 'extended', 'well', 'middle', 'glad', 'middle', 'alone'];0.1888020833333333

1071;MashedGravy;"warning - spoilers included... magic with which middle earth came to life in fellowship is wearing thin in the two towers. its a complicated trilogy, maybe the most complicated filmmaking ever attempted. not just adapting tolkien's story for the screen, but the filmmaking craft itself is stressed to the limits. it must have been a nightmare to shoot, all the angles for a single scene, and i can only imagine the horror of editting it... however, while technical part of the craft is well done with only minor quibbles, its the storytelling that suffers in the two towers. though i am a great tolkien fan, i am reviewing towers as a film buff. books aside, this is a separate creation. when towers work, they do so splendidly, but when they dont they dwell on mediocracy. this however is not the fault of being a ""middle"" film. the ents with merry and pippin story is the most solid part of the towers. it has ups and downs but it stays coherent. when it suffers it does so due to it being the shortest of the three stories. it is unfolded a bit awkwardly at times, considering what is going on in the other two. visualising walking and talking trees is no easy task, and they are visualised perfectly. they brought tears to my eyes... the main plot with aragorn, legolas and gimli is a mish mash. they have a task and they are at it. sadly, it doesnt work all the time. the plight of rohan is established well, with a small village forced to exile before an orcish onslaught. the trouble begins in edoras. bits were corny, purging saruman from theoden - the excorcism scene for example. bigger fault by far is the retreat to helm's deep. i never really felt like it was something they had to do. it felt contrived, devoid of suffering. the plight of rohan that was well established early on was not continued here. battle of hornburg, the helm's deep is generally well done but is set up with mixed emotions. a few corny scenes before the battle ruin the atmosphere and despair of rohan men, women and children is not portrayed well. the battle itself is grand, trully epic. some heroic stunts could have been omitted though. frodo and sam and gollum, ah yes, the gollum. all kudos to peter jackson and the crew for the gollum they created. they could have easily gone for a cute gollum, e.t.esque... instead, they brought a trully sad and tormented creature to life. the towers shine when gollum is on screen. the smeagol vs gollum dialogue is amazing. you love him and hate him at the same time. the weakest part of the towers is the story of frodo, sam and gollum encountering faramir and the army of gondor. it is cold and uninvolved. the whole plot is too long for the little it tells. faramir had to be introduced better... only magical moment here is gollum running with a fish in his mouth! as a whole, three hours of the two towers go by in a breeze. hopefully the extended edition will remedy some of the problems. the magic of fellowship still lives in towers. except in gollum scenes, it is most evident when gandalf with eomer and the riders of rohan charge down the hill into thousands of orcs... it cuts then to the ents tearing through isengard... epic, trully epic... it brought tears to my eyes.";27 January 2003;8;['middle', 'complicated', 'complicated', 'single', 'technical', 'only', 'minor', 'great', 'separate', 'middle', 'solid', 'coherent', 'short', 'other', 'easy', 'main', 'gimli', 'mish', 'small', 'orcish', 'big', 'deep', 'devoid', 'deep', 'mixed', 'few', 'grand', 'epic', 'heroic', 'cute', 'sad', 'tormented', 'amazing', 'same', 'weak', 'cold', 'uninvolved', 'whole', 'long', 'little', 'magical', 'extended', 'evident', 'epic', 'epic'];0.0510808270676691

1077;eclipsse;"i will cheerfully admit that i am a tolkien fan, and was concerned about the changes that i had heard/read about on the web sites etc. however, i decided to go and see it - keeping an open mind - and try to keep my rabid fandom under control (!) yes, the film is excellent. yes, there are flaws, but not enough to change the experience significantly. yes, the story is substantially changed from the book. so what? i have read the book at least once a year since i was nine, which adds up to a ""tidy few"". i would just like to make one or two points - 1. literature and film are two completely different media, with completely different strengths and weaknesses, problems and constraints, and those expecting to see exactly what was in the book - everything that was in the book - were always going to be disappointed. 2. in the book, tolkien ""travels"" with each group in turn, skewing the timelines substantially until everything is tied up at the black gate. in film, it would be confusing to do that, as you would have subtantial chunks of the film based around each set of characters in turn, so many cuts and a ""contemporaneous action"" system makes sense, as peter jackson has so ably done. 3. the book finishes on a particularly grim note, and is not a suitable cinematic closing point. the review bit - i thoroughly enjoyed the film. i thought the acting was superb, the technical aspects unmatched in any other film i have seen, and the production felt so much that this was a living, breathing world that we were somehow able to get a sneaky glimpse into. i thought that orlando bloom and viggo mortenson developed their characters superbly, with my only major niggles being the 'comic relief' role that has been given to gimli - he is never very prominent in the book, but the ""jokes"" began to grate almost immediately. i was also very irritated by the fact that <spoiler> gandalf's return <end of spoiler> was shown in the trailers - that completely ruined the tension and wonder of the moment. my rating? 8.5 - maybe 9 if it does what the fellowship did and improve on second watching.";9 January 2003;10;['concerned', 'open', 'excellent', 'enough', 'least', 'tidy', 'few', 'different', 'different', 'black', 'confusing', 'subtantial', 'many', 'contemporaneous', 'grim', 'suitable', 'cinematic', 'superb', 'technical', 'unmatched', 'other', 'much', 'able', 'sneaky', 'only', 'major', 'comic', 'gimli', 'prominent', 'irritated', 'second'];0.1248188405797101

1084;Dallan007;the sense i got from watching this film was that i was seeing the middle part of a movie. the action speeds up with a minimum of exposition, and i think in the end we will have to see all three pictures in order to understand peter jackson's vision. the most satisfying aspects of this film are the performances of the newer cast members. miranda otto as eowyn is a very human, down to earth rival to the ethereal elven maid arwen (liv tyler). bernard hill is near-perfect as theoden, the aged king of a threatened realm. karl urban is surprisingly good as eomer, the valiant nephew of the king. but the most startling performance comes from andy serkis, the human 'template' for the character of smeagol/gollum. playing his role in a motion-capture suit, serkis brings a human aspect that has been lacking in cgi characters since their inception. mr. lucas should take notes: you need a *human* to make a character human. by far the best moment comes from cast veteran sean astin as samwise. hi s speech at the climax of the movie may come across as cornball to some, but it is the best expression of what is worth fighting and dying for. taken into the context of current world events, the speech becomes a timely message, reminding us that there are reasons to fight the good fight that have nothing to do with religion, revenge or even patriotism. it's an interesting point that sam's speech inspires someone to commit an act of treason in support of frodo's cause. this is the second part of a three-part masterpiece. peter jackson should get a special achievement oscar for all three films. i never thought that i'd see a performance worthy of best supporting actor from a cgi character. gollum definitely deserves it. yoda should still get the mtv award for best fight scene, though.;19 December 2002;10;['middle', 'satisfying', 'new', 'human', 'ethereal', 'perfect', 'theoden', 'aged', 'threatened', 'good', 'valiant', 'startling', 'human', 'human', 'good', 'good', 'worth', 'current', 'timely', 'good', 'interesting', 'second', 'special', 'worthy', 'good', 'good'];0.3203257060399918

1089;bethgoodsell;truly, it was one of the best movies in a long while. i enjoyed it immensely. the battle scenes were quite lengthy and full of many interesting stunts. but the movie was not faithful to the book. i don't want to spoil anything so i'll stick with little things:like the incident at entmoot (gathering of ents) where they decided *not* to go to war - and then did so only once treebeard had seen the destruction of his people. i don't mind inconsistencies but couldn't they be at least necessary fabrications? anyway, in my mind the dialogue was a bit...melodramatic - for instance: legolas, gimli and aragorn are running in pursuit of merry and pippin and then every so often they stop and blurt out a line (or legolas eyes the horizon in his 'elfish' way) and then resume their breakneck pace. so what i'm really saying is: see the movie! by itself i give it 9/10 or so but what you need to know is that when compared with the books it probably won't hold up (especially if you demand perfection) alone: 9/10 with book:4/10;19 December 2002;10;['good', 'long', 'lengthy', 'full', 'many', 'interesting', 'faithful', 'little', 'least', 'necessary', 'melodramatic', 'gimli', 'aragorn', 'elfish'];0.1890625

1093;noodleboy500;absolutely outstanding! when people ask me about this movie, one thing that crops up in 9 out of 10 conversations is the question 'is the movie true to the book?' to me this is an unfair question. if you had asked peter jackson to make a movie that was beyond all doubt 'true' to the book, you would have a sequence of 9 hour movies instead of 3 hour movies. also, the movies would be disjointed, dull and unwatchable. why, you ask? because movies require a unique combination of flow and pace that books are not constrained to, and transferring a story to film without adapting it for the job would be a big mistake. book and film are not compatible media. what i often say is that the movie is true to the spirit of the book. i get the same feeling watching the film that i got when i'd sit up late at night, reading under lamp-light because i could not tear myself away from the story. the characters on screen look to me as though secret agents from weta workshops mind reading department have tiptoed in to my bedroom at night and plucked the images from my mind and i'm not the only person who says that all the hardcore tolkien fans i have shared this thought with have agreed with great enthusiasm. after watching this film, i feel justified in my past comments that pj is a genius. i have been a fan since he produced the cult classic bad taste in 1987, an alien/zombie movie that relied on vision and talent as opposed to a big budget or any real kind of budget at all, to be honest. the movie was improvised from start to finish (that's right, made up as they went along), and only received any kind of funding (beyond that which came from pj's own pocket) just before its completion. jackson is a creative genius, and deserves every word of praise he gets. no other person could translate the greatest fiction ever written in to the greatest film ever made the way he has. i give the lord of the rings a score of 15 out of 10.

1102;alexxchiodo;"'the lord of the rings: the two towers' is everything i could have hoped for in the second movie in 'the lord of the rings' trilogy. in this film the fellowship has broken and the film now follows three different adventures taking place - you have aragon, legolas and gimli fighting to protect rohan, pippin and merry occupied with the ents, and of course, frodo and sam lead by gollum to fulfill their quest to destroy the ring. i really liked how these concurrent endeavors were told without feeling, as the viewer, disengaged from the main idea of the story. for example, it didn't feel like there was intolerable jumping between different scenes to follow these different adventures, so i thought the movie proceeded at a good pace. hats must be taken off to a perfect embodiment of gollum's character and it is probably one of the most memorable performances i have ever seen in a movie. this twisted, tortured and disturbed creature is the epitome of the consequences of holding the ring for prolonged periods (500 years in gollum's case). the ring is so evil and corrupted that gollum represents the end result of it's control, which should signal to frodo to make haste of his quest or else he'll end up just like gollum. the amount of action and fighting in this movie has increased compared to 'the fellowship of the ring', and i loved it. it was so satisfying to watch legolas and gimli kill orcs so proficiently to the point where they keep a running tally of how many they kill. this form of humor embedded in several fighting scenes was much accepted and it wasn't too excessive to the point where it felt like the humor was forced. just like the first movie there are some epic panning shots as aragon, legolas and gimli cross some stunning terrain, and i feel that just the mere scale of this movie is so much bigger in magnitude to that in 'the fellowship of the ring'. in the previous film, there was a lot more dialog and felt like more of an introduction to the characters and the 'culture' of the 'lord of the rings' film, which isn't condemned, but 'the two towers' steps up the fighting scenes to another level without losing the dialog and character development. the sheer size of saruman's army sent a shiver down mine when i first laid eyes on it. you think to yourself, ""hold on, how are 300 'good guys' supposed to defend themselves against 10,000 of these brutal and viscous orcs?"" thoughts like this that leave you wondering what's going to happen next or how are the 'good guys' going to deal with this crisis is one of many reasons that kept me engaged in the film from start to end. furthermore, i loved gandalf's return as 'the white', and the scene at the beginning where he battles the balrog was an epic way to begin the movie. in addition, when the ents destroy saruman's headquarters was just insane to watch. i loved that feeling of gratification, yet also some sorrow, when you see the tree beard begin to lose it after what saruman has done and the ents just unleash chaos on saruman. it was satisfying to see the 'good guys' (i dislike referring to them as this) finally overpower saruman as he has been the one with supreme power and authority throughout the film (excluding sauron). you can't also help but feel when the ents take revenge on saruman for destroying their 'friends', that one day, in today's modern, developed society, nature will reclaim what is rightfully theirs one day. the idea of conveying the trees as having emotions and allowing them to feel anger and sorrow just like humans do, makes you condemn things like deforestation around the world and the negative impact human consumption is having on the earth. in essence, this is one of the best movies i have ever seen and cannot wait to watch the final film in the trilogy.";1 November 2013;10;['second', 'different', 'gimli', 'concurrent', 'main', 'intolerable', 'different', 'different', 'good', 'perfect', 'memorable', 'twisted', 'tortured', 'prolonged', 'evil', 'satisfying', 'gimli', 'many', 'several', 'excessive', 'first', 'epic', 'gimli', 'stunning', 'mere', 'big', 'previous', 'more', 'more', 'sheer', 'good', 'brutal', 'viscous', 'good', 'many', 'epic', 'insane', 'good', 'modern', 'negative', 'human', 'good', 'final'];0.1207142857142857

1108;suro;"as the second part of the trilogy, the two towers is like the middle child. the first movie had been greatly anticipated, and the last movie would be the mother-of-all cataclysmic battles (and of course the grand finale). the middle movie serves to bridge the introductions to the finale. a bridge indeed; it's the khazad-dum of bridges, and it will make 3 hours seem like 3 minutes. faithfulists beware, however, as there are much more 'artistic freedom' present in this installment, although all serve tolkien's major theme: pluralism. the defeat of saruman is not, and cannot be attributed to a singular being or group, and the movie is faithful to that point. however, i did take an exception, despite frodo's encounter with the nazgul (never happened), despite faramir's apparent desire for the ring (book serves as a contrast to the personalities of the brothers), at the lorien elves' joining of the battle of helm's deep. while their involvement definitely adds to the movie, the book is very clear that the time of elves had passed, and the book is really a historical perspective of the passing of the elves and the rise of men. for that, i had to take a point off--but my recommendation to see the movie does not change one bit. the movie must have been incredibly difficult to adapt, as the members of the fellowship have separated and independently pursue their goals. peter jackson does a great job keeping the audience involved by interweaving the different plots which all happen pretty much at the same time. had he followed the book, frodo and sam would have made their appearance in the second half, after the breathtaking battle of helm's deep. the interweaving is similar to the return of the king, and with further separation of the fellowship, the movie due next year should follow the same format. if there is one thing that stood out, it's the creature gollum. the sympathy jackson creates for the creature is almost enough to forgive his major theme deviation (see above), and i think personally he did better than tolkien did. his inner monologue--with his 'evil' gollum side vs. his 'nice' smeagol side--while the hobbits sleep is indeed memorable and frightening (can you say bipolar?). if there can be an award for a digital character, then gollum has my vote for best actor. those unfamiliar with the novel may find some parts confusing and perhaps unnecessary, as there are still many characters introduced. do yourselves a favor and read the book; even at over 1,000 pages (including the appendices), time will fly. and most important, you'll appreciate the movies even more.";20 December 2002;9;['second', 'middle', 'first', 'last', 'cataclysmic', 'grand', 'middle', 'more', 'artistic', 'major', 'singular', 'faithful', 'apparent', 'lorien', 'deep', 'clear', 'historical', 'difficult', 'great', 'different', 'same', 'second', 'breathtaking', 'deep', 'similar', 'further', 'due', 'next', 'same', 'creature', 'enough', 'major', 'inner', 'evil', 'nice', 'memorable', 'frightening', 'bipolar', 'digital', 'good', 'unfamiliar', 'confusing', 'unnecessary', 'many', 'important'];0.0929824561403508

1121;theanimatoradam;my theory with the lord of the rings films has always been that the stuff that is good gets better with each film, but the stuff that doesn't work as well unfortunately gets worse. whilst this means the very best moments of the franchise might still be yet to happen for film 2, there's no doubt a balancing act that is playing out as the stakes of the battles gets bigger and the adventures of the heroes get grander, whilst the sadder, darker moments start to creep into the edges of this film. overall, for upping the grandeur of the already fantastic part one without delving into what makes much of part three an exercise in patience, this film rounds off as the best one in the series for me personally - just don't fret about the extended directors cut too much, most of that stuff whilst good in its own right, was better left on the special features disc.;31 March 2019;10;['good', 'well', 'bad', 'good', 'big', 'dark', 'fantastic', 'much', 'good', 'much', 'most', 'good', 'own', 'special'];0.3461038961038961

1124;reinout_vanschie;"looking at reviews worldwide, they tend to focus on all the great elements of this movie as if existing on their own. they talk about how brilliant gollum is portrayed both technically aswell as acting-wise (which is true), or they talk about how the battle at helm's deep is the biggest battle-scene ever produced on celluloid (wich is also true). but my main praise for this movie is that it works as a complete picture, and it's sum is even greater than it's parts. with the two towers you've got a story which is, well, a nightmare to translate to screen. no beginning, no real end, two different storylines, told in such a way that they don't seem to connect (which in the book is no problem, but it just doesn't work in a motion picture like this). but when i look at peter jackson's film, i cannot see any weakness in it's story. even though it hasn't got a real beginning and ending, it does open with a bang, and ends with a big bang, and the picture comes to a more satisfying conclusion than fotr. next to this all the technical elements are once again flawless. shore's score works, in my opinion, just that bit better than his fotr score, the fx are not even in the same league as fotr's, their waaaay above them. acting is great once again, with special praise to the actors portraying aragorn, theoden and gollum. so is this movie perfect? well close, in the same way fotr was. but that's a personal opinion. i do understand that people don't like the change to faramir's character, even though i liked them, and i do understand people don't always appreciate gimli's humor, even though i thought it worked extremely well. also i have to say that the ending is in some parts a tad unconvincing and unsatisfying. the way faramir changes his view seems abrupt, and you really don't see much of the characters reactions after helm's deep, but that is probably saved for rotk, wich will surely be even better..... all in all, i have to say, i do like this one better than fotr, because it's tighter told, has a more satisfying conclusion, is much more breathtaking, if it was ever possible, and it just flows better. but the best compliment might be; it is a perfect followup to fotr, expanding on it, while remaining faithfull to the feeling of part 1.";8 January 2003;10;['great', 'own', 'brilliant', 'aswell', 'wise', 'true', 'big', 'true', 'main', 'complete', 'great', 'real', 'different', 'real', 'big', 'satisfying', 'technical', 'flawless', 'same', 'great', 'special', 'perfect', 'close', 'same', 'personal', 'unconvincing', 'abrupt', 'much', 'deep', 'rotk', 'well', 'well', 'tight', 'satisfying', 'breathtaking', 'possible', 'good', 'perfect'];0.3903530377668308

1130;SeyedYasinHosseini;"starting with a general idea about the lord of the rings, i should mention, predictably that the film cannot reach the book's level. the book has much more details and it can be even more attractive. however we all know it is impossible to bring too much information of the book just in a trilogy; therefore peter jackson, the director, did his best. perhaps this issue would solve if a tv-show had been created instead of a trilogy. anyway, many people believe that just two or three great and epic scenes make the movie memorable and this is the factor that the two towers does. in my opinion the 2nd part of this trilogy is the best one. certainly this film is great in terms of technical things like filming, music, special effects, acting and so on. apart from these, what really i noticed and enjoyed were the dialogues; very beautiful and impressive and also full of metaphors. at the beginning of the movie, saruman has a sinister speech about ruling the world by a new order. ""the old world will be burned in the fires of industry,"" says saruman. i was shocked as soon as i heard these words. by the way, this speech is a good one to just have some fun moments and let our mind have some conspiracy theory. in this episode, existence of poor gollum, who is seriously involved with his two characters, adds to the attractiveness of the film. gollum was cursed by spirit of lasciviousness. furthermore, he was defeated by his own carnality. on the other side, frodo tries not to be cursed by the ring because he does not want the gollum's fate for himself. so he has an odyssey in order to destroy the ring. sam, a friend of frodo who is accompanying frodo in that odyssey, has a strong will and personality. despite hydra-headed problems in their path, sam always helps his friend. another thing which i noticed is about ents and walking trees. they were victims. the gloomy point is that the situation in the real world is not better than the film at all; even in some particular cases, it could be worse. for instance, considering that problem about cutting down trees in the film, believe it or not, i would say in the reality is much more worse than the film. statistically we cut down over 15 billion trees each year in reality, trees moan louder and they are much angrier. trust me. anyway, there is an epic war in this film, called battle of helm's deep, which is designed beautifully and professionally. among all these we have merry and pippin who create some fun moments. actually they do not let the film be saturnine. there are plenty of things in this trilogy and i absolutely recommend that to everyone.";16 December 2020;10;['general', 'more', 'attractive', 'impossible', 'much', 'good', 'many', 'great', 'epic', 'memorable', 'good', 'great', 'technical', 'special', 'beautiful', 'impressive', 'full', 'sinister', 'new', 'old', 'good', 'fun', 'poor', 'involved', 'own', 'other', 'strong', 'gloomy', 'real', 'well', 'particular', 'bad', 'bad', 'angry', 'epic', 'deep', 'saturnine'];0.2234949945887445

1143;sarah_se1;"i was lucky enough to win a pair of tickets to see a premiere showing of ""the lord of the rings: the two towers"". needless to say i was pretty excited because for as long as i can remember i've been a great admirer of tolkien and huge fan of the first lord of the rings film. i wasn't disappointed with 'the two towers'. peter jackson draws you into the film with the opening score, and leaves you breathless until the very end. the story line picks up where jackson left off - a continuation of the first rather than another movie altogether. (i'm going to reveal the starting plot so please don't read ahead if you don't want to know.) merry and pippin have managed to escape from the orks that have held them capture, only to run into even more interesting creatures in the woods: ents, trees that can move and speak. aragorn, legolas and gimli are trying to rescue merry and pippin when they run into someone they didn't expect, gandalf - back and now a white wizard, the highest a wizard can go. after being assured of the two young hobbits' safety, they travel to the kingdom of rohan where saruman holds the king in an evil spell. after freeing the king they must prepare for saruman's army, which sole purpose is to destroy the world of men. the battle of helm's deep (which can be quite disturbing at points, not for the very young or those who can't handle that kind of thing) decides the winner. (peter jackson spent over a month filming this scene and all that time was not wasted - it was a fantastic scene, well thought out and captivating.) frodo and sam are trying to reach mordor but find themselves lost. after an encounter with the creature gollum, who at one point possessed the ring and maddingly wants it back, frodo (who is beginning to feel the true weight of the ring) decides to let gollum guide them. gollum wasn't much different from a hobbit before he possessed the ring, and was called smeagol. in the movie 'the two towers' you are able to see the struggle that takes place within gollum. smeagol represents the good left inside of him, and gollum the bad. these scenes were some of my favourites - they were wonderfully shot and really took the film to another level. and of course we can't forget the lovely elvish and thus immortal arwen, who is faced with the choice of staying with her beloved aragorn or leaving forever with her people; there's the nephew of king theoden, the strong and noble eomer who will do anything for rohan, and his equally strong and lovely sister eowyn who develops feelings for aragorn; and lastly faramir, the brother of the late boromir, now captain to gondor. this movie didn't feel like a movie. i honestly felt as though i had been pulled into the screen in the theatre. it was fantasticly shot, preformed, and directed. 'the two towers' is the classic tale of good against evil. it is perfectly carried through. there was not a moment i didn't savour - i didn't want this film to end and will be seeing it again in theatres the next chance i get. if anything, i think i enjoyed this film more than the first. and although i understand this movie isn't for everyone, i still highly recommend it to all. i give it a 9 out of 10.";17 December 2002;10;['lucky', 'premiere', 'needless', 'excited', 'great', 'huge', 'first', 'very', 'first', 'interesting', 'gimli', 'gandalf', 'white', 'high', 'young', 'evil', 'sole', 'deep', 'disturbing', 'young', 'fantastic', 'creature', 'true', 'different', 'able', 'good', 'bad', 'lovely', 'immortal', 'beloved', 'aragorn', 'strong', 'noble', 'strong', 'lovely', 'late', 'classic', 'next', 'more', 'first'];0.1932323232323232
1144;rogersgh1234;"i loved the fellowship movie and was eagerly anticipating the two towers, i own the dvd collector's edition. differences between the fellowship book and film i felt were minor and were understandable given time constraints, and allowing for creative expression of the director. i would not have been bothered by even more deviation from the book in the second movie, but it was excessive in my opinion. some of the deviations were so extensive that characters made fundamentally different decisions in the movie than were made in the book. (brand new scenes that were not in the book did not enhance the movie, so why bother? some new scenes detracted heavily from the storyline because of the fundamental change required of the character(s).) i don't know why peter jackson felt he needed to make these changes unless he felt his vision made a better movie than literally following the book. however, i feel the changes he made detracted from rather than added to the movie. my son, aged 18, leaned over at one point and said ""did they go there in the book?"", and my answer was ""no, and it is wrecking the movie!"". after the movie the 5 of us discussed the movie and we all felt it was not nearly as good a movie as the fellowship even though we all expected it to be even better given the major action sequences we expected. i am pretty tolerant of a movie being different from a book, but this was the closest i ever came to walking out of a movie. i have never been this disappointed in a movie, but that is probably partly due to my high level of anticipation. i sincerely hope the 3rd film is either closer to the book, or at least remains true to the personalities of the characters.

1147;Altima;"note, there may be spoilers in these comments. i just returned from ireland's first showing of the film. i was at the first showing on the fellowship of the ring last year and was blown away, and i still hold that it was more deserving than ""a beautiful mind"" for last year's ""best picture"" oscar. it got many things right, the characterizations were perfect, the locals were amazing, set design was top notch, special effects, cinematography, landscapes and script were superb. they couldn't have improved it. unfortunately it seems that this film was tainted by hollywood execs who wanted more bucks from this film and padded it full of stuff to bring in a more varied audience. it doesn't work. firstly, the film does not have the same focus as the last. the characters are separated, doing different things. in the book, it mostly deals with each group's quest one at a time according to the timeline. in this film, it switches between them constantly, trying to squash all of these events that happened over a certain timeline into a much smaller timeframe. it seems disjointed. secondly, there are major story rewrites. this was forgivable in the first film (face it, tom bombadil deserved to be cut, and the sweet scene between aragorn and arwen was nice) but in the two towers, a full 45 minutes of the film is just invented, padding out the time that should have been spent on the relevant story. most of these scenes are painfully cliched and remind one of fabio romance novels, especially the cover illustrations. also, frodo heads to a particular place far too early, a book too early in fact. i'm not looking forward to the rewrites they'll do for return of the king. the atmosphere and mood of the film is surprisingly different from the fellowship. last year's film was dark, brooding and full of impending doom. well, if the doom has come in the two towers, it wasn't much to worry about. it's full of one-liners. the comedic angle is exploited far too much, at the expense of gimli's character especially. the first film did an excellent job of portraying the relatively minor characters of gimli and legolas. they hate each other at first because of racial differences, but soon grow fond of each other. gimli's range of emotion is surprisingly versatile, especially seen in the mines of moria. despite the large focus on gimli's and legolas's relationship with each other in the book, none of it is present in the film. none. set design was another disappointment. yes, rohan was a feat that none of it was cgi, but it still looked awful and downright small. the scale in this film, with the notable exception of the battle at helm's deep was far too small. entire cities we are supposed to care about are not much bigger than the little towns that get ravaged early on. in the oft-discussed battle of helm's deep, there's a lot to like. unfortunately, there are at least a dozen times when the focus cuts from the action to a titanic-esque look at the women and children cowering in the caves. just one shot of that would be forgivable, but it shows them so much it just becomes annoying. also, the film ends before the book does! it handles the three major quests at dif ferent paces; so frodo's quest takes him into return of the king territory while the rest of the story leaves off only halfway through! but there are plenty of good things about the film. the highlight is gollum. this cgi ch a racter gives the best performance out of anyone in the film! (even the likes of gandalf are sub-par in this film, when he returns he is so unlike the character we knew before that one almost wishes the balrog ate him) gollum is a triumph of computer animation and his voiceover is excellent as well. there were also a couple moments of visual brilliance, like at barad-dur. but over all i give this film a 6/10, whereas fellowship earned a 9/10. it is not a worthy sequel to fellowship and considering it was all filmed at the same time i am at a loss as to how it could have turned out like this.";18 December 2002;7;['first', 'first', 'last', 'deserving', 'beautiful', 'last', 'good', 'many', 'right', 'perfect', 'amazing', 'set', 'top', 'notch', 'special', 'superb', 'hollywood', 'more', 'full', 'varied', 'same', 'last', 'different', 'certain', 'small', 'major', 'forgivable', 'first', 'sweet', 'nice', 'full', 'relevant', 'most', 'fabio', 'particular', 'different', 'last', 'dark', 'full', 'much', 'full', 'comedic', 'much', 'first', 'excellent', 'minor', 'gimli', 'other', 'racial', 'fond', 'other', 'versatile', 'large', 'other', 'present', 'awful', 'small', 'notable', 'small', 'entire', 'big', 'little', 'deep', 'least', 'titanic', 'forgivable', 'annoying', 'major', 'good', 'good', 'sub', 'excellent', 'visual', 'worthy', 'same'];0.2115920096852299

1149;zbrak;"a lot of teeth are gnashing about the changes jackson has made to the plot in two towers. i feel bad for people who are upset and can understand their frustration. i myself went out of my way to find reviews with spoilers so that, instead of spending my time in the theatre obsessing about plot deviations, i could just sit back and enjoy the movie (which i truly did). i think many of these plot changes were necessary, although i might have done them some other way if i was calling the shots. so let's launch in to a few of them . . . **spoiler warning** faramir: he's one of the more fascinating characters in the book, and he's simply given a broad stroke in the film, and not a particularly attractive one. but looking back at the book, faramir's character occupies 50 pages, much of which is dialogue between faramir and frodo. no wonder he's a complex character in the book! he does lots of soul-baring. given all that, it's understandable that some change had to be made in the film, otherwise we'd have ""my dinner with faramir"". in the book, faramir's plan originally was to take frodo and sam back to gondor (not because of the ring, however). after all the dialogue (and after faramir finds out about the ring), he changes his mind. there are also mentions of the book about the battles at osgiliath. so lots of the elements that are 'changed' in the movie have foundation in the books, and jackson (who feels his job is to make an exciting movie) did what he felt he had to do. i would've done it differently, but that's me. but there's obviously no room in the movie for the exposition that the books have. the nazgul confronting frodo as osgiliath bothered me as much as anything - part of the strategy of gandalf for the war is to sneak the ring in to mordor to destroy it, figuring sauron will believe that gondor is going to try to use the ring to challenge him. no need to announce to sauron that the ring is somehow at mordor's doorstep. i think the rousing of the ents (pippin's 'trick') also could've been handled better. in the books, tolken makes it clear that the ents are slow to anger and reluctant to get involved, but they knew what saruman was up to and said 'enough is enough.' not sure why jackson did it the way he did - didn't really add anything that needed to be added. the warg battle - this is in the book, sort of. as the contingent from rohan is riding to helm's deep, they skirmish with orcs on wargs and drive them off. this is probably a couple of sentences in the book and is expanded in the movie (a la the cave troll in the first movie). no harm done here, imho. aragorn's plunge off the cliff, however, could've been left out. it didn't add anything to the film, except another excuse to dip into the arwen subplot. speaking of which, much of the tension between arwen, aragorn and elrond is spelled out in one of the appendices in the book. jackson took some liberties there as well, but the idea pretty much holds true. (you could've left the whole arwen thing out of all the movies completely and it wouldn't have bothered me, but i understand how androcentric the film would've looked then.) the imagery of arwen grieving over king ellasar's body was nicely done, showing her dilemma. so again, jackson is taking the story and shaping it to the film - he is not creating this stuff out of whole cloth. after looking back through the book, i was actually pretty impressed about how much the battle of helm's deep matched tolkein's descriptions of it. and the landscapes --- i cannot believe how much the scenery matched my mind's eye from reading the books (like the scrub trees in the final scene in ithilien - a tiny detail, but absolutely perfect as it was captured on film.) astounding. and enough has already been said about gollum, who is a revelation. as i said before, i sought out spoiler reviews so i wouldn't be distracted from plot deviations. if i want to read the books, i'll read them. but i certainly enjoyed the film for what it was - a majestic and exciting adventure flick, well worth seeing again.";19 December 2002;10;['bad', 'upset', 'many', 'necessary', 'other', 'few', 'fascinating', 'broad', 'attractive', 'much', 'complex', 'understandable', 'exciting', 'clear', 'slow', 'reluctant', 'enough', 'enough', 'sure', 'deep', 'first', 'imho', 'much', 'aragorn', 'true', 'whole', 'androcentric', 'whole', 'impressed', 'much', 'deep', 'matched', 'much', 'final', 'tiny', 'perfect', 'astounding', 'enough', 'majestic', 'exciting', 'worth'];0.19125

(3) by eliminating the character of erkenbrand, and making eomer disappear from the film just after meeting aragorn, legolas and gimli, so that gandalf brings him and his men (instead of erkenbrand, as in the book) back to helm's deep, the film is missing eomer as a character --and misses the development of the bond of loyalty and devotion that, in the book, form between eomer and aragorn (not to mention the friendly rivalry between eomer and gimli). (4) eowyn is far too sunny and ""girlish"". all that ""poison"" that wormtongue spits at her in the film is what her character should actually be thinking. she's not supposed to smile like she does until much, much later. (5) while i understand the cinematic and, in some ways, story-enhancing value of having faramir (who does not do this in the book) drag frodo and sam to osgiliath, intending to bring the ring as a weapon to gondor, i wish peter jackson had been able to accomplish his ends in some way that did not cast faramir in such a bad light. in the book, faramir ""shows his quality"" by rejecting the ring straightaway, in the cave by the waterfall. why must he be so much weaker in the film? and finally, (6) huorns!! where are the huorns? don't tell me, peter jackson, that you can make cgi mallorns and armies and volcanoes and giant statues and underground caverns and flying lizards and gollum and ents and whatall else, and you can't give me one walking orc-swallowing demon forest?? but seriously, a summer release for return of the king. think about it.";21 December 2002;10;['long', 'long', 'usual', 'modern', 'single', 'certain', 'more', 'aragorn', 'particular', 'little', 'long', 'first', 'nice', 'great', 'true', 'little', 'few', 'minor', 'unnecessary', 'many', 'more', 'great', 'dead', 'spectacular', 'emotional', 'broad', 'swift', 'gimli', 'deep', 'aragorn', 'friendly', 'gimli', 'sunny', 'girlish', 'much', 'cinematic', 'able', 'bad', 'weak', 'giant', 'underground', 'whatall'];0.113969494047619
1187;Carnimirie;"i commented on this film a long time ago; and while i did have a few issues with some discrepancies between the book and the film (especially faramir), one thing i never expected to be a problem for anyone was peter jackson's ending this stage of his overall 3-part film when he did. folks, the relationship of the fellowship of the ring to the two towers to the return of the king is not the same as the relationship between, say, the raiders of the lost ark to the temple of doom to indiana jones and the last crusade. tolkien himself only split up his saga of the lord of the rings into 3 books because his publisher told him it would never sell as one huge one. peter jackson simply split his large work a different 3 ways than tolkien did, and i don't blame him. this movie is about 3 hours as it is (and i can only imagine the length of the director's cut, which by the way i hope they won't wait till november to issue this time). and while they could have cut some of the extraneous aragorn/arwen bits, the time they would have saved would never be enough time to do justice to what happens in the final 5 chapters of the book. also, remember: the return of the king is shorter by over a hundred pages, in terms of the story, than either of the first two. peter jackson is actually distributing the story more evenly than tolkien did. the only ""unfair"" thing about what he's done, is that now the ""return"" film will have all the best, scariest, and most awful bits to itself. oh well. i can't wait for december.

1192;mmayer20;"as i hoped, since all three movies were shot at the same time, the quality of ""the two towers"" is right up there with last year's ""the fellowship of the ring"". at first, i was a little apprehensive with the artistic license peter jackson was taking in this movie. but, after thinking about it awhile, the changes made do make sense for the movie version, anyway. in the book, it is the huorns (the nasty trees that the ents keep under control) that actually take out a lot of saruman's orcs at helm's deep as well as saruman's forces at orthanc (isengard). and of course, introducing yet another character that also gets almost no book exposure - erkenbrand of rohan - who comes in with the cavalry, would have been very confusing. so, having haldir lead a troup of elves from lorien to help at helm's deep, and having gandalf bring in the cavalry, does help to lessen confusion. i was dismayed at haldir's death, but upon reflection, it would have been totally unbelievable if every character survived such a savage and genocidal onslaught. regarding faramir taking frodo to osgiliath before letting him go. this is just an expansion of the theme in faramir's hidden fortress. in the book, faramir was tempted to take the ring, although he did let frodo go with full knowledge of what he carried. in the movie, faramir also does this, albeit only after a change of mind and a little convincing (the winged nazgul). the dangerous part of movie's change - having frodo the ringbearer id'd by the nazgul in osgiliath - is that sauron would now suspect that maybe his foes weren't taking the ring to gondor and minas tirith after all. he might now suspect there was a plan afoot to have the ring stealthily destroyed in mt. doom. that might cause him to focus less attention on gondor, and more on his own realm's borders, to catch any attempt to get in. that would have resulted in the failure of frodo's mission. all in all, the movie delivers convincingly. aragorn is coming into his own. gollum is pitiable and sympathetic, as well as menacing. he steals the movie. bernard hill does an excellent job as theoden, as does miranda otto as eowyn. uniquely beautiful, she is. frodo and sam are perfect, and sam is really becoming a favorite (as he does in the book). legolas and gimli were good, too. gimli was particularly funny in this one, and let's face it, the movie needed some relief of tension. i was very impressed with treebeard and the ents. i was hoping they wouldn't come across as silly, and for me, they didn't. almost sad, they were. i give it a 9/10. a subsequent viewing might make me change that to a 10/10. don't miss this movie! but see ""fellowship"" first!";20 December 2002;10;['same', 'last', 'little', 'apprehensive', 'artistic', 'nasty', 'deep', 'confusing', 'deep', 'gandalf', 'unbelievable', 'genocidal', 'full', 'little', 'convincing', 'winged', 'dangerous', 'afoot', 'less', 'own', 'aragorn', 'own', 'pitiable', 'sympathetic', 'menacing', 'excellent', 'theoden', 'beautiful', 'perfect', 'favorite', 'gimli', 'good', 'funny', 'impressed', 'silly', 'sad', 'subsequent'];0.1247023809523809

1203;voodoo4936;"thank heavens for peter jackson. the out-of-the-blue aussie auteur, previously best known for the 1996 michael j. fox bomb the frighteners, has managed to deliver where so many others have failed, or feared to even attempt. he has successfully translated j.r.r. tolkien's massive lord of the rings trilogy to the big screen with maximum verve and minimal crap. last year's fellowship of the ring scored a bulls-eye with moviegoers and critics alike, and there was an audible sigh of relief among hardcore lotr fanatics when the long-awaited film was finally released to smashing success. so, where does mr. jackson go from there? he took a gamble in filming all three of the lotr movies one after the other - what if fellowship tanked? the whole franchise would have been up the creek. thankfully, that fear was soon vanquished, but now jackson has yet another roadblock to overcome: expectation. hype. buzz. fellowship set the standard for jackson and his crew - now all they can do is surpass it. that's a lot of pressure. i mean, a lot of pressure. thus, the two towers is arguably the most important film in the trilogy, simply because it has to live up to the expectations of millions of lotr fans, and the general movie going public, and the critics, and the studios that pay for the whole shebang. i'm amazed that jackson hasn't had a stroke by now, or at least one mother of an ulcer. so when all is said and done, does the two towers deliver? yes. is it as good as fellowship? no. does it still kick ass? for the most part, yes. it's just not very graceful doing it. simply put, the two towers is an exhausting movie. by the end, i felt like i'd been through a war zone. the film is just so long, and there is so much going on, from epic battles to flowery speeches to zombified swamps to talking trees....the first word that came to mind when i left the theater was ""overstuffed"". i feel like i'm beating on a dead horse, though - these movies are complete adaptations of the novels, and as such, there's going to be a whole lot of stuff packed into 3 hours. but even so, those 3 hours don't have to feel like 6. i can see where jackson and company could have trimmed a bit here, shuffled a bit there, moved around a few parts here, just to make the narrative flow more freely. ttt's plot is heaps more complex than fellowship's, and the best way to deal with that is to tell the story in the simplest, most direct way possible. but jackson jumps back and forth between plot lines like quentin tarantino on speed, and it just doesn't work. this may be jackson's way of keeping us from getting bored, but it's ultimately distracting and unnecessary. yes, there are a lot of plot threads to juggle - from frodo and sam's descent into hell, to aragorn's crew trying to rescue merry and pippin, to merry and pippin themselves just trying to stay alive, and more subplots than you can shake a wizard's staff at - but they should be juggled, not thrown into the air and allowed to crash back to earth. the plot itself is average at best, and when coupled with the smothering story structure, makes for a rather underwhelming experience. fortunately, there is still plenty of good here, and a whole lot of great. the performances are once again top-notch, save for some flat dialogue and a few stilted scenes. the characters still feel the need to turn every sentence into a poetic work of art, arwen still needs a shot of caffeine, and frodo and sam still need to get a room already, but otherwise the acting is very good. the gorgeous scenery and cinematography are back in full force, and it's likely the best eye candy you'll taste all year. the world of middle-earth just comes alive on screen - it's like you're right there. i don't know about you, but i'm booking myself a vacation to new zealand asap. but where ttt really shines is, yes, the butt kicking. the battle scenes are simply breathtaking (and cringe-inducing at some points - dammit, that sword just came right at my face!), and the final showdown at helm's deep is just unbelievable. there's so much buildup, and such palpable tension, that when the battle finally occurs it feels like you're going to war right alongside aragorn and the elves. there are so many fighters on screen, so much attention to detail, so much pure excitement that i simply couldn't take my eyes off the spectacle, not even for a second (or a much-needed bathroom break). oh, and gandalf is alive. but you probably already knew that. there are certain things that work in the two towers, and there are things that don't. unfortunately, the good doesn't outweigh the bad, so ttt manages to find a fairly neutral middle ground. will the two towers disappoint lotr fans? probably not. will it disappoint everyone else? it's hard to say. but one thing is for sure: ttt is an experience you won't forget. just try to ignore the rampant hobbit homoeroticism, and you'll have a blast. my grade: 7/10";8 March 2003;7;['blue', 'many', 'massive', 'big', 'maximum', 'minimal', 'last', 'audible', 'hardcore', 'other', 'whole', 'important', 'lotr', 'general', 'public', 'whole', 'amazed', 'least', 'good', 'most', 'graceful', 'exhausting', 'long', 'much', 'epic', 'first', 'dead', 'complete', 'such', 'whole', 'few', 'complex', 'good', 'simple', 'direct', 'possible', 'tarantino', 'bored', 'unnecessary', 'alive', 'more', 'average', 'good', 'underwhelming', 'whole', 'great', 'top', 'flat', 'few', 'poetic', 'good', 'gorgeous', 'full', 'likely', 'good', 'middle', 'alive', 'final', 'unbelievable', 'much', 'such', 'palpable', 'aragorn', 'many', 'much', 'pure', 'second', 'alive', 'certain', 'bad', 'neutral', 'middle', 'hard', 'sure', 'rampant'];0.1157689305230288

1205;rockford_hinten;"i was very impressed with this movie. it was even better than _fellowship_. fellowship was a bit slow sometimes because they had to introduce characters and start building the story. this one took right off from there in full-tilt action and plot progression. i was very impressed with their portrayal of smeagol/gollum and frodo's relationship with him. they did a nice job emphasizing it as multiple personality disorder, like green goblin in spiderman. i found it very meaningful that frodo realizes first-hand what a torture the ring is, and what it has done to smeagol. his pity manifests itself in attempting to help him and save him by reminding him of who he once was. (""it is the name of your true self--you've only forgotten.""-rotj ;) ) that attempted redemption in return of the jedi is strikingly similar to this one, except that this meets with less success. i only have a small problem with this movie, and that was some of its deviations from the story in the original book it is based on. no spoilers here, but it threw in several things that just weren't in the book. i won't fault that in the movie rating, though, because this is a movie producer's portrayal of it, and the things they changed actually made for a better movie than the book plot would have done. for those who have read the books, i was surprised to see where this movie ended in the progression of plot, compared to the books. this movie stops well short of where _the two towers_ book gets to. it makes me wonder if we are in for a running time pushing 4 hrs. for return of the king, or if they are just going to cut a lot of stuff out to fit in the end of two towers' plot and then all of return of the king's plot.";19 December 2002;9;['impressed', 'well', 'slow', 'full', 'impressed', 'nice', 'multiple', 'green', 'meaningful', 'first', 'true', 'similar', 'less', 'small', 'original', 'several', 'well', 'surprised', 'short'];0.2122549019607843
1206;ichikuo;"i will make my comments away from the film's story but about the film's directing. we all know that the lotr has one of the most powerful stories ever in the media (including literature). i've never read the novels but still very much enjoy the story on film. however, i can only imagine what the film would be like if it had a better director. my opinion of ""the two towers"" is the same as ""the fellowship of the ring"". both films are driven by story. i enjoyed both films extremely only because of the stories. this leads to my disappointment of peter jackson's film directing abilities. however, i guess a man jumping from a blockbuster as ""the frighteners"" (sarcasm) lived up to my expectations. peter jackson is not a young man and seeing how terrible his films were before lotr, i expected a story driven film trilogy. why was he chosen for this film? what credits does he have that make him honorable? any director that has such a powerful license to a story such as lotr is going to be successful. if you look at the film from a director's perspective, there is nothing special about it. the film is watered down to nothing more than overhead fly-bys, which gets very old, early in the film it was like watching ""behind enemy lines"" again. the battle scenes are gorgeous simply because of location and cg, but there's no uniqueness to them. something peter jackson needs to make in order to make him stand out as one of the great directors to date. he does not take advantage of the opportunity he has with lotr. an amateur film director could have designed the scenes for each battle. they were too simplistic. mind you, you must get over the strength of the story and look at the basics of the direction of the film. i would've liked to seen what a director such as ridley scott or steven spielberg could have done with lotr. these film makers always seem to bring something new to the screen with each movie, something that makes them stand out, something peter jackson lacks. many people don't like spielberg, but i like spielberg films because they are always beautifully directed, same as ridley scott. the point of this editorial is something that everyone should notice and not look at lotr as the novel, but as the film. peter jackson's sub-par direction is hidden behind the story of lotr.";29 December 2002;9;['powerful', 'well', 'same', 'young', 'terrible', 'honorable', 'powerful', 'such', 'successful', 'special', 'more', 'overhead', 'old', 'gorgeous', 'great', 'amateur', 'simplistic', 'such', 'new', 'many', 'same', 'sub', 'par'];0.1551948051948052

1210;indraya;a reader amazed by j.r.r.tolkien's world might say that 'the fellowship of the ring' makes justice to the book. not all such readers would agree, but in my opinion, 'the two towers' makes something more. the first film had just to visualize the story from the first book with minor changes. the second one had to give the story a new and clearly defined structure. this task was almost perfectly accomplished. also, it is a delight to see tt being different from fotr. the first film often reminds of a colourful fairy-tale. the second one is more like a historical movie. realism of one of the main storylines makes such movies like 'gladiator' and 'braveheart' look a bit like a fantasy. of course, there are amiable fairy-tale like moments, but character development and action are primary elements. these are perfectly balanced. there is more character development than in the book, and the performance from the actors adds a lot to it. aragorn is perfectly depicted as firmly stepping towards his kingship. there are all aspects of frodo's psychology, what makes me to abandon all fears about the ability of the third film to express the darkest ones. gollum, based on astonishing performance, is alive. his big eyes make him similar to frodo, a nice visualization of a not too explicit writer's idea. the action, especially the battle, is as capturing as 'the matrix', while avoiding trivialization of death, so common in the movies. the film is impressive on all levels. there is a digital army, which does not look as such, and there are lots of subtle details like a flag of rohan landing under the feet of aragorn's horse. visual effects? there were two or three. everything else was real. the cinematography is breath - catching. the score is amazing. a certain theme is enough to remind a viewer of a location or event without naming them. what could one expect after fotr and tt? the 'return of the king' most likely will complete the seemingly impossible quest of moviemaking. 'the lord of the rings' as a whole will certainly be one of the best films ever made. for many people, at least.;9 February 2003;9;['such', 'more', 'first', 'first', 'minor', 'second', 'new', 'different', 'first', 'colourful', 'second', 'more', 'historical', 'main', 'such', 'amiable', 'primary', 'balanced', 'more', 'aragorn', 'third', 'dark', 'astonishing', 'alive', 'big', 'similar', 'nice', 'explicit', 'common', 'impressive', 'digital', 'such', 'subtle', 'visual', 'real', 'amazing', 'certain', 'enough', 'likely', 'impossible', 'good', 'many', 'least'];0.1531707031707032

1216;marperra;"all in all, a great movie, imo the best of 2002 (not a great year for films, anyway...). jackson is a real genius because he has taken a fairy story, that could mean nothing to the average guy, and has created a visual world around it, so wonderful and surprising that you're always wondering what you will see in the next minute. it's not only the special effects: the landscapes of new zealand provide some of the most awe-inspiring scenes. the golden rule of jackson is: when nothing very interesting happens, give something very interesting to see. this rule is broken a little in the second hour, where the story goes on details without being very involving; there, for me, the two towers failed the perfect performance of the fellowship (3 hours without a look to the watch!). but the last hours, with the two battle at helm's deep and isengard, is the greatest visual experience of the year. in this instalment, the most psychologically-complex character is introduced: gollum. it is funny that a cgi creature could be more human than humans (yoda immediately comes to mind). gollum is destroyed by the power of the ring, but a part of him still hopes that other people's love and respect can redeem him. gollum is so convincing because a real actor played his part, and cgi is superimposed on his body. this improves also the performances of frodo and sam, which don't seem to speak to themselves, as obi-wan talking to jar-jar. i don't think you can win an oscar without ever showing your face, but i hope andy serkis will get a special award for his peculiar and wonderful performance. 8/10";20 January 2003;8;['great', 'good', 'great', 'real', 'average', 'visual', 'wonderful', 'surprising', 'next', 'special', 'golden', 'interesting', 'interesting', 'little', 'second', 'perfect', 'last', 'deep', 'isengard', 'great', 'visual', 'complex', 'funny', 'human', 'other', 'convincing', 'real', 'special', 'peculiar', 'wonderful'];0.3425137362637362

1218;Sam_Mendes_Fan;"i loved the fellowship of the ring and was greatly anticipating this film. this film however did not have nearly the same wow effect as the first movie. effects in this movie are defenitly top notch and it makes the movie worth seeing just for the huge scale of the battles but other than that i thought this movie had far less substance. the best part of the movie is golem, he is spectacular and who can't love him? unfortunately he was the only character in this movie i found myself caring about. about all you get from gimliy and legalos are a bombardment of simply awful jokes. going alongside the wall at helms deep was humorous when you come by gimliy not being able to see over the wall, yet like all the good humor in this movie they immediately destroy the joke by over doing it, ""shall i fetch you a box."" no thanks mr. elf i would prefer a mute button. going back to gimliy again, i found it very annoying that treebeard's voice was done by the same actor, this however wont bother most of you... hopefully. the battles for the most part are epic and truelly spectacular, yet they throw in many scenes that make me cringe and want to look away, also in this movie i had trouble believing in ""the reality of the movie"". examples include... - legolas was taking out the orcs and there ride (large beast creatures) with one arrow a piece... they were moving... really fast, this i am fine with but when he get's off two shots at the orc with the torch resembling a character from the road warrior and doesn't put him down... something is wrong. this is also the same character that said when the orcs were a rather far distance from helmsdeep to aim for there necks and underarms. this brings me to my next and biggest complaint with our elf friend. - legalos told them to shoot at the necks etc. because that is where there armor is the weakest. well there armor does absolutely nothing against shields tossed with feet. the scene that i am talking about where legolas slides down the stairs is so awfull i don't want to see the movie again if i have to watch that. i was fine with all of legolas' other little tricks but this is completely stupid. it truelly takes away a lot of the serious atmosphere this battle had and turned it into trash. these people are defending there families and i can't take that seriously when i have elf man sliding away. - the central characters are far to powerfull in this movie. when aragorn and gimliy can cover the bridge swarming with orcs by themselves something 30 some people couldn't do it's hard to accept -when the men who capture frodo and sam kill the back half of that large army of men, why did the front half completely ignore what was going on? -and finally... there is no was i can believe that not a single person wasn't able to spot either sam or frodo when they were at the gates of mordor. there little cloaks were not enough to have shielded them from sight and sound with how much running around they did around there. i suggest when you see this movie you simply accept all of its oddness and not ""nitpick"" like me. i do think the movie is good but it is far from great and imho not worthy of a best picture nomination.";9 March 2003;3;['same', 'first', 'top', 'worth', 'huge', 'other', 'less', 'good', 'spectacular', 'only', 'gimliy', 'awful', 'humorous', 'able', 'good', 'mute', 'annoying', 'same', 'most', 'most', 'epic', 'spectacular', 'many', 'large', 'fine', 'wrong', 'same', 'far', 'next', 'big', 'weak', 'awfull', 'fine', 'other', 'little', 'stupid', 'serious', 'central', 'hard', 'back', 'large', 'front', 'single', 'able', 'little', 'enough', 'much', 'good', 'great', 'imho', 'worthy', 'good'];0.1322204968944099

1223;mcroyle;as a fan of tolkein's books, i may be the first person on the planet (that i've heard of) to say that i didn't like the second movie as well as the first. don't hate me please. as moviegoers, we can all understand the adaptation process, yet in the second film, peter, pilippa (spelling?) and the rest of the writing crew fell short of the adaptation process (es.) just my opinion, and i know some of you won't agree, but i feel that as a fan i deserve my two cents. first point to make is the threat of war: at the end of the first film there is the threat of war...we realize that war is inevitable, but it's not on our heels just yet. yet, at the beginning of the second film, it's as if war has taken us from the beginning of the picture. i know there's only so much you can do in a three hour span, but a lot of time in this picture was given to some more secondary things. (i.e.= too much chasing across landscapes for merry and pippin...and extremely long battle sequences during the helm's deep.) -- again some of you may have problems with me saying helm's deep was secondary...but that's not what i'm saying at all. but, the amount of time taken to visualize the scenes was too long. second point: the role of faramir, baromir's brother, was written almost totally different from the book. in the novel, faramir is a very wise and accepting person, (as was his brother) yet it also explains that faramir was quite different from his brother...and when he finds the true nature of the burden frodo carries, he completely understands (even if almost instinctly) that he couldn't, and would not, bring such a burden to mankind. yet, in the picture, he rushes sam and frodo off to minas tirith (by way of osgiliath) to take the ring to man...which never even happens. i was disappointed with faramir's character in the film, because even though peter, philippa, and the writing crew show that faramir is different than baromir in the end, the whole of faramir's character (the way that tolkien wrote it) is crushed by the screenplay. third point: i felt that the cgi characters in the film were something that could have been better constructed, although i am by no means anyone with skills enough even to create such amazing things on screen. there's one scene where the lion-like attackers persuade aragorn and his crew...i felt like i was watching a he-man cartoon and battle-cat (if anyone knows who he is) was cloned many times and people were riding on him. i know that weta, with the technology they have, could have easily bettered the outcome of the visual battle in these sequences...and i won't even start on gollum. (final fantasy was better. that's all i have to say about him.) i was so excited going into this film and so dissappointed when the ending credits rolled. what about the huorns? where are they? the first of the trilogy was almost flawless, leaving out so little vital things to the story, but i was left speechless at the closing curtain to the two towers...and not a good speechless. what about more history of the ents? you know...one of the oldest, wisest, most intersting parts of the second installment. who knows. all i know is that even though the movie did almost fulfill my need for a bridge between the first and third, it didn't include half the material (or even get included material right enough) for true fans to enjoy it as much as we would have liked. 7.5 out of 10 -- on my scale. the first -- 9.5 when did the elves fight with the humans during helm's deep too? -thanks for your time. :);25 December 2002;8;['first', 'second', 'first', 'second', 'short', 'first', 'first', 'inevitable', 'second', 'secondary', 'long', 'deep', 'deep', 'secondary', 'long', 'second', 'different', 'wise', 'different', 'true', 'tirith', 'disappointed', 'different', 'third', 'such', 'amazing', 'like', 'many', 'visual', 'final', 'well', 'excited', 'first', 'flawless', 'little', 'vital', 'good', 'more', 'old', 'wise', 'most', 'second', 'first', 'third', 'true', 'first', 'deep'];0.149715909090909
1224;jonathan-harvey3;of course, i am a tolkien fan that has enjoyed the books and associated art for years. i never thought anyone could possibly put this material on the big screen without butchering it so much it would not have the same magic. peter jackson has proved me so wrong, watching the fellowship (about 30 times now!) and the two towers three times i feel i have been transported into middle earth in all its glory! yes, i know the films have missed bits of the book out (tom bambardil for instance), enhanced some characters (arwin being a good example, but seeing more of liv tyler is not a bad thing), changed dialogue (everyone i would say) and have characters appear where they shouldn't be (sam and frodo at osgiliath for instance). i agree with peter jackson that it was necessary to change things around for the sake of making the movies as entertaining as possible whilst keeping as much of the essence of the book as possible. therefore, i forgive peter for all of the changes he has done, in fact he has even improved it in some places like the elves turning up to fight at helms deep, superb moment. after the disaster of the cgi created character jar jar binks in star wars episode i, i was really worried gollum and treebeard in the two towers. i was astonished with the realism of gollum, i forgot he was cgi'd when i was watching him which is the ultimate test i would say. treebeard was well done as well, would have liked to have seen more of him espiecially in his ent house, hopefully we will see more on the extended dvd i am expecting late next year. one question, how did aragorn manage to put his sword back into its sheath when he fell off the cliff? is there a break in continuity here? getting alan lee and john howe involved in the artwork for the film was a master stroke, so many scenes looked just as if they had been lifted straight from their paintings. well done to all those that worked on the film, but particulary peter jackson, he is a genius. can't wait to see it again.;29 December 2002;10;['associated', 'big', 'same', 'wrong', 'middle', 'good', 'more', 'bad', 'necessary', 'entertaining', 'possible', 'much', 'possible', 'deep', 'superb', 'worried', 'ultimate', 'more', 'more', 'extended', 'next', 'many', 'particulary'];0.1666666666666666
1225;secho;"finally here comes a movie that is worth the price of admission and more, a movie that surpasses your wildest expectations and constantly fills your eyes with wonder, a movie that grabs you from the first frame, carries you off to another time and place, immerses you in an epic struggle of good versus evil and makes you give a darn about the outcome, a movie with characters who are real and are given poetry for dialog in place of profanity, a movie where we care about those characters, where we root for our heroes and curse their enemies. finally here comes a movie that deserves the title ""epic."" here comes lord of the rings: the two towers. kneel down and pray. i should say i am not a huge fan of tolkien (though i enjoyed reading the hobbit as a boy). i saw the first film and thought it was ""okay,"" but this one -- this one made me a believer. the movie simply does not mess around. for one thing, you need not be a lotr-geek to get caught up in the spectacle of the thing -- probably the best that modern special effects has to offer the movie-going public. a surreal, dream-like world is established, half-cartoon, half-flesh-and-blood; which is which is often hard to tell. like any good magic show, at some point you just give in and enjoy the show. the two towers astounds its audience with sweeping vistas, gargantuan armies, looming castle walls, dark forests, giant monsters, dragons, and all manner of fantastical creatures. and its real. i particularly enjoyed the way mythological creatures became real creatures before my eyes. we become familiar with the nature and limitations of dwarves and wizards, elves and orcs, and oh yes...hobbits. for example, when gandalf the grey throws off his robe, revealing that he has acquired new power and become gandalf the ""white,"" you feel like you are witnessing a real wizard. all of the creatures move and operate according to certain rules -- just like in any universe. but its not hokey, the way, say, an episode of charmed might be with its ""white lighters"" and ""demons."" here is a world where a master dwarf is, well, a master dwarf -- a creature with excellent fighting abilities, sure, but don't count on him to give chase to bad guys (since he can't run very fast or for very long). nor can you expect him to be able to leap from a tiny ledge on the side of a castle, some ten feet across in order to attack a battalion of uruk-hai warriors gathered on the narrow entrance leading into the castle. he must be thrown across the way if he is to make it at all. hey come on; after all, he's a dwarf! the acting is so good that the characters are not being portrayed -- they simply are. the plot, though complex, never leaves us wondering. in fact, the plot is really quite simple: war is brewing. an evil force is gathering. innocent lives are threatened. a final battle is promised and when it finally occurs, we are in awe. ladders are slowly raised to storm castle walls, swarms of arrows impale snarling soldiers, and all of it looks magnificent. as cliche as it sounds, the movie is a rollercoaster ride of excitement. get in line and buy your ticket.";5 January 2003;10;['worth', 'more', 'wild', 'first', 'epic', 'good', 'real', 'epic', 'huge', 'first', 'okay', 'good', 'modern', 'special', 'surreal', 'like', 'half', 'half', 'hard', 'good', 'sweeping', 'gargantuan', 'dark', 'giant', 'fantastical', 'mythological', 'real', 'familiar', 'new', 'white', 'real', 'certain', 'white', 'excellent', 'sure', 'bad', 'able', 'tiny', 'narrow', 'good', 'complex', 'simple', 'evil', 'innocent', 'final', 'magnificent', 'rollercoaster'];0.1962162837162837

1227;rodmans545;"in 1994, when houghton mifflin company published a single copy of the lord of the rings, douglas a. anderson wrote a 'revised note to the text' making it clear that j. r. r. tolkien's famous epic novel was 'often erroneously called a trilogy, when it is in fact a single novel, consisting of six books plus appendices, sometimes published in three volumes'. the three volumes anderson referred to, the fellowship of the ring, the two towers, and the return of the king, were initially developed by the original publishers for purposes of cutting down on the cost of printing (david colbert, the magical worlds of the lord of the rings). according to colbert it was the publishers who first came up with the title the two towers for the second volume. given his fascination with and penchant for referring to dozens of important towers within the novel, tolkien himself wasn't sure which two towers were in fact denoted by the title and was therefore initially unconvinced by the title itself. however tolkien eventually conceded and thus the myth of the trilogy of the lord of the rings was born. all of this background is not for want when reviewing peter jackson's film version of the lord of the rings: the two towers. in spite of following the traditional lead of breaking the story up into three films, he has essentially remained faithful to the text, as faithful as any movie director can be expected to when trying to adapt such an epic to the big screen, by maintaining a continuous uninterrupted flow from the first film to the second. the two towers immediately picks up right where the fellowship of the ring leaves off and we are again treated to a movie masterpiece so entrancing and perfectly paced. the two towers is filled with rich three-dimensional characters and plotlines, beautiful performances, and numerous battle scenes amidst breathtaking landscapes. frodo (elijah wood) and sam (sean astin) continue in their quest to bring the one ring to mordor and destroy it in the very fires from which it was forged, while the rest of the fellowship is split up into several factions in an effort to find their lost friends and take up the fight against the armies of the dark lord sauron and the traitorous saruman. new characters are introduced, notably the ents, grima wormtongue, king theodon and the creature gollum. the film is undoubtedly mythical, just as tolkien had intended, but it also more than adequately explores many of the difficult problems and questions tolkien had examined during his lifetime; the inevitable encroachment of industrialization, and its impact on modern human society; the quest by some for unfettered power over all races; the onslaught of war in order to both provoke and quell that quest; the longing by others for peace and pastoral tranquility; and the endless forging and breaking up of alliances between the different races to achieve or defeat these varying quests. in many ways gollum's character is a microcosm of these competing interests, providing much of the film's most vivid and provocative moments and leaving the audience with much to ponder. it is perhaps to their considerable credit and understanding of today's moviegoers that jackson and his collaborators did not make one nine hour film but don't be surprised when the movie ends and the credits roll if instead you don't find yourself wishing they had.";15 April 2003;10;['single', 'revised', 'clear', 'famous', 'epic', 'single', 'original', 'magical', 'second', 'penchant', 'important', 'sure', 'traditional', 'faithful', 'faithful', 'big', 'continuous', 'uninterrupted', 'first', 'rich', 'dimensional', 'beautiful', 'numerous', 'very', 'several', 'dark', 'traitorous', 'new', 'creature', 'mythical', 'many', 'difficult', 'inevitable', 'modern', 'human', 'unfettered', 'pastoral', 'endless', 'different', 'many', 'much', 'vivid', 'provocative', 'much', 'considerable', 'surprised'];0.151403435274403

1233;fredrik-bendz;"i was very disappointed by this movie when it came out. true, jackson does a great job in bringing tolkien's world to life, and the shots are epic. however, as a tolkien fan, i find the film tantamount to blasphemy. i understand that you have to remove parts of the book to keep the film at reasonable length, and i understand that you need to make adaptations of the story for the screen. what i don't understand is why you take a literal masterpiece and remove most of it just to include a love story that adds nothing, and isn't very romantic even. apart from the battle of helm's deep, almost none of the events are taken from the book, and those that are have been changed beyond recognition. i (re-)read each book prior to watching the movies - bad mistake! if i didn't have the book in such fresh memory when i saw the movie, i might have appreciated it more. don't watch this movie with the expectation that it's an adaption of the two towers. it isn't. the story is rather based on the aragorn/arwen story in appendix a to the return of the king, with ""a little"" imagination from jackson. they should have included much more from the book and made this story a movie on its own. a love story staring viggo mortensen and liv tyler could have been a hit. it would have given the scriptwriter an opportunity to really focus on the love between arwen and aragorn, and arwen's decision to become mortal, thereby forsaking her chance to ever see her family again. that's some powerful love right there!

1242;leonardo-24;spoilers included let me start by stating that i enjoyed the film, but was disappointed with several of the choices made by the film makers. first the highlights: the striking debut of eomer (played wonderfully by karl urban) although sorely underused, king theoden (bernard hill, very good) the elves fighting at helm's deep, and gollum (a true cinematic feat). i was mesmerized by everything about gollum, but especially his face and eyes, i really felt like i was looking at a real living breathing being. other high points include the stunning new zealand scenery, the armor and swords of the rohan people, and the fortress at helm's deep. disappointments: 1) considering the meticulous planning that went into the battle of helm's deep, i was not pleased with the editing of the battle sequence. the constant cutting back and forth between the battle scenes and the other story lines, especially merry and pippin, diminished the sense of excitement and dread it should have invoked. why not spend a good fifteen straight minutes just on the battle, and really allow the audience to be drawn into the events. 2)i was also disappointed that we did not see a longer sequence showing the rohan horsemen battling the uruk-hai when they rescue helm's deep. what i disliked: 1)the entire sequence involving aragorn's fall from the cliff and the implication that anything terrible had actually happened to him. these scenes were obviously designed to further explore his relationship with arwen, but it felt out of place and seemed like a cheap way to wrangle an emotional response from the audience. 2)i understand the importance of the ents, but i found the scenes with treebeard and the two hobbitts to be almost unbearable. 3)the voice over by galadriel describing the war raging in middle earth, as much as i love cate blanchet, her scene was unnecessary, since we as an audience clearly know what is already transpiring. 4)the treatment of eowyn's character, after a great initial introduction where she demonstrates real strength, she is then relegated to pinning for aragorn. why not focus on her frustration at not being able to fight along with the men and being cast aside with the other women and children. if i were to grade the two towers i would give it a b-, whereas fotr receives a solid a.;22 December 2002;8;['several', 'striking', 'good', 'deep', 'true', 'cinematic', 'real', 'other', 'high', 'stunning', 'deep', 'meticulous', 'deep', 'pleased', 'constant', 'other', 'merry', 'good', 'straight', 'disappointed', 'long', 'deep', 'entire', 'terrible', 'cheap', 'emotional', 'unbearable', 'middle', 'unnecessary', 'great', 'initial', 'real', 'able', 'other', 'solid'];0.0974166666666666

(anyone remember star wars ep4?) directing - is it quite apparent that the directing was done with great care and dedication. i was unable to find one scene that could have had a better cut. music - the musical scores in this movie are clean, flowing, and quite moving, but do not get in the way of the movie itself. lotr1 had a few scenes that could have used a little less musical volume, but lotr2 did not suffer the same flaw. sound effects - do you ever think, ""hey i've heard that exact same bloop/slash/scream before""? well i have. i think someone made a universal sound database, and everyone uses it. everyone except the lotr crew. special effects - easily my most critical area. lotr2 stopped me cold on this criterion. well, i did find -one- flaw in the sfx, but it was water, and water is just given to be bad in any movie. not that it was bad, but it was certainly not perfect. however, the unprecedented computer graphics such as the ents, and the other very believable cg scenes made up for the brief scene with the rushing water. furter notes - the movie had intense action, and breathtaking cg, but did not use those as a crutch for poor acting, and lackluster directing (as the new star wars movies are doing). furthermore the cg far surpasses the quality of even ilm(lucas). that earns bonus points.";27 December 2002;10;['critical', 'little', 'different', 'wonderful', 'semi', 'popular', 'top', 'notch', 'apparent', 'great', 'unable', 'well', 'musical', 'clean', 'moving', 'few', 'little', 'musical', 'same', 'sound', 'exact', 'same', 'universal', 'special', 'critical', 'cold', 'bad', 'bad', 'perfect', 'unprecedented', 'such', 'other', 'believable', 'brief', 'intense', 'poor', 'lackluster', 'new'];0.0957628230355503

1259;WaMoZ;"i may as well start off by declaring that this is my favourite movie of all time. not that i think it's perfect. it has flaws not apparent in the fellowship of the ring, a near-perfect gem of a film. but more about ttt's imperfections later. i didn't ""choose"" it as a favourite film because it is the best, rather it ""chose"" me, by speaking to my heart and mind in a way no other movie has before or since has. within peter jackson's inspired vision of the lord of the rings, ttt just grabbed me with its uncompromisingly gritty intensity. it is the very centre of a monumental life or death struggle between good and evil. the beginning is long gone and the ending is still far off. i just love that the each of the three groups separated from each other by fotr's uruk-hai attack never find their friends. they are all driven by simple hope no matter how desperate their situations may get, and this theme is brilliantly summed up by sam's speech in osgiliath at the end. the opening sequence of gandalf fighting the balrog while they fall is a splendid mix of state-of-the-art special effects and character exposition. the ferocity of ian mckellen's performance more than matches the spectacular sight of the plunging, flaming balrog on the big screen. but better is to follow. andy serkis and a brilliant cgi team brings the repulsive and pathetic yet compelling creature gollum to life in a way inconceivable before the release of this movie. the other new characters add to the intrigue as the rohan's struggle for survival unfolds. the actors playing eomer, wormtongue, eowyn and theoden are perfectly cast, as the story flows seamlessly from the ending of fotr. as for the controversial changes to the book of ttt, i feel they are justified. aragorn's urging of arwen to leave middle earth is a noble act of self-sacrifice. the further exposition of arwen's character and her relationship with aragorn adds so much to our understanding of him. he is a more rounded and vulnerable character as a result. to not bring arwen and aragorn's tale out of the rotk appendices would have been a grave injustice, because within the narrative of the book her character is badly underwritten. i also liked seeing the elves at helm's deep, because viewers who haven't read the silmarillion would not realise the extent of their losses in previous wars with melkor and sauron. the addition of faramir's bad decision-making is even more controversial, but i say, why not make him more suitable for the unforgiving medium of film? on the page he is a wonderfully written character, but after just a cosy chat with frodo he lets him go on into the heart of mordor with the ring! the film audience would start to doubt the power of the ring with faramir being so immune to it, and also would end up wondering in rotk if it was actually necessary for aragorn to take over the rule of gondor from such a perfect heir to the now-dead denethor. in the film faramir's development as a character is extremely moving, culminating in his final quiet decision to release frodo. in this film faramir, aragorn and theoden are real characters i can better identify with, rather than the idealised figures of tolkien's original book. i am not putting down tolkien, because i love his writings and will defend them against his critics, but am merely pointing the difference between contemporary films and traditional literature. his characters are problematic on the big screen if left unadapted, and i believe jackson has done this and kept the essence of the story. however, to avoid the impression that i am totally uncritical of this film, i will say that jackson has not done justice to the power of treebeard's character as written by tolkien. he seems to be senile at times! ttt's epic battles are just brilliant. the warg fight is a nice entree, but helm's deep is a stunning main course. the beautifully developing friendship of legolas and gimli is a real high point. of course hardened solders make jokes in the middle of battles! then we have possibly the most spine-tingling moment of the whole trilogy, as the rohirrim charge out of the rising sun into the massed ranks of uruk-hai, led by eomer and gandalf the white rider on shadowfax. this is the sequence in my lotr ee dvds that gets the most replays! another reason this is my favourite is that it has less things to distract from plot and character development than do fotr and rotk. the homely shire, glittering lothlorien, the ghostly army of the dead, the great spider shelob, the awful mountain of fire, the pageantry of the minas tirith coronation, and the glow of the grey havens do not appear. the only idyllic place, rivendell, is a troubled memory in aragorn's tortured thoughts. helm's deep at night is not the majestic site for a battle that is minas tirith in daylight. don't get me wrong, i love lotr's spectacle, but in ttt the life and death scenarios seem even more fraught and desperate without the unforgettable backgrounds. i must add a comment about the extended edition, to illustrate a further flaw. unlike fotr, ttt relies on its ee to add details which make the story more understandable. jackson unfortunately left out of the theatrical version the flashback scene in osgiliath between boromir, faramir and denethor. while this decision aided the pacing of the movie, it left jackson open to criticism that he had thoughtlessly marred faramir's character. this scene provides back-story explaining why he first decides to take frodo and the ring to minas tirith. the ee is needlessly essential viewing as a result, but i would still recommend it regardless, because as with fotr it does add cream to the cake of a classic movie!";23 October 2006;10;['favourite', 'perfect', 'apparent', 'perfect', 'more', 'favourite', 'good', 'other', 'inspired', 'gritty', 'very', 'monumental', 'good', 'other', 'uruk', 'simple', 'desperate', 'gandalf', 'splendid', 'special', 'spectacular', 'big', 'well', 'brilliant', 'repulsive', 'pathetic', 'compelling', 'creature', 'inconceivable', 'other', 'new', 'controversial', 'middle', 'noble', 'further', 'rounded', 'vulnerable', 'rotk', 'grave', 'underwritten', 'deep', 'previous', 'bad', 'controversial', 'suitable', 'unforgiving', 'immune', 'necessary', 'aragorn', 'perfect', 'dead', 'moving', 'final', 'quiet', 'aragorn', 'theoden', 'real', 'original', 'contemporary', 'traditional', 'problematic', 'big', 'unadapted', 'uncritical', 'senile', 'epic', 'brilliant', 'nice', 'deep', 'stunning', 'main', 'gimli', 'high', 'whole', 'massed', 'white', 'most', 'favourite', 'less', 'rotk', 'homely', 'ghostly', 'dead', 'great', 'awful', 'only', 'idyllic', 'rivendell', 'troubled', 'deep', 'majestic', 'tirith', 'wrong', 'fraught', 'desperate', 'unforgettable', 'extended', 'further', 'understandable', 'theatrical', 'open', 'back', 'essential', 'classic'];0.143895619306067

1269;stewate4;generally an excellent film, which, taken as such provides an well paced continuation of the story, whilst at the same time sticking moderately closely to the original book. personally i can live with most of the changes that peter jackson has made, which given the limitations of time inevitable within a film are probably necessary. however i'm not too keen on what he has done to elrond. in both films he comes across as almost contemptuous of the race of man, and in the new one seems to be emotionally bullying arwen to give up aragorn and join an escape of the elves to the far west, leaving middle earth to its fate. as someone who has read the books this is rather jarring as there he is only half an elf himself (his full title is elrond halfelven), where his father was the man earendil, whilst his mother was the elf elwing, and aragorn was himself a direct descendant of his brother elros. also in the books the elves love middle earth and elrond and galadriel only leave it after the destruction of saurons ring, and the power of their own rings in destroyed. on the other hand as an adaptation where these back-story elements are not mentioned i suppose it could be justified, and maybe peter jackson's elrond doesn't have this heritage. still, i think it's rather a pity. rather more serious imho is the changes to the story of frodo and faramir. spoilers ahead!! in the film they have been dragged off to the city of osgiliath, which is under siege, and where, according to the words of one of the gondorian soldiers, the east bank has fallen. this implies that frodo sam, gollum and faramir are on the west bank. this alteration, as well as considerably diminishing faramirs nobility, as other reviewers have noted, also raises the problem that, when he belatedly realises it would be a bad move to take the ring to his father in minas tirith and releases them, where does he release them to? if he leaves them on west bank they will have to find their way back across the river, which is where mordor is and they want to get to, and as they don't have a boat, and the only bridges are in osgiliath where they are controlled by the enemy this may be difficult. also this last point makes releasing them on the east bank any more difficult as well. tolkien did meticulous work on planning out where all his characters were at any one time in the book, and how they could get to where they were going to, and i think they should have kept with him a bit more here. perhaps any extended dvd may clear this up, but as it stands it is rather puzzling what peter jackson thought he was doing here, apart from showing some, admittedly very good, footage of the battle for the bridges at osgiliath and attacks by nazguls on their flying 'fell beasts', (very well done here). having said all this, this is still an excellent film, which i will almost certainly see again, as well as buying the subsequent dvd's when they come out. the first film also had its inconsistencies as well, notably why gimli wanted to go to moria to see balin, with his 'roaring fires' etc, whilst everyone else knew it wasn't going to be a very dangerous place indeed, and the timing of the nazguls turning up in the shire at the start of the film whilst gandalf was in minas tirith searching through its library, and then gandalf beating them to bag end (how??). the battle at helms deep, as almost everyone else has said, is stupendously well done, and poor old gollum is really brought to life here. other high points are theodens city of meduseld, with a fully realised golden hall, beautifully done here, gandalfs showdown with the balrog right at the start of the film, and even if the fight with the wargs wasn't in the book, i thought that was very well done as well. generally i'm not too bothered by the licences film directors take with their source material, as i still read the books and i can always run much better versions in my own imagination. one of my favorite films is the 1950's version of 'great expectations', which takes much greater liberties with dickens than peter jackson has done here, and as someone else in these reviews has pointed out, people don't take prokofiev to task for the liberties he took with romeo and juliet for his ballet. even with my quibbles above, it succeeds so well in other places i'll still give it a 10.;20 December 2002;10;['excellent', 'such', 'paced', 'same', 'original', 'most', 'inevitable', 'necessary', 'keen', 'contemptuous', 'new', 'aragorn', 'middle', 'jarring', 'full', 'halfelven', 'direct', 'middle', 'own', 'other', 'back', 'serious', 'gondorian', 'other', 'bad', 'only', 'difficult', 'last', 'difficult', 'meticulous', 'extended', 'good', 'excellent', 'subsequent', 'first', 'gimli', 'dangerous', 'deep', 'poor', 'old', 'other', 'high', 'golden', 'well', 'own', 'favorite', 'great', 'great', 'juliet', 'other'];0.1246850079744816

1271;digital platypus;**very minor spoiler ahead** the two towers is film-making at its best. i enjoyed fellowship of the ring immensely, but felt that at places it would have been better to depart from literal faithfulness to the book to be more true to the spirit. the two towers does just that. the two towers glosses over lengthy sections of the book that would have been less than cinematic and enhances elements that reveal characters' motivations more clearly. i found only one section--from the reappearance of gandalf to the exile of grima--to be anything less than exceptional. perhaps a little consolidating there would have helped. but otherwise, the movie grabs you at the start and never lets go until an ending that left my companions who saw it with me and had never read the book begging me to tell them what comes next. the multitude of stories going on at once flow together seamlessly and the character development that never quite established itself in the the fellowship of the ring came through with a wallop. the combination of amazing acting and mind-blowing cgi that made gollum a character that truly engages both our sympathy and our disgust is an incredible achievement in itself. i never thought i would ever find myself wishing that a cgi character could be nominated for a best supporting actor award. but the greatest marvel of it all is way in which jackson can keep all of these story threads rushing forward without overloading his audience. masterful work!;23 December 2002;10;['minor', 'good', 'well', 'literal', 'true', 'lengthy', 'less', 'cinematic', 'less', 'exceptional', 'little', 'amazing', 'incredible', 'good', 'great', 'masterful'];0.3958333333333333

1273;soccerguy578;i already posted, but, after reading some of the other posts, i must post again. i truly believe that whomever has serious problems with this film must look into themselves to find the real problem. i've heard people complain about pacing, about being too violent, about poor acting, about being too different from the book, about changes from characters in the book, about too much cgi, and more. first off, if i ever see anyone compare this movie again to star wars episode ii: attack of the clones, i'll seriously consider ramming my head into a brick wall. that is the worst insult you could give a film that is deservingly among the top 20 films ever made. i am personally offended that any comparison can be made with lucas' absolute catastrophe. i seriously feel sick to my stomach having read anything remotely similar to that. it makes me question why i'm letting myself get so upset about a movie. oh well. first off, the computer graphics in ttt exist to tell the story, whereas the garbage star wars film was built around the special effects, probably to mask the fact that the acting was so bad, the story was written so poorly, and that lucas had forgotten his original or run out of ideas. the dialogue in ttt is so much more meaningful and worthwhile even in its worst moments. especially when compared to the best moments of the clones. this movie does have a different feel to it. it doesn't leave you the way fotr leaves you. after the first movie, i was dying for the next movie. i couldn't wait to see it. after the two towers, i wished it didn't end. while this may seem the same, it is different to me. three hours seemed like 20 minutes to me. the two towers flew by in a world of beauty and tragedy and... man, these words don't do it justice. you know, you can't win. the same people complaining about gimli's comic relief because it's too light-hearted are the same ones complaining that the violence was too gruesome for their likes. the only acting that can be categorized as poor was sean astin's. i will admit it freely. i do believe more of the book will be revealed in the extended versions. i don't like the way hollywood sells movies. i don't. and, if you end up liking the extended version better, you should stand up to hollywood... not peter jackson. his hands are tied on so many issues - if you knew how hollywood works. did it feel like there was less plot? i think so. did this get my panties in a bunch? no. the stories that were presented added more information to the state of middle-earth. the plight of every single woman, child, man, main character, creature... was all very heart-felt. even in this movie, there were so many political, philosophical, emotional undertones for those of us who hate action movies. to me, this wasn't an action movie. it was so much more. would i like there to be some more dialogue and depth in rotk than in ttt? yes. i hope there is. but, these are dark times. it felt dark. like another poster said... i could feel my face making expressions. i could feel my awe. i could feel my pain dragged right out of me. and, this was all with an annoying man next to me making comments about the movie through too much of it. i knew how good it was because i could block it out. when the movie was done, i just wanted to sit there and think about what just happened... and, about life... and, the current state of the world... and myself... and soul... and, so much. just like fellowship did to me. but, in a different way. unlike other people, i can accept the variety of emotions a brilliant story like this can give you. trust me also, i am a computer generated image critic. i think fotr had too many scenes with mediocre graphics. i could sit here and tell you where they fell short, but, i don't want to spoil anything for people skimming through. this movie has far, far fewer failures. someday...;22 December 2002;10;['other', 'serious', 'real', 'violent', 'poor', 'different', 'much', 'more', 'bad', 'top', 'absolute', 'sick', 'similar', 'upset', 'special', 'bad', 'original', 'meaningful', 'worthwhile', 'bad', 'good', 'different', 'first', 'next', 'same', 'different', 'same', 'comic', 'hearted', 'same', 'gruesome', 'only', 'poor', 'more', 'many', 'less', 'more', 'middle', 'single', 'main', 'many', 'political', 'philosophical', 'emotional', 'more', 'more', 'rotk', 'dark', 'dark', 'annoying', 'next', 'much', 'good', 'current', 'much', 'different', 'other', 'brilliant', 'many', 'mediocre', 'short', 'few'];0.0211471861471861

will anything that once was remain the same? all will be transformed, and much that once was will be lost, by its last stand against darkness, as pj has already hinted at for the return of the king and as readers of the books already know. this is a movie about war. in this, it is much different than fellowship of the ring. fellowship of the ring seemed much more fantastical and much more of an adventure movie. two towers, as pj said, is a movie about men, about warfare. the movie, for me, at least, centers around rohan and theoden and aragon (and faramir) and the war of men (rohan and gondor) against saruman and mordor. this movie is much less frodo-centric than fellowship of the ring. i remember in the dvd of fellowship that phillipa said that fellowship was rewritten to make all the story frodo-centric, centered around frodo and the ring. while frodo is still important in the two towers, it seems that the movie's focus is on rohan and the plight of men (the plight of osgilath and farmir also reaffirm this), who seem worn, their kingdoms near desolation, yet expected to fight one last time, though at the end of their days. gondor and rohan seem shadows of their former glory, children and elderly fighting, their people dirty peasants, their cities in ruins. when the banner of rohan falls before aragon arrives, blown by the wind, truly that is the state of men and of middle earth at the time of the film. to me, the main characters in this film are theoden and aragon, the old king of rohan and the future king of gondor. in theoden we see the passing of the third age, a former warrior-king (similar to those in germanic tales) past his prime as is his kingdom. he is torn about leading his people to war. he knows he may be leading what people are left in the kingdom to their end. he might be leading his kingdom to its final breath. i found his character wholly engaging, thought-provoking, and empathetic. viggo again does a wonderful job as aragon. as for the rest of the returning cast, they all do a wonderful job. john rhyss-davies is hilarious as gimli. i love that this time his character is given more screen time, which was cut out of the theatrical version of fellowship and not returned to fellowship until the extended dvd. as for gollum, i did not find him as believable as many people have stated. throughout he seemed to me cgi. however, in close ups of his face, he did look like andy serkis. truly this was an actor acting gollum when we focused on gollum's face. i felt pity for smeagol and terror of gollum. pj does a great job at the turmoil of smeagol/gollum and the difference between the two personalities and, most of all, at showing how gollum is what frodo is already becoming because of his ""addiction"" to the ring. i did not find the changes to faramir's character jarring. i had always found the faramir section of the two towers rather boring, so i liked that there was more tension involved. in the end, faramir is the faramir that we know from the books. he doesn't give in to the ring. > the only thing i really didn't like about the movie was some of the scenes with arwen. i did however think the scene where we see arwen and elrond together and arwen has to make the decision to stay or leave definitely was a worthwhile addition to the film. as for the ents, treebeard was rendered wonderfully and much of his dialogue came directly from the book. some of the other ents however looked a little ""cutesy"". i did have some misgivings that the ents did not after entmoot say right away that they would attack saruman, but having pippin and merry lead treebeard toward orthanc to show him the desolation saruman had created does give pippin and merry a more important role to play. we do get to see pippin and merry begin to take on more responsibility, though their role in the film is small compared to the other two major storylines, the major one being that of theoden/aragon and the other of frodo/golllum (again the old and the new, the old ringbearer and the new ringbearer). gandalf is given very little time in the movie also. again, i think because the script was written toward focusing on the aragon and theoden comparison and the frodo and gollum comparison. on the whole this is a very different film from fellowship. fellowship was about frodo. this is about the ending of an age and the trials of the weary kingdoms of men in the end times. did i like it? yes. but for different reasons than fellowship because this is a very different film than fellowship as pj has said.";21 December 2002;9;['final', 'weary', 'weary', 'third', 'middle', 'middle', 'ancient', 'last', 'long', 'former', 'theoden', 'weary', 'weary', 'devoid', 'gray', 'worn', 'devoid', 'many', 'empty', 'plain', 'barren', 'gray', 'bleak', 'gray', 'same', 'much', 'last', 'different', 'fantastical', 'more', 'least', 'less', 'frodo', 'phillipa', 'important', 'worn', 'last', 'former', 'elderly', 'dirty', 'middle', 'main', 'theoden', 'old', 'future', 'third', 'former', 'similar', 'germanic', 'final', 'provoking', 'empathetic', 'wonderful', 'wonderful', 'hilarious', 'gimli', 'more', 'theatrical', 'extended', 'believable', 'many', 'close', 'great', 'most', 'boring', 'more', 'only', 'worthwhile', 'much', 'other', 'little', 'important', 'more', 'small', 'other', 'major', 'major', 'other', 'old', 'new', 'old', 'new', 'little', 'theoden', 'different', 'weary', 'different', 'different'];0.0792367468596976
1281;dbudelsky;"contains spoilers i waited a year for this film. overall, it was a disappointment to me. as a real tolkien fan, i loved the first film and understood most alterations to the book as more or less necessary for shortening the plot to three and a half hours. i love the long dvd version even more than the shorter cinema version as the extension calms the journey a little bit, so the watcher can really see what is happening. in the second film ttt the sets, tricks and character looks are again excellent. the best persons in my humble opinion are wormtongue and of course: gollum really put to live, the most interesting person even in the books; here a real character. what i don't like are the alterations to the book, as they replace plot with massacre! a chapter in the book is made the central part in the film, lasting may be half an hour while eight chapters are left out and shifted partly to the third film, as the last scene clearly implies. that the battle is changed: replacement of the rangers by elves and erkenbrand by eomer is not the problem, but for example the ents: why do they turn up at isengard so suddenly after the decision to do nothing at the ent thing and the rethinking of treebeard ad the border of fangorn? or why does frodo face a nazgul at osgiliath who should clearly feel the presence of the ring and restart the hunt for it at osgiliath? a decade of plot outline from tolkien is replaced by holes! overall a must see film, but a clear decrease after fotr. what will we see in the third film? the book alone has enough plot for two jackson films, but elements of the ttt book have to be added to return of the king, namely shelob and the joining of merry/pippin with gandalf/aragorn/legolas/gimli (and eowyn!!!) for further adventures together.";12 January 2003;8;['real', 'first', 'most', 'necessary', 'long', 'more', 'short', 'little', 'second', 'excellent', 'good', 'humble', 'wormtongue', 'interesting', 'real', 'central', 'third', 'last', 'treebeard', 'fangorn', 'clear', 'third', 'enough', 'gandalf', 'aragorn', 'gimli', 'further'];0.1703947368421052

1290;edgarallenpahl;"there are new standards of cinematography, artistic settings, and action for the movie making industry. never before has any movie brought to the screen so visually the horrors of war and the complexity and depth of battle, with the seemingly hopeless courage of the outnumbered few. and yet fine details in settings and storyline were not lost amidst the ferocity of combat. the battle at helm's deep is one of the greatest achievements of all time and will be remembered as the definition of medieval war. this movie from the opening scenes with gandalf fighting the balrog to the final scenes is captivating to the extreme, i was on the edge of my seat the entire time, even if i had read the books at least 25 times and knew what was to happen next. the movie flowed seamlessly from one storyline to another. something needs to be said about the performance of andy serkis as gollum. he was absolutely incredible in bringing gollum to life as a real complex being with a dual personality. his performance should earn an oscar, but we all know that personalities and favoritism govern the choosing of oscars, not competence. witness the choosing last year of ""a beautiful mind"" over ""the fellowship of the ring"" as best movie of the year. this was a sympathy award to ron howard because he never earned an oscar before. perhaps the imdb should start presenting awards based on the voting of participants. then we would see awards based on actual best performances and no more sympathy awards. no other movie comes close to the greatness of ""the two towers"" except of course ""the fellowship of the ring"" which itself was among the greatest of all time, but to me is only a sneak preview of what was to come.

1291;lukemusto;one of the most annoying complaints people had for the first film was about the ending. well, if any of them was a little more interested in it then they would have learned that it was, in fact, a trilogy. well, duh! the film picks up exactly where the film left off, with aragorn, legolas and gimli racing off to try and save their hobbit friends, merry and pippin from the fearsome uruk-hai who have them in their grasp, and are racing back to isengard with them for their master, the wizard saruman, who believes that the two hobbits have the one ring, which he hopes to get for himself. saruman betrayed everything he once fought for to join sauron, but even so, he is subtly trying to make sauron fall. our other hobbits, frodo and sam, are journeying ever closer to mordor with each new day, where their journey will end only once frodo has destroyed the one ring. but, quickly into the film, the pair capture the creature gollum, whom they take as their guide to get to mordor. is gollum trustworthy? who knows. in years gone past, he had possession of the one ring, and that indeed was the reason he was caught: he was trying to reclaim the ring for himself. will his evil alter-ego finally take control of his consciousness? or will he revert to his former self, smeagol? with so many people searching for the one ring, the chances aren't good for frodo ever making it to mordor. but if he doesn't, and the ring goes back to it's master, sauron, then all of middle-earth is doomed. this is part of the defining trilogy, the lord of the rings, and while all films in the trilogy were critically acclaimed, this received the most acclaim. personally, i think that the director, peter jackson, has saved the best till last, with the return of the king. but, all of the three films are as good as it gets, and this one is certainly no exception. the stunning special effects thanks to weta workshops render every orc, troll and other beast that appears in this movie utterly believable. the beautiful landscapes that are the backdrop of this film also give it its credibility. without doubt, if it had been shot in a studio, there would be no comparison between the two. new zealand will forever now be considered as middle-earth. in shortgroundbreaking cinematic history. it'll be awhile before something quite like this ever pops up again.;4 April 2008;9;['annoying', 'first', 'little', 'interested', 'gimli', 'fearsome', 'other', 'new', 'creature', 'trustworthy', 'evil', 'former', 'many', 'good', 'middle', 'defining', 'most', 'good', 'last', 'good', 'stunning', 'special', 'other', 'believable', 'beautiful', 'middle', 'cinematic'];0.1684548406139315
1292;iamjacksemail;the two towers presents a worthy successor to last years the fellowship of the ring. i eschew the word sequel as it is not truly a sequel but a second installment in a continuous story that has been divided into three parts. i am hesitant to pass complete judgment until all three films have been released as it will only be then that we will be able to see the story totally unfolded and then that we will be able to see exactly how peter jackson has constructed the story as a whole. after the first two parts, however, it seems as though the story is in good hands. this film presents a sound plot driven action epic. it is shorter on the character development than the first installment and throws a couple new characters at us with little time to get to know them, however, considering the circumstances in which the characters find themselves it does not feel like a disservice. the actors all do an admirable job inhabiting larger than life figures. viggo mortensen, elijah wood, and ian mckellan especially invest their characters, the three who stand above all others with a sense of the grandeur of the goodness that drives these men. special mention must also go to andy serkis for breathing remarkable life into the animated creation of gollum, perhaps the most interesting character in the entire film. the true star, however, is peter jackson who brings together a gigantic epic with a touch that is pitch perfect. he has done an impressive job of bringing to life a fantasy world and making it not only look beautiful and marvelous but feel real and inhabited. the massive battle at helm's deep is a remarkable feat of movie making and is without a doubt the greatest battle scene of its kind ever committed to film. what is perhaps most impressive about jackson's achievement, however, is the manner in which he moves effortlessly between the epic scope of the battle sequences and the more intimate journeys followed by the pairs of hobbits. jackson weaves together three story lines and brings us three hours closer to the conclusion and does it all in epic fashion.;19 December 2002;10;['worthy', 'last', 'second', 'continuous', 'hesitant', 'complete', 'able', 'able', 'first', 'good', 'sound', 'short', 'first', 'new', 'little', 'admirable', 'large', 'special', 'remarkable', 'interesting', 'entire', 'true', 'gigantic', 'perfect', 'impressive', 'beautiful', 'marvelous', 'real', 'inhabited', 'massive', 'deep', 'remarkable', 'great', 'impressive', 'epic', 'intimate', 'epic'];0.3798007981601731

1298;cruiseee;"i had been anticipating the release of 'the two towers' since watching 'the fellowship of the ring' and i have to say that it has exceeded all of my expectations! this film is absolutely brilliant! unlike the first part of lotr, this movie is a montage of stories - the ongoing journey of frodo & sam, the whereabouts of merry & pippin & the mission of aragorn, legolas & gimli. this very collection of stories is what makes this movie better than the first & keeps us on the edge of our seats throughout! the scenery is breathtaking (what a great ad for new zealand!), the casting is perfect, and the special effects are awesome. comedy relief in this movie came from, not merry & pippin, but gimli & gollum (probably not intentionally funny!) who comes across as both cute, yet frightening with his double personality. treebeard and the rest of the ents were unexpectedly cool to watch, the orcs and uruk-hai were disgusting and menacing and aragorn was just plain gorgeous (like i said, great casting! ;-d)! there are bits that seem slow and dull, but then you can't have non-stop action for 3 hours straight! even so, the pace of this second installment of lotr is a lot quicker and is action packed throughout. the whole movie contains so many 'best bits' that it's hard to just pick one! but i have to say the battle of helms deep is probably the best battle scene i had even seen on the big screen! if you haven't already seen 'the two towers' then i recommend you go see it now!!! this is a film not to be missed!

1300;BaronWincott;first of all i should say that i think that the fellowship of the ring is an amazing film and is quite easily one of the best films of the new decade. i also think that peter jackson is a great director, so my expectations for the two towers were huge. unfortunately the film failed to deliver in so many ways. the biggest flaw is the script, which is almost no better than the abysmal episode 2 script. the trilogy has gone from being darkly epic to fun for all the family. for example, the only purpose that gimli seems to play in the film is to add comic relief. this is okay for a while, but his one liners soon become extremely irritating and only truly funny to the most stupid of film-goers. aragorn has become very bland, but you can't blame this on mortenson who does the best he can with the throw away script that he is given. as well as the script a lot of the acting is shockingly bad. sean astin yet again proves himself to be painful to the eyes and ears. billy boyd and dominic monaghan are both awful (what idiot cast these films?). even ian mckellen is average. christopher lee could've been good, but jackson decides to only give him about three lines. bernard hill is far to young to play theoden (again, casting issues!). as for the special effects, it would seem that jackson has taken a leaf out of lucas's book and gone cgi crazy. the beauty of fellowship was that cgi was kept to a minimum, but at times the two towers is a horrible computer generated mess. why computer generate the forest of fangorn? i'm sure there must be at least one forest in new zealand to fit the bill. but, the ents destroying isengard really took the biscuit for badness. the whole scene just looks cheap and nasty. as for the battle of helm's deep, the special effects look really good, but the whole scene is ruined by awful script, dreadful pacing, rubbish fighting (did they actually train the actors how to use those swords?) and a lack of continuity. fans of the book are saying this film is bad because it strays so far from the original text. essentially i don't have a problem with changing things if it means the narrative will flow better. but it doesn't. the films pacing is abysmally bad. i realise this is jacksons 'intepretation' of the books, but it is a very average one at best. what really p***es me off is the way all the critics are patting jackson on the back and saying that the two towers is even better than fellowship. someone needs to stand up to this guy and tell him that he has done bad things. if jackson or any of the cast receive oscar nominations i will be absolutely disgusted. i could go on and on with this rant, but i won't bother because my review is only going to become lost among a sea of other reviews claiming the two towers is one of the greatest films ever.;20 December 2002;5;['amazing', 'good', 'new', 'great', 'huge', 'many', 'big', 'well', 'abysmal', 'epic', 'only', 'gimli', 'comic', 'okay', 'funny', 'stupid', 'aragorn', 'bland', 'good', 'bad', 'painful', 'dominic', 'awful', 'average', 'good', 'young', 'theoden', 'special', 'crazy', 'horrible', 'fangorn', 'sure', 'whole', 'cheap', 'nasty', 'deep', 'special', 'good', 'whole', 'awful', 'dreadful', 'rubbish', 'bad', 'original', 'bad', 'average', 'well', 'bad', 'disgusted', 'other', 'great'];-0.0444289837146979
1301;Gustavo_Assano;"i read many comments from so many people, and i realized that people are not happy with the changes that peter jackson put it in the adaptation. the ones that actually read the ""the two towers"" could realize that between the three volumes, the second one would be the most difficult to put in a regular time-line story. they are forgetting that one of the most important tools in the book is the narrator, which is not used in the film. it is necessary learn to respect the differences between the movie and the book, otherwise, ""the fellowship"" would be a completely failure as an adapted film, because they put too much from the second book in the first movie. in my opinion, the ones who loved the first film are going to love the second one, and the ones who hated ""the fellowship of the ring"" are going to hate ""the two towers"". the only real danger is the expectation for the third movie, because the ones who read ""the return of the king"" are expecting a lot of perfection, and peter jackson cannot miss on that one. i liked this film because i simply love the book. peter jackson is doing an extraordinary work. he knew the it would be risky to do it, and everybody knows, or should know, that it wouldn't be perfect. i think that the curriculum of all the ones involved in the ""lord of the rings"" project will be divided in before-l.r. and after-l.r.";31 December 2002;10;['many', 'many', 'happy', 'second', 'difficult', 'regular', 'important', 'necessary', 'second', 'first', 'first', 'second', 'only', 'real', 'third', 'extraordinary', 'risky', 'perfect'];0.2208333333333333
1302;PsychoDJ;the two towers, the sequel. not only a sequel, but part two of three. one has to remember that when they sit down with their popcorn. this movie is pretty fast paced, fast cut, and overall intense. the battle scenes are epic and the dialogue scenes have loads of information to digest. if you haven't read the books (like myself) but are familiar with the story, you're in luck. you'll learn something and possibly even walk away a bit confused. the most intriguing and the most emotional, for me, are the scenes involving gollum/smeagol (slinker & stinker). tears and laughter want to explode at the same time while gollum and smeagol have at it with one another. an internal turmoil that has been there for hundreds of years. and the cgi, well, nevermind that. you'll forget in an instant that gollum is computer generated. unlike dawby the house-elf. there are many scenes that were added in apart from the books, and many parts of the books that aren't in the movie. the transition from book to film is not always easy. suspense (aka hooks) is a key form to action flicks. it's necessary. internal and external struggle are also key parts in screenplays/movies. as is romance. (yawn) but, it has to be done. there were a few scenes where the cgi jumps out at you and you can tell that something is outta whack, but those brief instances are quickly forgotten or dismissed. there are many heavy action/battle scenes and several breathtaking topography shots. all of it is amazing. it's well acted, well conceived and overall a great movie! i say it like that so the purists will not turn beet red and explode with anger. yes, it's a fact, it is not 100% true to the book. but, the story is the same. i recommend seeing it at least twice. you'll get a lot more from it because the brain can only consume so much. once is definately not enough. besides, if you leave ttt without wanting to see it again or craving the next release, you're just not getting it...;2 January 2003;8;['fast', 'overall', 'intense', 'epic', 'familiar', 'confused', 'intriguing', 'emotional', 'same', 'internal', 'many', 'many', 'easy', 'key', 'necessary', 'internal', 'external', 'key', 'few', 'outta', 'brief', 'many', 'heavy', 'several', 'breathtaking', 'amazing', 'conceived', 'great', 'red', 'true', 'same', 'least', 'more', 'enough', 'next'];0.1593434343434343

1306;Chili_Padmez;*possible spoilers* the lord of the rings:the two towers (2002) you all know the cast! **** i might as well get it out of the way - i am a purist so this review will be pretty critical. i'll start with the negatives however, so that i can finish the review with the praise this film deserves. i will also skip most of the plot detail, because i am fairly sure that most of you know the storyline. at first viewing, the pacing of ttt might seem a little jerky, as we shift between the various plotlines. one of the problems noted almost instantly is a lack of scale, mainly in frodo and sam's story. the dead marshes appear too small so that mordor, instead of being a distant blur on the horizon is constantly close and threatening, the red light of mount doom always showing. you lose the epic scale from the book. this shows again when after helm's deep, gandalf and others ride to the top of the ridge. mordor is strangely close again. minor changes like sending the women and children to helm's deep will have repurcussions in rotk which i will not detail because they are spoilers. cutting off the end of the book is not a particularly good idea because rotk is going to be packed with action anyway. faramir's personality change was one of the things that got me most. instead of appering as a complete contrast to boromir, as a true numenorian who would not pick up the ring if it were lying by the wayside, he appears even darker than boromir. osgiliath, seemingly served no more purpose than to inform us that peter jackson can do amazing things with computers. well - we already knew that! osgiliath looked perfect. but taking frodo and sam there not only removed the sense of urgency, it diminished the scale even further. then there was the fact that frodo and sam are supposed to know absolutely nothing about the outside world. another point that was mentioned - in osgiliath, faramir screams, 'nazgul!'. no one knew who the creatures on wings were until right at the end. the black breath etc is referenced, but the characters do not know that the nazgul are what is spreading terror. the fell beasts were not threatening enough i felt. the wargs were absolutely pointless and showed the one weakness in the special effects. and aragorn's near death? death has been faked so many times in this trilogy that it is ridiculous and unbelievable when it occurs and is actually in the book. a few odd things - the ents' faces were very good, but the rest of them was not substantial enough and gandalf's reintroduction (to merry and pippin), i disliked intensely. also, rohan was not the flat green grasslands that it should have been. the only cast member i disliked? elrond who seems far too severe! as he is half man, he would not be so harsh on men. finally - the great eye of sauron. it just didn't fit. dare i say it, it reminded me of the power coupling in episode 2, just a different colour! enough of bad points, although there were more, i'll move on to the (many) positives! the cast - well what can i say? new and established members alike, i was wowed. sets - especially edoras. exactly as i had pictured them in my own imagination. fangorn was absolutely perfect, as was helm's deep. the black gate has got to be one of the most amazing things i have ever seen. special effects - especially gollum. i have never seen such a brilliant cg character. his split personality was perfect too. i felt sorry for him, i hated him, i loved him! the battle sequences were brilliant. helm's deep did not seem too long and who can forget the trail of the orc armies stretched across the plain? the destruction of isengard, the breaking of its dam, i was awed. the tiniest detail was observed. just look at the detail on the elven brooches, on armour, the pillars of meduseld. and a small thing that i would like to say is thank you to peter jackson and his team for their research on pronuciation. if i had had to sit through fotr with everyone saying sawron, i would not have gone to see ttt. and i really liked the foreshadowing of aragorn's death. it was incredibly moving, although it did not state that arwen loses her immortality and dies shortly afterwards, which would have been another moving touch. enough from me rambling on! i am not going to review fotr as well, because i have so much to say. from this review, you might deduce that i dislike ttt because i fear my complaints exceed my praises. i just tend to notice my dislikes more and voice them! it cannot be said i disliked this film - i've seen it 3 times and will certainly go again. i did however, prefer fotr. that is on of the reasons why i have given this film 4 stars and not the 5 i would give to fellowship.;4 May 2003;8;['possible', 'critical', 'most', 'sure', 'most', 'first', 'little', 'various', 'dead', 'small', 'distant', 'close', 'threatening', 'red', 'epic', 'deep', 'close', 'minor', 'deep', 'good', 'rotk', 'complete', 'true', 'dark', 'more', 'amazing', 'perfect', 'outside', 'black', 'pointless', 'special', 'many', 'ridiculous', 'unbelievable', 'few', 'odd', 'good', 'substantial', 'flat', 'green', 'only', 'severe', 'harsh', 'great', 'different', 'enough', 'bad', 'more', 'many', 'new', 'own', 'perfect', 'deep', 'black', 'amazing', 'special', 'brilliant', 'split', 'perfect', 'sorry', 'brilliant', 'long', 'awed', 'tiny', 'elven', 'small', 'moving', 'much'];0.1681864830571726

1309;king_in_crimson;i am from brazil, and should say that tolkien has become incredibly popular over here with the lotr movies. i have read the books, am currently reading silmarillion. the first movie, fellowship of the ring, simply blew me away. i had to watch it five times before i could believe it. and this movie (the two towers) has done it again. it owns by far the best epic battle sequences my eyes have witnessed. forget about braveheart, 13th warrior, gladiator or any other movie. this is prime. and this alone should captivate the audience. oh, but there is more. there is so much more. this movie should also amaze the audience with the creature named gollum. despite being cg, gollum will give you shivers and it will be hard (very hard) to believe that smeagol is not real. once again, forget about jar jar binks, dobby or any other cg character. this impersonation made by andy serkis is so perfect it will bring tears to your eyes. the complaints on this one are about the changes in the story (faramir being tempted by the ring, elves in helms deep and so on). to be honest, i did not think that those changes compromised the main plot. they were necessary as peter jackson (who dedicated many years of his life to this project) saw them. and who are we tolkien geeks to complain? the movie is absolutely wonderful. oh, i forgot to mention treebeard, gimli, the warg battle (absolutely thrilling), king theoden (an excellent performance by bernard hill) and, of course, the best opening sequence (dueling with apocalipse now) that i've known: gandalf vs. the balrog of morgoth.;1 January 2003;10;['popular', 'lotr', 'first', 'good', 'epic', 'other', 'prime', 'more', 'more', 'hard', 'real', 'other', 'perfect', 'deep', 'honest', 'main', 'necessary', 'many', 'wonderful', 'gimli', 'thrilling', 'excellent', 'good'];0.3822368421052631

1315;rob-quirk;this is the film adaptation of the second novel in the lord of the rings trilogy. it follows the surviving characters from 'the fellowship of the ring' as they continue their dangerous quest. the visual style, storyline, cinematography, acting and special effects all combine to create another milestone in filmmaking. i visited new zealand shortly before the filming started there for the trilogy, and i actually read the novel 'the two towers' while i was there. i could not help but project the landscapes i saw while i was there into to the book i was reading. seeing these same landscapes now immortalized in the film version is just amazing. some of the changes between the film and the book are quite drastic, but they should be accepted as they are two entirely different art forms that sometimes cannot be directly translated. the acting is very good, although there are many actors who have to share the three hour run time, so we only get a brief taste of many of them. the main characters are still engrossing, and the computer generated character 'gollum' is utterly convincing and realistic, almost heartbreaking at times. this film contains some of the most advanced special effects in any film, and part of their appeal is in the way they are used. instead of blatantly using flashy effects in every scene like other directors, jackson instead tries to use them discretely. during most of the battle scenes it seems entirely possible that we are witnessing thousands of extras, not computer generated effects, acting out the battle. although i slightly preferred the fellowship of the ring to this movie, it is still an epic and stirring film.;25 March 2003;9;['second', 'dangerous', 'visual', 'special', 'same', 'amazing', 'drastic', 'different', 'good', 'many', 'brief', 'many', 'main', 'convincing', 'realistic', 'heartbreaking', 'advanced', 'special', 'flashy', 'other', 'most', 'possible', 'epic', 'stirring'];0.1725056689342403
1316;Drknsinstr;i read lord of the rings: fellowship of the ring when i was 7 years old. i was a bright kid and though it was a long, laggy story, i was fascinated by everything especially gandalf, balrog and strider. it was this whole new world that opened up to me and i was completely swept away with it. three years later i read two towers and it captivated me even more. by this time i had been playing ad&d and fantasy was my best friend. it was an escapist idea and back then things weren't nearly as bad as they are now but i loved going on that adventure. i also found out that this story was a trilogy and so read return of the king shortly thereafter. in the 20+ years since i actually finsihed all 3 books for the first time, i have gone back and revisited middle earth 9 times. tolkien, though wordy, was an extremely brilliant writer. the research alone that he brough to these books is astounding. not to mention creating multitudes of different civilizations, cultures and languages. it is amazing when you sit back and look it from a scholarly point of view. now that film is where we find the epics of today, not so much in books, it was only a matter of time before some attempted to transform this story for the screen. ralph bakshi is often criticized harshly for his rendering of the masterpiece, but i think that's wrong. bakshi is a master animator and has made several amazing films. he wanted to make three 2 hour movies for each book, but lost studio backing when it was barely halfway finished. finally the technology and mentality has come to allow us a brilliant view of this incredible story. thankfully peter jackson was as enamored with these books as the regular fan and he has done the story justice. sure there are obvious changes to the story and some don't make sense but i'm tired of all these people moaning and griping over the tidbits. sit back, take a deep breath and just look at what jackson has accomplished. certainly i never anticipated this trilogy would be made in my lifetime. thank you to the cast, the crew and exspecially to peter jackson for his fascination with the story and desire to make it. i know that return of the king is going to be just amazing and profound as the first two and the battle of pelennor field and stand at morannon will be astounding.;10 February 2003;9;['old', 'bright', 'long', 'laggy', 'gandalf', 'whole', 'new', 'good', 'bad', 'first', 'middle', 'wordy', 'brilliant', 'astounding', 'different', 'amazing', 'scholarly', 'wrong', 'several', 'amazing', 'brilliant', 'incredible', 'enamored', 'regular', 'sure', 'obvious', 'tired', 'deep', 'amazing', 'profound', 'first', 'astounding'];0.2581369248035914
1317;AaronBilawchuk;the star wars universe is almost dead to me. george lucas has destroyed that world beyond repair now. prequels and 'special editions' have ruined what was once pure and good. what hope is there now? what do we have to fill the void? like a light in the darkness came peter jackson's inspiring and ambitious attempt to take the greatest piece of historical fiction of all time, and turn it into a trilogy of movies. fellowship of the ring has escalated to one of my favourite movies of all time in the span of a year. as two towers approached, many wondered if it was just a fluke, if jackson had used up all his fairy dust on the first one. then the movie came, and all fears subsided. mostly. i do love these movies, and fellowship and two towers are both outstanding films. what really got me, though, was that there were some glaring deviances from the books in the second movie. in fellowship, any changes that took place, or new scenes, could be explained as if they had happened during the course of their journey but hadn't been written in the books. in two towers, they made huge detours and character changes. there were several differences that, for some reason, really bothered me. luckily these aren't the majority. without spoiling the movie for anyone, i'll just touch on the changes that bothered me most. what happened to faramir? why had his personality and 'quality' changed so much from the books? the changes made in the films put the ring in impossible peril, from which the hobbits should not have escaped. maybe it makes for a more exciting sequence, but it doesn't make sense based on previously established facts about the enemy or the ring. other things that bothered me: wouldn't merry or pippin have referred to gandalf by name before he 'remembers' it later? if there are 2000 rohirrim, why do you only see about 50 when the party first encounters them? what did treebeard think sauruman was burning over there in isengard? i won't mention anything else at risk of giving away too much. the rest of the film more than makes up for these differences. the excellent battle at helms deep, the golden hall at edoras, wormtongue, and the dead marshes are all elements that show why this movie belongs next to its excellent predecessor. this movie is far and away better than most of the fare out there. a worthy addition to an excellent series.;13 March 2003;9;['dead', 'special', 'pure', 'good', 'inspiring', 'ambitious', 'great', 'historical', 'favourite', 'many', 'first', 'outstanding', 'second', 'new', 'huge', 'several', 'impossible', 'exciting', 'other', 'much', 'excellent', 'deep', 'golden', 'dead', 'excellent', 'well', 'most', 'worthy', 'excellent'];0.3019022644022644

1322;emsleaves;"i went to this movie in anticipation of an intense three hours. but i made a major miscalculation. i thought reading the book would make me enjoy the film more. it did not. i found myself annoyed by what jackson did to parts of the plot. when i saw the first movie, i was emotionally sucked in because i had a space of a year between the reading of the book and the viewing of the film. this time, i viewed things with an incredibly critical eye. i didn't like what he did to aragorn in part of the film, seeing it as unnecessary. i thought that arwen was portrayed in an inconsistent, unjust manner. i remembered what was in the book about the battle scenes at helm's deep. i was immediately annoyed by jackson's frills and the overly sentimental attachment to the roles certain characters played in the battle. i also did not quite like the way he cuts back and forth between the first half of the book and the second half. i like that he does, because it is necessary, but some skill is lacking in the methods used and the pacing, causing some parts of the film to drag and take on a dull quality. i don't like how the end of the battle at helm's deep is signified in the film, thinking there was better perspective and handling of it in the book. i did like the human element. i loved how gollum, merry, and pippin were turned into stars. merry and pippin were given especially delightful roles. i loved their interaction the the ents. i loved gollum's speeches. i love how the environmental themes tolkein would have loved brought out were treated. i loved the simplicity with which wormtongue's, theoden's, and eowyn's starting situation and relationships to each other were treated. i liked the use of monologues by certain characters. i disliked but found necessary the behind the scenes psychology of the battle of helm's deep. somehow, sentimentality got hold of it too much. but i greatly admired jackson's very human treatment of all the characters in that situation, and the way he effectively shows the attitudes of those in peril. i admired his attempt to socially and psychologically comment on what was going on. it made a lot of sense even if i didn't find all of it artistically pleasing enough. i thought some of the great strengths of the film were in the acting, monologues, and highlighting of merry and pippin and gollum. i loved how frodo is shown in relationship to gollum and the shots used to clearly, eeerily, and humanly compare the two. the clear storytelling focus really worked for me. and as annoyed as some people are by the ending, i found it well done and a great way to wrap up the movie, make up for flaws, and really make you want to see number three. a major flaw of this movie is the forced and ineffective music, obviously intended to get you. but it didn't get me this time. it was as bad as the watered down root beer i was drinking. another annoyance is gollum's voice. i didn't think it was quite right. i have a reservation about the title. ""the two towers"" as a title does not hold up well thematically for the film because of the information the viewer is not given. it is better justified in the book, though still just barely. this has nothing to do with politics, but the fact that i feel it is too incompletely justified in the film and the book itself could have had a better title. i have to say this, though. the title gives nothing away. overall, by the end, this film is a lot of fun and thought-provoking, despite my reservations. it was definitely fun for me to think about and discuss with others. i give jackson points for pulling off anything having to do with these long novels as well as he did.";20 March 2003;8;['intense', 'major', 'annoyed', 'first', 'critical', 'unnecessary', 'inconsistent', 'unjust', 'deep', 'sentimental', 'certain', 'first', 'second', 'necessary', 'dull', 'well', 'human', 'delightful', 'environmental', 'other', 'certain', 'necessary', 'deep', 'human', 'pleasing', 'great', 'clear', 'storytelling', 'annoyed', 'great', 'major', 'forced', 'ineffective', 'bad', 'right', 'well', 'provoking', 'fun', 'long'];0.0540873015873015
1323;faith_meredith;"i am an immense tolkien fan, but rather enjoyed mr. jackson's last installment of the trilogy despite of this, and so was looking forward tremendously to this movie. i knew that i would come out of the theater upset, but didn't foresee how just how upset i would be! it's not just that they didn't stick close to the book. making art from someone else's art is a tricky feat, and i completely understand that to make it a true work of art, the director has to make the piece his, and making the piece his includes injecting his own experiences and interpretations to the piece. it's just that mr. jackson had some pretty whacked out interpretations! for example, faramir. in the books, faramir is supposed to be boromir's redemption - here he is just a jerk. this really ticked me off. and what was up with taking frodo to gondor? (don't even get me started on arwen!) and, as someone has already said, the switches between scenes were sort of distracting. they lent to a heavily sort of ""soap opera"" feel rather than the epic feel that the books had - and when it comes down to it, that's the major problem of this movie. it just didn't have the right feel. i would have enjoyed it enough as a simple fantasy movie if i hadn't already have read the books and reveled in the brilliance of them. i mean, like i said, it's not that mr. jackson made changes. but i just didn't get the feeling that mr. jackson understood in the slightest sense what the actual point of the books is. he messed around with the essence of the story, and that was what really annoyed me. that mr. jackson just doesn't get the books is evident in two different ways. one is the subtle shifting of the focus of the books from the melancholy of a dying way of life - the elves having to leave middle earth, the passing of the age - to a sort of celebration of the forging of the way of man. the second, and most grieving, is that i can't see, as evidenced from this movie, that he really gets the core of the good/evil conflict. i'm not doing a very good job of expressing myself. simply put, i guess i'm saying that i thought that the movie could have done with a little more focus on frodo and his inner battle than on aragorn and his love troubles. :) that said, i thought that the scenery was gorgeous and there were several moments that i did enjoy - for some strange reason, the moments i found myself liking most were those in which aragorn and legolas would start speaking elvish to each other. i'm not exactly sure why, but i thought that was extremely cool. gollum was at the same time freaky and cool and one of the things that i thought the movie did an excellent job in portraying. when i left the theater, i was convinced that i never wanted to even hear the third movie mentioned, much less ever darken the door of a theater to see it play. i'm not sure how i feel now - i'll probably still go, but i'll just go to see a fantasy movie that has some relation to the lord of the rings. i won't go to see tolkien, because this movie proved that that was an idealistic expectation.";30 March 2003;4;['immense', 'last', 'upset', 'upset', 'tricky', 'true', 'own', 'epic', 'major', 'right', 'simple', 'slight', 'actual', 'evident', 'different', 'subtle', 'middle', 'second', 'grieving', 'good', 'evil', 'good', 'little', 'more', 'inner', 'gorgeous', 'several', 'strange', 'other', 'sure', 'cool', 'same', 'cool', 'excellent', 'third', 'sure', 'idealistic'];0.1589285714285714
1324;SidHudgens;*spoilers herein* there seems to be a fundamental division between those who see this film. everyone either says decisively that they much preferred the previous one or they much preferred this one. personally, i preferred this one. the ending is much better than film one, and the new characters (theoden, eowyn, eomer, gollum, treebeard, faramir and wormtongue) make it much more interesting. however, i'm not sure all the changes to the book worked. let's start with the good changes. i think having wormtongue banish eomer at the start, only for him to return with gandalf to save the day at the battle of helm's deep was a very good idea, and i think it makes him a more memorable character for those who haven't read the book (i've read it twice by the way). the platoon of elves arriving at helm's deep, and the death of haldir was also a good idea, as i think people might be disappointed if haldir had just faded after the first film, as he did in the books. faramir taking frodo and sam to osgiliath wasn't a particularly good idea, but i can understand why peter jackson did it. at this point, the battle of helm's deep was at its climax and the ents were wrecking isengard. i think jackson wanted to put in a third action sequence (ie. the ringwraith attack) as if it had just shown frodo and sam walking along with gollum it would have looked pretty silly. onto the bad changes now. just what was the warg attack all about? and even worse, aragorn falling off the cliff? that scene belongs in monty python, not lord of the rings. people have said that aragorn's fall was so that he could see the uruk-hai army, but surely theoden could just have sent a scout or something? and of course, the most discussed flaw in the film itself: legolas using the shield as a skateboard. everyone mentions this, and no wonder. it completely undermines the serious implications of the battle, and simply isn't funny. i also felt that the dialogue in this film wasn't quite as good as in fellowship. gimli boasting about his running ability was mildly amusing, but it was out of place. however, theoden's poem (where is the horse and the rider/ where is the horn that was blowing...) worked very well, and to be honest i quite liked sam's speech at the end. generally, the acting was perfectly fine, particularly from ian mckellen, viggo mortensen, elijah wood, sean astin, brad dourif, and bernard hill. jackson's inventiveness with the camera is inspired and i know he will make a fantastic film out of the return of the king. 9/10;16 April 2003;9;['fundamental', 'previous', 'well', 'new', 'interesting', 'sure', 'good', 'wormtongue', 'good', 'memorable', 'deep', 'good', 'first', 'good', 'third', 'silly', 'bad', 'bad', 'monty', 'theoden', 'serious', 'funny', 'good', 'gimli', 'amusing', 'honest', 'fine', 'brad', 'fantastic'];0.2387741046831956

1326;prashanthology;peter jackson delivers again. in style. the lord of the rings : the towers, is the next installment, or rather the continuation of the fellowship of the ring. the story continues from the great river, where frodo and sam part away from the rest of the fellowship and embark on a journey never to be forgotten: that of destroying the one ring, by taking it deep inside mordor, into mount doom. elijah wood and sean astin once again steal the show with supreme performances of frodo baggins and samwise gamgee respectively, while the return of gandalf is welcomed appreciatively. the story takes on two difference courses, both of which are equally vital and are given almost the equal amount of time throughout the movie. peter jackson has not disappointed one bit with the visuals. the screenplay is simply magnificent and war sequence of helms deep will always be one of my favorite scenes in the lord of the rings. faith, trust, loyalty and friendship is shown throughout the movie, as in the epic book of j.r.r. tolkein. the music is wonderful, quite similar to its previous installment, but nevertheless a hundred percent effective. the fall of isengard is shown in a splendid way and jackson shows it takes more than mere directing to achieve it. a great effort taken by the entire crew for the movie and full appreciation deserved. quite a few would be of the opinion that the two towers is relatively disappointing with respect to the other two movies. i beg to disagree. the movie has been fantastically captured, and pays tribute to the book perfectly. overall, it is a captivating movie, taking the story to its final part, the epic ending of the lord of the rings. a must watch for any movie fan, let alone an the lord of the rings fanatic. it is a visual treat, great story telling and great performances. a 10 / 10.;27 November 2010;10;['next', 'great', 'supreme', 'samwise', 'vital', 'equal', 'magnificent', 'favorite', 'epic', 'wonderful', 'similar', 'previous', 'effective', 'splendid', 'more', 'mere', 'great', 'entire', 'full', 'few', 'disappointing', 'other', 'final', 'epic', 'fanatic', 'visual', 'great', 'great'];0.2458333333333333

1329;Tony_Almeida;after director peter jackson's exciting and emotionally affecting first chapter in the lord of the rings trilogy you would think he could do no wrong. while the two towers continues to up the stakes in terms of action and pure escapism it does not quite live up the sheer perfection of fellowship of the ring. ttt starts exactly where fellowship left off. frodo and sam continue on their quest to mordor while aragorn, legolas and gimli are on the trail of the orcs who took merry and pippin. the story follows three distinct threads (that of frodo and sam, aragorn, legolas and gimli and merry and pippin), unlike fotr, which was quite linear in its storytelling. the introduction of new characters such as gollum (a work of technical genius), eowyn (played with perfect restraint by miranda otto), faramir (david wenham) and grima wormtongue helps to keep the story interesting. though much complaint has been aimed at faramir's out of character behaviour, in regards to the source material, and other deterrence's from the book. i wholeheartedly understand why the writers took these minor liberties with the direction that was taken with his character, as it no doubt works better for the film. the majority of ttt basically foreshadows what is to come in return of the king and also sets up the most exciting aspect of this movie, the battle of helm's deep. the battle is technically impressive, with ingenious cinematography from andrew lesnie, brilliant choreography of fight scenes and a perfect score from howard shore to compliment the action and heighten the tension. i do have my complaints though. the fact this is the bridging chapter is noticeable and while some of the film's weaknesses can be attributed to this, no good reason can be given for the extremely slow pacing of the first 90 minutes. this is primarily due to some extremely annoying editing and writing choices that detract from the overall movie. arwen's scenes and the unneeded, and somewhat underwhelming, warg rider battle simply don't add anything worthwhile to the story. several scenes that can now be seen on ttt extended edition would have been better suited to the theatrical cut. had the omission of arwen's plot been considered, allowing for the insertion of some truly satisfying material (such as aragorn's revelation to eowyn that he is 87 years old and the entwash scene), the two towers, in my eyes, would have been the perfect bridging chapter between fotr and rotk. as it stands a good 30 minutes could have been edited out of the theatrical version and this movie would surely be more deserving of the praise it receives. the two towers is a slightly disappointing middle chapter to what is becoming one of the greatest movie series ever made. quality is one thing this series will be associated with and ttt continues this trend with its meticulous attention to detail, brilliant special effects and impressive acting. 8 out of 10 ee - 9 out of 10;28 November 2003;8;['exciting', 'first', 'pure', 'sheer', 'gimli', 'distinct', 'gimli', 'linear', 'new', 'such', 'technical', 'perfect', 'interesting', 'much', 'other', 'minor', 'exciting', 'deep', 'impressive', 'ingenious', 'brilliant', 'perfect', 'noticeable', 'good', 'slow', 'first', 'due', 'annoying', 'overall', 'unneeded', 'underwhelming', 'worthwhile', 'several', 'extended', 'theatrical', 'such', 'old', 'perfect', 'rotk', 'good', 'theatrical', 'deserving', 'disappointing', 'middle', 'great', 'meticulous', 'brilliant', 'special', 'impressive'];0.28994338994339
1330;NicNYC;ok. lord of the rings is an amazing book. i agree. the story is incredibly well told. what it just seems to me is that everyone wants to love this movie so much. everyone wants it to be the best movie they have ever seen and therefore they vote it to that position. has anyone really sat down and looked at the cinematography? what is so amazing? whwat is so groundbreaking? it tells a decent story...based on a story that is already great. i mean king arthur was terrible and that is a great story so i guess there is something to be said for lotr. bur really. i mean the matrix (original) brought so much more to film than lotr will ever bring. the wachoski's bring amazing cinematography with great writing and a great story that is not already someone else's. not to say there is anything wrong with remaking a great story into a movie, just that it doesn't bring anything new to the table. i agree that these films are good. i enjoyed them. however, that doesn't mean that they are great cinema. they are not. they are great entertainment. period. for this movie to be rated so highly on imdb just shows that this forum is not for people who really pushing the bounds of film making but only for those who like what is considered to be a blockbuster. the matrix was not a blockbuster, although it was rated highly, but many other films are not. if the harry potter movies were made 30 years after they were then i feel that they would get this same reaction. i mean really think about that. if these films were made right after the books had come out and when they were just popular, would the movies have been as successful? no. they wouldn't have been. they would have been regarded the same way hp is. they would not have been given the oscars etc. it just makes me sad that people don't look at the art of cinematography in the movies anymore. many writers have written great stories that can be told in many mediums, but i feel that something extra needs to be added other than just tons of special computer battle scenes to make a movie great. this movie is not great. it is far from it. it is a mediocre telling of a great story, and although the battle scenes are phat as hell, the rest of the movie, including orlando bloom's atrocious acting are a disgrace to it. an 8.8 is much to overrated for this pop-culture infested excuse for cinema.;8 March 2005;1;['amazing', 'good', 'amazing', 'groundbreaking', 'decent', 'great', 'terrible', 'great', 'original', 'more', 'amazing', 'great', 'great', 'wrong', 'great', 'new', 'good', 'great', 'great', 'many', 'other', 'harry', 'same', 'right', 'popular', 'successful', 'same', 'sad', 'many', 'great', 'many', 'extra', 'other', 'special', 'great', 'great', 'mediocre', 'great', 'atrocious', 'much', 'pop'];0.3531812485759855
1331;aah35;"clearly, the lord of the rings fanatics are taking over imdb. they have managed to voted ""the two towers"" into the number 4 spot on the all-time list. ridiculous. certainly, ""two towers"" is a good movie, but it has several problems that prevent it from attaining the greatness of its predecessor, ""fellowship of the ring"". first, all those useless, lingering shots of liv tyler make me conclude that peter jackson, as great a job as he has done on the series, could not resist the michael bay-like tendency to use his film as a platform for admiring the goddess-like qualities of some members of the fairer sex. second, the slow-motion, close-up shots of the women and children cowering in the shelter of helms' deep, anticipating a gory fate. i certainly understand their fear, but all of these sequences seem manipulative and heavy handed. frankly, i was plenty worried about the fates of the defenders without having to be reminded (repeatedly) by mr. jackson that there were mothers and children present, too. finally, in ""fellowship"", mr. jackson had a little less confidence in the patience of his audience, and he was therefore much more economical in his translation of tolkien's narrative onto the screen. in ""two towers"", he throws economy out the window, and the film suffers as a result. when your film exceeds three hours and you find yourself cutting in numerous slow-motion sequences, a little self-examination is in order. i am not calling for elimination of crucial elements of tolkien's story, but successful adaptation from page to screen requires some clever narrative devices to truncate long passages into digestible visual material. in this regard, ""two towers"" is far inferior to ""fellowship"". i hope that jackson, in ""return of the king"", shows more self-control. still, mr. jackson is on the verge of one of the most extraordinary achievements in film history. he deserves all of his success.";19 December 2003;6;['ridiculous', 'good', 'several', 'useless', 'great', 'like', 'like', 'fair', 'slow', 'close', 'gory', 'manipulative', 'heavy', 'worried', 'present', 'little', 'less', 'economical', 'numerous', 'slow', 'little', 'crucial', 'successful', 'clever', 'narrative', 'long', 'digestible', 'visual', 'inferior', 'more', 'extraordinary'];0.0663043478260869

1337;tyler-bruce23;"the opening scene of the two towers provides an outstanding, yet very brief, taste of action, cinematography, and special effects, only to be matched (and far surpassed) in the final hour of the film. the stunning events of the third hour of the two towers are undoubtedly the centerpiece of the film, and while the first two hours serve finely as story development, they primarily build anticipation for the final hour, which mostly depicts the battle of helm's deep. more than anything else, the first two hours merely tease and torment the patient audience. it's a shame that such a gap has to exist between the first minute and the final hour, but i take no reservations in saying that despite how you feel about the first two hours of the film, the final hour will make the wait entirely worth its while. as stated, the road to the battle of helm's deep can be enormously long and painful for any viewer aware of what breathtaking scenes await towards the end of the film. perhaps the two towers' biggest fault is in its own accomplishments; the first two thirds of the film are well shot, well paced, and they necessarily and adequately progress the storyline, but when compared to the spectacular final hour, the first two hours seem uneventful and insignificant. however, to be fair, i feel that it's simply impossible to create two hours of film that could appropriately lead into the battle of helm's deep. it's difficult to comprehend how such scenes came to exist in the rather short amount of time peter jackson has had to create six hours (so far) of finished film. the battle of helm's deep is simply unreal; it's unlike any event that has come to pass since fantasy films gained, and regained, popularity. as assumed, the two towers begins where the fellowship of the ring ended. the majority of the film follows four separate groups and their story lines: frodo and sam; aragorn and legolas, merry and pippin, and saruman and his army. the performances live well up to the standards of the first film, with a particularly notable performance from viggo mortensen as aragorn, whose role is significantly larger in the two towers. aragorn satisfies a thirst for someone to root for, a thirst that was left partly unquenched in fellowship. it's much easier to root for aragorn than it is for frodo; aragorn has many more qualities of a leading man, a soldier, and a hero. more than once did the audience, filled mostly with academy voters, applaud the heroics of aragorn. gollum also shines in a much-welcomed large role, due to extremely realistic computer animation, and a fine performance from andy serkis, upon which the animation was modeled. in fellowship, it was appropriate to consider gollum one of the many great 'features' of the film. however, here he is more of a leading character and a 'star,' and his convincing dual-personality, stabbing voice, and well-choreographed body movements make him consistently eye-grabbing and the center of focus of nearly every scene in which he appears.";31 January 2012;9;['outstanding', 'brief', 'special', 'final', 'stunning', 'third', 'first', 'final', 'deep', 'more', 'first', 'patient', 'first', 'final', 'first', 'final', 'worth', 'long', 'painful', 'aware', 'big', 'own', 'first', 'spectacular', 'final', 'first', 'uneventful', 'insignificant', 'fair', 'impossible', 'deep', 'difficult', 'such', 'short', 'finished', 'unreal', 'separate', 'aragorn', 'first', 'notable', 'large', 'aragorn', 'unquenched', 'easy', 'aragorn', 'many', 'more', 'more', 'large', 'realistic', 'fine', 'appropriate', 'many', 'great', 'more', 'convincing', 'dual'];0.225776397515528

1350;Big G-2;first off, let me say that i'm not a die-hard lotr person. i've never read tolkein's books and basically thought that the first feature was at best ok. so this review will be from a movie fan's point of view rather than a hard-core tolkein fan. frankly, i did find this to be a little more involving than 'fellowship'. it had some truly wonderful visuals, (it should win the oscars for those) and though i'm not a fan of cgi, gollum is one of the better digital creatures to come out of the movies. still, i did have some problems with the picture. first off, many have said that the characters are all well developed. well, i didn't see it that way. for me, any character development really took a back seat to the special effects. sometimes that's not a bad thing, if handled correctly. (ray harryhausen's movies are a good example of that). but when people start saying that these guys should be nominated for academy awards, oh come on now! frankly, the most interesting character by far was gollum and he was a digital creation! secondly, like the first feature, 'towers' has it's moments where it really drags, especially during the middle. peter jackson, i think, kept cutting in an out of the many different stories this movie had and as a result some of the focus was lost. the final battle scene was spectacular, but then again, jackson makes the cardinal sin of running it too long, and as result a lot of the intensity is gone. one of the professional reviewers said that not since akira kurosawa, have we seen any battle of this magnitude. well, speaking for myself, this battle comes no where near kurosawa's fighting scenes. kurosawa's battle scenes were always wonderfully intense from beginning to end. (and he didn't need digital fighting characters). if i were rating this movie film solely on its special effects, i'd give it 3 stars. but when the whole movie is added in, i'd have to give it 2 stars. just like the first feature, 'towers' is an ok movie, but because of the character gollum, i found it a little bit more entertaining. anyway that's my take on this film. it's funny how people view things differently. many hard-core fans view these two lord of the rings features as the greatest all-time cinematic masterpieces in film history, (which is perfectly fine) while i myself only found them mildly entertaining.;21 December 2002;4;['die', 'hard', 'first', 'good', 'hard', 'tolkein', 'little', 'wonderful', 'well', 'digital', 'many', 'back', 'special', 'bad', 'good', 'interesting', 'digital', 'first', 'many', 'different', 'final', 'spectacular', 'cardinal', 'professional', 'intense', 'digital', 'special', 'whole', 'first', 'ok', 'little', 'entertaining', 'funny', 'many', 'hard', 'great', 'cinematic', 'fine', 'entertaining'];0.2280272108843537

(this list could have been longer, but the extended dvd has righted many wrongs.) however, with 'two towers', the omissions and departures took us too far from the original, something that jackson was aware of when he said that this movie was the one most different to the books. i can forgive jackson for pumping up the sexual tension wholly absent in tolkien's rather staid love triangle. i can't forgive him for doing it at the expense of playing fast and loose with arwen's immortality and elrond's affability. aragorn's trip over the cliff and subsequent 'resurrection' was totally unnecessary - and too much like gandalf's moria dive - especially since we hadn't yet seen aragorn's dramatic door-opening scene from the trailer. merry and pippin spent way too much of the film perched on treebeard's shoulders - treebeard has a house, remember, and the ent draught the hobbits drink there becomes somewhat important by the time of the scouring of the shire. also, treebeard should have known what was going on in his forest, rather than being 'surprised' into battle by a rare clever moment on pippin's part (and the other ents came out of the forest remarkably quickly, didn't they?) faramir turned out to be too much like his brother. in fact, the whole capture of frodo and sam and their being taken to osgiliath was too drawn out (unnecessary padding in a three hour movie?) i also felt he gave away too much of the winged nazgul; in tolkien's book, they are a distant dread not directly encountered until the battle of gondor. having said all that, i feel that the general movie-going public will probably enjoy jackson's version of 'two towers' even more than 'fellowship of the ring' which was perceived as a bit slow. i, too, was stunned by the brilliantly conceived opening of 'two towers'. and there were many moments of further brilliance throughout: the tension-building editing during the great chase (although i would have liked to have seen merry and pippin's reaction to seeing gandalf - on the extended dvd perhaps?); the opening of the black gate; legolas mounting gimli's horse mid-charge; the whole of the helm's deep battle scene, especially theoden's last charge and jackson's own spear-hurling cameo (although i would have liked to have seen more of legolas' and gimli's competition - on the extended dvd?); the oliphaunts; and the highlight of the entire movie: the ents destruction of isengard. all in all, that is enough for me to give the movie a 9 out of 10 rating despite all my previous negativity. furthermore, 'return of the king' will be a better movie than it might have been, given what remains of tolkien's second book left for the next movie. so in the end, with a 10 out of 10 'fellowship of the ring' and (i'll go out on a limb here) a 10 out of 10 'return of the king', i'm sure die-hard fans will well and truly forgive peter jackson his flights of fancy in 'two towers'.";31 December 2002;9;['many', 'impossible', 'die', 'hard', 'general', 'die', 'hard', 'many', 'occasional', 'annoying', 'total', 'responsible', 'responsible', 'evil', 'few', 'long', 'extended', 'many', 'original', 'aware', 'different', 'sexual', 'absent', 'staid', 'loose', 'subsequent', 'unnecessary', 'dramatic', 'much', 'important', 'surprised', 'rare', 'clever', 'other', 'much', 'whole', 'unnecessary', 'much', 'winged', 'distant', 'general', 'more', 'slow', 'many', 'further', 'great', 'extended', 'black', 'deep', 'last', 'own', 'more', 'extended', 'entire', 'enough', 'previous', 'well', 'second', 'next', 'sure', 'die', 'hard'];0.0426282051282051

1355;Ophelia-23;"in the fellowship of the ring, frodo falls down over and over again in the face of overwhelming danger. after all, he is inexperienced against the perils outside the shire. he falls down with his friends running from farmer maggot, onto buckleberry ferry after being chased by a ringwraith, in the prancing pony, while being attacked by the ringwraiths on weathertop, on the snowy mountain, in the mines of moria vs. the cave troll, after running from boromir when he takes off the ring. but he always gets up again and perseveres, sometimes on his own sometimes with the help of others in the fellowship. this is an important theme again in the two towers. several story lines revolve and evolve simultaneously in a suspenseful tapestry of hope, courage, and strength confronting and prevailing over the two towers of evil: in isengard (saruman) and mordor (sauron). frodo, sam, and gollum; merry, pippin, and treebeard; aragorn, legolas, gimli, gandalph and king theoden in rohan; our heroes are bombarded with what appear to be impossible obstacles. although the bonds of friendships are threatened and tested, hope ultimately overcomes despair, and our heroes continue on their journeys. the complexity of frodo's and sam's friendship becomes even more interesting with the arrival of gollum. frodo falls again, this time into the marshes, and although we expect sam to pull him out, (similar to when frodo saved sam from drowning in the fellowship of the ring), gollum surprisingly rescues him. are gollum's motives strictly driven by greed for the ring, or does he truly become attached in other ways to his new master? aragorn is frustrated against overwhelming odds at helm's deep, when he helps king theoden against hordes of urukhai orcs. aragon and legolas even argue about whether they should involve themselves in what appears to be an impossible fight, although legolas comes around and admits he should not have given in to despair. ultimately, the two towers of evil are no match for the towers of good that develop amongst our protagonists. hope is never lost and should never be relinquished to despair, no matter what the adversary. ironically, i was re-reading the book of the two towers at a dental visit recently. the young dentist from australia was not familiar with the tolkien books and how long ago they were written. he pointed out the irony of the title in the wake of 9/11/01. there are themes in this excellent movie that are relevant to our present world. the movie makes me want to see more, and i am counting the days until return of the king.

1357;Pete-195;"i saw lotr: ttt just last week and found it an excellent movie. better than the first as the story gets going from the first frame and doesn't bother (much) with reintroducing the story. it is just assumed that you saw the previous film and are fully familiar with it all. maybe a bit arrogant, but then again they are absolutely right! if you haven't seen the first movie (or did and didn't like it, then shame on you!), don't bother with the 2nd one. the good thing about all this is that the movie gets right to the point and doesn't waste any second. it just plunges the audience right back in the experience they had in the first movie and even tops it. i am (unfortunately) used to people chatting etc during the movie, because the movie is taking to long, is boring, etc. well, that did not happen this time. the theatre was completely packed and right up to the last minute everybody was totally caught up in it. and that is saying something for a movie that is running up to 3 hours. anyway, back to what it is all about: the movie. the story of the original book is followed rather closely. yes, as several people have already commented, there are several differences as compared to the book, but in all the thread of the book is left intact. the story doesn't lose any pace and keeps you glued to the screen right up to the end. key scenes are well thought of (gollum's inner struggle as a key part in the book (in my opinion) is very well translated to the screen) and explain as well as keep the audience interested'. but.... one of the best performances of the movie, at least for me, was given by gollum. his inner struggle between doing ""the right thing"" and following his desire for the ring are very well portrayed (as already mentioned above). and yet..... frodo is going to a similar struggle and doesn't pull it off as convincingly as does gollum. so, is a cgi-character beating a human in acting ? gollum, for me, gives a much more convincing picture of the struggle within, than does frodo, who just rolls his eyes and looks completely out of is. is computer science already so far that it can beat a human performance or is it just happenstance ?";1 January 2003;8;['last', 'excellent', 'well', 'first', 'first', 'much', 'previous', 'familiar', 'arrogant', 'right', 'first', 'good', 'right', 'second', 'first', 'boring', 'last', 'original', 'several', 'several', 'intact', 'key', 'inner', 'key', 'interested', 'good', 'least', 'inner', 'right', 'portrayed', 'similar', 'convincing', 'human'];0.1532312925170068

1361;gibscreen2;first let me just compliment everyone involved in the production of this movie for their ambition. this was a monumental project, and they get a lot of things right, unlike any other. but the things they get wrong are really wrong. most of the blame falls on the director peter jackson. yes, he did play a huge part in bringing this thing together, and his organizational skills amazing, but he lacks skill as a storyteller, and his roots as the director of the frighteners and braindead really show through. although the images put on the screen are downright amazing, with the exception of portions of the battle of helm's deep, i don't think i was ever really engaged during this movie (or fellowship of the ring for that matter) with any of the characters or the story. and this is a tough feat considering that the characters and story are very well drawn. but there's nothing really connecting the audience with the movie. it's like looking at a picture taken of the mona lisa. although you see everything that is on the painting, there's just something missing when compared to looking at the real thing. plus, in my opinion, there were some huge fumbles in my opinion. gollum got downright irritating at the end of the movie. ok, we get it, he's having a moral crisis. we got it the first three times you told us. say it and move on. and the one part they got right--the battle of helm's deep--was almost completely destroyed when they cut away to merry and pippin yackin with treebeard. couldn't they have done this a little earlier? and then intercut helm's deep with the tree battle. that's just plain filmmaking 101. when you're at the end (even in a movie without an end) you shouldn't be setting things up for the end. that's what the prior 2 hours was for. there's a lot more nitpicking i can do. and i know a lot of people will violently disagree with me. but just wait a few years. or even for the second viewing. i think this is one of those movies where upon first seeing it, it seems really good, but the more you think about it, the more flaws just start jumping out at you.;22 December 2002;1;['monumental', 'other', 'wrong', 'wrong', 'most', 'huge', 'organizational', 'amazing', 'amazing', 'deep', 'tough', 'real', 'huge', 'moral', 'first', 'right', 'deep', 'little', 'deep', 'prior', 'more', 'few', 'second', 'good'];0.1206821617535903

'cause they're so fast... yeah, sure! the helm's deep fighting was good, but what on earth was haldir doing there? just included to have another hero dying, i suppose. and the counting thing between legolas and gimli is included and then again not really, because it ends just after it began. no caves to discover for gimli either. i know of course that you can't include everything in one movie, but there was some 'additional' crap in ""the two towers"" (meaning that it was not in the book) that could have been left out and a lot of original scenes that were left out. don't get me wrong: ""the two towers"" was a great movie. but it's not as good as ""the fellowship"". i wish i could see the original version, before peter jackson changed it...";22 December 2002;3;['amazing', 'huge', 'gimli', 'whole', 'serious', 'bad', 'first', 'great', 'superb', 'whole', 'splendid', 'wrong', 'aragorn', 'stupid', 'nice', 'bad', 'good', 'whole', 'annoying', 'same', 'afraid', 'stupid', 'great', 'long', 'deep', 'good', 'gimli', 'gimli', 'additional', 'original', 'wrong', 'great', 'good', 'original'];0.1293103448275862

(even if it is not from the book) otherwise, the movie is a mess. peter jackson obviously could not handle the diverging plot lines. (for example, merry and pippin are stuck on treebeard's shoulder while about a week of movie time goes by - quite a long hike through the forest!) the transitions between plots are interrupting, and jumble the flow of the story. i can't imagine trying to make sense of what everyone was doing if i had not previously read the books. the characters in the movie are completely boring, even the new ones. now that the heroes have been introduced, it appears that the director has lost any energy to develop them further. gimli becomes the comic stump (and if i really want a dose of midget humor, i'll go to a frat party or watch jackass). arwen's weepy narcissism goes out of control. way too much time is given to her and the other elvish leaders to act as if they are speaking profoundly and weep prettily in screen closeups. legolas is now the stunt man, with very little character left to express. faramir is weak (should have followed the book, mr. jackson). eowynn will hopefully get more attention in the last movie, but she was well-done in the movie, as were wormtongue and eomer. gollum is also fairly amusing, even if he must be turned into a schizo-comic hamlet. the fact that the movie ended on a somewhat upbeat note (victory of helm's deep) instead of the darker, almost hopeless note of the book (frodo taken captive by orcs after shelob), is a critical flaw. precisely what makes one so eager to read on in tolkien is the situation of near despair, which makes the reversals of fortune, or eucatastrophe, so welcome. maybe it's true that the middle book is the hardest one to pull off, but that's no excuse for making a poor movie. i had hoped that peter jackson could rise to the occasion. instead he has made a mush of weak emotions, contrived nobility, and lots of slimy orcs. i don't see how a fan of tolkien can watch the movie and not feel at least a bit cheated, and a bit insulted. this movie is neither beautiful nor interesting, in the artistic sense; it is flashy sensory entertainment produced for universal ease of consumption. if you like the tolkien-flavored yogurt, well then, enjoy.";22 December 2002;2;['amazing', 'official', 'average', 'excellent', 'satisfied', 'impressed', 'particular', 'long', 'boring', 'new', 'gimli', 'comic', 'frat', 'weepy', 'much', 'other', 'elvish', 'little', 'weak', 'more', 'last', 'wormtongue', 'amusing', 'comic', 'upbeat', 'deep', 'hopeless', 'captive', 'critical', 'eager', 'near', 'welcome', 'true', 'middle', 'hard', 'poor', 'weak', 'slimy', 'least', 'beautiful', 'interesting', 'artistic', 'flashy', 'sensory', 'universal'];0.1327938475665748
1366;yulek;"before you jump on me for blasphemy, i rated this movie 8 out of 10. i'm not going to go into what i liked about it. suffice it to say that i feel it was pretty complete, very well acted, and of course the production is incredible. almost perfect. so just let me give you 5 reasons why it's not 10/10: 1. the cg grandness is annoying (but at least not as annoying as in the fellowship). how many times must we take a flight through various caverns and structures, rotating impossibly around the towers, basically the stuff of the back to the future ride at universal or the star wars ride at disney. are movies going to learn from video game cut-scenes and computer graphic demos? or shouldn't it be the other way around? i can forgive this tho, cg is still fairly young and i'm praying that cg directors will finally get off the ""we can do it therefore we should"" and start thinking about art. 2. why was gimli turned into comic relief? to reach some strange audience? do the producers think the movie wouldn't sell if we didn't make fun of a short guy? uncool. just uncool. gimli is a dark and tragic character in the *real* lotr. i cannot forgive this. 3. all those sad women and children at helmsgate. awwwwww. what a waste of screen time. reminded me of the horrors of mad max beyond the thunderdome and the sci fi channel version of dune. ugh. edit that filler out. put in more dialog to explain the reasons why rohan and gondor are not (yet) working together. that was such an important part of the book and it's not well explained in the movie. 4. aragorn's love life blown out of proportion. a friend of mine says it's probably directed at the female viewers as vigo is a hotty. but again, an unnecessary drawing out of an already long movie. but i can forgive this, tolkien's two towers was pretty cold, a little love ain't a bad thing. just a little too much of it. it broke the story apart too much. 5. legolas skateboarding down the stairs while shooting his bow at the orcs. now this i cannot even fathom. is jackson mad??? i know, 10 seconds in a 3+ hour movie. but i almost screamed in anguish when i saw that. it wasn't even well done. it happens out of the blue and it's unclear even what legolas was riding. was it a shield? a piece of wood? an element deck with darkstar wheels? those stupid stupid 360 frames of film. we hates it. we hates it forever! -- the two towers was a very gloomy book. a difficult read. i can understand why jackson would want to liven it up a bit. but he went too far. good thing there was enough in the movie to make up for it (gollum, the dead marshes, and the continuing ability for jackson and his crew to tell a very difficult story in the visual medium)";7 January 2003;7;['complete', 'incredible', 'perfect', 'annoying', 'least', 'annoying', 'many', 'various', 'future', 'universal', 'other', 'young', 'gimli', 'comic', 'strange', 'short', 'gimli', 'dark', 'tragic', 'real', 'sad', 'mad', 'more', 'important', 'female', 'unnecessary', 'long', 'cold', 'little', 'bad', 'little', 'much', 'much', 'fathom', 'blue', 'unclear', 'stupid', 'stupid', 'gloomy', 'difficult', 'good', 'enough', 'dead', 'difficult', 'visual'];-0.1217105263157894
1367;Hawk-68;"i was on the nightly premiere of the two towers, and it seems clear to me now that there will never be another adaption of the lord of the rings. after the trilogy is completed, the legendary books will always be connected with this series of films. many people were astonished by the fellowship of the ring. the two towers will blow their minds away. while fellowship was an introduction of the characters in the story, two towers is full-scale mayhem ('open war is upon us, whether you risk it or not'). the violence is raw, the evil is dark and the uruk-hai army is mighty. this is also the point where the trilogy really becomes an epic story of the classic themes; love and friendship, hatred and war. the characters all become more complex. elijah wood portrays the increasing darkness in frodo brilliantly - his frightening eyes telling a whole story of their own, legolas is the ultimate medieval action hero and king theodan is also given a worthy performance by bernard hill. the most successful character, however, is the one of gollum/smeagol. he is geniously portrayed by the actor and mountain climber andy serkis, who both does his voice and his movements. gollum is definitely the most complex cgi character up to date, and his appearance is also very realistic. the footage is amazing. peter jackson has simply done an even more splendid job behind the camera this time than with fellowship. the beautiful nature of new zealand is a pleasure for the eye, with its majestic mountains and adventurous plains. fangorn forest is fantastic. the extra lightening effects, as are widely used with gandalf, adds to the experience. the battle of helm's deep. it is huge, overwhelming and epic in all its form, as is the movie. it is hard to believe that the film really manages to portray the battle as great on screen as it was meant to be, but peter jackson has accomplished the task. that is really the core of my opinion on the two towers (as on the fellowship of the ring): tolkien's story of middle-earth was a perfected masterpiece, hailed by many as the greatest of all stories. in these years we are witnessing it come to life on the cinema screen in a way no one could have imagined. we are privileged. the professor would have been proud.";18 December 2002;10;['nightly', 'clear', 'legendary', 'many', 'full', 'open', 'raw', 'dark', 'mighty', 'epic', 'classic', 'complex', 'frightening', 'whole', 'own', 'ultimate', 'medieval', 'worthy', 'successful', 'complex', 'realistic', 'amazing', 'splendid', 'beautiful', 'majestic', 'adventurous', 'fangorn', 'fantastic', 'extra', 'deep', 'huge', 'overwhelming', 'epic', 'hard', 'great', 'middle', 'many', 'great', 'privileged', 'proud'];0.2771545584045584

1389;sharon31673;and i hate using that word. but this movie, as the fellowship of the ring was, is top notch. i was really impressed with some of the way they did up some of the characters. grimer wormtongue and smeagal were almost exactly what i had invisioned when i read the books long ago. the battle had me on the edge of my seat (literally) through out the entire thing. elijah wood has done a great job of transforming from the innocent frodo to the frodo becoming more and more seduced by the power of the ring. these movies have been wonderfully casted. the only complaint i have so far about the casting choices, is from the fellowship. sean bean acted the part of boromir with excellence, but in my opinion he just didn't have the look. he just wasn't barbarian-ish enough.;23 December 2002;10;['top', 'notch', 'impressed', 'entire', 'great', 'innocent', 'seduced', 'only', 'barbarian'];0.2999999999999999
1390;nanahero-51637;the focus shift of film adaptation is more significant in this film. the original emotional sidelines that are thoroughly identified increase the proportion of the almost completely original battle of helm valley (of course, this section is well done and can receive goods). it's not too successful, but it's a perspective switch with ideas. the most praiseworthy is gulu's image design. in addition to the skin texture caused by technical limitations, it almost achieved full marks.;21 May 2020;9;['significant', 'original', 'emotional', 'original', 'helm', 'successful', 'praiseworthy', 'technical', 'full'];0.3178571428571429

1398;monious;"*** warning: major spoilers *** i just saw the midnight showing of the two towers, and i must say, i was rather disappointed. i really liked fellowship of the ring, i gave it a 10/10. and that rating didn't change even after repeated readings of the book. the parts that i thought they messed up were the parts that they deviated from the book, and if i thought they were a minor nuisance in fotr, man were they huge in ttt. although i can't speak for those who have never read the books (i've read all three several times, and also other tolkien works such as ""the silmarillion""), for me at least, it was a poor redesign of the schemes of the book. ttt deviates from the book in three majors ways. first is the actions and character of theoden, king of rohan. second is the same for faramir, captain of gondor. the third is, pretty much every major detail of the sequence of events between when wormtongue is cast aside to the end of the movie. theoden, in the book, after he is rid of the counsel of wormtongue, is a brave, courageous king. instead, in the movie he is belittled to a frightened king who cannot even go to war without constant nudging from aragorn. faramir is a noble man, learned of books and wise, as well as strong in war. he is a character who valiantly and nobly declines to accept the use of the ring, without some weird plot involving a siege of osgiliath and a out of context speech by sam to change his mind. faramir was one of my favorite characters in the books, but in the movie he is less a man than boromir. what gives? and why is it that his army of riders, six thousand strong in the book, is only a handful in this movie? what's the point? where did those elves come from to help defend helm's deep? why do the ents not rouse, until they are ""deceived"" by pippin? and why, why did frodo have to show the ring to the nazgul? what happened to the meeting of the kings and saruman? to me, it seems like these things were changed for the sake of changing them. to me, they ruin the character relationships that are developed and the plot that is given by tolkien. the lord of the rings is a tale of many heroes, gathered together in courage and strength even under despair. yet the movie seems to put all the burden on aragorn, gandalf, frodo, and sam, and leave everyone else as puppets of their situation. in many ways, the lord of the rings is a tale of the power of the gift of men: that they can change the music of the ainur, that they can shape their fate. in that way, i would say that the added scenes involving elrond and arwen were good; they deal more directly with this topic than any in the book. but every other scene that was modified seems to destroy the basic fabric that shapes this world for the sake of making the movie maybe just a little bit more exciting for the uneducated. after all this, it is still a well made movie with great cinematography and great actions scenes. the acting is well done, and there are many wonderful scenes. however, as someone who loves the books and feels that it is better, i can't give this movie higher than 8 out of 10, simply because i feel that the magic of the world of middle-earth was not well presented.";18 December 2002;10;['major', 'disappointed', 'minor', 'huge', 'several', 'other', 'such', 'least', 'poor', 'second', 'same', 'major', 'brave', 'courageous', 'frightened', 'constant', 'noble', 'wise', 'strong', 'weird', 'favorite', 'strong', 'deep', 'many', 'gandalf', 'many', 'good', 'other', 'basic', 'little', 'exciting', 'uneducated', 'great', 'great', 'many', 'wonderful', 'well', 'high', 'middle'];0.2004166666666666

1402;boilerhook;excellent movie, but having read the series was disappointed about some of the changes made for the movie. most notably was the changing of faramir. in the book faramir came across as a wiser, more noble person than his brother boromir, but in the movie they created a character that did not live up to the book's version. the only other thing that really bothered me was the change of ending. i guess that they just ran out of time, but the ending in the book is fantastic and was a let down with the movies version. all in all it is still a great movie, and can't wait for the next one.;21 December 2002;9;['excellent', 'wise', 'noble', 'only', 'other', 'fantastic', 'great', 'next'];0.421875

1404;jedsalazar;"the two towers can only be explained in one word, beautiful. this film left me breathless. i was hoping for a film that could stand in the same depths of the fellowship of the ring, and i must say that it has surpassed the film completely. i will have a hard time watching the fellowship and seeing the ending, knowing there is so much more waiting. let's start with gollum. gollum gave an astonishing performance. the poor misunderstood beast, or the darkened soul creature whose cares are only based on the one ring. the performance given in cgi is at times very human. the facial expressions given could strangely give this character a personality as you would see in any great actor. gollum's voice is still haunting, even when the beast appears to be the loving guide to the dark gates of mordor. for these reasons and more, gollum has become my favorite character in the film, replacing legolas in the fellowship. on the other side of middle earth we see aragorn, legolas, and gimli. i have to say that the dark times of this movie are at times overbearing, and saddening. there is a perfect mix of humor in the film given by the characters gimli, and legolas, while still keeping the viewer in understanding that these are very darkened times. aragorn's performance is outstanding. he has proven that he can be put on an a-list of actors, and deserves appraise for his performance. gandalf ""the white"" in this film was a twist. we remember the friendly gandalf the grey in the fellowship being a kind elderly wizard. shouting off fireworks for the children of the shire, and smoking ""leaf"" as explained in the novel. there are no cute scenes with the new white wizard. no fireworks, or pipes. just a wizard that knows the daunting task ahead, and the quest seems to have taken hold of the great wizard. very dark are the times for frodo, and samwise. gollum seams to give frodo hope, as the two ring bearers can associate the pains of the one ring. frodo gives an amazing performance this time around as well. it seams that the ring of power has taken hold of frodo, and our hero is slipping. but the surprise was aimed at samwise. proving that sam is the definition of a true best friend. even at times when it seems there is no hope for the troubled trio, it seams that sam brings hope to the moment. this is what keeps the frodo's story this time around even more extraordinary, is the hope that is there, even when all odds point to despair. merry and pippin's story is very odd initially. the ents in the story are very wise and newly troubled creatures from the amazing mind of tolkien. this story goes back to cut scenes during the worries of the rest of middle earth, and gives us a feeling of hope, in the troubled times of aragorn and the others. the ents were very well done cgi wise, but it was there personality that moved the audience. they are curiously wise, and well spoken and give the impression of an elderly college professor. their story is eventually given a wonderful opportunity, and for those of us who know the story, know that greatness is upon them. this movie honestly moved me further than i thought any film could. i could see my face and the emotion i felt as i was watching this mammoth film. peter jackson has truly given us all a gift of a magnificent. this story has captivated my heart, and the film has taken my breath away. there is no words that can express the greatness of this film. 10/10";19 December 2002;10;['beautiful', 'same', 'hard', 'more', 'astonishing', 'poor', 'human', 'facial', 'great', 'dark', 'more', 'favorite', 'other', 'middle', 'aragorn', 'gimli', 'dark', 'perfect', 'gimli', 'darkened', 'outstanding', 'gandalf', 'friendly', 'elderly', 'cute', 'new', 'daunting', 'great', 'dark', 'samwise', 'amazing', 'true', 'good', 'troubled', 'extraordinary', 'odd', 'wise', 'troubled', 'amazing', 'middle', 'troubled', 'wise', 'spoken', 'elderly', 'wonderful', 'mammoth'];0.2574675324675324

1407;tgeddes;the two towers is a wonderful movie, one that stands as a great work on its own. as an adaptation, it also excels, but you have to be willing to forgive the filmmakers for the amount of material they changed. at first, i left the theater a bit unhappy and ticked off. some things really didn't need to be changed, i thought. they went too far. however, after thinking about it more, there were a lot of things in the books that wouldn't translate well, not to mention the fact that introducing more people, towers, etc. would only serve to confuse the casual movie goer. also, some characters weren't complex or realistic enough in the books (faramir), and needed more depth and conflict. arwen, who is barely mentioned in the books, with exception to her tale in the appendixes, also needed to have her story, and her love story with aragorn, expanded, for the sake of realism and believablity. that is the key. there are things in the book that we can accept as readers that casual watcher wouldn't believe. were the movie geared only toward fans of the books, they could have mentioned all the names they wanted, and given us everything from the books they could have fit in 3 hours. but for the sake of making the trilogy make sense for new viewers, things had to change. i think that even the most jaded fan will appreciate this movie once they understand that. and, most importantly, peter jackson kept the mood and attitude right. details may have changed, but the heart-and-soul of the book remains. that is commendable.;19 December 2002;8;['wonderful', 'great', 'own', 'willing', 'unhappy', 'more', 'casual', 'complex', 'realistic', 'more', 'casual', 'new', 'jaded', 'right', 'commendable'];0.1799034299034298
1408;WhyFjord;one of the most important considerations to take into account when analyzing a film like this is the issue of medium. we must realize that there is simply no way to transfer a work of art from one medium to another. sure, we may agree that tolkien's book are masterpieces. and we can say that an adaptation of such a great work has a better chance of being a great work in its own right. but we must not mistake one work for the other. peter jackson's films are not the books. now there's no getting around the obvious connections between the two. many of us have grown up with a vivid image of middle earth in our heads, and we should expect to compare this vision with what is presented on the screen. but they will not, can not, be the same vision. so issues such as changes made to the plotline should be considered (as much as possible) within the context of the film. did the omission of shelob create a better story, or worse? did aragorn's little near-death excursion improve the pacing and flow of the narrative or not? faramir? the elf battalion? we obviously can not remove from our selves all previous conceptions of middle earth, but we must remember that these films are not actually tolkien's lotr. they must be considered on their own. i appreciate pj's decision to make ttt a more action-orriented film. an attempt to recreate tolkien's tt would have made a much less interesting and beautiful film. for the most part, the casting continues to be first rate. although she will never match my original conception, m. otto's eowyn was a particularly thrilling character. as with most, i was confused by faramir's characterization. i think, however, that a fully introduced faramir coming at the end of the film would have been awkward and would have greatly detracted from the film real hero, aragorn. so we'll have to wait for trotk to see faramir in full force. the looks of the ents was less than spectacular, but they came off fairly well as a whole. wood's frodo continues to descend into a frightening sort of madness and austin's sam continues to develop. i couldn't help but chuckle at the inclusion of sam's story speech near the end. insert director's tough into cheek. in the end, this is a fine film, although not quite as good as last year's fellowship. personal rating are subjective, but as much as i love the film with its beauty and tragedy so masterfully portrayed, this is no top ten of all time film. it is, however, a brilliant fusion of heroic drama, deep apreciation of ideals, and spectacular technique.;23 January 2003;9;['important', 'great', 'well', 'great', 'own', 'other', 'obvious', 'many', 'vivid', 'middle', 'same', 'such', 'possible', 'well', 'bad', 'little', 'previous', 'middle', 'own', 'more', 'interesting', 'beautiful', 'most', 'first', 'original', 'thrilling', 'most', 'awkward', 'real', 'aragorn', 'full', 'less', 'spectacular', 'frightening', 'tough', 'fine', 'good', 'last', 'personal', 'subjective', 'top', 'brilliant', 'heroic', 'deep', 'spectacular'];0.2361449864498644
1409;rocstat;having read a number of the reviews by fans of the books, i am dismayed at some of the reactions to this work. it appears as though they were mainly interested in comparing this film to the book and not looking at this as part of a film trilogy. what they seem to forget is that peter jackson is a huge fan of lord of the rings. he has adapted the books and i have to believe that he has stayed faithful to his experiences of the book. one of the beauties of novels is that they allow you to create your own landscape and vision of the characters. i have known of two people reading and loving the same book, but when they discuss it, they have what seem like completely different ideas of what the book was really about. all i am trying to say is that this is peter jackson's vision of the books and i am sure the changes he made were forced upon him through the difficulty of trying to adapt a complex novel into a film. when it comes down to it, a film is mainly the directors vision of the action, whereas a book allows us to create our own experiences. i will only suggest that no adaptation which was made to pander to the experiences of the reader has ever made a good movie. the point of adapting a book into a film is to share your experiences of the book with others, not to collect their experiences up put them all together and release them back to the people that gave them. oh, i thought the film suffered through the limitations of the story which will end up creating a ten hour masterpiece but judging it on its own means that it will suffer 9/10 (in anticipation) if you got this far, thank you and sorry for the rant.;21 December 2002;7;['interested', 'huge', 'faithful', 'own', 'same', 'different', 'sure', 'complex', 'own', 'good', 'own', 'sorry'];0.2590909090909091

1411;homerinvests;before i saw the first movie, fotr, i thought tolkien's lotr was impossible to adapt to film. it has so many strong characters and such a rich, multithreaded plot that i couldn't imagine how anyone could make all these people and ideas come to the screen without heavily watering down many of the details and characters. somehow in fotr jackson maintained tolkien's richness of story and characters with only minor changes. jackson maintained an impossible balance of all tolkien's detail to appeal to the tolkien read as well as the unread viewer. in ttt, the big question for me was whether or not he would be able to maintain this 'impossible balance' as the story continued. the movie - ttt ***some minor spoilers***. the re-introductions to the fotr characters and introductions to new characters was setup well. gandalf's battle with the balrog continues and gandalf's return is explained in a great yet vague manner consistent with the book. frodo, sam and gollum together worked for me. gollum's schizophrenic scenes were believable and even comic (if a little overlong) at times. merry and pippin were more serious and no longer the comic relief duo, but any comic responsibility they shed was picked up many times over by gimli. i'm sure he had more comic lines than serious ones. aragorn and legolas will again have their fan followings either for their battle prowess, or their lady swooning abilities. saruman was back in a lesser role with his army of badies. we were also introduced to king theoden, wormtongue, eomer and eowyn in the first hour of the movie, so the beginning laid a solid foundation for the rest of the story. i first got a sinking feeling that something was really missing when the uruk-hai fought over merry and pippin. there was no division of ranks between the forces of mordor and isengard. nor was there the counterplot in which saruman had designs on keeping the ring for himself. later, i again experienced this feeling of something missing when aragorn, legolas and gimli met eomer and the riders of rohan on the plain. many of tolkien's subtleties of that meeting were missing, and i could see that there was not going to be a brother-like bond between aragorn and eomer. merry and pippin's escape from the uruk-hai interleaved with aragorn discovering the clues of their escape was well done. this sequence lead up to the introduction of treebeard. i'm sure that there will be many who pick apart the cgi in these scenes, but i give top marks to jackson et al. for being brave enough to include a force of walking, talking, fighting trees in the movie. my problem with the ents was not with the effects, but rather it felt that jackson was struggling to stay consistent with tolkien. jackson kept them very true to the book and 'unhasty' in some scenes then had them act in the opposite manner in the next scenes. also, for one of the oldest, wisest creatures in middle earth, treebeard was more than a little naive. he acknowledges the smoke over isengard, but failed to deduce than smoke means fire, fire mean wood, and wood means... (wait for it) ...trees. further, the overall significance of the ents overthrowing isengard was not clear, but there is (hopefully) room for exposition on that in the next movie. theoden's transformation back to himself was nicely done, but it didn't seem very logical that grima was spared and set free given the knowledge he had of rohan's defenses. this is perhaps another riddle to be answered in the next movie. the flight to helmsdeep was good with a little of everything: comedy, romance (via aragorn / arwen flashback), and a battle. frodo, sam and gollum's journey introduced us to the flying nazgul, and gave us glimpses of the mental turmoil the ring was causing for frodo. we also got our first look at the impressive, impenetrable fortress of mordor and of sauron's massing armies. i thought jackson did well to stay somewhat true to the book as frodo, sam and gollum watched faramir's ambush of the oliphant riding wildmen and during frodo and sam's capture, but struggled with tolkien consistency in subsequent scenes. for the next few scenes i thought their whole interaction disappointing. there was no sense of mutual respect between frodo and faramir. when faramir 'showed his worth' by declaring that the ring would go to gondor, i felt my eyes bulge in my head. the helmsdeep arrival and battle preparation sequence was ok. the whole pacing of the movie seemed rushed here. why did they have to try to make so much happen in one day? between the arrival at helmsdeep, the battle preparation, the tension building moments, the comic relief moments, the arrival of reinforcements combined with scenes of the simultaneous doings of saruman, aragorn, merry and pippin - whew!...keeping track of everything was a bit difficult to follow. also, as an aside, what were those hobbit children doing in helmsdeep? - grin. the battle of helmsdeep itself was excellent with bad moments. on the good side, the scope was immense and the effects very good. ten thousand enemies assaulting a fortified stronghold. there was an outer wall battle, an inner wall battle, and last stand at the gate - wave after wave of attack and counter attack. on the bad side, a few unbelievables that stood out for me: for example, aragorn being blown off the outer wall to the courtyard in a massive explosion then getting up, uninjured, a few seconds later, or the scene where aragorn and gimli attacked everyone on the ramp then get pulled to safety by a dangling rope. gandalf's arrival with eomer was good but their initial charge looked to be a poor battle tactic - charging downhill into a pike holding mass. another minor criticism for me was that king theoden doesn't come across as very noble - quite inferior to tolkien's theoden. the battle with faramir's people in osgiliath served no purpose. ok, reading a bit into it, we see that faramir is the only one brave enough to raise a weapon to the flying nazgul. but after frodo's scene with the nazgul faramir comes to understand what frodo is going through and decides to set him free after all. huh!?!?!? what insight has he had? how could he possibly understand frodo's situation and turmoil? did sam's speech win him over? this did not flow for me at all. perhaps jackson et al. wanted to include another battle using sauron's forces to show that more evil forces were at work than only saruman (? - i don't know.). overall, it didn't seem as though there were as many subtle scenes , or as many scenes with hidden significance in ttt as there were in fotr. in the end we were left in similar circumstances to what we were in fotr. while ttt still has the flavour of tolkien's lotr, the full essence of tolkien's great work is not as strong as it was in the fotr. there are so many things happening in the movie that i think the unread viewer will have problems following the 'why' behind all that is happening. but, by the same token, once you've read the book you can't help but to compare it to the movie and here ttt fails to achieve the same impossible balance that fotr achieved. my $0.02.;30 December 2002;7;['first', 'impossible', 'many', 'strong', 'rich', 'many', 'only', 'minor', 'impossible', 'unread', 'big', 'able', 'impossible', 'minor', 'new', 'great', 'vague', 'consistent', 'schizophrenic', 'believable', 'comic', 'little', 'serious', 'comic', 'comic', 'many', 'gimli', 'sure', 'more', 'comic', 'serious', 'less', 'wormtongue', 'first', 'solid', 'missing', 'gimli', 'many', 'like', 'sure', 'many', 'top', 'brave', 'consistent', 'true', 'unhasty', 'opposite', 'next', 'old', 'wise', 'middle', 'more', 'little', 'naive', 'mean', 'overall', 'clear', 'next', 'logical', 'free', 'next', 'good', 'little', 'aragorn', 'mental', 'first', 'impressive', 'impenetrable', 'true', 'oliphant', 'subsequent', 'next', 'few', 'whole', 'disappointing', 'mutual', 'ok', 'whole', 'much', 'comic', 'simultaneous', 'difficult', 'excellent', 'bad', 'good', 'immense', 'good', 'outer', 'inner', 'last', 'bad', 'few', 'outer', 'massive', 'uninjured', 'few', 'gimli', 'good', 'initial', 'poor', 'pike', 'minor', 'noble', 'inferior', 'only', 'brave', 'free', 'more', 'evil', 'many', 'subtle', 'many', 'hidden', 'similar', 'full', 'great', 'strong', 'many', 'unread', 'same', 'token', 'same', 'impossible'];0.1341637529137529
1412;Sabbe-;alright, the movie was very good. i voted 9 for it. two towers was a very different movie than fotr, it had much more changes compared to the book and it had lots of humour (sometimes too much: for example the legolas skating scene, but other than that the humour was ok). i've struggled in my mind for long time about the changes.. most screwed up was the faramir-fiasco, but i've found in my mind the good things about it, with help of imdb user comments and threads. first i though that faramir was made weaker, but actually i think it made him stronger. the ring's power is great and faramir had other troubles, gondor in trouble and his brother just died. but in the end he decided to let frodo & sam go so that made him strong. and it was a pleasure to see the ruined city osgiliath which was in the book only hinted at. there were many other changes that irritated me too: aragorns fake-falling, the fake allience between elves and men and lots of other things. but none of the changes changed the overall-plot of the movie. for example the osgiliath-scene made sauron believe that the ring is in gondor so he will launch his great attack there. it was a much worse translation from the book than fotr was, but i still enjoyed it a lot. i loved gollum, he deserves an oscar :) the battle scenes were great, i can't wait to see the mordor's army surrounding minas tirith. saruman's army looked so great that the army of sauron must be something worth waiting :) i'm sure that mostly the ones who haven't read the book enjoyed tt more, but it was well made, though it could've been edited better. i think fotr was better than tt, but not much. fotr was 10, tt 9. i hope that return of the king will be as good as the first movie. we'll see.;23 December 2002;9;['good', 'different', 'more', 'much', 'other', 'ok', 'long', 'good', 'weak', 'strong', 'great', 'other', 'strong', 'many', 'other', 'fake', 'other', 'overall', 'great', 'bad', 'great', 'great', 'worth', 'sure', 'more', 'well', 'much', 'good', 'first'];0.2727564102564103

1419;mrgordonz;i am a great lover of all things tolkien. i have also long been a fan of peter jackson. and this movie is truly spectacular - a genuine epic. i am 34 years old and i still felt like a wide-eyed kid while watching ttt. the feeling reminded me of the first time i saw star wars when i was about 10. in fact, i would say ttt was better. i have read a number of reviews that have criticised this movie (and fotr) for not sticking precisely to the books. big deal! had the movies simply been a page-by-page, visual version of the books, each movie would be a rambling 7-hour mess. as any good film-maker will tell you, any book that is brought to film needs to be reworked to accommodate the different medium. this is especially true of a work as involved as lotr. it is this problem of translation from book to film that has been the undoing of other fantasy movies (eg: dune). bear in mind also that peter jackson has made a film for millions of people who have never read any of the books - not just for those lucky enough to have read lotr (or even the hobbit). so yes, ttt the movie is slightly different from ttt the book. does that disqualify it as a valid interpretation of tolkien's work? hell no!! be grateful that it was made by a genuine tolkien fan, and not by some third-rate hollywood hack. if you want to get an appreciation of how much time and effort jackson and his team put into making the film(s), watch the special features on the extended dvd edition. i doubt there is another director alive who would have invested so much of himself in the project. having said all that, what was the movie like? amazing! better than the first installment, and that is saying something. cinematography, sound, music, characterisation, plot development, continuity, special effects (especially gollum and the battle at helm's deep) are all first rate. but similar comments could perhaps be made about episode ii - attack of the clones. yet ttt is (in my humble opinion) far superior. so what separates the two? soul. spirit. passion. i enjoyed episode ii, but i got the feeling lucas was just going through the motions, pumping out yet another installment. but ttt has an energy that is palpable, and i believe this is due in part to the dedication of both cast and crew (especially jackson himself). more experienced and technical eyes than mine will no doubt find fault with the film for a variety of reasons. but i give it a strong 10/10!;29 December 2002;10;['great', 'spectacular', 'genuine', 'old', 'eyed', 'first', 'well', 'big', 'visual', 'good', 'different', 'true', 'other', 'lucky', 'different', 'valid', 'grateful', 'genuine', 'third', 'much', 'special', 'extended', 'alive', 'much', 'amazing', 'well', 'first', 'special', 'deep', 'first', 'similar', 'humble', 'superior', 'palpable', 'due', 'experienced', 'technical', 'strong'];0.2443650793650793

1426;mccabe_mike;"the two towers is an excellent movie. the special effects, in particular, are extremely well done. you really get a great sense of the massive amounts of people/orcs involved in the battles. that sense of a huge crowd/army is something that the two towers achieves, that no other film has ever come close to matching. gollum/smeagol is such an amazing character in the book and i was very happy to see him become what is destined to be, a classic movie character. at times, he seemed a little bit too bright, which gave him away as a cg character. but, there were also times where he looked so incredibly real, that you cannot help but view him and watch him as you would a regular, ""human"", character. andy serkis deserves a nomination for the character he helped create, and the two towers should win the academy award for best special effects because of what has been achieved with gollum/smeagol alone. seeing the continued battle between gandalf and the balrog was so good, it had me wishing that i had my dvd remote with me so i could watch it again and again. it opens the movie with a bang and it resonates so strongly, it's kind of difficult for the other things in the beginning of the movie to feel as important. that feeling of ""importance"" is not as apparent in the two towers as it was in the fellowship of the ring. of course, it is a ""middle"" movie, and that important feeling is going to be somewhat missing, regardless of what happens. but i think it's more the pacing and flow of the fellowship that makes it seem like a more ""important"" movie. scripting and filming huge battle scenes is extremely difficult. but peter jackson set the bar so high with fellowship, i was expecting even more this time. unfortunately, we don't get as many ""bad-ass"" moments in two towers, as we did in fellowship. as i already stated, being able to witness a battle that has so many characters fighting against each other is absolutely incredible. but, i was hoping to see more examples of how aragorn, gimli, and legolas are superior warriors to the rest of the masses. in the first movie, i was blow away by how calm legolas was while he stabbed an orc in the eye with an arrow, then shot the same arrow at another orc. i wanted to see more of that sort of thing. i wanted to see more of gimli as a fearless and accomplished warrior, and less of him being the comic relief. but, perhaps those are just things that i selfishly wanted to see on the screen. as things are, i really can't complain. it's incredible and it needs to be seen. the two worst parts (and these are very minor) of the movie are: 1)the aragorn/arwen love story 2)legolas on a skateboard i understand the use of aragorn/arwen love story, but i feel that it interrupts the natural flow of the movie. basically, it doesn't fit and takes way too long. during the battle of helm's deep, legolas slides down a stone staircase on an arm shield. this feels totally contrived and remember thinking, ""what movie is this? is this two towers (xxx remix)?"" it was just weird and out of place. but whatever. i'm being over critical. the movie is very, very good. it's not quite as good as the first one, but it's still very good. if you liked the book, you will love this movie. if like huge battle scenes, you will love this movie. if you loved the first movie, you have to see this movie.";19 December 2002;10;['excellent', 'special', 'particular', 'great', 'massive', 'huge', 'other', 'amazing', 'happy', 'classic', 'little', 'bright', 'real', 'regular', 'human', 'good', 'special', 'continued', 'good', 'remote', 'difficult', 'other', 'important', 'apparent', 'middle', 'important', 'missing', 'more', 'important', 'huge', 'difficult', 'high', 'many', 'bad', 'able', 'many', 'other', 'incredible', 'more', 'aragorn', 'gimli', 'superior', 'first', 'blow', 'calm', 'same', 'more', 'more', 'gimli', 'accomplished', 'less', 'comic', 'incredible', 'bad', 'minor', 'aragorn', 'aragorn', 'natural', 'deep', 'weird', 'critical', 'good', 'good', 'first', 'good', 'huge', 'first'];0.2487873284907183

1430;dbriers;"well, after months of waiting, i finally got to see the sneak preview of lord of the rings : the two towers last night. despite a fairly unpleasant cold, and being pretty tired (the show only started at 12:15 am), i was still blown away by this second installment of the trilogy. i am both a long-time peter jackson fan (and highly recommend that all fans of the lotr movies try and locate some of his early movies to see from whence he came - certainly a vast change in style, but nevertheless, distinctive), and a relative fan of the tolkien novels (i have read lotr and the hobbit on more than one occasion, but have not bothered to delve deeper). a warning first - had you not seen ""the fellowship of the ring"", you will get really lost, really quickly, so it is highly recommended that you see the first movie before this one. mr jackson thankfully does not make the age-old mistake of having a brief montage of events in the previous movie - you are thrust straight into the middle of events, and everything starts moving quite quickly. i'm not going to go on and on about every single event, but there are certain things which do deserve special mention. firstly, wormtongue is marvellously cast. portrayed with just the correct mixture of cowardice, malice, and toadiness (for lack of a better word), the character was just as i had always imagined. secondly, gollum was magnificent - personally, i don't think that the cgi was what won me over about the creature (although relatively flawless in it's execution). what won me over was the way that gollum was portrayed as a laughable creature, pathetic, snivelling, and almost thoroughly evil, yet with the distinct yet remote hope of redemption. i also was absolutely besotted with the voice of the creature, as well as the distinctive movements, grimaces and expressions of the two different personalities (gollum and smeagol). i sincerely believe that the performance of the creature is oscar-worthy - after all, serkis is indeed present in the creation, and makes it his own - the spirit is there, even if the flesh is not.. finally, the battle of the ents in isengard was to me a highlight. many have gushed about the battle at helmsdeep, which was indeed spectacular, but few have commented much on the ents, especially the battle in isengard, and i have no idea why, as this was to me one of the real highlights of the film. in conclusion, this is every bit as powerful as ""the fellowship of the rings"", but is slightly darker - basically, if you were a fan of the first movie, you will no doubt see this, and find it to be as compelling and awe-inspiring as the first installment. if on the other hand, you were not a fan, then you will probably not enjoy this either - after all, jacksons filming the trilogy all at once really has given the film a great amount of continuity, and the same sense of mystery and wonder throughout. i highly recommend it, and have no hesitation in giving it a perfect 10.";18 December 2002;10;['last', 'unpleasant', 'cold', 'tired', 'second', 'long', 'lotr', 'early', 'vast', 'distinctive', 'relative', 'more', 'first', 'old', 'brief', 'previous', 'single', 'certain', 'special', 'correct', 'well', 'magnificent', 'flawless', 'laughable', 'pathetic', 'evil', 'distinct', 'remote', 'distinctive', 'different', 'oscar', 'worthy', 'present', 'own', 'many', 'spectacular', 'few', 'real', 'powerful', 'dark', 'first', 'compelling', 'inspiring', 'first', 'other', 'great', 'same', 'perfect'];0.1071138211382113

1432;inceoglu;i believe anyone who read tolkien's masterpiece will be disappointed with this second installment of the trilogy. if you haven't read the book though, then this movie may be pure entertainment. why i don't like this movie? first of all it is not completely true to the story (you can very well argue it doesn't have to be), and unfortunately the additions made by jackson and his screenwriters consist of childish, cliche scenes or dialogues. the new lines sound like they have been written by kevin costner rather than tolkien. the action scenes are exaggerated and overacted (with legolas surfing down the stairs on a shield while firing arrows etc etc). the characters are all the time overcome with emotion, which toward the end of the movie makes you sick (why is frodo on the verge of tears all the time? why does everybody hug and cast meaningful glances at each other every other minute?). the background music gets to my nerves after the first hour. there should be a substitute to this nordic chorus singing at extremely high pitch whenever something grave happens. and then, back again the changes in the story are unforgivable for someone who loves the book. the removal of some parts of the story is, of course, necessary. but fiddling with characters (oh faramir!) is not. what you have is a hollywood blockbuster based on a great book. i guess it could have been worse, which is the only good thing i have to say about this movie.;27 August 2003;6;['second', 'pure', 'true', 'childish', 'new', 'exaggerated', 'overacted', 'sick', 'meaningful', 'other', 'other', 'first', 'nordic', 'high', 'unforgivable', 'necessary', 'great', 'bad', 'only', 'good'];0.043903743315508
1433;sweezely;"i am fairly disgusted at the level of near-godly praise this film has had. while the fellowship of the ring was a fairly decent (even better on the extended dvd), this film is actually mostly awful. after the opening explaining more-or-less what happened to gandalf in his battle with the balrog, peter jackson treats us to 90 minutes of incomprehensible drivel. the camera swings in his trademark ""sweeping"" shots so much it feels like a spoof of the first film, and then randomly lurches between the three groups of protagonists. there is little congruence, and the story is not even attempted to be told in any clear fashion. then there is the acting, which fails to live up to the standards of the first film. and the ents. ah, those tree-creatures that i could not visualise when i read the book, their appearance remains a mystery still. they look terrible. like the worst kind of stop-motion they do not look natural or tree-like, and they are not even produced very well on screen. they look appalling. as if to make matters worse, mr jackson has insisted on expanding the parts of the elves to give them roles in this film when they were barely even mentioned in the book. why, i do not know. fortunately the film gets better as we get to the centrepiece: the battle at helm's deep. yes, this does live up to what you have heard, and will undoubtedly go down as one of the finest cinematic battles to date. shame that it is intercut with scenes of the ents. then, the worst thing about the film: no ending. the film just seems to stop, and it does so a full six chapters before the book. this is unbelievable. the return of the king isn't that short a book to warrant getting a third of the two towers tacked on the beginning of it. i really cannot understand the reasoning behind why peter jackson expands some parts, but then misses out nearly a third of the book. and why were frodo and sam taken to gondor? that never happened in the book either. i really think peter jackson should actually read the books to the end. what's next? four lotr films?";27 December 2002;4;['disgusted', 'godly', 'decent', 'well', 'extended', 'awful', 'more', 'less', 'incomprehensible', 'sweeping', 'first', 'randomly', 'little', 'clear', 'first', 'terrible', 'bad', 'natural', 'like', 'appalling', 'bad', 'well', 'deep', 'fine', 'cinematic', 'bad', 'full', 'unbelievable', 'short', 'next'];-0.1782196969696969

1437;amygail;this movie is incredible. i loved every minute of it. my favorites were the ents and the discussion between smeagol and gollum. i loved the use of the camera angles to further split his personalities, i thought it was a great touch. the helm's deep scene was also wonderful. i also enjoyed the portrayal of eowyn, she is a wonderful character and she was truly done justice by the film. two elements, however, dissapointed me. i did not enjoy the fact that faramir was given a personality more like that of his brother boromir. faramir in the book is a much more helpful and supportive character, and i thought having him hinder the quest in the movie ruined his character. the other was the ambiguity surrounding arwen. it was left undecided whether she left for the frey havens or not. much as i personally find arwen a pointless character and would rather aragorn (a personal favorite) had gone for eowyn, i think that it would ruin the effect of an otherwise amazing film version of a great story to change that detail. overall, the two towers is an immensely enjoyable movie that is hugely worth seeing and no one should miss it!;8 January 2003;10;['incredible', 'great', 'deep', 'wonderful', 'wonderful', 'helpful', 'supportive', 'other', 'undecided', 'pointless', 'personal', 'amazing', 'great', 'enjoyable', 'worth'];0.4634615384615385

1444;divergenceOfHumanBeings;"lord of the rings: the two towers (2002) rating: 10/10 well, yesterday (sunday, december 22nd) was finally the day i had the chance to see the most anticipated motion picture of the year - the two towers. i loved the first part of the play and as i had my fears and doubts before marching into the theaters for the fellowship of the ring the first time, this time i didn't have any doubts. only uncomfortable feeling was because i had read so many negative things from you on these message boards. there are few minor spoilers given below, so if you haven't seen the movie and want to know as little as possible about it, i recommend you stop reading right now. -----spoilers ahead----- the beginning of the movie is just amazing. one funny thing was i had listened the soundtrack all over again multiple times in the past few weeks and had all the songs in clear memory and now i was able to catch those melodies from the movie. balrog is just one of the most incredible creatures i've ever seen and the fight between gandalf and balrog is just --- awesome.. the plot: there have been huge complaining about the changes made for the movie and i agree that the changes are a venture, indeed. there were almost six chapters left out from the movie including those chapters considering saruman and the fate of isengard, but because of fact that the movie tried to tie up the timing, which is very different in the book, i know they had no other choice. who knows what they are going to put on the extended edition or what they are going to leave for the return of the king. anyway, i was a bit frustrated at first because i couldn't get involved from the very beginning --- and the problem was that there was no such a thing. that is why all of it was a bit confusing for me at first, but then it just sucked me into middle-earth. now i am just too eager to just see it few more times in theaters --- i saw the first one five times and i just might break my own personal record with this one... the acting/characters: well, what can i say. acting was just superb as it has been in the first movie. new characters were introduced quickly, but they all seemed to have what we call talent and ambition to show us what they've got in a hurry. especially the performances by brad dourif and miranda otto were brilliant. one of the characters, who's a part which was changed almost completely, was faramir. he was presented in the movie as a patriotic hero, which didn't quite work out for me, because it only left with the desire to know and see more of him. i hope they are putting some extra footage of him in the extended edition. all right, who haven't appeared in my review yet? i must say that smeagol is one of the most astonishing creations in the history of cinema and the performance of andy serkis as a disturbed, schizophrenic mind is just real and emotionally very affective. i felt pity and empathy for it from the first frame i saw it onscreen. one of the things i hated with other people with me that almost the whole audience was laughing during its personal struggle, by myself i just have to say that serkis' performance was indeed superb and actually delivered very scary moments sometimes. complains i've heard about the appearance of gandalf can be put aside by me; it just as in the book: he returns, he disappears and then he returns for the last time. sir ian mckellen is a wonderful actor, especially the moment he revealed himself to aragorn, legolas and gimli is one of the most memorable moments in the movie. gimli was one of the funniest characters. yes, sometimes it went over the top, but i actually enjoyed his lines and jokes because it brought to me something that is about all dwarves; it is like these problems aren't still completely theirs and that he is just 'passing by'. that wasn't the best way to put it but i can sense carelessness in his personality and the times such as aragorn falling off a cliff and their fear of losing meriadoc and pippin brought gimli's emotional side forward. treebeard. he was fabulous. one thing i just wanted to see onscreen was his home and more of the fangorn forest, let's hope they put up some footage for the extended edition. directing: i cannot say that there weren't moments i didn't like as much as i would've liked, but considering the movie as a second act of the play the movie was awesome and peter jackson did his job well, bringing middle-earth in front of us again with huge threat of war upon them. solutions he had made for the story, i accepted them because i know (after listening 220 minutes of him watching the commentary track of the extended edition for the fellowship of the ring) he knows what he's doing and i know that he will astonish us again, first with the extended edition for the two towers and then with the final chapter of the play, the return of the king. music: howard shore's score is yet again amazing work and the movie works out well with such a musical extent involved; it tells you how to feel and it moves you emotionally. i was surprised shore was not nominated for golden globe award for this one, because the movie has although turned to be much darker and the score much different than the first one, brining shore's talents yet again in front of us. i am just thrilled to find out after one very long year (again) what he does with the finale. the movie was extremely violent compared to its predecessor, but the movie really is a war movie --- and most important an adaption from the book of j. r. r. tolkien. at first i had problems with this movie but after all, i loved it. i cannot say if this one is better than the first and there are three major reasons: 1) the visual deluge onscreen was just so huge i have to see it multiple times, as soon as possible, 2) the mood of the film was just so different from the first movie and 3) i still consider them as a one movie cut in three parts. this is going to be the greatest movie trilogies ever made. let's just stand for each other to survive through the year 2003 and let's just enjoy the last year we can be together waiting for what's to come.";23 December 2002;10;['first', 'first', 'uncomfortable', 'many', 'negative', 'few', 'minor', 'little', 'possible', 'amazing', 'funny', 'multiple', 'past', 'few', 'clear', 'able', 'incredible', 'awesome', 'huge', 'different', 'other', 'extended', 'frustrated', 'very', 'such', 'confusing', 'middle', 'eager', 'few', 'more', 'first', 'own', 'personal', 'superb', 'first', 'new', 'brilliant', 'patriotic', 'more', 'extra', 'extended', 'astonishing', 'disturbed', 'schizophrenic', 'real', 'affective', 'first', 'onscreen', 'other', 'whole', 'personal', 'superb', 'scary', 'last', 'wonderful', 'gimli', 'memorable', 'theirs', 'good', 'such', 'aragorn', 'emotional', 'fabulous', 'more', 'extended', 'second', 'awesome', 'middle', 'huge', 'extended', 'extended', 'final', 'amazing', 'musical', 'surprised', 'golden', 'dark', 'different', 'first', 'thrilled', 'long', 'violent', 'important', 'well', 'first', 'major', 'visual', 'huge', 'multiple', 'possible', 'different', 'first', 'great', 'other', 'last'];0.1871691599539701
1445;PhillipWhite555;let me start of by saying that i really did like the film, but i had some complaints about it. i would have to say that the movie is not quite as good as the first movie. the real difference for me was that a few times during the ttt i thought to myself, this is a long film and that was an interesting change to the book, while i never thought that once about fellowship. as noted in umpteen other comments director peter jackson made some interesting changes to the movie from the book. most of the changes i could accept as needed for transforming a lengthy and complex novel with oodles of characters into something that is halfway comprehensible. the arwan sequences, the cool warg cavalry battle, galenderial(sp?) appearance and the elves at helm deep all fall into this category. in fact i didn't mind almost any of the changes at all, it was when wholly new elements were introduced that i began not to like pj changes (frodo + sam being taken into gondor, merry and pippen tricking the ents to help). i also had a few qualms about some of the overall directing on the film. i felt that the climatic battle scene did not achieve the full effect it could have by the constant cutting away to other events, i mean after a good 20 min of build up i was ready and excited for the battle to get rolling, only for it to be start and stop and really seem to drag on. also,how many rotating helicopter shots can occur in one film and way too much gimili as comic releif. i also felt that the movie was a little too long, maybe 10-15 min shorter would have been perfect. i would of cut out the aragon near-death scenes and the stuff with hugo weaving (not all the aarown stuff) but added more to the relationship between merry and pippin and the ents. on the other hand i felt that the gandalf-balrog fight was awesome and better visually than as described in the book. pj also did a good job interspersing the various plot elements from what in the book are nearly 2 different stories. i must admit that my expectations were through the roof for this film, so it was a bit of a letdown, but overall a fine movie. i f you haven't read the books very, very;22 December 2002;9;['good', 'first', 'real', 'few', 'long', 'interesting', 'umpteen', 'other', 'interesting', 'most', 'lengthy', 'complex', 'comprehensible', 'cool', 'new', 'few', 'overall', 'climatic', 'full', 'constant', 'other', 'good', 'ready', 'excited', 'many', 'much', 'comic', 'little', 'long', 'short', 'perfect', 'near', 'aarown', 'other', 'gandalf', 'awesome', 'good', 'various', 'different', 'fine'];0.2262281910009183
1446;fjordboy;"this movie was very different from fotr, in many ways. first of all, the movie and book is mostly battle. the battle of helm's deep is probably the focal point of the entire movie, so the movie is significantly more violent than the first. if you're faint at heart, and don't like seeing orcs die, then you might want to consider watching ""bambi"" or something else instead. the cinematography in the movie was...once again, astounding. one particular shot that runs in my mind is when aragorn retraces the steps of merry and pippin...the flashbacks between aragorn (present) and pippin and merry (past) are excellent. a few other notable shots include when aragorn picks up the lorien leaf that the hobbits leave behind; when aragorn walks through the double doors, and (this one is incredible) when frodo attacks samwise (watch his blade..this shot is incredible). of course the landscapes and the battle scenes are great too, those are just a few particular shots that i remember. there are several things that i really loved and enjoyed about the movie. i'll make a brief list of them here: the introduction starting outside the mountain hearing what is going on inside and then gandalf falling/fighting the balrog; grima wormtongue. perfect casting..you couldn't get any slimier than that! ; the wargs (though they sort of looked too cute... ; the ents...oh my..the ents were spectacular. ; the destruction of isengard! i just wish they would have shown more of it. ; the battle of helm's deep. i know this is like half the movie...but it was great! there were a few changes from the book, but i won't mention them (i don't want to spoil the movie too much), but if you want to mention them, go ahead and post comments. i'll back up every (almost) change that jackson made...even what jackson did to faramir. there weren't too many things i didn't like..but the first and foremost is probably the entmoot...that is the one change that i think jackson shouldn't have made. also...we didn't get to see treebeard's ""house."" that was a shame. i really wanted to see the table and the ent draught. i also didn't like the dwarf tossing joke (yes..*another* dwarf tossing joke...sheesh!) and i didn't like what frodo saw in the dead marshes. peter jackson (even he admits this), took more creative liberties with this movie than any of the lord of the rings films (released and unreleased). knowing this before i went into the movie, i was a little worried. i figured he had cut something big out...or added something stupid in. but, in the end, i can appreciate almost all the changes he made (with the possible exception of the entmoot), and i think this movie was once again a winner! thanks to everyone who made it! it was great!";19 December 2002;10;['different', 'many', 'focal', 'entire', 'violent', 'first', 'faint', 'bambi', 'astounding', 'particular', 'aragorn', 'present', 'excellent', 'few', 'other', 'notable', 'lorien', 'aragorn', 'double', 'incredible', 'incredible', 'great', 'few', 'particular', 'several', 'brief', 'gandalf', 'perfect', 'slimy', 'cute', 'spectacular', 'more', 'deep', 'great', 'few', 'many', 'first', 'foremost', 'dead', 'creative', 'little', 'worried', 'big', 'stupid', 'possible', 'great'];0.2167792792792792

1452;randythetool;"first things first: before seeing this the two towers, you should rid yourself of the notion that it can compare to the novel. film translations of novels rarely do, and this is no exception. now that you have that out of the way, you can prepare to be visually stunned by one of the most magnificent motion pictures i've seen, and be disappointed by the script that ruins it. yes, that's right, the script that ruins it. the fellowship of the ring was ambitious. it was true to the text, as much as a film so ""hollywood"" could be. it was true to tolkien. it wasn't about the uruk'hai combination of orcs and goblins, or aragorn swinging swords, or legolas shooting arrows - it was about a delightful cast of characters, all united in a common goal. a fitting sequel to this film would be delightful. instead, we have the two towers, an action movie in middle earth's world, with a story similar to tolkien's text. packed with one-liners, epic battles, special effects, and (believe it or not), explosions, the two towers is every war movie you've seen, set in a fantasy background, redeemed only by the most beautiful cinematography to grace the screen this year. andrew lesnie saves this film, plain and simple. his camera shows perfectly how hopeless every character in this movie feels, or, are told they should feel. his frame is dark and dismal, in green, blue, and grey through the bulk of the three hours - a great contrast from the bright colors of fellowship. in the first film, the characters showed us hope, and now, they show despair. the helm's deep battle is magnificent to look at, but really, the rest of the film builds to it. lesnie probably should not get all of the credit for this, as peter jackson's directing is superb in its own right. jackson is unafraid to use all of the screen, and with the use of sweeping airborne cameras, he uses sometimes three or four times the size of the screen. the computer animation is first-rate, and there were times when i knew what i was looking at was false, but could not tell. gollum's character is entirely computer animated, and provides the most interesting character in this film - in fact, one of only two. gollum is a split personality - his entire being wishes to have the ring, if you'll recall from fellowship, but half of him wishes to help frodo and sam, and the other half wants to take the ring for himself. i'm not sure if each personality has a name, but frodo calls him smeagol throughout the movie, so i would assume the good half is smeagol, and the evil half is gollum - the film is not clear on this subject. either way, gollum/smeagol talking to himself, across personae, provides the single best scene in the film. quite unfortunate that a host of human actors could not reach the emotional intensity of a series of zeroes and ones. the other interesting character is theodan, king of rohan, played quite well by bernard hill. he is the only face in the film that truly captures how bleak the future is, epitomized in a scene before the epic helm's deep battle. theoden realizes that his army has no chance of defending their last stronghold, but has no other options. his talent should have been served with better writing. that would truly be something. the script is your standard action movie fare. dialog is swift, contains few details, and is rushed along to the next action sequence. elrond and arwen, the elves, return for a short while in this chapter, which has little purpose in this film. no doubt their scenes are more poignant in the extended version, which will be released next christmas season, and, no doubt, be the same drivel we've seen in this ""shortened"" version. i look forward to the extended version of this film. i have low expectations, if the scenes we have here are the ones they decided not to delete, i'm not sure i want to see the ones they took out. however, where the fellowship of the ring earned three and a half stars from me, the extended version gets four. maybe the two towers' extension will get three. i hope we're just being teased with the two towers, because i have high expectations for the return of the king. it would be a shame to see a project that started so ambitiously fall to the formula of the trilogy.";19 December 2002;4;['first', 'magnificent', 'right', 'ambitious', 'true', 'true', 'delightful', 'common', 'fitting', 'delightful', 'middle', 'similar', 'epic', 'special', 'beautiful', 'plain', 'simple', 'hopeless', 'dark', 'dismal', 'green', 'blue', 'great', 'bright', 'first', 'deep', 'magnificent', 'superb', 'own', 'unafraid', 'airborne', 'first', 'false', 'interesting', 'split', 'entire', 'other', 'sure', 'good', 'evil', 'clear', 'single', 'good', 'unfortunate', 'human', 'emotional', 'other', 'interesting', 'only', 'bleak', 'epic', 'deep', 'last', 'other', 'well', 'standard', 'swift', 'few', 'next', 'short', 'little', 'poignant', 'extended', 'next', 'same', 'extended', 'low', 'sure', 'extended', 'high'];0.1675773809523809
1453;nicoamil;"well, what to say when you see a movie you've been imagining for 7 years... it is really hard to throw away prejudices and preconcepts. i think the result of this adaptation is more than acceptable, in fact, an excellent product. great action, the love story, superb fx, nice and respectable stars, the drama, the commedy. it has all that it has to have. but then, as a lotr fan, i feel very very dissappointed with some points. first of all, it makes me feel sad to see that the acting, the best interpretation, the scene that better shows the spirit of theater and acting is the one of gollum ""struggling"" with smeagol. the best actor is computer created, without forgetting the surelly hard work (and very good one) of andy serkis. now on to the characters. i was pissed off when i saw aragorn giving the daggers to the hobbits and i understood that no tom bombadil will be in fotr. i said, ""ok, it's a whole new character and lot of time for something that, truly, doesn't affect so much the storyline"". something similar with arwen and glorfindel; but now, when gollum decides to take frodo and sam to shelob's lair, it decides so because of frodo ""betrays"" him. in the books, and i've already said that i'm a fan and cannot throw my concepts, gollum takes the two hobbits to shelob because of sam, and this is one of the most important things in sam's character. like frodo hasn't enough, jackson took it off of sam to give it to frodo. hey! sam already exists, you don't have to make a new character!!! this makes me sad too. but with faramir, what jackson did to faramir makes me not sad but very p***ed off. this faramir is totally opposed to the faramir of the books. he was one of the noblest and wisest characters, even being very young, and there was a very big difference between boromir and faramir. i can't see this difference in the movie. man, faramir resisted the temptation of the ring almost without effort, and here he don't have the chance to get out of the shadow of his big brohter. in fact, it doesn't even seems to bother him... it is a good movie, really well done, but for someone who have already created and recreated the characters, it will be a little difficult to accept some of these changes. anyway, everyone should see it once or twice.";2 January 2003;7;['hard', 'more', 'acceptable', 'excellent', 'great', 'nice', 'respectable', 'lotr', 'dissappointed', 'sad', 'good', 'good', 'hard', 'good', 'whole', 'new', 'similar', 'important', 'enough', 'new', 'sad', 'sad', 'opposed', 'noble', 'wise', 'young', 'big', 'big', 'good', 'little', 'difficult'];0.2111812570145904

1455;jerman13;another fantastic layer to the film is the art direction, which is not only elegant and organic at times, but rugged and industrial. it also fabricates a realism into itself that creates infinite impact on the audience. the cast is also very good, they play off each other perfectly, different nationalities keeping each character fresh and interesting. due to the huge number of characters in this film, i will only mention the most notable performances: as far as hobbits go, elijah wood gives us a brilliant transformation from a wide-eyed innocent to a paranoid ring-junkie. sean astin gives us a beautiful portrayal of boundless friendship and unlikely courage. dominic monaghan and billy boyd provide delightful comic relief when together, compelling character development when apart. ian holm has only a small amount of screen time, but in it he is incredibly memorable as bilbo. ian mckellen is powerful as gandalf, as well as providing hope and exposition along the long journey. now we come to the miss-matched three musketeers: viggo mortensen is powerful, rugged, and tortured as aragorn, where as orlando bloom and john-rhys davies are both simply awesome when they get to play off each other. when it comes to sean bean as boromir, during the course of the story, he does a villainous deed, but we still feel sympathy for him, as we do for his younger brother, faramir, played to perfection by david whenham, who strives to please his father by emulating boromir. i see no reason why john noble, who plays denethor, the tragic, corrupt father of the two sons mentioned earlier, should'not receive an oscar for his shakespearean performance. the film also holds its own brand of visual amazement. combining fantastic lighting that further effects the tone of a particular scene, elaborate sword fights that give each character their own method of fighting, incredible action scenes including a single warrior climbing a giant elephant and single-handedly taking him down, 2,000 horses sliding down a hillside, a giant staircase falling down a chasm, a man and a fiery beast fighting while falling miles down a tunnel into an underground lake, and a mile-high tower falling and exploding on it's way down, and dynamic camera moves, that include something of a roller coaster ride through massive tunnels, a minute-long shot of a moth flying over a tower, or a pan past a mile-high life-like statue of a forgotten king. in a film with so much spectacle, cgi is expected, but here, not even noticeable. giant monsters, cgi sets and landscapes, and fabricated armies, all flawlessly integrated into the film by a computer, looking as real as if they were all there right in front of the camera. but for all the films technical achievements, they hail in comparison to one: gollum. his movements are flawless, his voice perfect, his amazingly realistic flesh tones breathtaking. whether you hate him, pity him, or identify with him, is your decision. the film portrays him in such a way, unbiased, unprejudiced. but one thing we can all agree on, he is quite simply, one of the greatest technical achievements of all time.;8 March 2009;10;['fantastic', 'elegant', 'organic', 'rugged', 'industrial', 'infinite', 'good', 'other', 'different', 'fresh', 'interesting', 'huge', 'notable', 'brilliant', 'eyed', 'innocent', 'paranoid', 'beautiful', 'boundless', 'unlikely', 'dominic', 'delightful', 'comic', 'compelling', 'small', 'memorable', 'powerful', 'long', 'powerful', 'rugged', 'aragorn', 'awesome', 'other', 'villainous', 'young', 'tragic', 'corrupt', 'shakespearean', 'own', 'visual', 'fantastic', 'further', 'particular', 'elaborate', 'own', 'incredible', 'single', 'giant', 'giant', 'fiery', 'underground', 'high', 'dynamic', 'massive', 'long', 'high', 'like', 'much', 'noticeable', 'giant', 'real', 'technical', 'flawless', 'perfect', 'realistic', 'unbiased', 'unprejudiced', 'great', 'technical'];0.2614098972922501

1457;mdlarumbe;this movie presented me with a dilemma. i read and loved the book, and i sure did like the first one. i realize that to make a movie you can't just follow the book (that would take at least a 20 hour movie) but why waste time in details shown in the book while discarding some important effects the book causes? for example, frodo's journey becomes unbearable in the book, here it only seems like a long walk, only uncomfortable. and the story, honestly, becomes to slow and long for a movie. it's ok for the book to be slow because it gives us time to enjoy the details of tolkien's work, but in the movie is just a waste of time. besides all it's downsides, it has most of what people should expect: absolutely amazing special effects, gollum is as real as it gets and the battle scene it's marvellous, but it comes too late. my girlfriend didn't read the book and thought the movie was allright, not as surprising as the first one, but good. so, to sum it up, for me it can barely make it. it has a 10 in special effects, but a 2 in the plot.;4 January 2003;3;['first', 'least', 'important', 'unbearable', 'long', 'uncomfortable', 'long', 'ok', 'slow', 'most', 'amazing', 'special', 'real', 'marvellous', 'surprising', 'first', 'good', 'special'];0.2258928571428571

1459;dshand_316;upon first viewing of this movie, i came away from the theatre disappointed. i had just finished re-reading the book and all the characters and events were fresh in my mind. i expected to see on film the exact images i had read on paper. unfortunately this soured my movie experience and i seemed to spend most of the time looking for all the changes and debating with myself if i agreed or disagreed with them. i guess i fell into the trap and even thou i knew, i did not heed the words 'the two towers the movie - based on the books by tolkien'. anyway finally went and watched it again. sat back, relaxed, cleared my mind and went for a ride. the amazing detail that went into all the scenes is just mind blowing. the battles were fantastic. as an fantasy / action epic this movie gives you everything you would expect and more. the downside is that some of the new characters do not get a chance to develop fully with the exception of gollum. he was cleverly portrayed and all to entirely believable. there were several scenes that did not feel quite right like at the end with farimir and frodo. overall a highly enjoyable way to past 3 hours. if you like to escape into a fantasy realm you can't go wrong.;6 February 2003;9;['first', 'fresh', 'exact', 'most', 'relaxed', 'amazing', 'fantastic', 'more', 'new', 'believable', 'several', 'right', 'enjoyable', 'wrong'];0.2863136863136863

1467;briman180;warning! possible spoilers! i think it's silly and stupid that so many people think that ttt should follow the book so closely, hello! its a movie people! if peter jackson were to follow those books like you wanted him too it would make them even longer, and as far as i'm concerned they're long enough, (though still a good movie). as for adding in scenes that were not in the book, peter did this because unfortunately tolkien did not think it would be good to have even a shred of an important female character, this would leave the female audience something sadly lacking if he didn't exagerate some of his parts a bit. as for the unneeded river scene, although i don't care for it it's not like it ruined the movie. if you guys have to be so stuck up and just look at the parts he added or deleted and think of how that doesn't follow the book you shouldn't even watch movies to begin with. a movie should not follow the book word for word, it should have something extra that the director adds to make it his own. i would be angry, actually, if he kept everything, it's not like he took out anything so major it wrecks the movie. ttt is, right now, my favorite movie of all time. yes, i've read the books and so have all my friends and it is still our favorite movie. if you guys want to go trash it just because it didn't follow the books perfectly at least think movies need something a bit more that books don't have (and vice versa). anyway, i just had to write this down because it's really irritating me that so many people think movies should reflect books. as far as this movie goes i think it is 10/10. it really is a great movie, it has something for everyone. action, romance, suspense and even a bit of comedy. i love how they captured the characters and i believe it really does follow the book nicely, as far as movies should go that is.;24 December 2002;10;['possible', 'silly', 'stupid', 'many', 'concerned', 'good', 'good', 'important', 'female', 'female', 'unneeded', 'stuck', 'extra', 'own', 'angry', 'major', 'favorite', 'favorite', 'least', 'more', 'many', 'great'];0.1927631578947368

1469;evanhalikias;people thought that making a movie of the lord of the rings would be an impossible task with its variety of environment and complex characters but peter jackson made it look easy. he combined action with depth and an unbeatable cast to pull such a thing off. in my opinion this will be considered a great for decades. if you know anything about writing you should know that a screenplay is very different from a book. turning a book into a movie is no easy task. i admit that jackson added a few things and left some things out but he had to. he had a flow and had to stick with it. he focused more on helms deep than the other scenes but that is what he had to do. i you have not seen the movie and are reading this let me tell you this: you will have a wide smile on your face the whole three hours. i know that i did. it is one of those movies where you feel like you are with them and you want to jump into the screen and help them. it is an enjoyment very hard to find, especially in a movie. if you read the book right before you go, don't look for things that really happened and things that are made up, but just watch the movie. on top of its correctness to the book, it is also a 5 star movie. one of my favorites at that.;4 January 2003;10;['impossible', 'complex', 'easy', 'unbeatable', 'great', 'different', 'easy', 'few', 'deep', 'other', 'wide', 'whole'];0.0431818181818182

1486;cardmongerkaren;the movie was about as interesting to watch as a dripping faucet. it doesn't do the book any justice. perhaps the most irksome feature is the fact that the classic novel is so grossly tampered with in order to accommodate well-known hollywood actors (particularly the character of arwen, played by the poorly-casted liv tyler). if the idea is to incorporate more female characters, they did a terrible job, as the arwen scenes basically involve overly illuminated close ups of her face contorting into various crying scenes. as for other female characters, eowyn is decent but doesn't live up to what i imagined her to be like in the book (strong, steadfast), but at least she gets some coverage. galadriel is wonderfully portrayed by cate blanchett but her role is minuscule. anyway, enough of that. there were some good scenes, like when the hobbits meet treebeard, and most scenes involving frodo were decent although gollum is way too cute to be anything like the book's version. worm tongue is also weak (not creepy enough). so my main issues are poor character renditions and alteration of plot. wish they'd stuck to the story more accurately instead of turning it into a cheesy soap opera.;3 March 2012;2;['interesting', 'dripping', 'irksome', 'classic', 'more', 'female', 'terrible', 'close', 'various', 'other', 'female', 'decent', 'strong', 'steadfast', 'least', 'minuscule', 'enough', 'good', 'most', 'decent', 'cute', 'weak', 'main', 'poor'];0.0999999999999999

1500;Elwen;"it is, perhaps, possible to imagine a place in which dreams and stories lie hidden beyond the boundaries of silence, beyond distance and pain; a place in which they lie waiting to be discovered with trepidation and warmth. maybe it is easy to believe that, no matter how tired and defeated these stories may feel, the essence of that which once made them complete still remains inside, untouched, clean, virgin. waiting in silence to be discovered, to be understood, to be brought to light. it is clear by now that j. r. r. tolkien's epic saga 'the lord of the rings' is perhaps one of the most accomplished works of literature. the scope and reach of his tale has been discussed in countless essays and articles, with millions of fans throughout the world. but to translate his work to screen seemed like an impossible task to undertake by anyone. there is no doubt in my mind that peter jackson's the two towers has accomplished this, and more, by bringing the story to life with such passion that words fail me at this moment. i think, and i say this with a small hint of suspicion in my tone, that i am still under some kind of spell. the seconds go by incredibly slow as i watch in delight every single movement that the tree outside my window is making. right now it appears to be covered in mist, almost as if a small fluffy cloud decided to come down and rest outside my window. the tree is shaking its branches vigorously, trying, to no avail, to shake off the impalpable intruder. transfixed as i may be, i feel the necessity to put into words what this movie has left in me. this is not an ordinary review i must warn you. in it you will find no plot summary, there will be no word about the specific turns and twists; that task i leave to you. no, this is an intimate look at peter jackson's the two towers. a persistent feeling of urgency and oncoming darkness creeping into middle earth is ever present during the story. the scope is grand but at the same time it feels more intimate and personal. the stakes are high but the characters have grown so much since we were first introduced to them that you feel every word and every wince of pain coming out of their faces. i could try to sum it all with a collection of simple, unobtrusive sentences. stuff like, andy serkis' gollum is by far the best character work in the movie. or maybe, the direction and work from the production team is flawless and inspired. this would be too easy, too simplistic. i don't want to do that. i find that right now my thoughts wander off into directions and places unfamiliar to me, unfamiliar not because i am not aware of their existence, but simply because only hints and images existed of them inside my own drifting heart. it took the two towers to awaken them. this collection of almost-familiar thoughts lie at the center of my desires and hopes, breathing life unto them with their mystery and beauty. they move through time and space, going back and forth between those images from the movie that i now hold dear in my heart, and that remarkable unspoken word which controls my nightmares and my dreams, all too often resting in the memory of someone else's puzzling reality. the two towers reminds me just how fragile and precious our own existence really is; these things, hidden as though they may be to unscrupulous eyes, will still be with me until the end of my days. such flurry of thoughts awake a sense of sheer blissfulness when i think of what lies ahead, when i dare to dream the dream when i'm awake. the length of my words can barely capture the state in which my mind is right now. thank you to all involved in the making of this movie.";18 December 2002;10;['possible', 'easy', 'tired', 'complete', 'untouched', 'clean', 'clear', 'epic', 'accomplished', 'countless', 'impossible', 'more', 'such', 'small', 'slow', 'single', 'small', 'fluffy', 'impalpable', 'ordinary', 'specific', 'intimate', 'persistent', 'oncoming', 'middle', 'present', 'grand', 'same', 'intimate', 'personal', 'high', 'simple', 'unobtrusive', 'good', 'flawless', 'easy', 'simplistic', 'unfamiliar', 'unfamiliar', 'aware', 'own', 'familiar', 'dear', 'remarkable', 'unspoken', 'fragile', 'precious', 'own', 'unscrupulous', 'such', 'sheer', 'awake'];0.1263472706155633

1516;vtah236;"there is something mildly offensive about people in this forum taking issue with 'nitpickers'. this attitude is wrong because it takes as its assumption that a work such as the two towers is beyond criticism, and how dare anyone find fault with it? there are two threads to the pro- and anti- ttt arguments: those who compare the film with the book, and those who comment on just the film. a body of work such as tolkien's trilogy is bound to have a plethora of devoted defenders, and their opinions on the divergence of the film plot from the books are valid. the issue i have against this argument is that a faithful reproduction of the books onto film would have been tedious: the council of elrond from the fellowship of the ring was over 10,000 words long!; the battle of the ents on the film of ttt took place in real-time, whereas in the book it happens in retrospect (arguably, like in the conventions of classical greek drama, adding to the sense of surprise by having minor characters describe something that has happened in the past). jackson's treatment of ttt is good, but not brilliant. the other breathless reviews of this film reflect an unquestioning readiness to be seduced by overwhelming spectacle. there are nevertheless some elements for which jackson deserves praise: the rendering of gollum into a genuinely pitiable character; the beefing up of faramir's character and role (the antithesis of which works well in the book, but would have made this episode pointless in the film if he hadn't been seen to be a more aggressive character - probably a jackson decision to darken gondor's predicament prior to the climactic conflict in the final film); the warg battle and aragorn's interlude; the suspiciously arab-looking human allies of sauron being both mysterious, mute and menacing; grima wormtongue's tears when he sees saruman's army; and my favourite bit - the representation of fangorn forest as something mildly sinister and the genuinely quite sweet looking ents. the battle of helm's deep could have been shortened, though my main gripe is with the absolutely pointless introduction of haldir and his doomed elf stormtroopers. jackson's adjustments up to this point can be explained away under the protection of dramatic licence i.e. to speed the plot along, but what was the point of the elves? that they didn't appear at this point in the book is a minor point, what is unforgivable is that in an already over-lengthy battle scene, their introduction served absolutely no dramatic purpose. i would even go so far to say that it spoiled this episode: it pointlessly lightened the mood as the forces of darkness were closing in on the refugees and small force of human soldiers. maybe jackson has a thing about bows and arrows. on paper, the climactic battle of gondor reads better than helm's deep, and i am hoping that the film of the return of the king will be as thrilling as the literary version. overall, ttt is a good film, but the fellowship was better.";3 January 2003;7;['offensive', 'wrong', 'such', 'such', 'devoted', 'valid', 'faithful', 'tedious', 'long', 'real', 'classical', 'minor', 'good', 'brilliant', 'other', 'overwhelming', 'pitiable', 'aggressive', 'darken', 'climactic', 'final', 'human', 'mysterious', 'menacing', 'favourite', 'fangorn', 'sinister', 'sweet', 'deep', 'main', 'pointless', 'dramatic', 'minor', 'unforgivable', 'lengthy', 'dramatic', 'small', 'human', 'climactic', 'deep', 'thrilling', 'literary', 'good', 'well'];-0.0163793103448275

1524;Maximus Decimus Meridius;"i saw ttt this friday and it was great. i suppose that a fear/criticism of this whole film trilogy was whether or not it would uphold the book's integrity. for the most part it did which was nice (you'll recognize some slight changes when you see the film). it is a great supplement for me as it gives me a more vivid picture of tolkien's imagination a picture that we as fans try to capture when we read the books. i really enjoyed the whole world that jackson has created and the wardrobe is excellent. but i suppose the 2 things that set this movie apart from many other epic dramas/myth is indeed the battle scenes and of course smeagol. i can only say about the battles that they are spectacular and that any description one could give would bring them shame-you must experience it. as for gollum, i hate to admit it being a die-hard sw fan, but perhaps he surpassed yoda as cg character of the year. and as jackson has learned some things about action and battle from gl, i looking forward to sw ep.iii to once again set a precedence in epic film making. coming into it, aragorn and mithrandir have always been my favorite characters and they really showcased their skills. i really like how they are portraying the love story, miranda otto looked beautiful and her role as a ""shield-maiden"" was very believable-she had passion, class and strength but also a tenderness which is exactly the way tolkien wrote it and intended it to be. my only criticism, it ended- believe me you'll be on the edge of your seat for 3 hours and time will fly but truly it was wonderful well except for some scenes with frodo, samwise and gollum that may have dragged. however my verdict: give this movie 10/10. as an endnote there is this really funny scene with gollum,(you'll recognize when you see it) this i think was the kind of comic relief that gl hoped for with jar jar, but failed miserably as the scenes with gollum were subtle- first time i saw him, i thought not another cg disaster but by the end, i was very satisfied with smeagol's portrayal. the ents also looked awesome, they were a treat to watch. hard core fans of the book will not be disappointed, nor will the general fans of action and adventure.";21 December 2002;10;['great', 'whole', 'most', 'nice', 'slight', 'great', 'vivid', 'whole', 'excellent', 'many', 'other', 'epic', 'spectacular', 'die', 'hard', 'epic', 'favorite', 'beautiful', 'believable', 'only', 'wonderful', 'funny', 'comic', 'first', 'satisfied', 'awesome', 'hard', 'general'];0.3629629629629629

1549;hopealso;perhaps it was the fate of the 'middle film' in the series, but two towers suffers from excessive plot and excessive pulls to the heart-strings to match. it seemed that every character with at least a five minute span of character development eventually got their own democratic turn at dramatic lighting and sappy music with us all supposedly marveling at their remarkable valor as they marched into their next challenge. after about three or four turns at that and about an hour and a half into the movie, i began wondering when the intermission was going to be. the problem was, given very little time to get to know these characters, we began to wonder why we should care about their valiant acts or their noble deaths. i'm not sure that i can forgive the almost predictable, certainly tiresome, and problematically vapid bravado of the film to simply an excess of things going on. the beauty of the film and the worthwhile performances of the cast might have induced me to forgive the relative lack of depth or magic in this rendering, had i not felt that i was being clumsily and unsuccessfully manipulated at every turn. i very much enjoyed fellowship due to a skill i saw in distilling tolkien's complex world into a meaningful exploration of character difference and temptation, as regarded each character's current and historical relationship to the ring of power. this film continues to do so in the sequences that are perhaps the most rewarding, those involving the trio of frodo, sam, and gollum, a bizarre relationship but psychologically riveting. we understand the complexity of the task of frodo through both his own tortured visage and the reactions of those around him. conversely, the minute long introduction sequence between aragorn and his new would be human love interest is hardly enough to inspire us to any level of emotional involvement, yet somehow we are supposed to believe that this two sentence exchange should be enough to carry the sub-plot through the rest of the film. there is simply far too much that happens in this film for us to even understand the depth of what is going on, and there are far too many times when we are left with the feeling that at this moment we are expected to be moved to tears. whiplash is probably a better description for the reaction. despite my disappointment in the two towers, i still do look forward to the final film. this film never relents in its lively and magnetic exposition of a rich other world. despite its inability to rouse me to any heights of passion in the battle of good versus evil, i am left still anxious to watch 'what happens next'.;22 December 2002;4;['middle', 'excessive', 'excessive', 'least', 'own', 'democratic', 'dramatic', 'sappy', 'remarkable', 'next', 'little', 'valiant', 'noble', 'sure', 'predictable', 'tiresome', 'worthwhile', 'relative', 'complex', 'meaningful', 'current', 'historical', 'rewarding', 'bizarre', 'riveting', 'own', 'tortured', 'minute', 'long', 'new', 'human', 'enough', 'emotional', 'enough', 'much', 'many', 'well', 'final', 'lively', 'magnetic', 'rich', 'other', 'anxious'];0.1071969696969697

1553;Jeroen van Dam;after seeing lotr the two towers i only regret that it takes another year to see the final ending of this epic saga. of course, having read the book several times, i know how it will end, but i'm very curious how peter jackson will adapt it to the screen. judging by this second installment i imagine it will also be grand in every aspect. watching ttt was an amazing experience with many highlights. first of all there is of course the creature gollum, which is 'made' absolutely astonishing. other highlights include the battle at helms deep as well as the fight between gandalf the grey and the balrog. for the comic-relief this movie relies on excellent one-liners from gimli. there are however also some parts that worked less for me. personally i was not fond of the side-plot with treebeard in the book and i don't care for it much in the movie. however, it is essential to the story, so who am i to complain. what i also did not enjoy was talking orcs (can't remember them as being whiners...) and can somebody explain to me what the deal is with the immortality of elves? all these little things aside, peter jackson created another masterpiece in which we follow the trail of three separate groups in their quest against mordor and survival of mankind and middle earth. jackson deemed it unnecessary to recap the stories from the first movie. rightfully so, i would say, because if you have not seen the fellowship there is no real point in watching the two towers. there is some reference to some loose ends the fellowship left (what happened to gandalf, who is gollum etc), but never too much. anybody who enjoyed the fellowship will also enjoy the two towers. the movie did not feel like three hours and leaves the audience craving for more. and that is good news. i wonder how long people will let the cliffhanger be unsolved. therefor there is a kind request to everybody who already knows how the book ends: don't talk about it in public, because some people don't want to know yet... bring on 'return of the king'!;11 December 2002;10;['final', 'epic', 'several', 'curious', 'second', 'grand', 'amazing', 'many', 'creature', 'astonishing', 'other', 'deep', 'comic', 'excellent', 'gimli', 'fond', 'much', 'essential', 'little', 'separate', 'middle', 'unnecessary', 'first', 'real', 'loose', 'much', 'more', 'good', 'long', 'unsolved', 'kind'];0.1966137123745819

1555;Shin Kyo;"the first lord of the rings movie was great, remarkable, innovative and as close as possible to the book. it is a shame that those are the qualities we don't find in the two towers. first of all, it would have been nice to have some kind of introductory sequence to remind what happened in the first movie. many people don't remember, or haven't even seen it. the only thing we get is a - incredible - scene with gandalf and the balrog that was a good touch, since it is a very obscure part of the book. too bad this was the only modification to the original story that actually helps the sequence of the plot. in fact, this was the most hated aspect of the movie: its lack of fidelity to tolkien's work. some say that peter jackson did this in order to make the history a little easier to understand, and that it is impossible to compile this epic in ""only"" 3 hours. well, if you think you need more time, why including unnecessary scenes, like extending the importance of faramir in the movie? or that scene where the hobbits have to convince treebeard to turn back, only to see the destruction of his own forest? i usually don't mind when changes are made to help the plot, but this is not the case. also, some parts should have been better planned, to cause the desired effect on audience. more than once, i heard laughs in a serious scene, like when legolas throws a shield on some stairs, get on top of it and goes out shooting. it might appear to be just a detail, but perfection is achieved with attention to every little scene. on to the good side. the special effects were wonderfully made. a perfect example for this is gollum, with expressions and movements that could hardly get better. most actors were ok, although not anything special can be said on this area. the plot, even modified by some unknown reason, is still a great classic and will be enjoyable by anyone who have not read the books. my advice is: watch it, have fun, but don't expect this to be the best movie ever, as reading some reviews may suggest. i can only hope peter jackson learns from the things he have done right on the first and wrong on the second to make the last movie of this trilogy a classic to be remembered.";31 December 2002;7;['first', 'great', 'remarkable', 'innovative', 'close', 'possible', 'nice', 'introductory', 'first', 'many', 'only', 'incredible', 'good', 'obscure', 'bad', 'only', 'original', 'easy', 'impossible', 'more', 'unnecessary', 'own', 'serious', 'little', 'good', 'special', 'perfect', 'well', 'most', 'ok', 'special', 'unknown', 'great', 'enjoyable', 'good', 'first', 'wrong', 'second', 'last'];0.283860544217687

1559;aidangill;"peter jackson has clearly rushed through the middle instalment in the lord of the rings cycle, with heavy over-use of cgi effects that may satisfy some but leave this observer mostly cold. in some ways, spending less time on the two towers is justified - after all, it is the weakest link in the original books (the first half of the two towers book is a very weak and ponderous piece of fantasy writing). however, the immense revenue and over-hype surrounding fellowship (the film), along with the indulgence shown to jackson in being permitted to release the 'director's cut' dvd so soon after the original film release, has taken the edge off his directorial skills. three hours is way too long, for a start, particularly in a film which has little in the way of deep dramatic substance. this is really the aragorn-character's film - he is centre stage and what little solid acting has been allowed by the director is usually on view through aragorn. jackson is not helped by tolkien's wandering, skeletal plot - he has done well to bring gollum to the fore and beef up the dialogue for this character (the vocalisation for gollum is excellent - more evil and snivelling i haven't heard in a long time!). it is regrettable, though, that gollum is wholly cgi - it's quite a feat of computer engineering but it is a very long way from being convincing. how many times do the lips truly move in sync with the dialogue, for example? (not many!!) i have read reviews that rave about the helm's deep battle. well on this point, the film couldn't have won me over just because i find extended close-up battle scenes increasingly depressing - does every 'epic' film these days really have to do all this over and over again? but that's my personal subjectivity; as battle scenes go it is rather splendid, but the epic scale is somewhat marred by the anonymity of most of the combatants, and some flawed cgi (though nowhere near as weak as the parasurfing incident in die another day ...). gladiator made much more impact on me. another area in which the original text is weak, thus hampering the film, is the lack of a visible, darth vader-like enemy. here in the film, saruman is relegated almost to a couple of cameo scenes - what a waste of christopher lee! - and of course we never get to see the dreaded sauron (true to the book but jackson has taken welcome liberties with the text this time around, so why not more big bad guy?). the noble exception is brad dourif's excellent wormtongue - he is truly creepy and was, for me, the high point of the film. relegating gimli to a comedy walk-on role, a la c3po in star wars ep 2, is a good thing after the messy performance in fellowship. rhys davies get's a meatier role by far in the voiceover for treebeard - i thought the ents were well realised but almost looking like they were in the wrong film (i.e. would have looked great in a cartoon or a final fantasy-type cgi-only effort). i realise this will be a huge film in terms of popularity and takings, and good luck to peter jackson and the whole team - who, all things considered, are carrying off a marvel in terms of cutting-edge filming techniques. but as a film, it just didn't absorb me; i found the storyline tenuous and much less coherent than in fellowship; i thought the cgi dominated the film, usually not to its benefit; and i left feeling impressed but a long way from being thrilled. it's a money machine now, and the books really don't stand up to critical scrutiny sufficiently to carry off the 'epic' tag for the film that many are lavishing on it. a film to reflect on in a few years' time - after the hype - to see just how it stands up in the hall of fame.";24 December 2002;5;['middle', 'heavy', 'cold', 'less', 'weak', 'original', 'first', 'weak', 'ponderous', 'immense', 'original', 'directorial', 'little', 'deep', 'dramatic', 'aragorn', 'centre', 'little', 'solid', 'skeletal', 'excellent', 'evil', 'long', 'regrettable', 'long', 'convincing', 'many', 'many', 'deep', 'extended', 'close', 'depressing', 'epic', 'personal', 'splendid', 'epic', 'most', 'flawed', 'weak', 'more', 'original', 'weak', 'visible', 'like', 'dreaded', 'true', 'welcome', 'big', 'bad', 'noble', 'brad', 'excellent', 'creepy', 'high', 'good', 'messy', 'meaty', 'treebeard', 'wrong', 'great', 'final', 'only', 'huge', 'good', 'whole', 'tenuous', 'coherent', 'impressed', 'long', 'critical', 'epic', 'many', 'few'];0.1050574712643678

1564;tangyiru;i like the previous movie better than this one. i think this movie is putting too much effort on action and view (i do like the view though).many main characteristics are no longer colorful such as gandolf, fordo ....(on the contray, some minor characteristics took over the attention). the long war scene is splendid but lack of details. it is impossible for them to beat so many enemy but they could play it more clever such as set some snack or use fire or water, which could make their final victory make more sense. but in the movie, there is just fight and blood, no wise, no trick, no really moving story. and finally, i don't believe gandolf can find such a large army. watch the two forces of army running towards each other, i felt unreal, and somewhat just like playing a silly game.;23 December 2002;7;['previous', 'well', 'much', 'main', 'colorful', 'such', 'minor', 'long', 'splendid', 'impossible', 'many', 'clever', 'such', 'final', 'more', 'wise', 'large', 'other', 'unreal', 'silly'];0.1072128851540616
1565;aji-mohan-1980;peter jackson's lord of the rings: the two towers stands out as the second best of the trilogy, the first being the fellowship. the directive skills of peter jackson and how he managed to draw up nearly six units working together, is really awesome. the cinematography of andrew lesnie is very enthralling and i think he must have won the best cinematographer award for all the three movies. the guys at weta digital are really marvellous. its because of their imagination that we got to see such a spectacular portrayal of moving images on the screen. hats off to stephen regelous for creating the massive crowd developer software, which was used in the battle scenes. the soundtrack by howard shore is mind-blowing and the track, gollum's song by emiliana torrini stands out. the creation of the fully computer generated creature, gollum is the highlight of the three movies. its really amazing how such a character can be created using the keyboard and mouse of a computer. each of its facial expression seems to be so realist, just like a human being. andy serkis's performance as gollum is awesome. gimli, the dwarf provide some humour to the movie, when all the other characters speak only serious stuff. i liked the helm's deep battle scene, where he asks aragorn to throw him into the crowd of orcs at the gate, provided he does not tell the elves about it. frankly speaking, i have never read the lord of the rings books before watching the movie. but the movie has left me captivated into thinking how the imagination of human beings work. its so marvellous. i guarantee that it is going to be the greatest movie for a long, long time to come.;18 April 2007;10;['second', 'good', 'first', 'awesome', 'enthralling', 'good', 'weta', 'marvellous', 'spectacular', 'regelous', 'massive', 'amazing', 'such', 'facial', 'realist', 'human', 'awesome', 'gimli', 'other', 'serious', 'deep', 'aragorn', 'human', 'marvellous', 'great', 'long', 'long'];0.2679824561403509
1566;johnnybjhb;i saw this film in 2003, before the release of return of the king. of course i had already seen the fellowship and loved it. i found two towers to surpass it. upon viewing return of the king, i felt it was the best. now i find myself saying two towers is the best because it is a much stronger film that 3. i hope i'm not including spoilers, but the battle of helm's deep was more exhilarating than minas-tirith, gollum was better (not visually but spiritually) that in 3, and above all it had a sad and slightly depressed feel compared to the other films. even though return of the king is a great conclusion for the series, two towers is a better film with more emotional depth.;26 April 2007;10;['good', 'good', 'strong', 'deep', 'exhilarating', 'well', 'sad', 'depressed', 'other', 'great', 'well', 'more', 'emotional'];0.3208333333333333

""the rope burnss usss!"", ok, frodo takes it off of him, perfect interaction. the battle of helm's deep is another sequence that is just breathtaking. you want 10,000+ orcs fighting a few thousand men, elves and of course a certain dwarf? no problem. you want an army of ents destroying isengard? no problem. you want the second installment of tolkein's masterpiece? go to your local movie theater as soon as possible. step aside ilm, there's a new crew in town.";18 December 2002;10;['possible', 'last', 'amazed', 'close', 'more', 'first', 'last', 'alive', 'perfect', 'real', 'perfect', 'few', 'certain', 'second', 'local', 'possible', 'new'];0.2143320964749536
1568;sdijkstra;"right after watching lotr, the group i was with - all of whom having read the trilogy several times - started debating whether this one was truer or less true to the original than fellowship was. even moreso than with fotr, we concluded quite quickly that we didn't *care* about these deviations. the score was much more balanced than fotr. i have read many times that howard shore has composed the score for the entire trilogy as one piece of music, however the wagnerian usage of themes was a lot less obvious in this installment than it was in fellowship. furthermore, where in fotr gimli was a little too recognizable as a standard john rhys-davies character, in ttt he appears more ""natural"" in his fumbling, quirky behavior, probably because he knows when to keep his mouth shut. in short, i found his character to be a nuisance in fotr, and a great source of comic relief in ttt. as for the elves, their stance towards humans seemed to have grown more distant and in the case of ""agent smith"" elrond (i can't help it) sometimes almost seems hostile. which of course breeds tension for the love triangle that develops between arwen, eowyn and aragorn - something i anticipate will deepen in part three even though tolkien's original barely scratches the surface. smeagol, in his computer generated glory, is a visual delight if one can call a wretch like him that. his creepy, crawly hideousness goes beyond the human form, so jackson made an excellent choice in putting the latest and the greatest of rendering systems to work, and the end result is simply baffling. especially since the immense pity frodo feels for the creature takes hold of the viewer as well. not bad for a bunch of pixels. also wonderfully done are the ents, whose way of disposing with orcs i couldn't help but find terribly amusing. here you see the splatter artist jackson briefly appear, though the film keeps neatly within its pg-13 borders. there are some weaknesses in the editing storyline, and i am left wondering why this had to be done. probably the alterations made for the battle of helm's deep allow for a grander army to come from isengard without the story losing too much of its credibility, but one wonders whether this could not also have been accomplished by simply doubling the garrison. nevertheless, special praise has to be given for the way vast armies are created with the help of computers, ironically the very machines tolkien was anxious about. i will not go into much detail, but you can very well expect to be swept off your feet by the intensity, the grimness and the sheer magnitude of it all. there has never been a battle on a movie screen with such ferocity and enormity, and one can only speculate what will happen once new line unleashes the third installment of this already epic trilogy. we will see, my precious, we will see... 9.5/10";19 December 2002;10;['several', 'true', 'true', 'original', 'balanced', 'many', 'entire', 'wagnerian', 'obvious', 'little', 'recognizable', 'standard', 'more', 'natural', 'quirky', 'short', 'great', 'comic', 'distant', 'hostile', 'visual', 'creepy', 'crawly', 'human', 'excellent', 'late', 'great', 'immense', 'bad', 'amusing', 'deep', 'much', 'special', 'vast', 'very', 'anxious', 'much', 'sheer', 'such', 'new', 'third', 'epic', 'precious'];0.1348890692640693
1569;ainfigree;"this is probably a pretty controversial opinion but looking at some of the comments left for this film i'm surprised some of you people even bother to air your petty disagreements, so all's fair, i suppose. first of all, a bit of background, as at least one other reviewer doesn't think this film is going to be enjoyed by ""females"". i'm quite happily female, from the uk, and read the books for the first time when i was 11 - more recently to get my memory up to speed too. my problem with ttt - the book - was really that i always got bored in the middle and simply turned off. i'm a pretty intelligent person and avid reader (or so i'd like to think) but something about the middle-end of ttt always put me off. i was, therefore, a bit dubious about seeing the film. however, i was delighted to watch this masterpiece from peter jackson. in my opinion this film is better than fotr - the amazing ratings for fotr are mostly for the visuals and novelty which are obviously very similar in ttt. however this film is extremely gripping and fast paced, with moments of tension and surprise throughout, and extremely strong characterisation of the main players. i disagree with the opinions about faramir and was delighted to see how closely he was played to boromir with the difference showing in faramir's decision, which did not happen earlier because he wasn't aware of boromir's downfall - once he found that out, he laid his life forfeit. good stuff. i also don't think that a few of the other characters in the film were portrayed as weakly as some people make out - did you really see the same film i did, or only what you wanted to believe? one thing that pleased me most as a ukian was the accuracy of the characters' accents throughout. gimli was scottish sometimes and not at others, but other than that everything was spot on - especially all the characters' quaint habit of saying ""can not"" instead of ""can't""! ttt was spectacular, amazing, fantastic (in the fantasy sense of the word), epic, huge, beautiful, emotional and human. i was surprised when the interval came up and astonished that the end happened so quickly, and can't wait for the return of the king to hit our screens!";3 January 2003;10;['controversial', 'surprised', 'petty', 'fair', 'least', 'other', 'female', 'first', 'intelligent', 'avid', 'middle', 'dubious', 'delighted', 'well', 'amazing', 'similar', 'gripping', 'strong', 'main', 'delighted', 'aware', 'good', 'few', 'other', 'same', 'scottish', 'other', 'spectacular', 'amazing', 'fantastic', 'epic', 'huge', 'beautiful', 'emotional', 'human', 'surprised'];0.27734375
1570;the_HAL_9000;"ttt is an excellent continuation of fotr and sets up what we all hope to be a monumental conclusion in rotk. for me, its function as the ""bridge"" in the lotr story is ttt's weakest and greatest achievement. ttt continues the story seamlessly from the first film. without any sort of recap, we are thrust right into all of the protagonists' storylines within minutes of the opening title. at the same time, the film introduces a host of new major players: gollum, the rohirrim, theoden, grima, eowyn, who begin to interact with & deflect the trajectories of fotr protagonists. new expositions, surrounding the state of affairs in rohan, gondor & fangorn, quickly set the table for the drama of ttt and beyond. we are completely engrossed in the new dramatic environment, leaving the fotr behind as valuable backdrop for the new action. it's remarkable how efficiently this is all accomplished. ttt's weakest moments are at its end. the film must somehow provide a climax to resolve the 3-sided plot threads that have been engrossing us for over 2 hours. what happens to the defense of rohan & the ""world of men"", to merry & pippin's recruitment of the ents to fight, and to frodo, sam & gollum's attempts to enter mordor? while all three story-arcs do have great climaxes, in particular the battle at helm's deep, there is no real dramatic resolution. there is even less than in the book, where at least a certain closure is achieved in the confrontation with saruman & grima at orthanc. i guess what all this indicates is that ttt is a masterful ""prequel"" for rotk. we have so many ""loose ends"" that require resolution! in addition to the three major plot lines of the broken fellowship, we still have the arwen/aragorn question, as well as new ones like faramir's fate and eowyn's dilemma! i should add that, as has been said by many, that most everything about the film, the cinematography, acting, cgi, special effects, art direction, casting, musical score, etc. is top notch & at least the equal of fotr. so, all in all, while it really cannot stand on its own in the way that fotr was able, ttt acts as an excellent appetizer for the grand finale, rotk. cannot wait! p.s. - i should add that a minimum of 2 viewings is required, especially if you had titanic expectations, as i did, from loving the 1st film or tolkien's books. the 1st time around, i just could not take in the picture as pure cinematic experience, and not worrying about the deletions, changes, additions, etc. to the novel, of which there are admittedly many and of varying value. _____________________________________";23 December 2002;9;['excellent', 'monumental', 'rotk', 'weak', 'great', 'first', 'same', 'new', 'major', 'new', 'new', 'dramatic', 'valuable', 'new', 'remarkable', 'weak', 'sided', 'great', 'particular', 'deep', 'dramatic', 'less', 'least', 'certain', 'masterful', 'prequel', 'rotk', 'many', 'loose', 'major', 'broken', 'aragorn', 'new', 'many', 'most', 'special', 'musical', 'top', 'least', 'own', 'able', 'excellent', 'grand', 'rotk', 'titanic', 'pure', 'cinematic', 'many'];0.2204857108703262
1571;lkalliance;"it seems impossible to write a review of this film without turning into a comparison between it and j.r.r. tolkien's original text. the deviations from the plot of the novel have been decried and also lauded. but that sometimes deflects readers from the nature of the accomplishment: peter jackson and company have taken a massive work (speaking of the entire trilogy), a sprawling work, and not just brought it to the screen but repurposed it to be a true film adaptation, playing to the strengths of the medium. the production team took a story that was plot-centric and made it character-centric; they took a story that in book form touched on an incredible number of areas and created a wonderful, rich universe and concentrated on the most important areas -- which makes it a less-than-perfect copy of the original source material, but a nearly perfect cinematic presentation of this story. as the middle part of a three-act story, ""the lord of the rings: the two towers"" was the most difficult to conceptualize and the most difficult to present on its own, and some hurdles were nearly not cleared...but they all were, eventually. it's important to accept the storytelling premise: this is not a standalone film. it's less about character development than ""fellowship of the ring"" was and it's less about closure than ""return of the king"" will be -- though it has both of those elements. it's the second act: that part of the story where we put the characters into impossible situations, where the challenges crystallize. the real story isn't about the quest to destroy the ring of power. it's about the internal journeys that frodo, sam, aragorn and the rest each face. this film does an excellent job in getting that task done. the good: the awesome panoramas and physical scope of what you see on screen is ever-present, as it was in the first film and i expect will be in the last. there are a lot of characters to keep track of, but most attention is placed on the ones that need it. jackson's decision to jump right into the second film -- to actually treat it not as a ""second film"" but as a continuation of the first -- means that every moment of screen time can be devoted to fleshing out characters and themes, which means that this film will contain more messages and things to dwell on than most films will. some will find that a negative, but i found it a positive. certainly tolkien provided ample source material to choose from. at the same time, the film does not attempt to flesh out everything from the novels, which helps the viewer focus on the important things. the action is fast-paced but not overbearing, the acting superb and the balance between the physical and the emotional is good. everything you've heard about the performance by andy serkis as gollum is true -- easily the most significant digital character ever and a crucial performance. howard shore's score is superb. the bad: if you are a fan of the books and unable to let go of the text and keep an open mind, you're going to be distracted. i am a many-times reader of the books and i couldn't avoid devoting much of my attention to plot comparison during my first viewing. but once that was out of the way, i found that each successive viewing was a better experience than the last one. if you are not comfortable with the entire fantasy genre, the good news is that ""lord of the rings"" doesn't overplay the role of magic in the story. there are fantastic elements of course, but most of what you see on screen (or on page, for that matter) is different in form from reality but not so much in function. that being said, ""the two towers"" has the most fantastic elements of the three volumes, and will be harder for you to swallow. with the plethora of characters and with jackson's wise choice to focus on the development of the core ones, some characters seem to get short shrift, including gandalf, who is in the odd position of being both a key mover of events but at the same time not being one of the core characters in terms of development. that can be disconcerting if you're not paying attention. ""lord of the rings"" is not a casual movie. a few of the visual effects are not up to par with the effects from the first film, though overall they are outstanding and in gollum's case mind-blowing. of course, ""good"" and ""bad"" are subjective. the ""bad"" parts i list above are pretty circumstancial and might not make a difference to you. they didn't for me, which is why i give ""the lord of the rings: the two towers"" unabashed top marks. a note on the extended edition: i found the extended edition dvds to have great extra scenes that tolkien fans will love and cherish (i certainly did), and the special feature had me completely enraptured. however, i still recommend the tighter, leaner theatrical cut as the better film experience.";29 November 2003;10;['impossible', 'original', 'massive', 'entire', 'true', 'incredible', 'wonderful', 'rich', 'important', 'perfect', 'original', 'perfect', 'cinematic', 'middle', 'difficult', 'difficult', 'own', 'important', 'storytelling', 'standalone', 'less', 'less', 'second', 'impossible', 'real', 'internal', 'aragorn', 'excellent', 'awesome', 'physical', 'present', 'first', 'last', 'most', 'second', 'second', 'first', 'more', 'most', 'negative', 'positive', 'ample', 'same', 'view', 'important', 'overbearing', 'physical', 'emotional', 'good', 'true', 'significant', 'digital', 'crucial', 'superb', 'bad', 'unable', 'open', 'many', 'much', 'first', 'successive', 'well', 'last', 'comfortable', 'entire', 'good', 'fantastic', 'most', 'different', 'fantastic', 'hard', 'wise', 'core', 'short', 'odd', 'key', 'same', 'core', 'casual', 'few', 'visual', 'first', 'outstanding', 'good', 'bad', 'subjective', 'bad', 'circumstancial', 'top', 'extended', 'extended', 'great', 'extra', 'special', 'tight', 'lean', 'theatrical', 'well'];0.1735105519480519

1589;athena13-1;"making a good film of an epic the size of tolkien's lotr, is a difficult task. in the fellowship jackson pulled it off, but ttt, although quite ok as a whole, is full of questions for me. first of all, when the changes in the plot of the fellowship were justified, it is difficult for me to accept a lot of them in ttt. rohan looked nothing like tolkien described it, with edoras looking like a poor village situated in not even remotely similar geographical surroundings. the jokes were sometimes a bit out of place; (spoiler!) e.g gimli's and legolas' 'shall i find you a box' joke - extremely poorly acted by orlando bloom and a joke that did not correspond to the mood of the whole scene really. faramir had gone through a personality change - one of the most unfortunate changes of them all, as tolkien's faramir was quite the opposite of boromir and as such very believable considering the family problems behind it. and ents, although quite good visually, were not interested in anything, thus resulting in a very weak story line. was it really necessary to make such changes to make the situation look more desperate and difficult? and of course (spoiler!), the arrival of the elves to helm's deep?!? come on! of course, this story line is surrounded by more controversies than i'd like to describe. in the fellowship they wanted to help, in the beginning of ttt they didn't and left for valinor, but in the end showed up in helm's deep anyway? where's the logic to that? or is it just some extremely complicated and unsuccessful way to show the inner struggles of elrond? in addition to faramir's personality change, another one that bothered me already in the fellowship was aragorn's indecisiveness. reading the book, aragorn was always aware of his role and his task, with his whole life being a preparation for the lotr action. although in the 'original' version of the fellowship this change is not so pronounced, the director's cut makes it even clearer. such change, although not a very good one, adds depth to the character (as do aragorn's conversations with arwen and elrond in ttt, which were good, no doubt in that) and certainly does make the movie more dramatic. and of course, i'm really sorry for pointing this out and maybe it is a result of my twisted sense of humor, but some of the scenes seemed like a parody of something i've seen before. (spoilers!) faramir &co fighting the southrons and oliphaunts looked like robin hood and his merry men. elf troops looked like coming directly from a star wars movie. the orc running to the wall of helm's deep with the aim to blow it up and other orcs cheering along, looked like a ridiculous mix of lighting the fire during the olympic games and some teenagers' movie with the compulsory slow motion scene of a football game. however, there were quite a lot of simply magnificent things. the landscape was absolutely breathtaking. the emotions behind actions were well justified, although for someone who has not read the book some of the things may seem coming from nowhere and thus not logical. aragorn-eowyn relationship was intriguing, and well played by both actors. (spoiler: there is a wonderfully played and cut scene of the meeting of legolas and aragorn in helm's deep, when legolas returns the jewel - look at eowyn's face.) gimli and legolas were as stylish as in the fellowship and made a wonderful duo. the cast did a very nice job indeed (with a couple of exceptional scenes) despite the 'one-liners' tendency in the script. gollum was simply brilliant - the way his split character and the inside good vs bad fights were depicted made some of the best scenes in the whole film. and the jokes, of course. well, i could go on for quite some time with this list, but in short, the movie was quite ok. although not an improvement compared to the fellowship, it's certainly worth seeing, and probably the more you see it the better it gets.";25 January 2003;10;['good', 'epic', 'difficult', 'ok', 'full', 'difficult', 'poor', 'similar', 'geographical', 'whole', 'unfortunate', 'such', 'believable', 'good', 'interested', 'weak', 'necessary', 'such', 'desperate', 'difficult', 'deep', 'more', 'deep', 'complicated', 'unsuccessful', 'inner', 'aragorn', 'aware', 'whole', 'original', 'clear', 'such', 'good', 'good', 'dramatic', 'sorry', 'twisted', 'merry', 'deep', 'other', 'ridiculous', 'olympic', 'compulsory', 'slow', 'magnificent', 'breathtaking', 'justified', 'logical', 'intriguing', 'deep', 'gimli', 'stylish', 'wonderful', 'nice', 'exceptional', 'brilliant', 'split', 'inside', 'good', 'bad', 'good', 'whole', 'short', 'ok', 'worth', 'more', 'well'];0.1557017543859649

1599;Brunel;"to begin, let me state that i am a huge fan of the lord of the rings and have been ever since i first read the books at the age of 16. now, having read the books multiple times and thoroughly enjoying the first installment of peter jackson's epic adaptation, i was more than eager to see what the second would have to offer. and i was not disappointed. words cannot do justice to this film, it has to be seen to be believed. my initial impression on leaving the cinema was that it was truly a fantastic film. there were, however, some small areas which i would love to be able to question peter jackson over. they were not failings within the film but i am intrigued as to why some scenes were there whilst others were not. why did we have aragorn going over a cliff and then being presumed dead? not part of the book and it doesn't seem to contribute anything to the story. the only reason i could think of was to illustrate the firm friendship between him, legolas and gimli at that stage and possibly to emphasise that eowyn is falling in love. why did frodo and sam go with faramir to the city? i can't think of a single reason for it other than to increase the screen time of david wenham. why were we missing several crucial chapters towards the end?! i was sitting on the edge of my seat, convinced that there was more to come when the final credits came up! where was the reunion between pippin, merry, aragorn, legolas and gimli? where was the episode with gandalf facing saruman? and pippin looking into the palantir? i can only guess that these chapters will be covered in the next film; i can't imagine that they will be left out entirely. if this is the case then the third film will have a lot of ground to cover. we have yet to meet shelob and witness the final battle where the nazgul is slain, not to mention the destruction of the ring. does this mean that the film will end abruptly when the war is won? will we fail to see frodo and his friends return to hobbiton and what happens there? or will they somehow manage to fit it into those 3 hours and still see frodo passing away to the grey havens? oh the mind boggles!!!! my main point of contention has to be with faramir. he was always one of my favourite characters in the book but in the film he appears to be a replica of boromir. this is not true of the character. ""unlike they were, and yet also much akin."" please don't misunderstand me; none of the things above lessened my overall enjoyment of this film, they simply intrigued me and i would love to know why certain decisions were made by the production team. the two towers stands apart from any other film. it is a visual masterpiece and a thoroughly enjoyable way to spend 3 hours; i do not begrudge a minute of it and i can guarantee that i will be going to see it again. the battle sequences were simply amazing and i can't possibly end without mentioning how completely fantastic gollum was! he was absolutely hideous but then completely pitiable at the same time; perfect characterisation. thank you peter jackson for this film! i loved the books long before the film and i love these films just as much. i can't imagine anyone doing more justice to tolkien than as has been shown in these two films. i can only hope that return of the king will be just as good, i have very little doubt that it will be. p.s. the ents are awesome! oh how i love treebeard!!";20 December 2002;10;['huge', 'multiple', 'first', 'epic', 'more', 'eager', 'second', 'disappointed', 'initial', 'fantastic', 'small', 'able', 'dead', 'only', 'firm', 'gimli', 'single', 'other', 'several', 'crucial', 'more', 'final', 'gimli', 'gandalf', 'next', 'third', 'final', 'slain', 'main', 'favourite', 'true', 'akin', 'overall', 'certain', 'other', 'visual', 'enjoyable', 'amazing', 'fantastic', 'hideous', 'pitiable', 'same', 'perfect', 'more', 'good', 'little', 'awesome'];0.162421679197995

""the two towers"" exceeds ""fellowship"" in various ways. first, there's gollum. gollum is absolutely wonderful in this movie. after a bit you forget that gollum is mostly a computer trick and you see him as a real creature. gollum offers many things: comic relief, foreshadowing, plot revelation, etc. but he also brings out different aspects of sam and frodo's personalities. gollum brings out the protective nature of sam and the loyal nature of frodo. gollum being as great as he is is probably one of the key elements to this movie's success. another improvement in this movie is the character development we see. each character's personality is revealed much more in this film than it was in the first. we see the determination that lies in merry. we see the bravery come out in pippin. we see the friendship that's developing between legolas and gimli. we see gimli as a die-hard, determined fighter and legolas as a noble protector. more of aragorn's past and future are revealed in this movie. all this character revelation makes ""two towers"" more satisfying for any view, tolkien fan or not. and then there's the romance between aragorn and arwen. now for all those who have read the books, come on; who didn't want to know more about that?? i think that maybe tolkien left that relationship hazy so that each reader would dream up a story to fit in. and that's exactly what jackson did. before i saw ""fellowship,"" i had only read ""the hobbit"" and had no real desire to read ""lord of the rings."" then i saw ""fellowship."" i immediately ran out, re-read the hobbit, and then finished the series. i was not disappointed. pater jackson may have disappointed many tolkien fans, but he inspired another. i fell in love with ""fellowship;"" i fell even harder for ""the two towers.""";1 January 2003;10;['first', 'exaggerated', 'true', 'impossible', 'true', 'various', 'wonderful', 'real', 'many', 'comic', 'different', 'protective', 'loyal', 'great', 'key', 'more', 'first', 'gimli', 'gimli', 'hard', 'determined', 'noble', 'more', 'satisfying', 'more', 'hazy', 'real', 'disappointed', 'many'];0.2261363636363636

1616;AlastairDavie;translating a book to film is entirely the art of the compromise, what made fotr such a great film was the quality of the compromises made, the choice of scenes cut from the book, the characters collapsed into one while preserving the essence of both the narrative thread and the integrity of the characters. ttt fails to meet these exacting standards set by fotr and most of it's failures stem from the effort to have the remaining eight characters in the fellowship be the driving force for all the events in the narrative. pj made compromises in the confrontation of gandalf and saruman, by including it in the healing of king theoden from his evil influence, an excellent choice to collapse two events into one to impart all the necessary information and keep the narrative flowing. my suspicion is that those hoping to see more of this in rotk will be disappointed. treebeard and the ents deciding not to go to war against saruman and then being tricked into it by merry and pippin significantly failed in all aspects. the length of time to cut back to treebeard stating that saruman had been cutting down trees for too long and needed to be short would have been less than the substitute reason for their attack and having established the ents as being non-hasty to suddenly burst into a fit of rage diminishes them the now rejuvenated theoden changes from a man with his courage restored who goes out to face his doom to a coward who runs with the women to hide in the hills and allowing aragorn to take the lead in the defense of helms deep. a compromise that lessens the film for those knowledgeable in the book. conversely the elves turning up to help under the lead of haldir, is easier to explain and insert into the narrative than the troop of rangers with the two sons of elrond as occurs in the book. *** potential spoiler for rotk in next paragraph *** faramir's transformation from the noble man in which the line of numenor runs true to one that succumbs to the temptation of the ring on his first sight of it was probably done to add drama to the journey of frodo and sam, which it does, but will probably end up being the part that most fans will hate the most. keeping shelob in ttt would have served the cause of drama far better but then would have ended the film with the 'death' of the main hero, not something you can do in hollywood. the threads of aragorn fake death, the warg attack and arwens leaving middle earth are again changes to the book aimed at increasing the drama of certain portions of the film and by themselves they achieve more or less that (though some of it drops into melodrama) but when combined with the other deviations from the book it reinforces the other failed compromises. overall i still liked the film, the brilliance of fotr probably inflated my expectations for ttt so i'll go back and see it again with my expectations suitable modified and see how it goes from there;23 December 2002;9;['great', 'narrative', 'most', 'theoden', 'evil', 'excellent', 'necessary', 'more', 'short', 'less', 'substitute', 'non', 'hasty', 'theoden', 'aragorn', 'deep', 'knowledgeable', 'easy', 'potential', 'next', 'noble', 'true', 'first', 'most', 'most', 'main', 'aragorn', 'fake', 'middle', 'certain', 'less', 'other', 'other', 'suitable', 'modified'];0.1712380952380952

1631;js-rensch;an excellent movie and true to the spirit of tolkien. although a more potent display of wizardry for the epic gandalf vs. the balrog would have helped novice viewers grasp how an old man could defeat such a demon. i was also a little disappointed in faramir. he seemed but a shadow of the valiant & noble (and wiser than boromir) heir to the steward of gondor that tolkien intended. was i the only one who appreciated miranda otto's portrayal of eowyn, shieldmaiden of rohan? her simple yet stunning looks and shy inward strength were impressive . an excellent characterization. i agree that the level of detail was outstanding, and jackson & crew are to be commended for their efforts . notice the 'white tree' emblazoned on the tunics of the warriors of gondor . exactly as tolkien had originally drawn.;28 December 2002;10;['excellent', 'true', 'potent', 'epic', 'old', 'little', 'disappointed', 'noble', 'wise', 'only', 'simple', 'stunning', 'shy', 'inward', 'impressive', 'excellent', 'outstanding', 'white'];0.2889705882352941

1635;rsaunders;for most of a year i waited -- hardly able to contain myself -- for the second installment of the trilogy. the first film, while not flawless looks better and better the more i see it. the characterizations are rich, sensitive and nuanced, the narrative propulsive, the scenery lovely and tolkien's words and ideas well represented (and embodied). all that waiting and for what? director jackson has lost his way. this is not tolkien's two towers -- a fable that, among other things, sets out to demonstrate that/how even the smallest among us can change the world. these are not tolkien's characters. in particular theoden and faramir -- two great characters with large roles to play in the proceedings -- are inexplicably cast in a poor light. the ents -- while visually well rendered seem mostly to stand as bookmarks to hold merry and pippen while the film moves forward without them. nor is it his story line. fans know all of the deviations. the question is this: why'd jackson do it? the fellowship proved that jackson and company were up to the task. but the two towers falls flat. profitable, but flat. why? my theory is that jackson and his producers got greedy. the first feature reached number five all-time on the international box office charts. rather than celebrating their success with a stern commitment to a faithful rendering of tolkien's books, jackson et al. seem to have decided to see if they could do even better -- in the box office, that is. so they trimmed away less sexy characters (theoden, for example), added more action and special effects, simplified the plot and, along the way, ceased to be about tolkien's two towers. it may play to huge numbers in search of great battle scenes but great filmmaking it ain't. lots of sound and fury signifying nothing . . .;17 January 2003;10;['most', 'able', 'second', 'first', 'well', 'well', 'rich', 'sensitive', 'nuanced', 'lovely', 'other', 'small', 'particular', 'great', 'large', 'poor', 'flat', 'profitable', 'flat', 'greedy', 'first', 'stern', 'faithful', 'sexy', 'theoden', 'more', 'special', 'huge', 'great', 'great'];0.2812770562770563
1636;joe_unander;"really, i should probably let this film soak in a bit; i am, after all, on something of a ""post-viewing"" high right now. however, at this moment, my feeling remains the same from the first installment - this is the movie experience i've been waiting my whole life for. in case you haven't gathered, this movie is visually stunning, literally breathtaking. i mean that, some of the scenes in this film simply stopped my lungs in their tracks, shocked at the pure, enveloping beauty of the shot. peter jackson has a profound grasp of visual manipulation like few directors have ever had. the acting is, as always, superb. kudos for hiring ""actors"" not ""stars""; ""oscar-worthy"" over-acting could have threatened the realistic touch the film's remarkable cast supply. specific mention goes to both john rhys-davies in his well enjoyed comic turn, and very largely to andy serkis, who was a major role in creating the most realistic and brilliantly well-performed cgi character i've ever seen (gollum). for the most part, and as a fan of the books, i take no offense to the slight plot modifications. my understanding is that tolkien himself realized that visual adaptation of lotr would require a somewhat different take on his work, and was apparently open to such minute changes. there are also a few tiny bits and pieces i was disappointed to see not make the final cut, however, i'm sure a future inevitable extended dvd will take care of those. in short, if you found the continual enjoyment i did with the first movie of lotr, this movie will in no way let you down. not even for a minute. highly recommended, 10/10.";18 December 2002;10;['post', 'high', 'same', 'first', 'whole', 'stunning', 'breathtaking', 'pure', 'profound', 'visual', 'few', 'oscar', 'worthy', 'realistic', 'remarkable', 'specific', 'comic', 'major', 'realistic', 'most', 'slight', 'visual', 'different', 'open', 'such', 'few', 'tiny', 'disappointed', 'final', 'sure', 'future', 'inevitable', 'extended', 'short', 'continual', 'first'];0.1271912202380952
1637;truthbealiar;as a film student and a tolkein fan i loved this movie and almost everything about it. peter jackson really does understand what he's doing. for all those who say that this film made too many changes from the book, this is all i have to say to you: go cry me a river. it's an adaptation for the love of god, it's not supposed to follow the story exactly. most of the things that were changed in this film were changed with good reason. as much as i love tolkein and his writing, he does tend to meander with his narration to a point that i sometimes wonder if treebeard is supposed to be the one narrating these books. additionally, alot of information in the books is conveyed through dialogue instead of through action and visuals, which is a big no-no in film, and not a great idea in storytelling in general. therefore, peter jackson created some new ideas that got the same story across only more visually. yes, he changed alot, but all of the new stuff still accomplished the same thing as the books and still got the themes of the story across. yes, there were changes that p***ed me off. faramir is supposed to be the good brother and that bothered me because it was a complete change of a character, not just of the story. as far as the whole arwen thing goes, i'm not happy that they made the decision to blow up her character and all, but i like the way they did it once the decision was made. it could have been done a lot worse, with her following him into battle and trying to be a lovey dovey, turning this into another titanic/pearl harbor. at least they stuck to things that actually did happen, albeit in the appendicies.;13 January 2003;10;['tolkein', 'many', 'most', 'good', 'big', 'great', 'general', 'new', 'same', 'new', 'same', 'good', 'complete', 'whole', 'happy', 'bad', 'titanic', 'least'];0.2264204545454546

1656;OBOTtheDESTROYER;this movie was horrid. i think that's the best place to start. this movie was the biggest disappointment i have ever had. the worst part was that for the first hour i actually thought they were going to follow the book. then the pain began. by adding and changing scenes from the book, they completely ruined a good movie. some people argue that if the movie exactly matched the book, people should just read the book. i argue that if they want to make up there own story don't try to remake a book by someone else. the things added to this movie were not put there to improve the story anyway. they just added a level of badly acted drama that the film did not need. why they felt the need to change the story to emphasize the plight of frodo and middle-earth with bad drama i will never know. the whole movie is already bent on these ideas, so why they felt like shoving it down our throats is a mystery. maybe they want to try for oscars... i've got an idea let's do another close up of merry's face full of determination... another problem is the fighting scenes. these were insulting. there is a difference between unrealistic fantasy fighting, like in the first film, and in your face crap that wouldn't even be shown on mst3k. if you can just run over 10,000 orcs with 5 horses and be fine, why didn't they just do that in the beginning? obviously, the orcs have no momentum and no ability to even hold a spear up against a horse... i could go on about the problems of this movie for much longer but instead i'll just say this. if you have invested any time at all into this series, do not watch this movie, because it is horrible and will only irritate you. 1/10;28 December 2002;1;['horrid', 'good', 'big', 'bad', 'first', 'good', 'own', 'middle', 'bad', 'whole', 'bent', 'close', 'full', 'insulting', 'unrealistic', 'first', 'fine', 'orcs', 'horrible'];-0.0288888888888888

1666;swengle-1;i understand that many people don't think it is a valid criticism to say that this movie doesn't follow the book. so let's set aside the book and look at this movie as a movie. while it is beautifully shot and the acting is roughly equivalent to the first film, the two towers fails at crucial moments. for example (spoilers): 1. first, and most important, the end of this film is not believable. the battle of helm's deep is a complete rout. there are literally 10,000 orcs out on the plains in front of the fortress, and aragorn decides to ride out with 10 men on horseback?!? then we see gandalf up on a hill about 1/2 mile away, on the other side of the orc army, charging forward with what appears to be a couple hundred men. the way this battle is staged, aragorn, gandalf, legolas and gimli must die. i didn't think gandalf would make it past the first row of spears set in the ground. and are we supposed to believe that 10,000 orcs, including numerous archers who are standing within 100 yards of aragorn, legolas and gimli, all turn around and completely ignore our heroes when gandalf charges? isn't it a tad more likely that our heroes are immediately pelted with thousands of arrows? this battle is insulting to the audience's intelligence. mr. jackson fades the battle out, as he must, because there is no way that the forces of good are going to win. this is not a minor problem. mr. jackson has chosen to make the battle at helm's deep the climax of this film. the fact that this climax is not credible is a serious flaw in this film, and one that i just couldn't overlook. 2. mr. jackson's decision to use the battle of helm's deep as the climax of his film meant that he had to spend an inordinate amount of time showing people shuffling toward the fortress, shuffling into the fortress, sitting in alley ways, getting weapons, missing aragorn, rejoicing when aragorn comes back . . . . there is no real action or character development going on during this hour of screen time. this build up could have been replaced with something more essential to the storyline. 3. treebeard and the other ents take half a day to pronounce someone's name. they have stood in the forest for thousands of years and seen countless trees fall and be destroyed. yet, for some reason, they rashly decide to wreak havoc on saruman because he has destroyed what looks to be about 50 feet of treeline. not very consistent with their character, so why do they do it? the only reason i could discern is that mr. jackson wants us to think that merry has done something clever for once. this thin reed of justification cannot support such an obvious break from character. 4. aragorn being dragged over the cliff by a worg served two obvious purposes. first, we get to see that eowyn loves him. but we knew that already. second, he spots the army of orcs. we knew that as well. further, the fall over the cliff feels crassly manipulative. we don't seriously believe that aragorn is dead, but we are forced to watch the characters display their grief. ugh. i wish this screen time had been used for any other purpose. 5. faramir's decision to bring frodo into gondor seemed like a pointless detour, and, sadly, one that inadvertantly led to some mighty contrived acting by elijah wood. ian holm and the computer-generated gollum are fine when showing the pull of the ring's power, but the ring seems to make mr. wood stare into space. also, what exactly is it that changes faramir's mind? seeing frodo try to give the ring to a ringwraith convinces faramir that he should let frodo continue to carry the ring into mordor? huh? what do all these flaws have in common? none of them are in the books. tolkien spent literally decades crafting his trilogy. i understand that some things must be cut from the books for the sake of time. mr. jackson showed admirable discretion in the first film, which was a compelling adaptation of the novel. this film falls far short. it is still beautifully rendered, but that is not enough to save a film riddled with flaws. i was sorely disappointed by this picture.;14 January 2003;6;['many', 'valid', 'equivalent', 'first', 'crucial', 'important', 'believable', 'deep', 'complete', 'aragorn', 'other', 'aragorn', 'gimli', 'first', 'numerous', 'gandalf', 'likely', 'good', 'minor', 'deep', 'credible', 'serious', 'deep', 'inordinate', 'real', 'essential', 'other', 'countless', 'consistent', 'only', 'clever', 'thin', 'obvious', 'aragorn', 'obvious', 'manipulative', 'dead', 'other', 'pointless', 'fine', 'common', 'admirable', 'first', 'compelling', 'short', 'enough'];0.0735714285714285
1667;swengle-1;many spoilers i loved fellowship of the ring. i thought it was a classic film and a faithful adaptation of the spirit of the books. the two towers is beautiful, as was fotr, but it contains several serious flaws that make this movie more frustrating than enjoyable. people appear averse to hearing a comparison of the movie to the books, so i will stick to criticism of the film. the most glaring flaws in the film are: 1. the resolution of the battle of helm's deep is not credible. this is a major problem because mr. jackson has chosen this battle as the climax of his film. we see literally 10,000 orcs on the plain in front of the fortress. as they are about to breach the last defense, aragorn, gimli, legolas and a handful of others ride out into the fray. at that moment, gandalf appears on the other side of the army of orcs and charges in with what appear to be a couple hundred soldiers. now here is the problem: in this situation, there is no way that aragorn, gimli and legolas will live, and it doesn't appear that gandalf can prevail given his limited numbers. do 10,000 orcs, including hundreds of orc archers near aragorn, gimli and legolas, all turn around and face gandalf, forgetting completely about aragorn and crew? it seems much more likely that some orcs will fight gandalf (and kill him: i didn't think he would make it past the spears set in the front line), while aragorn, gimli and legolas are pelted with literally thousands of arrows. mr. jackson, apparently unable to resolve this problem, fades the scene out. not good enough. this is the climax of the movie and it is not believable. a fatal flaw for any picture. 2. because the battle of helm's deep is the climax, we must endure almost an hour of people preparing for that battle. they shuffle out of the city, shuffle along through fields, shuffle into the fortress, get some weapons, and just generally stand around. this build-up is too long. though the battle itself is impressively filmed, it cannot support this much film. 3. the ents, creatures who take half a day to pronounce someone's name, who have stood silently in the forest for thousands of years, decide suddenly to wreak havoc on isengard because they see thirty feet of burned treeline. this is not in character at all. perhaps it was done this way to convince us that merry has grown since fotr. character development is a wonderful thing, but not at the expense of consistency in the behavior of other characters. this moment makes the ents, and merry, look silly. 4. faramir's decision to drag frodo to gondor does not resolve itself well. how does watching frodo try to give the ring to a ringwraith convince faramir to allow frodo to take the ring into mordor? if anything, he should conclude that frodo is near the end of his rope and the ring should be in other hands. these problems make the film ultimately unsatisfying to watch. as a side note, all of these problems were caused by mr. jackson's decision to deviate from the books. here's hoping rotk stays closer to the writings.;19 January 2003;6;['many', 'classic', 'faithful', 'beautiful', 'several', 'serious', 'frustrating', 'enjoyable', 'averse', 'glaring', 'credible', 'major', 'about', 'last', 'aragorn', 'gimli', 'other', 'aragorn', 'gimli', 'limited', 'aragorn', 'gimli', 'likely', 'front', 'gimli', 'unable', 'good', 'believable', 'fatal', 'deep', 'long', 'much', 'wonderful', 'other', 'silly', 'ringwraith', 'other', 'rotk'];0.11133658008658
1668;tux_penguin;i was generally very impressed by this adaptation of the book. gollum was very well done, and the character development and interactions were much better here than in the first movie. i didn't mind the fact that certain changes had been made. for example, i was pleasantly surprised that arwen was given more of a role and was generally a better developed character in the movies. also, i thought it was a fun and interesting addition to have elven warriors show up for the battle of helm's deep and it was perfectly believable within the context of the story. i was less impressed with the addition of the battle with the orc riders where aragorn is presumed dead, but i didn't mind too much. what actually really bothered me was the dramatic change in faramir's character. in the book, even if he is momentarily tempted by the ring, he never attempts to force frodo to follow him to gondor or anywhere else. he's different from his brother boromir. i was very disappointed by this alteration. faramir is one of my favorite characters, and i felt he was unjustly portrayed. i was confused as to why the movie did not end with frodo presumed dead in shelob's lair. if the added bit where faramir goes out of character were to be removed, i'm sure there would have been space for shelob. the ents weren't quite as i imagined them. i always thought they were much thicker. however, that's simply quibbling. the altered ent moot and so on was not a big deal, and it was too bad there were no hurons at helm's deep, but i didn't really feel that loss either. overall, it was an extremely enjoyable adaptation. the images, sounds, and character interactions were very impressive, and the battle scenes were a lot of fun. i just wish faramir had been more fairly portrayed.;15 January 2003;9;['impressed', 'first', 'certain', 'surprised', 'more', 'developed', 'interesting', 'elven', 'deep', 'believable', 'impressed', 'aragorn', 'dead', 'dramatic', 'different', 'disappointed', 'favorite', 'confused', 'dead', 'sure', 'thick', 'altered', 'big', 'bad', 'deep', 'enjoyable', 'impressive'];0.1533730158730159

(notice peter jackson's cameo in helms deep as he throws a spear.) the main problem with this movie is that they wasted too much time with added scenes. the sequel to this movie, the return of the king, must be at least 3:45. the two towers just didn't have quite enough of the real book in it, but it was still really great. and gollum! the best cgi character put on screen. the scene in the night where smeagol and gollum are talking to each other is one of the best scenes in movie history. this is an absolute must-see, but you must see the fellowship of the ring before this, otherwise you will not get the point of the movie. wow!;26 February 2003;10;['good', 'great', 'more', 'great', 'deep', 'cool', 'deep', 'great', 'big', 'many', 'great', 'constant', 'other', 'massive', 'deep', 'main', 'much', 'least', 'enough', 'real', 'great', 'good', 'other', 'good', 'absolute'];0.3246376811594203

1683;Hunthor;"review applies to both the fellowship of the ring and the two towers. the fellowship of the ring and the two towers are visually impressive films having wonderful sets, costumes and make-up. the computer-generated effects are generally effective and occasionally wonderful, even awe-inspiring. however both films are boring. the vivid and well-realised images on the screen are not sufficient compensation for the very poor story-telling. director peter jackson can justly take credit for the feat of organising and being responsible for an apparently huge undertaking in getting support for three ambitious, expensive films and then making them on an apparently epic scale. the art direction is wonderful and he has gathered some great teams about him that convincingly bring tolkien's middle-earth to the cinema. not least, it must be a feat to be entrusted with millions of dollars and keep all those film executives at bay whilst one gets on with the job. that said, the storytelling is inept. jackson shares the writing credits with two others and they take great liberties with tolkien's story. this might have been all right if they had made the story better or more suitable for the medium of film, but the changes are not very good and they are badly handled. the screenplay also misses much of the wit and interest of tolkien's work. it also lacks the drama and tension. even when considered as a film independent of tolkien's tale, the story-telling is very poor. this is a director who relies on vivid imagery and hasn't much of an idea as to what makes a decent script. many of the exchanges between characters are extremely limited; there is nothing deep or profound. every now and again some of tolkien's dialogue appears (easy to spot because they're the good bits) but jackson and co. appear to have cut and pasted such sections into their script without much care as to whether it comfortably fits into the stuff they have written. perhaps it is no accident therefore that the film has not attracted true film stars to play the major roles. this is a b-movie cast to go with a b-movie script. that's not to say that some of the actors aren't good: ian mckellen, ian holm and sean bean give good performances, but one suspects that with a decent script the film series would have been attractive to star actors to take the lead roles. sometimes the casting of virtually unknown actors can pay off but i'm afraid that they aren't really given much to work on and thus little chance to show what they can do. i don't think that peter jackson's direction helps his actors much. this is not a director with a great range, and things such as subtlety lie outside it. nor do i think he rates the intelligence and comprehension of the audience very highly. everything is thrust into the viewer's face. nothing lurks menacingly just out of sight, nothing is merely glimpsed or suspected, no tension is built up: bad things or monsters just appear - ""bam!"". slow motion, backlighting (at night and in the wilderness) and extreme close-ups are laid on thickly. the lighting is artificial and the editing is very careless and disjointed. (this is an occasion where the medium of dvd may really be useful. the good thing about dvd is that people will be able to choose the sections they wish to watch and will thus be able to oogle over the wonderful set-pieces as often as they like without having to suffer the tedious parts.) i shouldn't really be bothered going on about all this as it's just a film, but i think that undeserved kudos and plaudits are being heaped on peter jackson (not to mention tons of money). what is more, studios will may be further encouraged to think that a decent script is unimportant for a good film. the fact that quite a number of people rave about this film means that the money and effort used to make it were not entirely wasted. (i suspect that they were so impressed by the imagery and the grand theme that they have been able to overlook the films' serious shortcomings.) the sad thing is that a first-rate production was let down by a bad script and clumsy direction. it deserved better.";22 August 2003;3;['impressive', 'wonderful', 'effective', 'wonderful', 'inspiring', 'boring', 'vivid', 'sufficient', 'poor', 'responsible', 'huge', 'ambitious', 'expensive', 'epic', 'wonderful', 'great', 'middle', 'least', 'inept', 'great', 'right', 'well', 'suitable', 'good', 'much', 'independent', 'poor', 'vivid', 'much', 'decent', 'many', 'limited', 'deep', 'profound', 'easy', 'good', 'such', 'much', 'true', 'major', 'good', 'good', 'decent', 'attractive', 'unknown', 'afraid', 'much', 'little', 'much', 'great', 'such', 'bad', 'slow', 'extreme', 'close', 'artificial', 'careless', 'useful', 'good', 'able', 'able', 'wonderful', 'tedious', 'undeserved', 'more', 'decent', 'unimportant', 'good', 'impressed', 'grand', 'able', 'serious', 'sad', 'first', 'bad', 'clumsy'];0.1895167022032693

1688;tricky808;this movie is so good. it gives me that feeling i used to get when i was a kid and a new star wars flick was coming down the pipe. all of the modern technological advances in moviemaking find raison d'etre in this saga without smothering the story in large production 'pomp and circumstance'. yeah yeah, we can all get p***y about how the story wasn't followed to the letter and how license was granted in the embellishment of certain characters but we have to see this work for what it is, a movie. movies are not books. anyone who uses this argument to downplay their opinion of jackson's (et al.) attempt needs to revisit my previous statement. you cannot compare the two works as if they were the same variety of fruit and one is lacking in bouquet or has artificial color or flavoring. this reasoning is inherently flawed. let's all give credit where it is due. tolkien is the master of his world. jackson is obviously a maestro in his own arena. i am so stoked that he has accomplished this with such aplomb. if we want to get upset at modern movie adaptations of excellent stories, why not pick on the grinch or interview with the vampire or the impending alexander the great movie(s) (i may be jumping the gun on this last one, but why anyone would highlight the sexual practices of the greatest, most accomplished leader of all time as if it meant something is moronic especially considering the common practices of the day (i urge baz and oliver to read some j.f.c. fuller on alexander, please!). i would venture to say that, in the distant future if movie-like entertainment exists, no one would make a big deal out of how our modern leaders conducted themselves outside of the diplomatic/political/militaristic arena.) hollywood misses the mark in so many ways. why we would get so wrapped up in this silliness is beyond me. three cheers for jackson and company!;28 November 2003;10;['good', 'new', 'modern', 'technological', 'large', 'certain', 'previous', 'same', 'artificial', 'flawed', 'due', 'own', 'such', 'upset', 'modern', 'excellent', 'impending', 'great', 'last', 'sexual', 'great', 'accomplished', 'moronic', 'common', 'full', 'distant', 'like', 'big', 'modern', 'diplomatic', 'political', 'militaristic', 'many'];0.185510323010323

1703;gokusmiles;"spectacular in every way! the only thing i did not like was the change to faramir (-1 point). in the movie, he too is captivated by the ring and begins in earnest to take frodo and the ring to his father, unlike the book. in the book faramir chooses to ""look the other way"", but he still senses the evil of the ring. in part we are led to believe that his training under mithrandir (gandalf) may have something to do with his knowing not to let his mind linger on the ring, but rather shun it. he does not take frodo captive with the intention of taking the ring to his father, but rather frees frodo after holding him at the waterfall hideout. i thought jackson and co. could have stayed true to the book in this case without losing the effect of the ring being seductive to everyone. faramir's shunning of the ring also helps to effectively show the difference between he and his brother. both having good intentions, but with faramir being the more ""open-minded"" of the brothers he is thus able to recognize the danger of the ring, and also know his own weakness in the face of such danger. aragorn, too, chose to shun the ring, and he too could sense its evil. he was also something of mithrandir's apprentice (not to mention the elves'). so there was a logical explanation for them resisting the ring: their training alerting them to the potential danger and the need to avoid it. that could've been explained in lieu of this relatively small change in the story they chose to make.";1 December 2005;9;['spectacular', 'only', 'other', 'captive', 'true', 'seductive', 'good', 'open', 'minded', 'able', 'own', 'such', 'aragorn', 'logical', 'potential', 'small'];0.2173076923076922
1704;rizasoy;the second chapter of the lord of the rings trilogy may very well be better than the original. it's such an intense journey for all the characters and the excitement hardly lets up. the resurrection of king theoden is a highlight and the grand finale with helm's deep is so epic and masterfully staged. it manages to capture the actual dread of a bleak, nasty and massive battle. also, one of the greatest accomplishments is undoubtedly the character of gollum. they not only made us believe that he exists but more importantly they made us care. it's a stunning middle chapter that rivals the finest sequels in movie history.

1714;Malk;i may not be a movie maker, or writer, or even a phd in tolkien world. nevertheless, i am a great fan of him and of his books. i saw many commentaries around said that the issues on the movie are because of the difficult to make a book translation to the movies.it seems to me people are trying to refuse their own disappointments with the movie with this argument. the movements in the timeline of the movie are the first cliche, much like episode i and dozens of other movies. lets make a quick comparison, episode i and two towers have three stories running at the same time: frodo and sam going to mordor, anakim skywalker in a space battle, gungans going to war in the fields, merry and pippin and treebeard, obi-wan kenobi and qui-gon jin against darth maul, aragorn, legolas and gimli in helms deep. 1) chances are against the characters (ok...we need drama) 2-tt) frodo is captured by faramir at the same time that treebeard and the ents decide to do nothing, at the same time the fortress begins to fall. 2-epi) anakin is lost inside the trade federation ship, at the same time amidala and hers guard are captured by the vice roy at the same time qui-gon dies. 3-tt)the new hope appears with eomer coming to help helm's deep, at the same time treebeard discovers that fangorn is being destroyed (how could he not know that already remains a mistery) and calls the other ents to destroy isengard at the same time faramir set frodo free. i have only looked to this small part of the movie, but there's more to tell about the whole of it, i will just tell about some more cliches: 1) the father that does not want his daughter to marry 2) the hero that everyone know is a main character falls in battle (and everyone knows that he will return - it adds no drama) 3) the hero that does not want the power that is his. 4) the king that does not listen to counsel. 5) the calm heroes that doesn't want to enter the war, although all evidencies seems that they had no choice. 6) the useless character that has a great idea (pippin). there's many more that i will not put here now. in my opinion, tolkien's world is greater than this and much more interesting.;7 January 2003;4;['great', 'many', 'difficult', 'own', 'first', 'other', 'quick', 'same', 'gimli', 'deep', 'same', 'same', 'same', 'hers', 'same', 'new', 'deep', 'same', 'fangorn', 'other', 'same', 'free', 'small', 'more', 'more', 'main', 'calm', 'useless', 'great', 'many', 'more', 'great', 'interesting'];0.2028787878787878

1716;smarano;"spoilers. in my opinion, fotr was a brilliant film. i rated it a 10.0 here (the extended dvd version). for me, as for many others, it laid to rest any doubts that peter jackson could pull off the impossible and create a truly worthy, magnificent film version of lotr, one which even tolkien would likely have been proud. i honestly must say that after viewing the two towers, those doubts have returned for me. when i left the theatre after having viewed fotr for the first time, i had a few quibbles about pj's interpretation, but in general i felt thrilled and elated and raring to see it again. this time i came out feeling let down and a little short-changed and wanting to see it again just to give it the benefit of the doubt. part of this reaction was because i had read too many advanced reviews which built my expectations too high. and part of it was because, as so many others have pointed out, ttt is more of an action/battle novel while fotr was very character/quest driven. but these rationalizations are letting pj off the hook too easily. in my opinion, he released a product that could have been significantly better, given the time he had to complete it. like others who have criticized ttt, i felt that jackson gave short shrift to the hobbits, particularly merry and pippen. i loved the banter between m & p that existed in fotr. in ttt, the two basically just sat on treebeard's arms with their mouths agape. what didn't help was that the cgi quality of the ent sequences was well below that of the rest of the movie. i've read that jackson cut ou a lot of ent material(the ent draught scene in particular), material that will likely go back into the extended dvd, so this might help things. and he'll probably work on improving the quality of the animation renderings as well (he did that in the first movie). i felt that frodo's characterization was surprisingly weak. at the end of fotr, frodo was resolute as he viewed the plains of mordor. at the beginning of ttt, he appeared already half-delirious from the influence of the ring. the passage of time was not just rushed; it was non-existent. also as countless others have stated, i felt that faramir was shortchanged to some degree. he was a more noble, likeable character in the novel. but frankly, the change wasn't nearly as bad as i had expected. he was not a clone of boromir. having just reread the book, i would challenge anyone to prove that pj's characterization of faramir was that far off the mark. yes he was portrayed as more cold and distant than he appeared in tolkien's novel, but not by any stretch did he covet the ring as did boromir. nor did i find the trip to osgiliath particularly objectionable. imo, these criticisms are relatively minor compared to my main criticism: that the ending was a butchered edit job. a build-up of two hours to the battle of helms deep emphasizing the rohirrim's feeling of despair and utter hopelessness of being vastly outnumbered, a great sequence of battle scenes, and then in the space of 5 minutes, it's over. gandalf appears on shadowfax on a hillside, and the uruk hai basically run for their lives. ten thousand creatures that 'don't know pain, don't know fear' turn tail at the site of 300 men on horseback. that's not the way it happened in the book. it was the huorn (trees) that saved the day. i guess jackson felt that it was too much to ask the viewing audience to accept the ents/trees saving the day twice (helms deep and isengard). that thinking in itself is ok. but he could have drawn out the fighting sequences after gandalf and the rohirrim appeared. the battle was simply over too quickly. worse, the climax with gandalf was treated almost as an aside. the scene of the wizard and the riders of rohan charging down the mountain was not even presented in 'real time' in the movie. instead it was simply a backdrop to sam's hokey motivational speech to frodo. the intermingled scenes of gandalf and the ent's flooding of isengard played second fiddle to this speech, which frankly was so corny, i cringed a little in my seat. even worse, the final ending scenes paled in their impact compared to that in fotr. i don't buy the excuse that this had to be because ttt was the middle movie. the end of fotr was beautifully and intelligently scripted and was very emotional. in particular, the scene with frodo standing in silence on the banks of the river with the ring in his hand was one of the highlights of the movie for me, and one of the reasons why i could return to watching it again and again. in contrast, ttt just ends. there's no sense of suspense or drama. to me, it came across as if pj was editing the movie, realized that it was 2 hours and 59 minutes long, and said to himself ""oh my god, i've only got one minute left! i'll just throw in this quick pan of shelob's mountain and be done with it!"" in my opinion, he should have continued the plot right up until the brink of the confrontation with shelob. two other minor criticisms: the make-up job on the pre-exorcised theodin was way over the top. yes, he was possessed. but couldn't jackson had made the point more subtly? it's like he didn't trust the audience's intelligence and had to hit them over the head by turning theodin into a caricature. and the confrontation of frodo with the black rider on the back of the flying creature (not nearly as frighteningly rendered as the black horses in fotr): why was that necessary? it undermined one of the main sources of suspense in tolkien's novels: that frodo and sam manage to stay just outside the view of mordor. for these reasons, i rate ttt an 8.0. and i think that's being generous. in fairness, i am going to see this movie again (but probably only once again, in contrast to the fifteen times that i have scene fotr), mostly to give it the benefit of the doubt and see if my opinion of it improves upon further viewing. also in fairness, i had let my expectations build to the point that the movie could not do anything but disappoint. after all, these two movies together represent possibly the greatest epic ever to be filmed, and the third is hopefully going to be a return to the quality of the first. though i must admit that i now have some doubts, something i would not have said after seeing fotr. also, on the plus side, the animation of gollum was imho just awesome. makes yoda and jar jar binks (hate to even mention him) and dobby seem like hand puppets. bottom line: i cannot hide a sense of disappointment. the tribute to tolkien and jackson is that i regard this lotr trilogy - and pj's films - as a personal possession, and i have lost a little pride in that possession upon the first viewing of ttt.";24 December 2002;10;['brilliant', 'extended', 'many', 'impossible', 'worthy', 'magnificent', 'proud', 'first', 'few', 'general', 'thrilled', 'elated', 'little', 'many', 'advanced', 'high', 'many', 'more', 'well', 'short', 'agape', 'particular', 'extended', 'first', 'weak', 'resolute', 'delirious', 'non', 'existent', 'countless', 'shortchanged', 'noble', 'likeable', 'bad', 'cold', 'distant', 'objectionable', 'minor', 'main', 'utter', 'great', 'uruk', 'huorn', 'much', 'deep', 'ok', 'bad', 'real', 'hokey', 'second', 'little', 'bad', 'final', 'middle', 'scripted', 'emotional', 'particular', 'quick', 'other', 'minor', 'pre', 'exorcised', 'black', 'black', 'necessary', 'main', 'generous', 'great', 'third', 'first', 'imho', 'awesome', 'bottom', 'personal', 'little', 'first'];0.1292746913580247

1719;bwv540;this film has left me in an awkward frame of mind. i don't know whether i want to sing peter jackson's praises to the world or mutter coarse and vulgar things about him under my breath. i am an unabashed and lifelong lord of the rings nut. i have read the books more times than i can remember. if you give me the name of the most obscure character, i can probably tell you all about him or her. if you read me a line from one of the books, i can probably tell you which book and chapter it is from, as well as it's context. i am also an avid film buff and understand perfectly well that a film-maker has to paraphrase, compress, and otherwise alter a book in order to fit it into a viable film. i think peter jackson did a masterful job of this with the fellowship of the ring, and i looked forward to a similar, if not even more faithful rendition of the two towers. after all, the story lines in the two towers (book) are fairly straightforward, though on multiple paths. so i was quite taken aback by the extent to which jackson has taken liberties with the story line in this film. several major deviations he made seem unnecessary and unforgivable to me, though others do make sense for the reasons given above. i ought to have been furious about this, perhaps even to the point of walking out of the film. but i wasn't, and here is why: it is just too good a movie not to like. the cast and performance are superb. the portrayal of gollum is beyond all my expectations, and the ents are quite good as well. the visuals are as breathtaking as they were in the first film. and, as with the fellowship of the ring, i was so immersed in the film that i had no sense of it's length. so if, like me, you have practically memorized tolkien's work, do see the film. if you can check your knowledge of the books at the theater entrance, you will enjoy the film for what it is. if you cannot, you will at least have a wealth of material for conversation. in either case, you will have a whole year to speculate about what pj will do with, or to, the return of the king.;30 December 2002;7;['awkward', 'vulgar', 'unabashed', 'lifelong', 'more', 'obscure', 'avid', 'viable', 'masterful', 'similar', 'faithful', 'straightforward', 'multiple', 'several', 'major', 'unnecessary', 'unforgivable', 'furious', 'good', 'superb', 'good', 'breathtaking', 'first', 'memorized', 'least', 'whole'];0.2072368421052631
1720;Thieron;first of, it is not as good as fellowship. it is however, almost as good. there were few elements i didn't like about the movie and many, many i did. most people are talking about the cg. and most people are focused on gollum. i want to give a mention to the ents. we all knew about what gollum should look like, but how do you animate a tree. now we know. the ents were perfect. there is no other way to decribe it. their distinct appearance, their voices, their mannerisms are all just brilliant. gollum is almost perfect. he still has that slight unreal look that all cg has that tells you he isn't really there, but from the way the actors and gollum himself behave, it doesn't cause a problem. he is animated, alive, and acts on the environment around him better than any cg character to date. there is a scene where gollum and smeagol complete for dominance that will blow you away. while everyone was anticiapting the battle of helms deep, few people were ready for the battle at isenguard. i think this stole the movie. the ents rampage was just amazing and there wasn't a second in the battle you though they were fake. it just felt like the keep was being torn apart. helms deep was one of the best action sequences ever. it is fast paced, intense, and features large and small scale fights all around to keep the variety going. the battle builds and builds until its wonderful climax that will have you cheering in your seat. now, i would give fellowship a 10. it is the perfect movie for that story. i give two towers, really, a 9.5. the problem in it are not enough to drop it more than that however. my problem, you ask? is the pace of the movie. unlike fellowship, which really, has two parts, two towers builds and builds for 2 hours until the battle of helms deep. after the first 1.5 hours i was just eager to see the battle and urging the movie to get on to it. there were a few small bits of action during the first 2 hours, but mostly it was story. mind you good story, but 2 hours is a long, long time to build up to something. especially when it seemed that it took forever just to watch the warriors of rohan preparing for the battle of helms deep. also, to create some tension, they make it seem like a key character might be dead, but it is a character you know will live, even if they don't stick to the books, this character is too important to die now. then, once the battle of helms deep start, there are breaks to the rest of the story, which is still slowly developing. it isn't until there are battles in all parts of the story that the pace really moves and you can't even sit back for a good 30 minutes. i wish they had started all the battles at the same time, so that while you would break from story to story, there would be action in all of them, so the last hour would be nothing more than a nonstop fight. the intensity of helms deep is just too great to switch to the ents talking and frodo walking. it is too much a shock in pace to feel confortable. that is why i'd say two towers is a 9.5. however, once the ending is in full gear, it makes up for just about any problems with the movie. the battle of helms deep is amazing and filled with bits that will leave you in glee and the ents rampage at isenguard will just leave you with chills.;19 December 2002;10;['good', 'good', 'few', 'many', 'many', 'most', 'most', 'perfect', 'other', 'distinct', 'brilliant', 'perfect', 'slight', 'alive', 'complete', 'deep', 'few', 'ready', 'amazing', 'fake', 'good', 'intense', 'large', 'small', 'wonderful', 'perfect', 'enough', 'deep', 'first', 'eager', 'few', 'small', 'first', 'good', 'long', 'long', 'deep', 'key', 'dead', 'important', 'deep', 'good', 'same', 'last', 'more', 'nonstop', 'great', 'much', 'confortable', 'full', 'amazing'];0.2765128968253968
1721;Digital-10;"hello, all! i am in the fortunate position to not only have read all three lotr books several times, and seen the fellowship of the ring (fotr) numerous times and the two towers (ttt) a few already, but also loving both the books and the films. listed below are a few ideas i think a few of you critics need to think about. 1) cliche as it is to say, if lotr was turned into a film completely after the books, it would have been about 36 hours long, if not more. impossible. some things need to be cut. 2) lotr are the best books i've ever read. they are still boring at times. you cannot tell me that you want to see sam and frodo walking through emyn muil and the dead marshes for as long as they do in ttt? in that case you should consider seeing a shrink! i haven't seen anyone complaining about all the songs and poems being cut out in the films. 3) the films need to be presented in a way that not only introduces lotr to people who haven't had the pleasure of reading the books, but to create a justifiable storyline and a visualization of lotr to its readers and fans. that's a difficult job. lotr: the films are not for its fans and readers only, nor is it for the people who haven't heard of lotr/read the books. it's for everyone! and in terms of that, it could properly not have done better. ok, now i would like to say that yeah, as a fan of the books i have my pointers to the films, why wasn't tom bombadil in the films? why does aragorn almost die in ttt? why doesn't sam look into the mirror of galadriel? why does boromir die in the first film and not the second? where is shelob? but the point is, nobody cares!!! we know all this, cause we've read the books. it's what we call interesting/additional information. the people who haven't, don't care, they'll never know! so in this way, everybody is happy. but it does create a loophole for another question i think is more interesting: why all the made-up stuff? well, it is simply necessary to gain as large an audience as possible, and as stated above, that's the purpose of the film, to be for everybody! i am sick of people saying that peter jackson is a bad director. the shots are fantastic, the actors (which have been directed) are doing a really good job, the tenseness, which of course is different from person to person, is higher than in many other films, and the film has a feeling of art about it. i am sick of people who have read the books and complain about the film being crap and not doing the books justice, when they themselves can't be bothered to spell characters' names correctly. go be miserable on your own while we others have fun. it's your loss. i am sick of people complaining about holes in the story when they simply haven't understood something. gandalf becomes the white because he earned that title by killing the balrog of morgoth. do some simple, fun, easy research, read the books, or even easier: listen to what the characters in the film are saying. please don't put your stupidity on display like that. guys and gals, in the end, if you read the books, and then see the films, you'll know everything, you should be able to appreciate everything, and if you only want to see the films, that's fine, you're in for a long movie which should entertain you till the end. if you only want to read the books, that's fine as well, but more than anything, peter jackson's films are supporting tolkien's work, not destroying it, not building on it, not overshadowing it. supporting it. giving it a new glance. and that, they do magnificently well. if you like the films, i feel sorry for you, for not being able to be done to, but i also respect your opinion, just make sense. and make sure that it makes sense to you, and that you're not just trying to be different, or trying to be critical. the lotr films are too good to be spoiled in that way. the books are always going to be the ultimate work of tolkien, and they will always be the best, if you need them to be. the films still complement the books, in the same way that the books complement the film. remember that your vision may not be the same as peter jackson's. that does not mean that either of you are wrong. it just means he had the money and power to show everyone his ideas, but that shouldn't matter to you. keep yours, and make them what they are to you, but accept jackson's as another vision, as fit to exist as yours. i, for one, cannot wait until the return of the king (rotk), when the trilogy will be completed, and in the meantime, i'll have fun reading tolkien's masterpieces (while skipping over the boring bits, like we all do ;o). enjoy the art. monroe";25 December 2002;10;['fortunate', 'several', 'numerous', 'few', 'few', 'few', 'more', 'impossible', 'good', 'emyn', 'dead', 'justifiable', 'difficult', 'first', 'second', 'shelob', 'interesting', 'additional', 'happy', 'interesting', 'necessary', 'large', 'possible', 'sick', 'bad', 'fantastic', 'good', 'different', 'high', 'many', 'other', 'sick', 'miserable', 'own', 'sick', 'white', 'simple', 'fun', 'easy', 'easy', 'able', 'fine', 'long', 'fine', 'more', 'new', 'sorry', 'able', 'sure', 'different', 'critical', 'good', 'ultimate', 'good', 'same', 'same', 'wrong', 'fit', 'rotk', 'fun', 'boring'];0.0799308132343846
1722;Vixen-8;okay, this wont be a unique comment on the movie. i liked the first one, it was giving a great picture of tolkiens world. at least to me it was as if peter jackson had copied the fantasies i had about the surroundings, the characters etc. sure, i missed tom bombadill, and i missed out on some of the things that wasnt there, but atleast there wasnt really anything added (except the fact that arwen rescues frodo instead of glorfindel, but that was something i could live with.) so ofcourse my expectations were high when i went to see ttt, and yes, the movie was as good as the first one, but the story according to the book was lousy. i can live with the fact that they had to exclude some parts of the book that were too hard to use in amovie, but what i dont like is that they've added alot of scenes that was totally inadequate, such as, why did the elves go to helms hold? why did faramir bring frodo and sam to osgiliath? why didnt we get to meet the female spider-monster in the end? why? why? why? there are also some general flaws, such as the fact that legolas refuses to use a saddle... altogether its a great movie, but lousy compared to the first one, it doesnt give me the same feeling of well-being as fotr did. i really do hope they dont screw up the third one.;10 February 2003;10;['unique', 'first', 'great', 'least', 'high', 'good', 'first', 'lousy', 'hard', 'inadequate', 'such', 'female', 'general', 'such', 'great', 'lousy', 'first', 'same', 'third'];0.1135185185185185

1724;bjshipley1;this was an outstanding film. it had excellent use of practical effects combined with cgi, and continued the character and plot development quite nicely. i was a little disappointed at first with the changes made to faramir, but after hearing the director's reasoning i must conclude that he has a good point. treebeard grew very tiring though. i know that's kind of the point, and the ents' behavior is even remarked upon, but it didn't make it drag on any less. gollum was awesome. andy serkis really knocked it out of the park with this character, setting a whole new standard for performance-capture. the big battle was good, but lack of variation had a very slight detrimental effect. i also enjoyed the new characters introduced, though i wish we could've seen more of eomer. overall, i'd recommend this to anyone.;2 October 2013;9;['outstanding', 'excellent', 'practical', 'little', 'disappointed', 'good', 'tiring', 'less', 'awesome', 'whole', 'new', 'big', 'good', 'slight', 'detrimental', 'new', 'more'];0.2572781385281385

1726;Fredrik Duprez;i must say i'm rather curious why the lengthy story with faramir is in the movie - he's portrayed like a totally different person than in the book. also, why change the temper of the ents so completely and make them look like they destroy isengard in the heat of the moment? i think the first movie was better in terms of keeping somewhat with the storyline of the book. hopefully the last movie is better.;30 December 2002;8;['curious', 'lengthy', 'different', 'first', 'well', 'last', 'well'];0.0375
1727;Leonymous;quite simply, this is one of the most incredible pieces of cinema ever committed to film. from the very first moment the direction and action grab you by the throat and refuse to let go until long after you've left the cinema. the film's epic proportions and feel as well as it's intense emotion are perfectly controlled by one of the greatest director's that cinema has ever seen. as an adaptation it's not without it's flaws, leaving many of us -who've read tolkien's novel- with questions still unanswered, even having watched the special extended edition. yet, over all, the changes made and omissions from the book are used to good effect in the exciting retelling of this chapter of the classic tale. superlative acting from a perfectly cast body of actors adds to the magic of this already classic film. a score to die for and jackson's sweeping direction create a world that is utterly involving and even believable. 'the two towers' is unparalleled in cinema history -except, of course, by it's predecessor 'the fellowship of the ring'- and sets new standards in film effects and story telling. the film is a cinematic journey of rich emotion and spectacular action which can not be praised highly enough. of course, it does have it's faults in storytelling and even the odd cgi shot, but these pale in comparison to the depth and magnitude of the overall picture. unlike some recent film successes, 'the two towers' rightly deserves it's place among any list or collection of cinema's greatest films. only the most threatened critic or hardened cynic could fail to be moved by this stunning movie creation. sheer brilliance.;14 December 2003;10;['incredible', 'first', 'epic', 'intense', 'great', 'many', 'unanswered', 'special', 'extended', 'good', 'exciting', 'classic', 'classic', 'sweeping', 'believable', 'unparalleled', 'new', 'cinematic', 'rich', 'spectacular', 'odd', 'overall', 'recent', 'great', 'threatened', 'cynic', 'stunning', 'sheer'];0.3080510069640504

""the fellowship of the ring"" comes close to doing this. the screenplay should have had a major rewrite staying truer to the book with more natural dialogue. many of the lines would be spoken and fall flat. there was no projection or passion in the lines, they were too stilted. joking in the middle of a battle should have been crossed out by the director, and the entire love story should have been deleted. doing this would have left room for the many scenes that were left out from the book. the ending of this movie lacks in drama and suspense, i deeply wanted to feel drawn into it and expect the next and last adventure, but the only thing i wanted was to get out of the room. what i greatly saw spelled over the entire movie was ""tired."" the actors were tired and the director was tired, and this was just another movie to crank out. with every scene saying ""ok, that's done. let's move on,"" with no care or artistic appreciation of the true art of filmmaking. i don't expect much from ""the return of the king"" next year and i don't expect much from peter jackson as he's too soft of a director to show the true grittiness of middle earth. he is targetting this movie more towards females and those who haven't read the books and not true tolkien fans like myself. overall it was a decent action film, with your typical fight choreography, one liners, legolas and his unlimited arrows, and the good guys always coming out unscathed.

1769;TheImpaler;after having read some comments on imdb and reviews in newspapers i finally got to see the movie myself and i don't actually know what people are complaining about. entertaiment doesn't get better than this. i think i can safely promise to anyone who goes to see this movie that he/she won't be bored at all. this is not one of these stupid cgi and action-filled movies without heart and essence. i guess you knew this already because fotr wasn't either. the story - and what jackson made of it - is so epic and gripping that i was more than once shivering and shaking in my seat. i don't want to go into detail because i think most people know the story and for those who don't it may spoil the fun. but what i really have to say to people who dislike the movie because they say it doesn't stick close to the book or because something isn't quite looking like they wanted to or blah blah blah... how can you be this annoying? i mean, there are people who know everyone from these three books. they can tell the slightest difference between book and movie and dislike most of them. well, sure, this is your opinion. i don't want to hurt anybodys feelings, but there are more books out there - even, although it may sound unbelievable - better ones. normally i really understand peoples feelings towards books very much. i myself read a lot and i am mostly disappointed with book adaptions (didn't like the hp movies very much) but with this one, i really can't follow these arguments. this movie is so brilliant and epic especially the way it gets you emotionally involved that i dare to say: it is better than the book. this is the tale of a handful of heroes who try to save their world and it pretty much feels like this. what do you want more? are these changes really spoiling the quality of this movie? no, they aren't. the movie works pretty well for itself and it takes the essence of tolkiens story - if there is any. tolkien himself said - if i remember this right - that the books do not have a deeper meaning, that they should stand as what they are: an epic fantasy tale. *****mild spoiler******* so, why is it bad then to change faramirs character to focus on the essence of frodos journey - the rising danger of the ring? ****end of mild spoiler****** it isn't. this movie has to simplify the book and it does this pretty well. look at what they've done to the harry potter books: they even forgot to give harry a character! i cannot understand what people love so much about the books that they do not find in the movie. yes, i know, the books full of details about the history of middle-earth. and i know, they take a lot of time for everything. e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g. many times they are plain boring and not at all brilliantly written. this is my opinion. you may dislike me for it, but i did not feel anything while reading them. to me the characters and landscapes remained blurry and dull. i still liked the story and think that what tolkien thought up is a brilliant piece of work, but his books didn't get me involved. the movie did. it got me very involved. and to get this to an end: in my opinion this movie gives tolkiens story the epic scale and especially the feelings that should have been in the book. and it is a brilliant movie in itself. it is so good that i think complaining about it is a complete waste of time, because as i said in the beginning: entertainment doesn't get better than this. and after all movies and books of this kind mostly are about entertainment, aren't they?;18 December 2002;10;['well', 'stupid', 'epic', 'more', 'most', 'annoying', 'slight', 'most', 'anybodys', 'more', 'unbelievable', 'well', 'hp', 'brilliant', 'epic', 'involved', 'well', 'more', 'deep', 'epic', 'mild', 'bad', 'mild', 'harry', 'full', 'middle', 'many', 'boring', 'blurry', 'dull', 'brilliant', 'involved', 'epic', 'brilliant', 'good', 'complete', 'well'];0.1447530864197531
1770;finezer54;"i feel compelled to comment on peter jackson's lotr series now that we have seen 2 of 3 parts of the book. as a movie scholar and a 14-time reader of the trilogy, i hope not to have the biases exhibited by too many reviewers. the two movies so far have been as an impressive an effort in film as virtually any movie ever made. the scale of production, special effects, and ensemble acting are simply beyond the scale of any movie production in history. that does not mean that fotr and ttt are the best movies ever made; they are both outstanding but not flawless. however, no one has (or probably ever will) attempted as enormous a task as making three movies at one time and achieving the incredible results we have seen. these movies have been almost universally loved by both audiences and critics. the only naysayers are the tolkien nutcases who cannot take a microscopic deviation from the trilogy. they seem to forget that books and movies are not the same art form. upon viewing ttt for the first time, i sat there and examined the movie in detail trying to identify flaws and discrepancies from the book. my initial reaction was mixed. my second viewing was based on a less cynical attitude. when you just watch and enjoy, ttt stands on its own and is pretty incredible. the changes from tolkien can be improvements on the book (especially the often criticized, more realistic depiction of faramir, who is no longer perfect). the story is very slightly altered, but holds true to the concepts of the book and to the characters. the book is a collection of words which we mentally turn into images; the movie is a collection of images and words which depict a virtually identically story. after all, the movie shouldn't be a film of a narrator reading the book out loud. the battle scenes should be extended as compared with the book; that's what movies are good at. the movie is about 98% true to the book and is quite excellent. the final hour is almost breathtaking, as is the entire depiction of gollum (who almost steals the show). for those who hate the movie, i am certain others would hate your filmed version of the book.";14 February 2003;10;['many', 'impressive', 'special', 'ensemble', 'good', 'outstanding', 'flawless', 'enormous', 'incredible', 'only', 'microscopic', 'same', 'first', 'initial', 'mixed', 'second', 'cynical', 'own', 'incredible', 'realistic', 'perfect', 'true', 'good', 'true', 'excellent', 'final', 'breathtaking', 'entire', 'certain'];0.4032627865961199
1771;stshipley;"warning: spoilers possible last night's premiere of the two towers was an excellent movie experience, with a few minor quibbles. first, as has been mentioned in some other comments, there are a few scenes where they portray legolas as a super hero, and his antics are so over the top as to illicit more than a few snickers or groans from the audience. second, some of the battle scenes, though very impressive in their grand scale, have the feel of the clone war in attack of the clones, where you felt like the computer animators just couldn't restrain themselves. lastly, for a three hour movie, there were times when the pace of the movie was off. some matters were rushed, and you felt like they needed more explanation, and others dragged on or were repeated seemingly too many times. on the flip side, the movie has some very fine points. when gollum first appeared, i was very disappointed at the cgi rendering, and his dialog seemed poorly synced with his mouth. but after that initial sequence, almost everything he did, his movements, the emotions his face conveys, the very depth of his character . . . . it was astounding. it still doesn't replace an actor, but it comes damn close, closer than anything ever presented on film. and the battle scenes are top notch, especially helms deep, though the ent assault on isengard is very impressive. i personally thought their rendering of the ents was very well done. i've read the book, and the book purists will have much to complain about, but i understand the choices peter jackson made about deferring much of the story to return of the king, and making helms deep the climax of the film (it's in the middle of the book). and there is a ""hollywood"" slant to some of the dialog and action sequences that jackson has taken some liberties with, but the essence and soul of the book come across. i would regard the movie as well worth your money for a big screen ticket and 3.5 hours in a crowded theater. i anxiously await the final picture. 9/10";19 December 2002;9;['possible', 'last', 'excellent', 'few', 'minor', 'other', 'few', 'super', 'more', 'few', 'impressive', 'grand', 'clone', 'more', 'many', 'flip', 'fine', 'disappointed', 'initial', 'very', 'astounding', 'close', 'close', 'top', 'notch', 'deep', 'impressive', 'much', 'much', 'deep', 'worth', 'big', 'crowded', 'final'];0.2322

1802;xxparxx;"i will do my best to sum up my feelings and observations about this movie. to start off, i consider myself one of the most avid tolkien fans in the world. i know that is a self-proclaiming thing to say, but this story has had a place in my heart for over 20 years and without having any role models as a young man growing up in a terrible situation, i placed many of my beliefs and philosophies in the honor that tolkien portrayed in aragorn's character (think what you like... everyone has something they believe in, i chose this). enough said, on to my review: knowing the books as well as i do, i was disappointed in some of the liberties jackson took with his vision. in both the first and second films, he made some director decisions that i believe were unnecessary. i also think that he loves the story enough to be faithful in the majority, but his ego gets the better of him when he has the power to impress his vision when he wants. (i say this because during his award acceptance, he never once thanked the man who made this whole thing possible... tolkien). **** start of the spoilers---book/movie comparison **** as with the first movie, the changes made could be attributed to many things. it's such a long story to put onto the screen that many allowances must be made to make it appealing for large audiences. i agree with not making the audience sit for 5 hours for 1/3 of a story, just to make it true to the books. but... the following list of changes is unnecessary ... 1) aragorn: jackson's portrayal of aragorn in the tt starts to evolve more into the character that tolkien created. in fotr (movie), aragorn is made into a self-pitying, unwitting hero. this is not who aragorn is. in the books he knows who he is, and not only accepts it, he is it. throughout the story he acts as the king of men he will one-day be, the leader of the dunedain... men of numeanor. as in the book, aragorn should have been portrayed as ""the kings of past, come again"", not a reluctant hero. ok... side tracked a little --- two towers problems with aragorn: why on earth did they make him go over the edge? to me they should have been more true to the books in other areas (mentioned later) instead of forcing scenes with arwen. doing flashbacks and all is great.. but over the edge, make him seem dead, and then save him by a horse that comes out of nowhere and appears to give him cpr. sorry but this wasn't in the book. 2)theodin: theodin's character before/after his ""affliction"" is very questionable. i sat in the theatre embarrassed with gandalf's exorcism of theodin. it was laughable. same complaint i have with aragorn, in the book, when theodin is woken up and confronted with grima's subversions, he sees the destruction of rohan caused by his actions and then does everything a king should to protect his people. why was he portrayed as a weak king during the trip to helms deep and his ruling of a besieged fortress? he does send riders to gondor, not fight with aragorn about it. in the movie i get the feeling that jackson was trying to fix his errors with aragorn and show that aragorn really is a true leader by making theodin look like an idiot. 3)faramir: here is my 2nd largest problem with the movie. faramir is my 2nd favorite character in the whole story. he is noble, honorable, decisive and (as stated in the books) ""a mirror of gondor's rulers of old"". he lives his life and makes decisions with honor and what is best for his people. unlike his brother (and their father denethor) whose character is based on pride, faramir is confronted with frodo and the ring and handles the situation like a true hero. he is cautious, occasionally ruthless because of his leadership and responsibilities, but he realizes what frodo is doing and what the ring really is. he is faced with a decision, makes frodo do what he did with gollum, and comes to his own realization as to what must be done for the best of middle earth. 4) helms deep: this i think was a total disappointment. don't get me wrong, the special effects are the best i've ever seen and if this was not based on a story so well loved, i would have thought it absolutely the coolest thing i ever saw. to keep it simple, eomer is cast out with some of his most trusted followers (40-50 horsemen, not 2000). helms deep is a hopeless confrontation that has no outcome other than total destruction of the people of rohan unless some other race helps them. the elves don't help them; the ents with the hurons (spelling not sure of) help them. hell if jackson was worried about effects cost, the true story would have been cheap and true. a massive blackness, darker than the night amasses behind the orcish hordes. there is confusion, the fighting stops and all defenders wonder what new hell they must face. amid the silence, screams and the sound of battle erupt on the other side of the invading army and after some time, all is silent. as the first rays of morning sunlight break over the mountains above, a massive forest appears in the place of the besieging army, silent, feeling of anger, and gandalf appears as promised. --- not 2000 mysterious horsemen with gandalf at the head of the charge... lame... my gripes are meaningful and if i had 500 more words i could tell more. i don't. overall as a movie i really liked everything else. as i watch it more and more i think ill like it as much as the first one. but true to the books it is not.";23 December 2002;9;['good', 'avid', 'young', 'terrible', 'many', 'disappointed', 'first', 'second', 'unnecessary', 'faithful', 'well', 'whole', 'possible', 'first', 'many', 'long', 'many', 'large', 'true', 'unnecessary', 'more', 'aragorn', 'unwitting', 'reluctant', 'ok', 'little', 'true', 'other', 'great', 'dead', 'questionable', 'laughable', 'same', 'weak', 'deep', 'aragorn', 'true', 'large', 'favorite', 'whole', 'noble', 'honorable', 'decisive', 'old', 'good', 'true', 'cautious', 'ruthless', 'own', 'good', 'middle', 'deep', 'total', 'wrong', 'special', 'good', 'cool', 'simple', 'hopeless', 'other', 'total', 'other', 'sure', 'worried', 'true', 'cheap', 'true', 'massive', 'dark', 'orcish', 'new', 'other', 'silent', 'first', 'massive', 'silent', 'mysterious', 'meaningful', 'more', 'more', 'ill', 'first', 'true'];0.1233743369306749
1803;gbutler1;what people who come to this film need to realize is that what peter jackson has done (and honestly, what any director could have done) is create an interpretation of the written works. arguing points like lack of songs, the fact that elves joined the men in battle, the exaggeration of scenes and characters says absolutely nothing about the film as a piece of art. all it does is say that aspects that you liked about the books weren't present. when something is adapted to film, be it book, play, or a previous movie you have to expect things to be different...time must be accounted for, flow of narrative, and above all the difference in how a film entertains versus how a novel of hundreds of pages entertains. when a stage director goes to show a shakespearean play on stage, lines are cut, scenes are changed, and nuances are done according to the director. this is how it is, and how it has to be... what peter jackson has done is adapt a remarkable written work, into a remarkable filmed work. yes, the two are different, but they are completely different media.what matters is that the essence of the story remains...what makes the film so wonderful is that the world of middle earth, the characters in it, and the basic story has been brought to the screen. enjoy the film as a separate piece of art that stands on its own, and enjoy the novel the same way.;18 December 2002;10;['present', 'previous', 'different', 'shakespearean', 'remarkable', 'remarkable', 'different', 'different', 'wonderful', 'middle', 'basic', 'separate', 'own', 'same'];0.2444444444444444

1809;Cthulhu42;this movie is another amazing movie from peter jackson that is almost as good as the original. it has great acting, amazing special effects, sweeping landscapes, a huge action sequence, and on top of all that it's also pretty funny. all of the remaining fellowship are just as good as the first, and most of the new characters are just as well cast and well acted as the original group. miranda otto is great as eowyn, theoden is excellent, the ents are about as good as the ents could possibly be, seeing as i never really liked them from the book to begin with, and gollum is frankly the best character in the movie hands down. also, gimly is given a lot more character and shows off dwarven pride in many hilarious ways. the opening is so cool, my only problem with it was that it was too short. i know a lot of people had issues with the pacing and the editing, but personally i didn't have a problem following things. i have read the book, but that was years ago, so i wasn't completely up on the story going in. it seemed to be very well cut together considering that there are three story lines. the movie deviates a lot from the book, but i'm not so much of a purist that i have a real problem with that. it stays true to the characters and plot, with the exception of faramir, and it certainly ended up working well as a movie. i think over all it was a very faithful adaptation of the book. but, i did have a few problems with it. first, the action in the movie was too clumpy. i know this is more a problem with the story itself, but it was still annoying that all the action came at the very end, instead of being spread throughout like the first one. also, i know i'm alone on this, but helm's deep wasn't as good as i was expecting. i blame that a bit on the fact that it was overhyped, as it was pretty cool, but i still think that the battles in the first movie were better. i think one reason for this is the fact that in the first movie there were individual enemies, like the balrog, the cave troll, the nazgul, or the uruk-hai chieftan, that stood out and made the fights more dynamic, scary, and interesting. in this movie all the enemies look the same, and it lacks a sense of real power on the side of evil. if they had just left shelob in i think i would have felt better about this aspect of the film. still, all in all it worked better as an action movie than most others in the genre, and in my mind was an even better drama than action movie, so it's hard to complain. the other problem was the ending. at the end of the first movie i really wanted to just keep sitting there and watch more. at the end of this movie i was ready to go home. it wasn't that it was bad, but unlike the first movie the ending seemed rushed, and put a damper on the overall drama that had been running through the last hour of the movie. if the movie had been just a minute longer, and they had wrapped things up a bit more, it would have been as good as the first one. if i could, i would give fotr a 9.7, fotr extendend 9.8, and this movie a 9.5, just for comparisons sake. given that i can't, i'll just go with 10/10, as i will probably like it even more with a second viewing.;19 December 2002;9;['amazing', 'good', 'original', 'great', 'amazing', 'special', 'sweeping', 'huge', 'funny', 'good', 'first', 'most', 'new', 'original', 'great', 'excellent', 'good', 'good', 'more', 'dwarven', 'many', 'hilarious', 'cool', 'only', 'short', 'much', 'real', 'true', 'faithful', 'few', 'clumpy', 'annoying', 'very', 'first', 'alone', 'deep', 'good', 'cool', 'first', 'well', 'first', 'individual', 'dynamic', 'scary', 'interesting', 'same', 'real', 'well', 'most', 'well', 'hard', 'other', 'first', 'more', 'ready', 'bad', 'first', 'overall', 'last', 'more', 'good', 'first', 'second'];0.2832084582084581
1810;pl004j@mail.rochester.edu;"-------------------spoilers contained within this review!!!!------------ ok, let me preface my review by saying i overall enjoyed the movie. if i hadn't read the books (many times) i probably would have really enjoyed the movie, but i don't think i would have enjoyed it as much as the first. that sentence is misleading, however. i did in fact, enjoy the two towers, it just left me with a sour taste in my mouth (read below for details) the fellowship of the ring was, in my opinion, one of the best movies i'd ever seen. it didn't remain entirely true to the books, but there were few additions, and a few ommisions that didn't have an overall effect on important characters in the story to come. the biggest problem with the two towers, is that, as has been said before, some of the added material is unnecessary, some not necessary but interesting things were left out, and a few important plot changes were made. to me, there were four big changes that are worth noting, and i'll in the increasing order in which they bothered me. first, the battle with the wargs (giant hyenas?) was an addition, and a reasonably significant one. for the most part, i would say this was a welcome addition. more than anything else, it was simply exciting, however it could have done without aragorn going over the cliff. second, the elves being included in the battle of helm's deep was neither here nor there for me. it really added nothing to the story, but it didn't take much away from it either. third, was king theoden being possessed by saruman. this is where the changes start hurting tolkein's character development, and will ultimately put a damper on the character development for the next installment. as mentioned in an earlier review, theoden breaks free from wormtongue on his own, which shows his will. he is also a much stronger king in the books. lastly and to its largest detriment is the change in the way faramir handles the situation with the ring. as we learn later on, faramir is the highly unfavored son of the leader of gondor, because he was ""weaker"" than boromir. i understand jackson's justification of making faramir want to please his father, but that is simply not how faramir's character is drawn up. he is noble and wise. he intuitively knows what happened to boromir, and knows he can't make the same mistake. unfortunately, this happens and moves on until the movie is nearly over, and it left me with a sour taste in my mouth. it just wasn't necessary and will hurt the character development across the films. for people familiar with the books, there are a lot of other obvious changes from the book, but these are overall less significant. the development of the ents is obviously lacking in the film, but the overall effect isn't much different. the reason the changes in fellowship of the ring were so tolerable was because the end result was still the same as the book. ultimately, the same thing happens with the two towers. it leaves us about 30-50 pages before the end of the novel, but the path we take to get there changes things that will have an impact past the scope of this film on its own. now that i've gotten that gripe out of the way, i'll discuss some other things! gollum (smeagol) was produced exquisitely. his interaction with frodo and sam is very believable, and his facial expressions and humanity (hobbity?) are both impecable. the battle scenes in general are impressive to say the least, but you won't find anything like the fight sequence in moria with the cave troll, or the duel between aragorn and the uruk-hai fighter like you did in fellowship. the battles in the two towers are bigger, but somehow less exciting. it's comparaing apples to oranges though. what the two towers does in its battle sequences it does very, very well. as far as large scale battles go, there isn't much that can rival the execution of the battle at helm's deep. the opening scene with gandalf, is a good way to get the audiences pulse going, and the scene showing his return to gimli, aragorn and legolas and the fight on top of the mountain was amazing. my conclusion is simply that i must see the movie again, knowing what to expect. this way, the changes won't distract me, and i'll be able to concentrate on exactly what's happening in front of me.";18 December 2002;8;['many', 'first', 'misleading', 'sour', 'good', 'true', 'few', 'few', 'overall', 'important', 'big', 'unnecessary', 'necessary', 'interesting', 'few', 'important', 'big', 'worth', 'giant', 'significant', 'most', 'welcome', 'more', 'exciting', 'aragorn', 'third', 'theoden', 'next', 'early', 'theoden', 'free', 'own', 'strong', 'large', 'unfavored', 'weak', 'boromir', 'noble', 'wise', 'same', 'sour', 'necessary', 'familiar', 'other', 'obvious', 'significant', 'overall', 'different', 'tolerable', 'same', 'same', 'own', 'other', 'believable', 'facial', 'impecable', 'general', 'impressive', 'least', 'uruk', 'big', 'exciting', 'large', 'much', 'deep', 'good', 'gimli', 'aragorn', 'amazing', 'able'];0.2053776683087027

1827;justinrsko;"the opening scene of the two towers provides an outstanding, yet very brief, taste of action, cinematography, and special effects, only to be matched (and far surpassed) in the final hour of the film. the stunning events of the third hour of the two towers are undoubtedly the centerpiece of the film, and while the first two hours serve finely as story development, they primarily build anticipation for the final hour, which mostly depicts the battle of helm's deep. more than anything else, the first two hours merely tease and torment the patient audience. it's a shame that such a gap has to exist between the first minute and the final hour, but i take no reservations in saying that despite how you feel about the first two hours of the film, the final hour will make the wait entirely worth its while. as stated, the road to the battle of helm's deep can be enormously long and painful for any viewer aware of what breathtaking scenes await towards the end of the film. perhaps the two towers' biggest fault is in its own accomplishments; the first two thirds of the film are well shot, well paced, and they necessarily and adequately progress the storyline, but when compared to the spectacular final hour, the first two hours seem uneventful and insignificant. however, to be fair, i feel that it's simply impossible to create two hours of film that could appropriately lead into the battle of helm's deep. it's difficult to comprehend how such scenes came to exist in the rather short amount of time peter jackson has had to create six hours (so far) of finished film. the battle of helm's deep is simply unreal; it's unlike any event that has come to pass since fantasy films gained, and regained, popularity. as assumed, the two towers begins where the fellowship of the ring ended. the majority of the film follows four separate groups and their story lines: frodo and sam; aragorn and legolas, merry and pippin, and saruman and his army. the performances live well up to the standards of the first film, with a particularly notable performance from viggo mortensen as aragorn, whose role is significantly larger in the two towers. aragorn satisfies a thirst for someone to root for, a thirst that was left partly unquenched in fellowship. it's much easier to root for aragorn than it is for frodo; aragorn has many more qualities of a leading man, a soldier, and a hero. more than once did the audience, filled mostly with academy voters, applaud the heroics of aragorn. gollum also shines in a much-welcomed large role, due to extremely realistic computer animation, and a fine performance from andy serkis, upon which the animation was modeled. in fellowship, it was appropriate to consider gollum one of the many great 'features' of the film. however, here he is more of a leading character and a 'star,' and his convincing dual-personality, stabbing voice, and well-choreographed body movements make him consistently eye-grabbing and the center of focus of nearly every scene in which he appears. as was the fellowship of the ring, the two towers is a visual delight. those who have seen fellowship are no doubt familiar with the beauty of the landscapes of new zealand. the cinematography is, again, one of the best aspects of the film. the swooshing camera movements that follow the armies and horsemen throughout the fields are extremely satisfying in this post-matrix era. the shots of the ascending enemy-laden ladders in the battle of helm's deep are terrifying and chillingly gorgeous all at once. the visual effects take an appropriate leap forward from those of the first film. while the visual effects in fellowship were outstanding, the battle of helm's deep provides for the best application of cgi since the rippling waves of the matrix's 'bullet time.' the battle of helm's deep features absolutely awe-inspiring and seamless integration of acting, stunts, and computer animation. each orc seems to have its own personality, demonstrated in its movements and visual features. the masses of armies fight with strategy and true character, which i imagine is much harder to accomplish than animating thousands of identical clone troopers. the only problem i have with the visual department is the look of gimli, the treebeard. gimli's visual features seem a bit childish and uninspired, inconsistent with the standards set by the rest of the film. but again, there is simply nothing that compares to the battle of helm's deep. george lucas and the wachowski brothers certainly have not created anything that approaches the grandness and magnificence of the two towers' final hour, and i doubt they will do so anytime soon. in the fellowship of the ring, i had a few minor problems with howard shore's score. while i thought it was gorgeous and it established several very memorable themes, i don't think it handled the sentimental scenes (opening in the shire, gandalf's passing) properly. i thought it caved in to the melodrama a bit too much, resembling the emotions from james horner's titanic. however, i believe that the two towers requires the type of score which howard shore accomplishes best: dark, continuous, and unrelenting, as demonstrated in se7en and silence of the lambs. the theme used in many of the action scenes in fellowship (low brass, six notes repeated with a rest in between) is much more present in the two towers, appropriately. a brand new theme is also unveiled, the theme for rohan, a prominent kingdom in middle earth. rohan's theme is played more often than any other melody in the film, underscoring most of the memorable and heroic scenes with great effect. howard shore undeniably exhibits his skills as an 'a-list' composer, and with a possible double oscar nomination this year for the two towers and gangs of new york, he could get propelled to the very top of the 'a-list,' right beside john williams and hans zimmer in terms of demand. if not the picture itself, there should be a way to recognize and award the battle of helm's deep. the battle sequence alone represents successful filmmaking in its highest form. the choreography of the battle, the visual effects, the pacing, acting, cinematography, and music, all work together in perfection to achieve grand filmmaking which is as entertaining and enjoyable as film can be. for this very reason, no one, whether a fan of fellowship or not, should miss the two towers.";8 December 2002;10;['outstanding', 'brief', 'special', 'final', 'stunning', 'third',

1829;lertch1001;*spoilers after first paragraph* (although how much you could spoil a fifty year old book i am not sure) i saw fellowship last year and was absolutely blown away. i hadn't read tolkien since jr. high, but it captured everything i liked about the books and even highlighted and expanded some of the central themes. for me, fellowship of the ring was one of the best movies ever made--i saw beautiful mind once and thought it was nice, but i have watched fellowship over and over and i am still moved by it. like many of you, i reread the lord of the rings and eagerly looked forward to the two towers. reading the books may have been a mistake in terms of enjoying the movie. when the book is fresh on your mind, everything that is different from the novel jars you and inhibits your ability to relax and take in the film. for example, i was anticipating the climactic battle with shelob and i started getting anxious as i realized the film was going in a completely different direction. my main questions/gripes: 1) tolkien's relationship with nature is one of the hallmarks of his work and i felt that jackson unnecessarily minimized the ents by making them appear foolishly out of touch with nature. what was gained by having merry trick treebeard instead of having treebeard come to his own conclusions based on his supernatural relationship with fanghorn forest and the damaged being caused it by sauruman. 2)frodo wandering up to the ringwraith and holding up the ring made no sense--why did the wraith just fly around aimlessly once it had seen the ring? was it scared of the way sam knocked frodo down the stairs and it feared it would suffer the same fate? frodo and sam had time for a nice conversation, but the wraith was somehow unable to just fly down and pick them up. 3)farimir quickly deciding to free both of them and their potential weapon with little obvious reason for doing so. i can't see how any of these changes helped the movie--please e-mail me if you have insights. however, these gripes all stem from a jarring of expectations set up by the book. otherwise, i thought the character of aragorn in particular was nicely portrayed, and the battle scenes were superb. gollum surpassed expectations. this movie also caught the same shakespearian themes introduced in the first one--we all suffer from greed, lust for power, and jealousy, but the most common person can stand up to the greatest human foibles. i will be looking forward to next december for the scene with shelob--and i hope jackson slows down the pace a bit for more reflective scenes that made fellowship such a great movie. fellowship rated a perfect 10--the two towers gets an 8.5 or 9.;30 December 2002;10;['first', 'much', 'old', 'sure', 'last', 'high', 'central', 'good', 'beautiful', 'nice', 'many', 'fresh', 'different', 'novel', 'climactic', 'anxious', 'different', 'main', 'own', 'supernatural', 'fanghorn', 'scared', 'same', 'nice', 'unable', 'potential', 'little', 'obvious', 'particular', 'superb', 'same', 'shakespearian', 'first', 'common', 'great', 'human', 'next', 'reflective', 'great', 'perfect'];0.2506818181818182

1842;ahellyer;"like most people who saw this film, i found it to be a very enjoyable experience. while it is not without some flaws overall it deserves the praise it has received. (please excuse the spoilers ahead). for those of you who found it a bit disjointed just remember that the film encompasses two major plot lines - events in rohan and frodo heads to mordor - plus the minor one of merry and pippin's escapades. no matter how the director tries to fit them together it won't suit all viewers. additionally, as the middle part of a trilogy it was always going to be difficult to make it stand on its own as well as the first. but just wait until 2004 when you can watch all three in a row.... for those of you who have made comments about film quality, the cgi used to overlay the digital gollum over the actor andy cserkis, etc, i highly recommend getting the dvd extended edition pack that has two discs devoted to the making of the first film. just sit back and enjoy the action, scenery, music and adventure. appreciate the scope of the movies and the effort made for realism (for example, two guys spent about 18 months full time just making suits of chainmail). read the books and if possible watch fotr again before you see ttt. sure it is a long movie and slow in parts but what movie isn't. and don't get caught up with trying to compare it to other great movies (if you think the godfather movies are the pinnacle of cinema excellence, fine, but they are not the lotr trilogy and should not be rated against each other). as for some of the other issues people have commented/complained about... 1. faramir - i agree that jackson was a bit harsh on him but i believe tolkien himself was a bit generous towards him. imagine you are the commander of military forces guarding your borders from huge evil and two little guys turn up carrying a powerful artifact that in the wrong hands would destroy your land. i think faramir would have been suspicious of their motives (as he was at first in the book) and not basically say ""off you go lads, here's some food, head due east to mordor, you can't miss it - high mountains, volcanoes and a squillion orcs"". wait for the third movie to see him more in tune with the faramir of the books. his change of heart and allowing the hobbits to leave is, i suspect, also part of setting the conflict with, and within, his father denethor in the next book. 2. shelob - don't worry she will be in the next movie. gollum basically says so at the end of ttt. who cares whether she was in the second book but not in the second movie. 3. elves at helm's deep are a symbol of the wider conflict - peter jackson is trying to convey in the movie what was covered in a few lines in the books - namely that forces of evil were fighting elves, men and dwarves elsewhere while the fighting in gondor and rohan was occurring. i would not find it unusual if the third movie had dwarves appearing at the siege of minas tirith to further symbolise the alliance of the three races. the sequence with elrond and galdriel was necessary to explain why the elves would be at helm's deep. 4. aragorn and eowyn - this bit is basically showing eowyn's infatuation with a powerful, handsome and noble man (which is touched upon in tolkien's writings somewhere). cliched? perhaps, but in real life romance, when you look closely, is often cliched. why should the movies be any different? i have to admit that the bit with aragorn falling off the cliff is a bit unnecessary - perhaps the extended version might make it clearer. 5. arwen and aragorn - some found this theme slow and laboured. but remember she is considering giving up immortality for aragorn, not just deciding what colour gossamer dress to wear that day. it is an integral theme to tolkien's work.";2 January 2003;10;['most', 'enjoyable', 'major', 'minor', 'middle', 'difficult', 'own', 'first', 'digital', 'first', 'full', 'possible', 'sure', 'long', 'other', 'great', 'fine', 'other', 'other', 'harsh', 'generous', 'military', 'huge', 'little', 'powerful', 'wrong', 'suspicious', 'due', 'high', 'third', 'next', 'next', 'second', 'second', 'deep', 'wide', 'few', 'unusual', 'third', 'necessary', 'deep', 'aragorn', 'powerful', 'handsome', 'noble', 'real', 'different', 'aragorn', 'unnecessary', 'extended', 'clear', 'slow', 'laboured', 'integral'];0.0804710144927536

1858;bobboman;"peter jackson has taken one of the greatest stories ever written and turned it into mindless action. first off, the script is horrid. where did the genius of tolkien disappear? the dialogue is cut down and resembles one-liners. the directing is unbelievably bad with constant camera movement making character development impossible. fast cut scenes are at all times jumping at you from the screen so you never get the time to fully absorb the story, forget about the time to think. and you're not supposed to, there are no layers (they are magically gone, thanks to the decisions of peter jackson), what you see is what you get. continuity and development are sacrificed to create a pill more easily swallowed. it's like a restaurant where they feed you, and if they do it fast enough then maybe you won't notice that the food isn't cooked. this might work with traditional action (because let's face it, we like them because they give us a 90 minute vacation from our brain), but in the case of lotr it only goes to diminish and destroy a work of art. probably the worst thing about this movie is the music score (still it's much better than fotr, as it's less titanic). anyone with any understanding of music will see how shallow the composition is. it reminds me of composed music used in computer games, poorly directed and lacking depth. also it keeps blowing what little suspense it has by frequently changing to custom fit each and every scene. really nice touch this considering that the scenes change without logic. from the midst of the battle of helmsdeep to merry and pippin in a quiet forest. somebody please explain to peter how suspense is built. besides this, the music has nothing to do with ""the lord of the rings"", it doesn't capture the right atmosphere and it keeps repeating itself. it's just there and it's there all the time, every scene (another poor directing decision. it didn't give fotr an epic feel and it failed again in tt). wouldn't it have been nice if the music featured in the television trailer was actually in the movie? in the storyline jackson has made some unforgivable alterations. tolkien would weep if he knew. the lord of the rings is mainly about the journey of frodo, because if he fails then all is lost. this is also the most interesting part of the story because it is symbolic, dark and a psychological struggle. this is why two thirds of the books are about frodo. in this second movie jackson has devoted minimum screen time to this most important, atmospheric and perilous journey. in stead he has used countless minutes, not polishing the rest of the actual story (it often feels like it's on fast-forward and in many scenes the emphasis is on all the wrong things), but adding loads of new scenes which have nothing to do with anything. apart from changing the story he has also changed some of the the characters (why?). peter jackson tries so hard to entertain us, deadly afraid that we'll get bored for even a second thus insulting our intelligence. he sets his own trap and blindly walks into it. **spoilers** the book is supposed to be dark, hope is supposed to fade and ""the two towers"" is supposed to end in the mountains of mordor with frodo poisoned and taken captive by the orcs and sam stuck in some dark underground maze with the ring and nowhere to go. instead the movie ends with sam giving an inspiring speech about those ""favorite stories where all seems lost but where you know that the good guys will win in the end"", in some idyllic forest far from mordor with a lot of light and sappy music. this sums up what injustice jackson has done to the lotr pretty good. **spoilers end** but why? because peter jackson isn't the greatest director in the world. and because they wanted to make money and ""the lord of the rings"" as it is today is making buckets of it. they wanted a brainless action adventure that followed mainstream traditions that even children could pay to see. they wanted to sell aragorn rangers and arwen barbies. this i can understand, and if it weren't so the movie would never have been made. work and a lot of money went into creating the visuals. what i can't understand is independent critics praising it, when clearly the movie is lacking. there's more to an epic than visuals. a darker, more true and intelligent tale would make a great movie, but it wouldn't make a sure box office income. in the end, fotr and tt aren't that bad if you just look at them as action-adventure movies (specially fotr). and one very good thing is that more people will now read the books. but they're just not tolkien. and don't tell me that it doesn't matter, because it does. i was disappointed with both the fellowship of the ring and [specially] the two towers, not because they're so bad, but because they could have been so much better.";18 January 2003;4;['great', 'mindless', 'horrid', 'bad', 'constant', 'impossible', 'fast', 'traditional', 'bad', 'well', 'titanic', 'shallow', 'little', 'nice', 'quiet', 'right', 'poor', 'epic', 'nice', 'storyline', 'unforgivable', 'interesting', 'symbolic', 'dark', 'psychological', 'second', 'minimum', 'important', 'atmospheric', 'perilous', 'countless', 'actual', 'fast', 'many', 'wrong', 'new', 'deadly', 'afraid', 'bored', 'second', 'own', 'dark', 'captive', 'dark', 'underground', 'inspiring', 'favorite', 'good', 'idyllic', 'light', 'sappy', 'good', 'great', 'brainless', 'mainstream', 'aragorn', 'independent', 'more', 'epic', 'dark', 'true', 'intelligent', 'great', 'sure', 'bad', 'good', 'more', 'disappointed', 'bad', 'well'];0.1006403318903318

1870;Dethedrus;"as a quick aside, i find myself amazed at many of the negative reviews which come off as angry/spiteful that a movie could generate the kind of buzz and near slavish fandom that the lotr trilogy has to date. feh. while the two towers doesn't quite have the visceral impact of fellowship, if for no other reason than the newness that fotr brought (not quite the drought of high fantasy that existed when fotr hit the scene), the depth of story and the strong emotional energy truly push the limits of the genre. how to classify a fantasy film, that has strong action elements, an engaging romance, and all other sorts of fun turmoil? this is one film that's hard to pigeonhole, unless perhaps you simply want to title it an epic, ala the classics like spartacus, ben hur, braveheart, et al. from the wrench internal struggles of gollum/smeagol, to the near hopeless love of aragorn and arwen (and don't forget eowyn), to theoden seeing his world crumble before his eyes while he tries to save what he can of his people... it's almost as if the action is simply a beautiful backdrop to a deep and engaging drama. not something you see too often in a standard sword and sorcery flick. add the masterful performances of viggo mortenson, sir ian mckellan and john rhys davies (""nobody tosses a dwarf!""), i can find very little fault with this second installment. the only complaints i can muster are a little *very* obvious cg work (some of the ent scenes are a bit iffy), and the fact that the music score seemed very derivative of the first movie without having nearly the same impact. sure i'll be tired at work today (12:01am showing), but well worth the effort :) 9.7 / 10";18 December 2002;10;['quick', 'amazed', 'many', 'negative', 'angry', 'spiteful', 'slavish', 'visceral', 'other', 'high', 'strong', 'emotional', 'strong', 'other', 'fun', 'hard', 'internal', 'near', 'hopeless', 'beautiful', 'deep', 'engaging', 'standard', 'masterful', 'little', 'second', 'only', 'little', 'obvious', 'iffy', 'derivative', 'first', 'same', 'sure', 'tired', 'worth'];0.118735632183908

1876;BitOfFish;while much more action packed than fellowship, two towers manages to capture the humanity of the events much more emotionally. it is in fact very altered from the original tale. the lord of the rings in itself is a tale being told by one man. when one man tells a tale it is different from the last telling. jackson's version of the story is not a verbatim transcript of the books, nor does it pretend to be. it is nothing more than his own telling of a tale that was told to him. a concept that is at the very heart of tolkien's trilogy. whether or not jackson should have placed the story on a visual medium is not for anyone to decide. whatever the case may be jackson executes the film nearly flawlessly. certainly the story seems a little more empty than the books, due simply to the fact that the visual author is much more limited in his time to tell his story than the literary author. so my advice is if you are unwilling to accept anything other than an unabridged account of frodo's tale, read the book. elsewise see this brilliantly crafted film.;18 December 2002;9;['more', 'altered', 'original', 'different', 'last', 'verbatim', 'more', 'own', 'very', 'visual', 'empty', 'due', 'visual', 'limited', 'literary', 'unwilling', 'other', 'unabridged'];0.1271978021978022

1883;elf-girl10;i still cannot decide which of the two lotr films i prefer, but i don't really think that matters, as i rate them both 10/10. the thing i loved about the two towers was that straight off we were back where we had left off - it felt like there was no time between me seeing this and the first one in the cinema. some say ttt has a lack of characterisation, but i felt you really began to see the individual traits, as the fellowship has scattered. viggo mortensen dons the reluctant hero so easily as aragorn, he is a brilliant actor and deserves to get the recognition he deserves - even if he doesn't want all the hollywood attention. elijah wood continues his great portrayal of frodo, and ian mckellan and christopher lee are just as good as in the previous one. some parts were cheesy (like sam's little overview at the end), but even though this was a long film, i wanted it to go on. how this differs from other films is that i feel as if i am there and living the troubles, and joys that the characters experience, rather than watching - my heart was beating so fast during the battle. the highlight is always going to be seen as the battle of helm's deep, and it has been criticised that it revolves around it too much, but i think the anticipation build up is great. i loved the whole thing, minor criticism was the ents weren't great when viewed close up, but i'm knit-picking! i better stop blabbing, and just finish: i am counting the days to the finale of this awesome trilogy. i just hope it does not get so hyped up that it disappoints.;25 April 2003;10;['lotr', 'first', 'individual', 'reluctant', 'aragorn', 'brilliant', 'great', 'good', 'previous', 'little', 'long', 'other', 'deep', 'great', 'whole', 'minor', 'great', 'awesome'];0.3247222222222222

1888;homeboy989;overall it was a good adaptation of the book, i felt the second book of the series was boring in comparison to the rest, so it was good to see peter jackson take some directors license and play with the story a little bit to good effect, although in a few scenes not so much. the excellent landscapes of new zealand, the faithful recreation of middle earth, the convincing acting, the fabulous cgi creation of gollum, and fantastic battle scenes all culminate in a great movie. a lot of work went into this movie and it really shows. the only problem with the movie was how the story is delivered, considering the size of the book scenes have to be summarised and dialogue is sometimes lacking between characters as the film rushes along to finish the story. in my opinion it was better than fellowship, even though i prefered the fellowship book, and i found it rather fresh to find the story slightly altered so i did not know exactly what was going to happen. cant wait for rotk, its the best one in the series;28 December 2002;9;['good', 'second', 'good', 'little', 'good', 'few', 'much', 'excellent', 'faithful', 'middle', 'convincing', 'fabulous', 'fantastic', 'great', 'only', 'well', 'fresh', 'rotk', 'good'];0.3875

1891;MavisC;"wow, what can i say ... i am still speechless and awed from such a breathtaking film. let me start off by saying that i believe two towers was a difficult book to adapt because of the break of the fellowship. the jump from frodo to sam, to the three hunters and gandalf, to merry and pippin, as well as the introduction to many other characters made the flow of the film very unorthodox. we are so used to seeing film's introduce the plot and characters, show how characters grow, see them run into conflict and see how it all ends ... and so even when i knew that two towers could not flow in that manner, it still took me some time getting used to the hopping around. at first, it made me feel quite uncomfortable, but now i have a growing appreciation for peter jackson's choice of storytelling. i hope those who watch it can keep that in consideration; though i fear that critics will not keep that in mind when they see the film. i am most impressed with the battle at helm's deep. it was absolutely stunning, and one of the best battle sequences i have ever seen on film. everything from the incredible cgi, the amazing choreographed action sequences, the costumes and settings (working under the rain sequence must have been treacherous), to gimli's innocent comic relief, was so wonderfully done. for every second of the 45 minute scene i was at the edge of my seat, with my hands clenched and my eyes widened, hoping and rooting for the victory of the men and elves, even when i knew how it would end. next, i would like to say that andy serkis was magnificent. not only did he capture the movement of gollum, but he also mastered gollum's voice and his multi-personality disorder. in fact, all the actors did a exceptional job. the audience was able to see the characters changing, growing and slowly developing into what they are fated to be in the end. elijah wood was especially marvelous. overall, two towers was remarkable and a wonderful second addition to the lord of the rings trilogy. can't wait to see what rotk is going to be like.";7 December 2002;9;['speechless', 'breathtaking', 'difficult', 'many', 'other', 'unorthodox', 'used', 'uncomfortable', 'impressed', 'deep', 'stunning', 'good', 'incredible', 'amazing', 'treacherous', 'innocent', 'comic', 'magnificent', 'multi', 'personality', 'exceptional', 'able', 'marvelous', 'remarkable', 'wonderful', 'second', 'rotk'];0.4870833333333333

1894;vitaminl;as a very avid fan of the books, i felt that a few too many liberties were taken with the plot of the two towers in it's adaption to the screen. the two major changes from the book which (in my opinion) would have been better cinematicly if they had not been changed were faramir taking frodo and sam to osgilliath and the downplaying of the legolas and gimli commraderie. faramir lost some of his wisdom, gimli some of his dignity and legolas seemed to gain some super powers. regardless, this isn't the book and had more than enough enjoyable parts to make up for what i perceived as discrepancies. really enjoyable and almost as good as fellowship of the ring.;4 January 2003;9;['avid', 'few', 'many', 'major', 'well', 'gimli', 'gimli', 'super', 'more', 'enough', 'enjoyable', 'enjoyable', 'good'];0.3145833333333333
1895;joeblimp2;wow, the two towers was an exhilarating ride. there was so much more to the movie than i had imagined from reading the books. i am not talking about the shape or sizes of characters or the picturesque scenery. the extent that jackson pushes the story is astonishing. it is so well crafted and thought out, characters are given depth. for example, you are not told that theoden is king of rohan with a crown plopped on his head you are shown in the mini-stories of the tribulation of his people. gollum is a cgi coup, the first believable cgi character, so complex, what a great job! the ents come off well too, this is where things also could have gone very wrong but jackson and weta have done a good job with this tricky part of tolkien's story. i cannot stress enough that the two towers goes beyond a fantasy movie, it is a war movie at its heart. again jackson goes beyond to show us what death means, to a dying elf-lord no less, or the psychological terror of war. there is so much to the film, it is so rich in detail, of action, of art work in the form of the material artifacts constructed for the picture, and of cinematography. oh and it is funny too. the last movie of the ring cycle, return of the king, is a year away. so long to wait for the end. thanks to peter jackson and co. we have two movies to watch as we anticipate the payoff of this epic trilogy.;19 December 2002;10;['exhilarating', 'more', 'picturesque', 'astonishing', 'first', 'believable', 'complex', 'great', 'wrong', 'good', 'tricky', 'less', 'psychological', 'much', 'rich', 'funny', 'last', 'epic'];0.2472222222222222

1900;cinematographe;"mild spoilers it was good for what most people expect, which would be a visual representation of what the book had. good job hollywood, but... it was horrible as a film, because it didn't build on any idea or theme, it just dictated. there were a good three or four scenes where all it consisted of was sam, aragorn, or whoever talking about how not to give up hope, how hope was something good in the world. one scene would've been enough, but we since sam said it to frodo, we needed aragorn to say it to some little kid, and then we needed arwen to tell her father the message of hope because the elves weren't anywhere near sam or aragon to have gottent he message. the audience, regretfully, is present at all three. plus the scene where aragorn instills his hope speech to theoden. i think what the movie shows is that hollywood is still willing to spend a lot of money to get something right, which is something a vile place like hollywood should be applauded for, but what the movie also shows is that peter jackson has a great imagination, but he's a poor director. every other one of his movies have been directorial/screenwriting failures, but have had wonderful conceptual ideas with them. but while i was watching the movie i could care less about what happens to any of the men, and half an hour in i could care less what happens to frodo. and when i thought about it, it just came down to the acting. the acting seems as if the actors were still discovering who the characters were because they had no force given to them by the director. it seems that's how all his movies are, very flat characters. the characters are great in tolkien's books. and indeed, the actors provide those actions and mannerisms in the movie, but there's nothing else. elijah wood curling his eyebrows, and viggo mortensen making his pouty faces isn't giving them any depth. maybe wood can get away with it as a hobbit, but not a single human in that picture can. ian mckellan and christopher lee give the best performances, from their mannerisms to subtle changes in their face, and it is only because they have been acting so long, they can compensate for a poor director, all great actors can. the poor acting direction is compounded by the moments jackson chooses to include in the picture. there were atleast ten times that jackson cut to scenes of women crying and whining, as if that is the only reaction human women can muster up. one was enough, and about the only one that didn't look like complete whining was the one where the mother was trying to hold on to her soon as he was recruited for the battle at helmsdeep. he also dramatizes events that people who have never read lotr would know are just plot points. my mother who could care less about tolkien knew that aragon didn't die because he couldn't die, he's the one of the main characters for christ's sake. and yet jackson spends about five minutes showing the sad reaction of the characters. legolas is sad, grimli is sad, theoden is sad, then the very next scene is them arriving at helmsdeep where we see: grimli is sad, eowyn is sad, legolas is sad, theoden is sad. if not annoying, at the least it's poor scene construction. and the fact is it's poor scene construction from a director/editor point of view because if you looked at the screenplay it works fine. the most disappointing thing is how i could care less how many elves, humans, or orcs died in the helmsdeep, but welled up with tears when treebeard saw the forest of isengard destroyed. when he said ""they were my friends"" it was devastating. and peter jackson did a marvelous job with that. but if a cgi creature from his imagination gets more emotion out of the audience than the humans and hobbits, there's something wrong there with how the director is building up the scenes. i liked the movie like i said, and a lot of the things said about character development and such is true, gollum and treebeard are the only interesting characters in the whole thing. i think it took a lot of balls for peter jackson to shoot all three movies at once with seven units, and even more balls to think that he could bring tolkien's vision to the screen. he succeeded wonderfully at it, but failed in heft and emotion of the film as a film itself. they should have jackson be the ""master director"" and then had another director to just work with the actors, rehearsing them and finding the pieces for a great performance. even directors like jeunet know their weaknesses (his lack of mise en scene) and so he got marc caro to do the mise en scene for him while he worked with the actors. oh well. it's only a movie, and they'll probably be more lotr movies made, just as there have been made in the

(isn't it supposed to be a secret? wouldn't sauron's faithful servant tell him?)since when did an army of elves turn up at helm's deep and all apparently die. since when did eomer come to the rescue. and so it goes on. i agree that there has to be some adaptation of the book to translate it from page to screen. but peter jackson seems to have simply changed too much. was tolkein's version not good enough. why film it then?;20 December 2002;8;['slight', 'amazing', 'special', 'eligible', 'cinematic', 'several', 'last', 'thoughtful', 'wise', 'reluctant', 'evil', 'same', 'boromir', 'faithful', 'deep', 'good'];0.1325396825396825

1904;john-constantine;one year ago, i thought fotr got bashed too easily while it was actually a very decent flick anyone could enjoy. this one doesn't achieve anything at all. hardcore tolkien fans (or anyone who's actually read the book) will be very frustrated to see the appaling rewriting job done here while newcomers will just be confused. seeing the good rates this movie gets, i can only guess most viewers were stunned by the visual effects and they were right to be. _most_ effects are great (the sheer scale of the armies is incredible) but on the other hand, you get very poor inserts, gandalf's beard is almost falling off at times and i'm not sure i want to comment theoden's metamorphosis. character development is virtually non existent since most characters are defined by one dumb catch phrase and idiotic exposition ruins some potentially great scenes. a few characters are still very nice, such as gollum (the only reason i didn't give 1 to this movie), eowyn or sam. but eomer's sorely lacking and don't even ask me what arwen is doing in this movie (or why haldir shows up at helm's deep). the writing choices made here are a real betrayal to tolkien's work (i'm not talking about cosmetic stuff like some minor missing scenes from fotr but about some really deep changes made to the characters and events). the greatest flaw of this movie is its definite lack of structure: there's no real beginning nor ending, it needs the 2 other movies to stand. i think that's a really poor choice, deciding to cast aside potential viewers who didn't see the first flick. would i recommend it to people? no. would i tell them not to see it? neither, because that's the kind of movie where everyone gets lunatic and so, you'll have to make up your own opinion but as far as i'm concerned, it falls short of being one of the most boring movies ever.;19 December 2002;2;['decent', 'frustrated', 'good', 'most', 'visual', 'right', 'most', 'great', 'sheer', 'incredible', 'other', 'poor', 'sure', 'non', 'existent', 'most', 'dumb', 'idiotic', 'great', 'few', 'nice', 'such', 'only', 'deep', 'real', 'cosmetic', 'minor', 'deep', 'great', 'definite', 'real', 'other', 'poor', 'potential', 'first', 'lunatic', 'own', 'short', 'boring'];0.117594537815126

1906;norm_paradigm;first, i believe 'lord of the rings' to be one of the greatest books of the 20th century - (and definitely the best fantasy books ever to be written) -- we'll get that out of the way... i am a fan of the book. if you are one of those people who expects a word-for-word translation of the written text to the visual medium, forget it. tolkien knew that this was impossible, as did the cast and crew of the film adaptation. however, peter jackson has done an incredible job keeping to the spirit (if not necessarily the letter) of tolkien's masterpiece. yes... this means that jackson and company had to cut out some sections of the book, and yes, add (or at least emphasise) and re-organise other sections. to feel that somehow this betrays both tolkien (and his fans) is utter nonsense. the film is absolute beauty and grandeur - gorgeous cinematography and production. the battle scenes are truly epic (in an age when that term gets thrown about a bit much) - never before has cgi been so seamlessly integrated into live action (the crew at weta workshop deserves many, many awards for their work). most impressive on the cgi front is that this movies realises the first full-fledged cgi character (gollum/smeagol makes yoda from swii look like the kracken from clash of the titans). let's not forget the actors (the 'real' ones, that is)... stellar group that one - someone paid attention when casting and hired not 'stars' but the right people for the roles (novel concept that). so yes, this is not a 1:1 mapping from book to movie, and it never could have been. peter jackson has done brilliantly and certainly better than any other director working today could have done (and might i add, better than any of those 'fans' who feel it necessary to slag the film could have done either). appreciate what has been given to you. there could never have been a better version (and this one is pretty spectacular at that). 10/10;2 January 2003;10;['great', 'good', 'visual', 'impossible', 'incredible', 'least', 'other', 'utter', 'absolute', 'gorgeous', 'epic', 'much', 'live', 'weta', 'many', 'many', 'impressive', 'first', 'real', 'stellar', 'right', 'well', 'other', 'well', 'necessary', 'well', 'spectacular'];0.2776386312100597

1909;funkarty;"alright, i saw it--the unfortunate thing about movies such as this is that one builds up anticipation so much that a movie cannot really impress but only live up to expectations or disappoint that being said--here's the review the movie is good--not the best movie of all time, but definately something that will be remembered years down the line--i would hazard to say that this trilogy is turning out to be the star wars of wizards and swords and what not--a classic--hard to outdo gollum is absolutely amazing--while there are some points where it is hard to believe he his not cgi--he is the best cgi done in movies to this point--i wouldn't be surprised if he was nominated for an oscar--and won--the voice acting is superb--but also the facial expressions, body language, etc. is really amazing acting--i call it acting because someone has to come up with that stuff, and all the expressions and whatnot are so...real that its hard not to believe them--plus the fact that he is a emotionally tortured character gives the ""actor"" alot of chances to undergo a range of emotions i couldn't take legolas snowboarding down the stairs--it was only 10 seconds, i guess--but, come on--what warrior would ever do that--thats just too gimmicky--and the rest of the movie (thank god)doesn't do gimmicky garbage like that--take note george lucas faramir's (spoiler) departure from his character in the book i do not think has any real purpose in the movie--it doesn't add to the movie at all, so why do it? while many hate the arwen scenes, i didn't think they were too bad--we needed to see aaragorn's emotional reaction to eowyn--there is obvious attraction in both the book and the movie between these two--and what is aaragorn going to think about in a situation like this but arwen--peter jackson needed to add some depth to aaragorn, to make the audience identify with him more, and this is how he's trying to do it although i believe there to be flaws with this movie, i still believe that peter jackson is doing as good a job bringing tolkein's work to life as could possibly be done, given the obvious limitations in dealing with such a historic and dense trilogy--it is impossible to please everybody--and i think the main reasons one cannot say these are the greatest movies of all time is because one cannot effectively communicate the full scale of these works in only 9 hours of film--in fact thats probably the main problem with these movies--too much going on--its all spectacular, but following the different plots can be burdensome in a movie even though they aren't in the book";19 December 2002;9;['unfortunate', 'such', 'good', 'good', 'definately', 'star', 'hard', 'amazing', 'hard', 'good', 'surprised', 'superb', 'facial', 'amazing', 'real', 'hard', 'tortured', 'gimmicky', 'gimmicky', 'real', 'many', 'bad', 'emotional', 'obvious', 'good', 'obvious', 'historic', 'dense', 'impossible', 'main', 'great', 'full', 'main', 'much', 'spectacular', 'different', 'burdensome'];0.1602011494252873
1910;tolotos81;yesterday i have seen ttt. and i must say that i'm quite disappointed. when i first saw fotr i was a little bit sad that there was no tom bombadil and no barrow-wights and it took me half a year to accept this fact, but i think now, it is true that the film would have been too long nevertheless it is one of my absolute favourite movies! it is absolutely well done, a real masterpiece. but now it seems to me that peter jackson has invented his own story in ttt. in the first half i asked myself many many times if the changes were really necessary and i got more and more nervous and anxious. in the second half i begun to ask myself if i was in the right film. for example there were no huorns. perhaps it was too difficult to realise this scene but i don't think so, it was just more dramatic for the popcorn audience when eomer came back at the edge of time with thousands of riders of rohan (where the hell did he gather them). also the ents seem kinda stupid folk. in the book they are described as the eldest people in middle-earth and full of wisdom but in the film they seem thin as paper and rather dull ( i was astonished that ents have such long legs, do they really???). faramir is strong wise and just, the better part of denethor's sons but not so in the film. there he first appears as a greedy rough man. rough was also the real faramir but not in this bad way. then they go to osgiliath! why, peter jackson why??? there frodo encounters e nazgul. why? that is also just e cheap little bit of 'tension' catching. there faramir decides to let frodo go. that seems to me not as an intelligent turn. peter jackson just had to go back to the book for a while otherwise the film would have gone in a totally different direction than the book. maybe the worst part of the film was when the people of edoras was attacked by the wargs. i have seldom seen such bad cgi's. in every second of this scene you could see that they were cgi's! puuh. it reminded me in a way of the bbc's documentation with that prehistoric beasts, maybe someone knows them. this is a unbelievable discrepancy to gollum/smeagol. yes, in this film were also good characters and scenes and gollum/smeagol was my favourite. he is absolutely lovely and authentic! i have never seen such a realistic cgi. i thank to andy serkins because he partly saved the film and i hope he gets the academy award for that . the schizophrenia of gollum/smeagol was, after me, even better presented in the film than in the book. there were also lots of nice landscapes which we know already from the first part. the riders of rohan in the plains in front of the tall, white mountains is an epic picture and it opens the heart of every tolkien fan. also the black gate, fangorn and the oliphaunts were very beautiful scenes and they compensate a little bit for the rest. all in all it is a very colossal and entertaining movie for those who have not read the book. but the real tolkien experts who have read the book many times will be a bit disappointed. i rated it 7/10! one year ago i longed every day for the continuation of fotr. and often i asked myself in what fantastic ways peter jackson would convert tolkien's epic story into his movie. but now i think that i have do be afraid every day thinking how far the return of the king will stray from the real storyline! please please please peter jackson stick to the book!!!;19 December 2002;10;['disappointed', 'little', 'sad', 'true', 'long', 'absolute', 'favourite', 'real', 'own', 'first', 'many', 'many', 'necessary', 'more', 'nervous', 'anxious', 'second', 'right', 'difficult', 'dramatic', 'kinda', 'stupid', 'eld', 'middle', 'full', 'thin', 'dull', 'such', 'long', 'strong', 'wise', 'well', 'greedy', 'rough', 'rough', 'real', 'bad', 'cheap', 'little', 'intelligent', 'different', 'bad', 'such', 'bad', 'prehistoric', 'unbelievable', 'good', 'favourite', 'lovely', 'authentic', 'realistic', 'nice', 'first', 'tall', 'white', 'epic', 'black', 'beautiful', 'little', 'colossal', 'entertaining', 'real', 'many', 'disappointed', 'fantastic', 'epic', 'afraid', 'real'];0.0559204931972789

1912;sunfalling;the lord of the rings: the two towers is, as expected, an amazing movie. although, it lacks the pure brilliance of the fellowship of the ring, it is no disappointment. tolkien fans have criticized two towers as being untrue to the book, but i believe it comes as close as is absolutely possible to achieve an enjoyable movie. everything about this movie is superb. the acting was incredible, especially the role of gollum (played by andy serkis), the special effects were magnificent, and the cinematography was stunning. the only complaint that i have is the lack of screen time for some of the main players like gandalf (ian mckellan), and eowyn (miranda otto). otherwise, ttt was a perfect example of a movie masterpiece. this movie is worth seeing for any tolkien fan, ringnut, or otherwise, and all those who just enjoy watching a good movie.;19 December 2002;9;['amazing', 'pure', 'untrue', 'close', 'possible', 'enjoyable', 'superb', 'incredible', 'special', 'magnificent', 'stunning', 'only', 'main', 'perfect', 'worth', 'good'];0.5170068027210885
1913;herbavore1;"parts of this movie were exciting. but there were at least four big problems: 1) the movie follows three sets of characters: frodo and his buddy; the humans who are attacked by the army of orcs; and two hobbits who are lost in the forest. since these sets of characters have their own separate story lines throughout the movie, there are lots of jumps. and only one story line is any good: the humans battling against the orcs. everything else is just distracting. 2) the first movie is good largely because the evil characters, especially the horsemen, are so believable and menacing. in this installment, the bad guys are laughable -- buffoonish orcs by the thousands, a crazy christopher lee stuck in a tower, etc. 3) the computer graphics in this movie just aren't very good. golum is a great character but, whenever he comes onscreen, you can't help thinking, ""hey, that guy's a cheesy computer graphic."" the computer effects in the last scene involving torrents of water are like something out of a bad godzilla movie. 4) as much as i like sir ian, his white gandolf seems stoned in most of this movie.";4 December 2002;5;['exciting', 'big', 'own', 'separate', 'first', 'good', 'evil', 'believable', 'menacing', 'bad', 'laughable', 'buffoonish', 'crazy', 'good', 'great', 'last', 'bad', 'white', 'most'];-0.0088235294117646

the worst part is that this change does absolutely nothing for the plot! sam and frodo still end up parting ways with faramir and his men and faramir is still on his way to defend gondor. the only difference is that anyone who has read the book and loved the character of faramir is now disgusted with what we've been given instead. i said that was the worst part. actually, i lied. the worst part is that there are numerous scenes like this. a completely new, ill-contrived subplot involving aragorn and arwen wastes time by doing nothing but giving still more screentime (now in a story that the character isn't even meant to appear in) to a mabeline-laden liv tyler and then taking us back to exactly where we started (unless pj ends up messing with the characters in even more tasteless ways in the next film). the 'simplified' ents, rather than noticing that a huge chunk of their forrest has been hewn down, initially refuse to take part and have to be manipulated by pippin into going to isengard before doing anything. all of these changes seem inferior to the book version and yet they all deposit their characters in roughly the same position as their counterparts in the book. it makes one wonder what pj was thinking in making the changes at all. i feel betrayed and alienated by this movie. it would have been much better if the first film had been lousy. i wasn't expecting much at the time. but having longed to see helm's deep on the big screen for so long, when i saw jackson's ""fellowship.."" i developed a faith that it could actually happen. never in my wildest imaginings would i have expected to be contemplating leaving in the middle of it. the thought actually crossed my mind that 'maybe the whole thing is really just a bad dream and then i'll wake up and we'll go see the real movie'. my wife, who is the real tolkien fan of the family, was left literally in tears. for those who are interested, here's the most complete list of major (ie not just nitpicking about lines added or sideways glances omitted) changes that we could put together gandalf literally excorcises saruman from posession of theoden the character of faramir is radically different gimli is mostly comic relief new subplot with dog riders attacking the people of rohan en route to helm's deep, aragorn's ""death"" and arwen's (apparent) descision not to stay with him. theoden is much less heroic at helm's deep and has to be coaxed into doing anything. elves show up to announce their alliance with the humans and save the day at helm's deep (????) the women and children of rohan are kept in helm's deep instead of another keep in the mountains apparently for no other reason than to give us lots and lots (and lots) of shots of women and children crying during the fight. eowyn is therefore there at the battle, but neither fighting nor having been given stewardship over her people. ents have to be tricked by pippin to decide to to do anything about saruman no shelob * gandalf does not confront saruman (he's never even at isengard) * gandalf and co never receive the plantir (black, spherical seer stone thing) * * = this may just have been moved to the beginning of the third movie.";18 December 2002;3;['few', 'enormous', 'honest', 'much', 'first', 'forgivable', 'first', 'little', 'quibble', 'great', 'second', 'own', 'meaningful', 'dense', 'average', 'unfamiliar', 'good', 'same', 'sad', 'difficult', 'trivial', 'favorite', 'poor', 'gimli', 'comic', 'little', 'more', 'low', 'average', 'non', 'tolkien', 'complex', 'simplified', 'close', 'simplified', 'simplified', 'plain', 'bad', 'only', 'disgusted', 'bad', 'bad', 'numerous', 'new', 'aragorn', 'more', 'screentime', 'tasteless', 'next', 'simplified', 'huge', 'forr', 'inferior', 'same', 'betrayed', 'well', 'first', 'lousy', 'much', 'deep', 'big', 'wild', 'whole', 'bad', 'real', 'real', 'interested', 'complete', 'major', 'different', 'gimli', 'comic', 'new', 'deep', 'apparent', 'heroic', 'deep', 'deep', 'deep', 'other', 'black', 'spherical', 'third'];0.0039530153754291

1927;Subcat;"yesterday, i saw ""the two towers"" and have to say that i am very disappointed. even for someone who is not exactly a fan of tolkien's world or the fantasy genre, the ""fellowship of the ring"" stood way beyond this sequel. a massive storyline and an excellent dramaturge concept made the first part appear smooth as silk. chapters like ""the treason of isengard"" or ""the bridge of khazad dum"" will always be remembered throughout the movie community and have set a new standard in this genre of film. now, ""the two towers"" has literally no plot, it seems that director peter jackson didn't have a clue about how he should start, unfold and end the story of this second part of the trilogy. somehow, it now seems hard to believe that he was in charge of the first part... the sequence of frodo and his fellows crossing the marches, the exaggerated focus on the creature gollum and tons of splatter-urukhai-sequences are all a strange reminder of his previous movies braindead or the frighteners. the film reveals its entire structural weakness just by the fact that pippin and merry appear throughout the movie in one neverending story-like sequence which was mainly used as editing material. the only impressive point so far is howard shore's incredible soundtrack on cd (even better than the first one!) and not so much in the film, where it was poorly used - amazing tracks like ""the forbidden pool"", ""breath of life"" or ""evenstar"" are played in slapstick-like gollum & aragon scenes! neither the old nor the newly introduced characters did have a chance to unfold properly. to put it in bilbo's words: ""like butter stretched over too much bread"".";18 December 2002;1;['disappointed', 'massive', 'excellent', 'first', 'smooth', 'new', 'second', 'hard', 'first', 'exaggerated', 'creature', 'strange', 'previous', 'entire', 'structural', 'like', 'only', 'impressive', 'incredible', 'well', 'first', 'much', 'amazing', 'forbidden', 'slapstick', 'like', 'old', 'much'];0.1664015151515151
1928;Gareth_Trotter;after seeing the fellowship of the ring at the end of last year and feeling quite content to rank it as one of the best films i have ever seen, i was most intrigued to see what peter jackson and his ensemble would serve up this year. although the kiwi has taken on a pure labor of love, it is clear to see from the films and the supplementary material on the special edition fellowship dvd that his enthusiasm and love for such a great story flowed into his cast and crew and have allowed them so far, to produce what i personally believe are two pieces of cinematic history. the two towers picks up where fellowship left off and does not dissappoint, in fact it only adds to the magic contained in the first film. although there is a slightly darker air than the first (and rightly so, as the shadow further advances from the east), there is still humour, and plentiful emotion as the main protagonists of the splintered fellowship continue on their respective quests, with the addition of further memorable characters. the one incredible example being that of gollum. note - if any star wars fans (i was one of them prior to episode i and ii) wish to see a believable cgi character, please go along to see this performance! coupled with this, we are also treated to much more wonderfully choreographed and action on an epic scale. no more needs to be said than that, except i refuse to believe that anyone could see the helm's deep sequence (the word epic just about covers this!) and not be impressed! all performances are once again heartfelt and impressive, howard shore's score is once again a wonderful key into unlocking the most emotional and inspirational parts of the film, and lest we forget, the star of the first film, the new zealand landscape, is once again present in even greater splendour this time around! i can't think of a bad thing to say except this...i have to wait a whole year now before i see return of the king!;18 December 2002;10;['last', 'content', 'good', 'pure', 'clear', 'supplementary', 'special', 'great', 'cinematic', 'first', 'dark', 'first', 'plentiful', 'main', 'respective', 'further', 'memorable', 'incredible', 'believable', 'choreographed', 'epic', 'more', 'deep', 'epic', 'impressed', 'heartfelt', 'impressive', 'wonderful', 'emotional', 'inspirational', 'first', 'present', 'great', 'bad', 'whole'];0.3012288786482335

1934;thepcwurks;as a fan of the trilogy and the movies to date, i find myself in a juxtaposition as i bet many reviewers are. while i doubt i could have ever hoped or received a better cinematic adaptation of the tales with the same quality as peter jackson has delivered, i find myself asking numerous questions as i praise a stellar job. having read the books multiple times both prior and since the release of peter jacksons' masterpieces. i have always had what i believe the same queries as he as i read the books.. how can this be done?? peter jackson, aside from the fact that he does scale down the vast text, remains true as possible to it during the 3+ hour offering. capturing the vital elements to each part of the whole story and displaying them to us as grandly as possible is in essence what he does so well. and therein lies the magic! the things i found lacking were few, but in my opinion for the viewer and the continuity of the story they were critical. first was the forced pilgrimage of frodo and samwise to gondor at the hand of faramir which never took place in the books. authenticity states that they traveled together in curiosity of each other but in companionship for some time conversing. i assume the course of events taken in the movie were for the purpose of including the fall of osgiliath and the incorporation of gondor into the two towers in the allotted time. second to my distaste was the time merry and pippen spent with the ent where it is critical to the conclusion that they grow several feet in size. perhaps it may be revealed in the final part of the series of movies that in fact they have done so but as the literary time line goes that is not the chain of events as one reads them. those are the major points of inaccuracy as i found them. now for the crowning achievements. the cg rendered ent were masterfully represented in likeness and behavior and are second only to gollum/smeagol who was briefly introduced in the first movie.. steals the spotlight from the human actors in this film through is realistic behavior, speech and movement. the battle at helm's deep was exceptionally offered both for the imagination and the eye alike and surely stands out as one of the best if not the best mass combat sequences ever offered on film. if it were not for the limited seating time available and the short attention span of the present day movie patron, each movie could easily alone be 6 hours in length. what we receive is condensed acceptably with out much lapse in authenticity to the literary masterpiece, offered visually without parallel, and leaves us wanting more all within the span of roughly 3+ hours. can we ask for more? yes! should we? no! we get more than what we need and certianly more than the admission price, the lively hood of our own imagination should be the basis of your entertainment. if for whatever reason you fail to be drawn into the world of middle earth, be it as a newcomer to tolkien and his genius, or as a veteran, it is your imagination that fails you not the movie or the director.;18 December 2002;9;['many', 'well', 'cinematic', 'same', 'numerous', 'stellar', 'multiple', 'same', 'vast', 'true', 'possible', 'vital', 'whole', 'possible', 'few', 'critical', 'other', 'allotted', 'critical', 'several', 'final', 'literary', 'major', 'second', 'first', 'human', 'realistic', 'good', 'good', 'mass', 'limited', 'available', 'short', 'present', 'much', 'literary', 'parallel', 'more', 'more', 'more', 'more', 'lively', 'own', 'middle'];0.1559676434676434

1940;lodupree;'the two towers' is by far my favorite of the tolkien books. perhaps that's why i left the theater disappointed that peter jackson felt it necessary to remove so much of what made the book special, and replace those things with his own unnecessary scenes. i've read a few comments that defend jackson by saying there just wasn't enough time to represent the book accurately. well, perhaps he could have found more space if he hadn't spent half the movie showing characters on horseback riding around in long panoramic shots that slowed the pace of the movie. they rode in, and they rode out. they rode in, and they rode out. they rode in, and they rode out. they rode in, and they rode out. see, isn't that annoying? i mean, i started checking my watch after about a half dozen of these. what on earth happened? where's the storyof the ents? where's the confrontation of gandolf and saruman? where's the spider? where's the sense of evil that was present in the book? why did those hobbits spend most of their time on top of treebeard composited with a really bad chromakey? why did he have to show women and children in the caves repeatedly? about the only thing in this movie that to me had of the depth of tolkien's work was the character of gollum. he was brilliantly depicted, and a marvel of 3d animation, but he doesn't save the movie for me. i saw 'the fellowship' twice in theaters, and bought both the regular and extended versions of the dvd, but i'd be surprised if i'll see this movie again! >;19 December 2002;5;['necessary', 'much', 'special', 'own', 'unnecessary', 'few', 'enough', 'more', 'long', 'panoramic', 'annoying', 'present', 'most', 'treebeard', 'bad', 'only', 'regular', 'extended', 'surprised'];-0.0061904761904761

1942;TopherTheGreat;understand that jackson is making a movie, not a cartoon that just reads the script of the book. you can't include anything and everything you want from the book. in fact, you even need to change somethings to keep it interesting. faramir being tempted by the ring makes the story more cohesive and emphasizes aragon's character more. if you don't remember, the ring tempts all living things. every single man who has seen the ring thus far in the movies has been tempted and tried to get it, with the exception of aragon. unfortunately, audiences do not eat up sappy stuff like men are divided into sweet and sour. people want a dues ex machina to come out of the sky at the very end and smite all the problems away. if faramir's temptation is shown then it serves only to add glory to aragon. the elves at helms-deep link the story back to the elves. jackson is making sure the characters are not forgotten and that their nobleness is well known. it ties up loose ends with some major characters by compressing them into a single scene. remember at the end of fellowship, there wasn't just a single battle at the end, there were many. but it sums it up in a single more dramatic encounter which adds to the flavor of cinema. some stuff was moved to the return of the king, and understandably so. anyone complaining that shelob wasn't in the movie are simply acknowledging jackson's magnificent use of a cliff hanger. stop judging the movie as a book because it isn't. take a step back and realize just how close it is to the books instead of scrounging for the small breaks of plot. use your trivia for impressing your friends, not trying to tame a movie of this caliber. putting a book to script is like translating a greek passage to french when you're native language is english. you have to understand that both people who have read the book and those who haven't will be seeing the movie and it has to appeal to them both. it's not like jackson changed all the names to scott, bob and joe, even though it would have been much easier to follow for someone who was unfamiliar with the books. plus, i'm sure the extended edition will be more geared for you just as it was this year with many more details and insights.;19 December 2002;10;['interesting', 'cohesive', 'more', 'single', 'sappy', 'sweet', 'sour', 'very', 'deep', 'sure', 'loose', 'major', 'single', 'single', 'many', 'single', 'dramatic', 'magnificent', 'close', 'small', 'greek', 'french', 'native', 'english', 'easy', 'unfamiliar', 'sure', 'extended', 'many', 'more'];0.1804288103201146

(2) the use of gimli as a butt of humour. i thought the terry pratchett material about not telling the difference between male and female dwarves was particularly out-of-place. (3) gandalf quoting churchill, ""the battle for france is over. the battle of britain is about to start"" (substitute helm's deep and middle earth) (4) the misinterpretation of faramir, and the abduction of frodo and sam to osgiliath. as played, faramir is just a slightly less competent version of boromir, with the same character flaws. the point of tolkein's faramir is that he is different from boromir, with no ambition to use the ring. stuff i would like to have seen (basically the rest of the book): (1) the meeting with merry and pippin at isengard, which would have given closure to one of the open issues at the end of fellowship (2) frodo and sam's encounter with shelob, which would allow their sequence to finish with the same cliffhanger that tolkein wrote (3) gimli's argument with eomer about the beauty of galadriel (4) the bonding between gimli and legolas, and their discussions about the relative beauty of mines and forests. sorry peter, only 6 out of 10, could do better.";27 December 2002;5;['spectacular', 'good', 'first', 'nice', 'final', 'new', 'gimli', 'male', 'female', 'about', 'deep', 'middle', 'competent', 'same', 'different', 'open', 'same', 'gimli', 'relative', 'sorry'];0.1344919786096256

1993;mellonquendi;"(*minor spoilers*) peter jackson has done it again! he has given us a splendid movie, which is moving, funny spectacular, imaginative and epic in scale. he keeps you engrossed in the story for the whole 3 hours and leaves you wanting more when the end-credits roll by. even though there are many similarities with the fellowship when it comes to style, tone and general story elements, the two towers is also a very different movie-experience. and still peter jackson manages to reach the same quality standard set by its predecessor. amazing! a great part of the movie is about the battle at helm's deep and it's preparations. much has been said already about the greatness of the battle scenes. i have to agree with most critics. it's unparalleled! spectacularly shot and executed. the whole build-up to the battle is tense, emotional, with great pieces of dialogue delivered by theoden, aragorn and legolas. another fairly large part shows frodo's struggles with the ring, his emerging dark side, and the complications that the creature gollum brings to the drama of his character. of course it's also about the tragic figure of gollum himself (a brilliantly created cgi-character), but it's especially interesting to see how frodo and gollum mirror each other. sam is the stable figure in all this and has to make sure frodo keeps his sanity. it's really wonderful to see the interaction between these three characters. then there is a smaller part dedicated to merry and pippin's meeting with the ents (walking and talking trees), and treebeard in particular. even though the ents didn't completely match the image i had of them prior to seeing the movie (i had imagined them as being really huge, like all the other trees in the forest while in the movie they were quite a bit smaller), they were still a joy to watch, and once they were lined up, getting ready for battle, i was totally buying their appearance. the battle of the ents was one of the standout moments of the movie, i must say. seeing the vengeance of these ents, hurtling rocks, squashing orks, and flooding isengard, is really terrific! still, there are many more enchanting and spectacular moments in the movie. gandalf's fight with the balrog, a warg attack (beasts looking like huge hyena's), two trolls opening the black gate, olifaunts (huge elephant-like creatures), i could go on. the way peter jackson tells the separate stories works terrifically. the cutting between the different storylines is refreshing, makes for a good pace of the movie, and keeps you involved with every character. halfway through, we even get a sequence in which we return to the aragorn-arwen love story (through a dream/flashback scene), and see appearances by elrond and galadriel. it doesn't distract from the rest. on the contrary: it is a nice and calm intermission in the midst of all the mayhem going on in middle earth. the overall tone of the movie is nicely balanced. dramatic moments, action-sequences, dashes of humour, romance; peter jackson finds the time and place for all of these elements. the movie isn't flawless though. for example, gimli is portrayed as a funny dwarf who is clumsy and often can't keep up with the rest. even though the funny moments work many times and he is still tough and ruthless with his axe, his character is a little too much of a comic relief. it doesn't do justice to his character. (hopefully, jackson will compensate this in the return of the king. then i can forgive him.) other moments go a little over the top or get a bit corny. then there are some scenes, which are not menacing enough (for example the first appearance of the nazgul on the winged creature), or need to be a little more fleshed out. in the end though, in the light of the whole movie, the weak points turn out to be minor quibbles. the amazing experience that is 'the two towers' is definitely no letdown. it is a work of art and can proudly stand next to 'the fellowship of the ring'.";6 January 2003;9;['minor', 'splendid', 'funny', 'spectacular', 'imaginative', 'epic', 'whole', 'more', 'many', 'general', 'different', 'same', 'amazing', 'great', 'deep', 'much', 'most', 'unparalleled', 'whole', 'tense', 'emotional', 'great', 'theoden', 'aragorn', 'large', 'dark', 'creature', 'tragic', 'interesting', 'other', 'stable', 'sure', 'wonderful', 'small', 'particular', 'huge', 'other', 'small', 'ready', 'terrific', 'many', 'enchanting', 'spectacular', 'huge', 'black', 'huge', 'like', 'separate', 'different', 'refreshing', 'good', 'aragorn', 'nice', 'calm', 'middle', 'overall', 'dramatic', 'flawless', 'gimli', 'funny', 'clumsy', 'funny', 'many', 'tough', 'ruthless', 'little', 'much', 'comic', 'other', 'little', 'first', 'winged', 'little', 'whole', 'weak', 'minor', 'amazing'];0.177805679563492

ultimately the answer is a well-affirmed ""hell yeah."" the two towers begins in glorious fashion: a recap of gandalf's battle with the balrog. however this time, we watch as he tumbles into the center of the earth, battling the flaming, snarling creature. when the scene concludes, there are some minor problems. the first couple of scenes with frodo and sam feel a bit strained, almost edited too much. the terror of the ring is gone, as well is the fear of sauron. however we do have the introduction of the splendid gollum, and now the story takes on a new life. meanwhile, aragorn, gimli, and legolas are busy hunting down a band of uruk-hai holding their friends captive. blood is shed and confusion enters and now we have three separate story lines: aragorn, gimli, legolas, and gandalf (in case you didn't know he's not dead), merry, pippin, and the ents (a dull story until an ultimate payoff), and frodo, sam and gollum. gandalf and his three companions venture into rohan, where lies king theoden. after a glorious exorcism and an emotional heartbreak, gandalf begins consulting theoden on a plan to defend his city against uruk-hai that are just itching to attack. eventually, saruman (the creepy wizard gone bad, allied with sauron) launches his army of 10,000 uruk hai against the band of 300 civilians who have retreated to helm's deep, a sort-of fallout refuge for rohan. now for the analysis: storyline: alright!! things are differentc than from the books!!! get over it!! the major changes are not so bad anyway. faramir has now become a violent power-hungry slug that is even worse than his brother boromir, who at least evoked some emotion and humanity. this is an awkward change, however with the removal of shelob from the end of the movie, the action in frodo and sam's storyline would be nonexistent. there had to be a change. and for the people upset over the elves aiding at helm's deep: elves rule. overall the plot is coherent and interesting. acting: gollum!!!! jesus that cgi is incredible. he looks unbelievably real, and the acting is phenomenal. he might not deserve the oscar but serkis does deserve the recognition. viggo mortenson gives an awesome performance as aragorn, the wily, reluctant, romantic hero who is grappling with his destiny as the future king of gondor. he might very well come away with a best actor or best supporing actor nomination. ian mckellen has got gandalf down. too bad he's not in more of the movie, or he would be another lock on a bsa nod. elijah wood and sean astin turn in solid performances as frodo and sam, respectively. astin's speech at the end is quite a 9/11 allegory. bernard hill is wonderful as king theoden, and mirando otto is lively and leia-ish as eowyn. cate blanchett is barely in the movie, as is hugo weaving, but liv tyler still manages to impress. i never thought she could pull of arwen but she does do it pretty well. orlando bloom and john rhys-davies give jolly, but ferocious performances as legolas and gimli. gotta' love a dwarf with an axe. wenham is average as faramir, not nearly as human as sean bean's boromir. christopher lee is barely in the movie, as is brad dourif, but they both deliver freaky performances nonetheless. merry and pippin and treebeard at first seem a bit annoying, but the assault on isengard is a spectacular, oddly moving event. special effects: great!!! end of story!! oscar guaranteed! the two towers proves to be a great film. it's moving, glorious, and pretty in its stunningness. there are moments that will make your heart cry out in joy, and there are times where you will remember things that don't seem so distant in today's world. what a great film...";26 January 2003;10;['epic', 'first', 'terrifying', 'powerful', 'superb', 'special', 'amazing', 'average', 'great', 'incredible', 'real', 'glorious', 'minor', 'first', 'strained', 'much', 'splendid', 'new', 'aragorn', 'gimli', 'busy', 'captive', 'separate', 'gimli', 'dead', 'dull', 'ultimate', 'glorious', 'emotional', 'theoden', 'creepy', 'bad', 'uruk', 'deep', 'of', 'differentc', 'major', 'bad', 'violent', 'hungry', 'bad', 'least', 'awkward', 'nonexistent', 'upset', 'deep', 'coherent', 'interesting', 'incredible', 'real', 'phenomenal', 'awesome', 'wily', 'reluctant', 'romantic', 'future', 'good', 'good', 'bad', 'more', 'solid', 'wonderful', 'lively', 'ferocious', 'average', 'human', 'brad', 'annoying', 'spectacular', 'special', 'great', 'great', 'glorious', 'distant', 'great'];0.1553922158088825

2046;irishjabba;"the two towers.after seeing the fellowship of the ring, i was very excited about the release of this chapter of the lord of the rings trilogy. though fotr wasn't totally true to the writings of tolkien, the changes director peter jackson made to the story were minor, and seemingly necessary to translate this great work of literature into the theatrical medium of film. all in all, fotr was pretty darn close to the book and helped bring my childhood imaginings of aragorn, legolas, and gimli to life. having read all of the books a number of times since i was little, you can imagine how i was looking forward to seeing the two towers in the same visual format as fotr, as the book was full of action and exciting new monsters like the giant spider shelob waiting for frodo and sam in the caverns of mordor. but what a huge disappoint it turned out to be! at the beginning of the movie, we are treated to about 10 minutes of footage that we've already seen in fotr, of course intermixed with some other footage of gandalf and the balrog, all but confusing the viewer. this opening footage was completely unnecessary for the viewer to follow the story, and just eats up valuable story telling screen time. i'll get to why this is important later. after this, things seem to recover.jackson follows the story line of the book for the most part, and then towards the middle of the movie, things go bad. jackson begins taking liberties with the storyline.a story line written by a great author whose works are what made the fantasy of the lotr popular. are these changes necessary for the translation from book to film? absolutely not. for example, the ents are only persuaded to go and stop saruman after treebeard sees the destroyed forest surrounding isengard.basically since saruman is destroying trees, now it's the ents problem when it wasn't before. the book of course shows the ents deciding to attack saruman because of the deeds he's already committed, his affiliation with the hated orcs, and the fact that they know if he wins, the ents and trees will be doomed as well. the book shows the ents being wise creatures, acting when necessary. the movie shows them as being uncaring separatists, who have to be persuaded by a couple of idiotic hobbits (which by the way have a really lame persuading speech to the ents, also not in the book). we also have a scene with the orcs riding on worgs, attacking the riders of the mark and our remaining members of the fellowship. this whole scene isn't in the book at all, and though is a great action scene, and the worgs are beautifully done, this whole scene wastes about 15 to 20 minutes of screen time. i'm unclear as to why this change was made; the original story line from the book accomplishes the same tasks, but with less time. next of course we have the elves of rivendale showing up at helm's deep. what?!?! this change was made obviously to show some sort of good neighbor attitude from the elves, but that wasn't of their nature. they were leaving, and made it clear that this fight was that of man. a totally unnecessary change. this fight scene is also full of slow motion camera tricks that are suppose to make the fight more dramatic and intense, but only stetch out an already long fight scene and actually take away from the intensity. for example, one of the elf captains (who we see from the fotr) ends up getting killed by an orc, and this scene is slowed down that it ends up taking almost 5 minutes to happen.and this is for a minor character who wasn't even in this scene in the book!! and towards the end of the movie, the change that actually made me angry, was when boromir's brother (faramir) is charmed by the ring and takes frodo, sam, and golum back to gondor, and this point, the rest of the movie is basically nothing like the book. first of all, the book has faramir turn down the chance to take the ring from frodo while they are in mordor. this shows the strength of character in faramir, which was lacking in his brother. this action leads to events in the next book, the return of the king. also, with faramir letting frodo go free inside mordor, this allows frodo to continue his trek to mount doom and of course encounter shelob and the fun twist of thinking frodo has died by shelob's bite. but of course, we are denied this, and instead get some lame battle against the orcs at gondor and the appearance of a nazgul who frodo basically gives himself up to. this whole scene goes against the strength and integrity contained in frodo that allows him to get all the way to mount doom with the ring in the books. if he wants to give himself up at the mere sight of a nazgul, how is he going to make it past sauron into mount doom? of course a the end of this movie, golum alludes to the fact that he's taking them to shelob's lair, which of course indicates that the story line for the return of the king is already screwed up.> the funny thing, is that without all these storyline changes, extended action scene 'slow downs', and reused scenes from fotr, peter jackson could have had plenty of time to follow the storyline created by tolkien almost exactly, removing some of the longer speeches from the book, and delivered a much better movie to lotr fans of the book as well as the first movie. some lotr movie fans would say to me that it's a great movie, and that it doesn't have to follow the book to be good, and normally i would agree. however, all this series of movies is now, is a stepladder for a mediocre director to make a name for himself by butchering a great piece of literature to fit his vision. in interviews he talks about how big a fan he is of tolkien's works, and how he wanted to make these movies be as close to the books and stories as possible. fotr did show that intention, however, the two towers did not, and in fact showed a bit of disdain for the original work. characters are changed. events are changed. the storyline is changed. how is this movie allowed to be called the two towers? in my opinion, this movie is terrible. not as bad as say.pluto nash, but is an insult to any true lotr fan. the special effects were great, but the rest of the movie (the substance of it) was trash. i should say that this movie does have one saving grace.and that's the character and creation of golum. probably one of the best cg characters i've ever seen, golum definitely embodies the character from the book in mannerisms, actions, and attitude. however, i would attribute the success of this character to peter jackson, rather the great writing of tolkien and an obviously excellent cg crew. p.s. this movie, or any of the lotr series, should never be directly compared to the star wars trilogy, as they are two completely different genres of movie making. star wars is a sci-fi fantasy, while lotr is just plain fantasy. one has spaceships and laser guns, while the other has elves and dwarves. one trilogy has affected generations of fans since it's creation and is an integral part of pop culture, while the other has p****d off literary fans while affecting only the lives of d&d players living in their parent's basements. one has a great director, who created an entire universe out of his imagination, while the other has a director who pirated a great book, and twisted it to his limited vision.";25 February 2003;3;['excited', 'true', 'minor', 'necessary', 'great', 'theatrical', 'gimli', 'little', 'same', 'visual', 'full', 'exciting', 'new', 'giant', 'huge', 'other', 'unnecessary', 'valuable', 'important', 'most', 'bad', 'great', 'popular', 'necessary', 'wise', 'necessary', 'idiotic', 'lame', 'whole', 'great', 'whole', 'unclear', 'original', 'same', 'less', 'deep', 'good', 'clear', 'unnecessary', 'full', 'slow', 'dramatic', 'intense', 'elf', 'minor', 'angry', 'next', 'free', 'fun', 'lame', 'whole', 'mere', 'golum', 'funny', 'storyline', 'extended', 'slow', 'long', 'well', 'first', 'great', 'good', 'mediocre', 'great', 'big', 'close', 'possible', 'original', 'terrible', 'bad', 'true', 'special', 'great', 'good', 'great', 'excellent', 'different', 'plain', 'other', 'integral', 'other', 'literary', 'great', 'entire', 'other', 'great', 'limited'];0.1263457862483837

2066;Hareb-Serap;"***spoilers*** ***spoilers*** since i have read the books once, my review will of course be weighted somewhat by that. first, let me try to see the movie as a new film, no preferences, just another movie. it is nearly 3 hours long, a format very hard to master. you have to keep the viewer interested at all time not to let him/her fall asleep. this is mainly done by effects in this movie, which i think is not enough. the plot does not contain the sufficient amount of suspense, nor does the music. the plot vanishes in monumental 20 minutes scenes just saying: ""there was a fight"" or ""he is the bad guy"". scenes like that are just there to restate something that was even too obvious the first time it was shown. accompanied by an equally monumental musical score this constant insulting of your intelligence just makes your mind go numb. peter jackson could have said all this movie says in one hour instead of three, if he was a good director. a film is only as good as it's story. some things are of course good. the casting is great (with some exceptions), the acting is as good as one can expect, the scenery is good (ok, the barren waste since a thousand years is a lush forest, but who cares? i don't) and the special effects are marvelous and incredible. sadly, that's all there is to it. i really wanted this trilogy to be the best, the greatest films ever created. i hoped that the second part would be better than the far from perfect first movie, but i got brutally let down. beneath the crust of pure eye candy this is a hollow void. the conclusion is: go see this movie, but don't expect anything but a nice computer demo. the animators deserve the credits, the ""director"" should be ashamed. corrolary: since peter jackson has written his own plot i would like to state some of the major differences. people saying that the books are just good vs. evil have probably never read them. warning, some plot spoiling ahead!!! (i think someone else already spoiled it, but ok) an example of polarization of good-evil: the ambitious fellow saruman believes he can beat sauron and thus save middleearth if he gets hold of the one ring (and he probably could). he is not evil, he has his own way of seeing things. this is reduced to him being the all evil lackey of the all evil sauron. an example of how the importance of chance is ripped away: pippin (i think) by curiosity uses the palantir when it is by chance aimed at mordor and sees sauron who ask: ""who are you?"" pippin answers: ""a hobbit"" before he is interrupted by his friends. this event leads sauron to the (erroneous) conclusion that saruman has the ring. why? since it is very painful to use the palantir, none of the good guys would do it to a hobbit, ergo saruman made him do it. ergo, saruman wants to show sauron that he has the hobbit i. e. the ringbearer and the ring. sauron thinks saruman has the ring and acts according to that, which is the only reason he empties mordor of troops. if the alliance has the ring an attack is possible. aragorn is also using the palantir in a somewhat taunting way to enhance this. in doing this sauron opened the only possibility for frodo and sam to reach mt. doom without getting caught by patrols. when he realize that the ring is in mordor, it is too late. all this due to a little hobbits curiosity, a factor sauron didn't and couldn't take into account. in the films this simply isn't. everything is deterministic. everything is planned and thought of, thus actually making it impossible for sauron to lose. more examples could easily be stated. however, i only considered things that are greatly contradictory to the spirit of the books, not actual plot misses which are numerous. /the disappointed storyliner";3 April 2003;3;['new', 'hard', 'interested', 'asleep', 'enough', 'sufficient', 'monumental', 'bad', 'obvious', 'first', 'monumental', 'musical', 'constant', 'numb', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'great', 'good', 'good', 'barren', 'lush', 'special', 'marvelous', 'incredible', 'good', 'great', 'second', 'well', 'perfect', 'first', 'pure', 'hollow', 'nice', 'ashamed', 'own', 'major', 'good', 'good', 'ambitious', 'fellow', 'evil', 'own', 'evil', 'evil', 'erroneous', 'painful', 'good', 'only', 'possible', 'aragorn', 'taunting', 'only', 'late', 'due', 'little', 'deterministic', 'impossible', 'more', 'contradictory', 'actual', 'numerous', 'disappointed'];0.138224683812919
2067;GaborAlexandru;"with ""lord of the rings: the two towers,"" it's clear that director peter jackson has tilted the balance decisively against the hobbits and in favor of the traditional action heroes of the tolkien trilogy. the star is now clearly aragorn (viggo mortensen), and the hobbits spend much of the movie away from the action. the last third of the movie is dominated by an epic battle scene that would no doubt startle the gentle medievalist j.r.r. tolkien. the task of the critic is to decide whether this shift damages the movie. it does not. ""the two towers"" is one of the most spectacular swashbucklers ever made, and, given current audience tastes in violence, may well be more popular than the first installment, ""the fellowship of the ring."" it is not faithful to the spirit of tolkien and misplaces much of the charm and whimsy of the books, but it stands on its own as a visionary thriller. i complained in my review of the first film that the hobbits had been short-changed, but with this second film i must accept that as a given, and go on from there.";12 March 2014;10;['clear', 'traditional', 'aragorn', 'much', 'last', 'epic', 'gentle', 'spectacular', 'current', 'popular', 'first', 'faithful', 'much', 'own', 'visionary', 'first', 'second'];0.225

2070;taylanduman;let's cut to the chase. the lord of the rings: the two towers is everything you've been told and so much more. the second part of jrr tolkein's middle-earth trilogy is a cinematic rush of blood to the head that exhilarates, astounds and enchants, and leaves you hungry for more. following the death of boromir and the apparent demise of gandalf in the pit at khazad-dumb, the fellowship divides into three groups. hobbit friends frodo and sam head for the black gates of mordor. en route, they befriend gollum (voiced by andy serkis ), a mysterious creature deeply scarred by his previous encounter with the ring. the path ahead is riddled with dangers, including faramir, the brother of boromir who hopes to use the ring's powers to save his kingdom of gondor. aragorn, elf archer legolas and plucky dwarf gimli make haste for the besieged rohan kingdom, where they pledge their support to the beleaguered king theoden and his beautiful niece eowyn. the advancing armies of evil wizard saruman force the rohan people to abandon their home and head for the sanctuary of helm's deep. however, the king's duplicitous adviser wormtongue, a spy working for saruman, anticipates theoden's risky strategy. meanwhile, hobbits merry and pippin escape from their uruk-hai captors and head into the mysterious fangorn forest, where an age-old ally offers a glimmer of hope to tipping the balance back in favour of the forces of light. the visual effects in the fellowship of the ring were nothing short of staggering, bringing to life hordes of fantastical creatures including platoons of snarling uruk-hai and the monstrous balrog. these achievements (which were rewarded with an oscar and a bafta) pale into comparison next to the technical wizardry conjured up in the two towers. the digital artists have surpassed themselves, creating jaw-dropping action set-pieces such as the climactic battle at helm's deep, which features more than 10,000 warriors fighting to the bitter end in a vast mountainside fortress. the scope and richness of detail is breathtaking, and it's hard to believe that many of the landscapes in the film exist solely in the hard drives of the animators. they look so real. of course, luscious visuals would mean nothing without equally powerful performances, direction and scripting. thankfully, the two towers delivers on every single level. the ensemble cast continues to excel, evoking a menagerie of wondrous beings caught in the midst of a titanic battle between good and evil. wood gradually reveals the desperation and rage bubbling within frodo as the ring begins to take hold of him, and astin is intensely moving as the best friend who would sacrifice everything - including his own life - to ensure frodo reaches mount doom and achieves his goal. the rapport between the two actors seems so easy and comfortable. once again, mckellen is majestic as the wizard guiding the fellowship on its perilous path, and mortensen accepts the hero's mantle with gusto, cutting a swathe through his enemies and facing death head on. the love triangle involving aragorn, eowyn and the elf princess arwen simmers tantalising in the background, and will undoubtedly boil over in the final instalment of the trilogy, the return of the king. the two towers continues tolkein's trilogy in grandiose style, casting a spell that is impossible to resist. the only disappointment is how quickly the three hours fly by, and the agonising 12 month wait until frodo's quest is finally resolved. and you get the feeling that will be something very special indeed.;7 December 2014;10;['more', 'second', 'middle', 'cinematic', 'hungry', 'more', 'apparent', 'dumb', 'black', 'mysterious', 'scarred', 'previous', 'gimli', 'beleaguered', 'beautiful', 'deep', 'duplicitous', 'risky', 'uruk', 'mysterious', 'old', 'visual', 'short', 'fantastical', 'monstrous', 'pale', 'technical', 'digital', 'such', 'climactic', 'deep', 'more', 'bitter', 'vast', 'hard', 'many', 'hard', 'real', 'luscious', 'powerful', 'single', 'ensemble', 'wondrous', 'titanic', 'good', 'good', 'own', 'easy', 'comfortable', 'majestic', 'perilous', 'final', 'grandiose', 'impossible', 'only', 'agonising', 'special'];0.1115567765567765

2076;jewelthrone;some of us may know the back story of how tolkien himself never wanted his books to be made into a film and i have to say that i agree with him, much of the magic of his books were in the finer details and these could never be conveyed well in a film. here we have a film that's well done in some ways yet in the grand scheme of things it was never needed, the books stand alone and this trilogy of movies are a perhaps selfish project? -that are essentially a compromised vision of the books, this big budget 'action' movie would serve those looking for a feast of cgi effects and action sequences, thankfully there is some subtlety and the interplay between characters is the films saving grace and i appreciate the tasteful selection of dialog used for the most part. one of my big beefs with the two towers and the other 2 movies is just how nonthreatening sauron is in these films, i think this aspect weakens the movies a great deal, even the ring wraiths come across as impotent compared to creatures such as the urak hai. another is the abrupt transitions between scenes, and the movies lose much of the 'glue' that the books had tying everything together. finally 'some' of the cgi effects don't do justice to the imagination - sauron's eye, and the faces in the dead marsh seem to suffer like gladrieal did in the previous movie - a little bit too overly dramatic and washed out - i am only mentioning this as a comparison to the majority of effects in this movies which are actually very well done. also the costumes are excellent, i especially thought the depictions of the orcs were excellent. overall i can only give this 5 stars.;7 November 2010;5;['back', 'much', 'fine', 'grand', 'selfish', 'big', 'tasteful', 'most', 'big', 'other', 'great', 'impotent', 'such', 'urak', 'abrupt', 'much', 'dead', 'previous', 'little', 'dramatic', 'excellent', 'excellent'];0.1458333333333333

2078;pacothinks;"this movie had a difficult task; to bridge the gap between the introductory ""fellowship of the rings"" and the conclusive ""return of the kings."" but that doesn't take it off the hook for delivering a decent product. tolkien's trilogy is an incredibly written story with a multitude of intricately woven plots and subplots. the films have dumbed all of this down into a simple fight between good and evil. even the star wars trilogy had more depth to the relationship between the warring sides, the hero, luke, was the son of the biggest, baddest guy of them all. and in the end we see how affected darth vader was by the fight for his son's jedi power. ""the empire strikes back"" ought to replace ""the two towers as number 11 on this list. every film-goer will acknowledge how difficult it must be to adapt a book, but when the book is so good, the worst thing the movie can do is make the story and experience of it mediocre. the two towers did worse than that; it degraded the struggle for middle earth to a few love interests, a wicked spell overturned by a gleaming white savior and two long hours of brutal violence. perhaps the brightest part of the movie, or its dimlight, was gollum's inner struggle between temptation for the ring and desire to do what is right. the other characters, indeed mr. tolkien's story itself, deserve to be developed with as much vigor as gollum's has been.";22 June 2003;1;['difficult', 'introductory', 'conclusive', 'decent', 'simple', 'good', 'more', 'big', 'badd', 'affected', 'difficult', 'good', 'bad', 'mediocre', 'bad', 'middle', 'few', 'wicked', 'white', 'long', 'brutal', 'bright', 'inner', 'right', 'other', 'much'];-0.0427437641723356

2080;Homeless_Robles;perhaps my judgment is a bit skewed, having camped out 30 hours for the premier of this movie and expecting to see the gates of heaven open up as soon as they turned on the projectors (i had high expectations of this film), but i think that peter jackson should be shot repeatedly with a bb gun for what he did to tolkien's masterpiece. i mean, even in the first movie when he left out tom bombadil i could understand the reasoning. but if you're going to cut something for reasons of time, don't add anything! everything that was added to this movie was total crap from an oliphaunt's ass. any true fan of tolkien should be incensed at the utter butchering of the story. i could go into examples, but i'm sorta strapped for time currently, and i'm sure they've been discussed at length here (i'm a little late, but i just registered here, so... well you know). the only redeeming qualities were the first 10 minutes, and the way they did gollum (although the portrayal of the character was more humourous than it should have been). all this being said... i'll probably end up buying the 4-disc special edition dvd and camping out overnight in preparation for return of the king... :);7 July 2003;3;['skewed', 'high', 'first', 'total', 'true', 'utter', 'strapped', 'sure', 'little', 'late', 'only', 'first', 'humourous', 'special'];0.1254220779220779

2084;mcgarv03;the second movie in the trilogy, the lord of the rings: the two towers, is a fantasy/action movie about one hobbit and the continuation of his quest to destroy the all-powerful ring to save mankind, hobbits, and other creatures alike. saruman, played by christopher lee, is building his army of orcs to destroy mankind under the power of the dark lord sauron, and anyone who fights with them. he has an eye that can see the ring that frodo, played by elijah wood, carries around his neck. the ring is drawn to the eye, and the burden of carrying it gets harder and harder for frodo, as he and sam, another hobbit played by sean austin, make their way to mordor. in the meantime, aragorn, played by viggo mortensen, and his companions continue on to rohan, to warn them of saruman's army and intentions. the king theoden, after being released from a spell, has his people flee to the walls of helms deep for safety from the orc army. as they prepare any man or child that can bear arms to fight, saruman's army approaches helms deep. the massive army is too much for the untrained forces of rohan, and the orc army blows a hole in the supposedly indestructible wall. the women and children flee into the caves, as the remaining forces try and fight off the orcs. when there is only a small group left to fight, gandalf the white and his forces he recruited come over the hilltop at sunrise to take the orcs by surprise and end the battle. this film is full of exciting battle scenes, and ones full of emotional turmoil as frodo fights the urge to give up the burden of the ring, as the eye feels its presence. another movie that resembles the lord of the rings is the harry potter series. in both story lines, it is basically good versus evil, with wizards and creatures in a fantasy world, but ultimately run by humans. both harry potter and frodo are relied upon to carry a burden, while having companions to help along the way. i think the director, peter jackson, did a great job using dark lighting in the nighttime battle scene, and just about any time an evil character was in shot. it brought a kind of eeriness to the scenes and brought the evil persona's to life. the angles were well used also, such as in the battle scenes which showcases each character in quick shots, one after another, so as to keep up with the fighting. all in all, the movie tells quite a bit of story with detail and awesome visuals, which keep up with each character's story on the ultimate quest to destroy the ring and defeat sauron.;2 May 2011;10;['second', 'powerful', 'other', 'dark', 'hard', 'hard', 'aragorn', 'deep', 'deep', 'massive', 'much', 'untrained', 'indestructible', 'small', 'white', 'full', 'exciting', 'full', 'emotional', 'good', 'great', 'dark', 'nighttime', 'evil', 'evil', 'such', 'quick', 'awesome', 'ultimate'];0.043

2092;rpshays-1;in case your wondering what my favorite film is, it would have to be the first lord of the rings. im not going to go into detail why, but mainly because its kind of like an intro to the world of middle earth and all of its inhabitants we meet, and it lays down the premise,so it felt new and unlike something never seen before, it went into the territory of the unknown, and when ever you go into something completely fresh its a little more exciting, at least to me anyways.well anyways two towers, an amazing and incredibly accomplished film. there are so many things you can say about how great this film is, but instead of explaining go watch it and figure them out for yourself. make your own judgement on a film not because of what a review says but what you think, you are your own critic;7 October 2003;10;['favorite', 'first', 'middle', 'new', 'unknown', 'fresh', 'exciting', 'least', 'amazing', 'accomplished', 'many', 'great', 'own', 'own'];0.3133116883116883

'don't give up mr frodo', 'take courage sam'.. followed by more crying and another group hug. it was filled with endless cliches and unnecessary dialogue, almost like the writer needed to fill the gaps to make it 3 hours long. i swore after watching the first i'd never watch the second, but people told me it was better and that i'd like it!! i must admit the scenery was fantastic, the effects were superb and that's the only reason i'm giving this 2/10 rather than 1/10.;23 December 2003;1;['top', 'first', 'several', 'second', 'bad', 'endless', 'more', 'endless', 'unnecessary', 'first', 'second', 'well', 'fantastic', 'superb', 'only'];0.1107142857142857
2094;arduwyn;"as a tolkien fan, and after the incredible first installment of the lord of the rings trilogy i was really looking forward to the two towers. there are many epic fight scenes - my favourite being the treants versus the forces of saruman the white at his tower in eisengard :) it is a must to watch. however i can only hope that in the final installment, the return of the king, there is less of a sense of it being dragged out in parts. this could primarily be achieved by leaving all scenes involving samwise gamgi out of the film. his ""fondness"" for frodo is done a bit over the top and you are left with the feeling that sam would gladly wipe mr. frodo's butt-crack if need be. this minor irritation and the fact that a few scenes dragged a bit are all that prevent me giving this film a rating of 9 or 10.";24 October 2003;8;['incredible', 'first', 'many', 'epic', 'favourite', 'final', 'less', 'samwise', 'minor', 'few'];0.1666666666666666

2122;m9c9s;"why did they have a whole sequence where aragorn is thought to be dead and that dumb elf (or the thought of her) brings him back? why add something so useless and completely non-tolkien? who cares about adding ""touching"" scenes for the superficial walking wallets? tolkien's books became classic and popular without all that garbage. i don't think peter jackson did a horrible job on the trilogy, and in fact, i think he produced a great silver screen interpretation of the series. however, i believe that he really fouled up the middle of this movie. its true that the book trilogy does not have much involvement for women, but there is no reason to add it now. it was completely unnecessary to add the whole arwen romance spin. i don't remember reading it in the books. if it was in the books, then it was so insignificant that i merely forgot it. i only recall arwen being mentioned in the end when they are wed (in a somewhat political wedding). (i've been told there is more to arwen in the appendices, but i never read those, and they are appendices for a reason: extra and unimportant) in fact, they actually cut out some of the only ""romance"" that tolkien actually put in the story. faramir and eowyn spend quite a bit of time together while recovering, and that is where they begin to fall in love. if it was so necessary to have romance in this series, why not emphasize that part? this is probably because it didn't occur until the third book, and some hollywood money-maker thought it would be better to develop a romance from the beginning to draw people in. i know this may seem like i'm some tolkien die-hard who will not like anything but the books, but i'm not. i love when books and movies coincide. however, i hate when money (instead of artistic integrity) dictates production values. if you want a clearer view of what i mean, read michael crichton's the lost world (sequel to jurassic park) and then watch the movie.";25 February 2005;5;['whole', 'aragorn', 'dead', 'dumb', 'useless', 'non', 'touching', 'superficial', 'classic', 'popular', 'horrible', 'great', 'true', 'much', 'unnecessary', 'whole', 'insignificant', 'political', 'more', 'extra', 'unimportant', 'only', 'necessary', 'third', 'hollywood', 'well', 'die', 'hard', 'artistic', 'clear', 'lost'];0.0265151515151515

2148;mikimiki-57022;"lord of the rings: two towers why does everyone say that lord of the rings trilogy are one of the best movies ever made? maybe because, they are the movies adaptation of one and only j.r.r. tolkien, who was a magnificent fantasy novelist? nah. or maybe it is known, because peter jackson have directed entire trilogy? possibly. from my point of view whole trilogy owe their popularity to amazing actors, screenplays and cgi. whole story is placed in middle-earth and is the great journey to destroy mighty ring of dark lord sauron. frodo baggins (played by elijah wood) and samwise ""sam"" gamgee (played by sean astin) continue their journey to mordor to mountain doom. second part begin with remind of past events. the fellowship of the ring is nearing its end. everyone is scattered by the great loss, but they must complete their quest. legolas (orlando bloom), aragon (viggo mortensen) and gimli (john rhys-davies) pursue the uruk-hai to save their fellows merry (dominic monaghan) and pippin (billy boyd), while frodo and sam lost their way to mordor. last owner of dark ring, gollum (andy serkis), who followed them, helps them find the way out. i won't say more, you must see it with your own eyes. briefly speaking screenplay and cgi of this movie is fantastic. there is everything you need: orcs, elves, dwarf and great wall. if you sought new thrills packed with great battles, a romance and a masterful plot, you would find a right movie. if not, you should watch it anyway. p.s they have dragons.";15 May 2018;9;['good', 'only', 'magnificent', 'entire', 'whole', 'amazing', 'whole', 'middle', 'great', 'mighty', 'dark', 'samwise', 'second', 'past', 'great', 'dominic', 'last', 'dark', 'more', 'own', 'fantastic', 'great', 'new', 'great', 'masterful', 'right'];0.3613365800865801
