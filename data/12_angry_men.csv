0;MartinHafer;"this is one of the greatest films ever made...period. much of this can be attributed to the exceptional writing and much of this can be attributed to the amazing performances in one of the best ensemble casts in film history. in fact, anyone who considers themselves a film buff or a serious student of film cannot say so unless they have seen this film. i also wish all young directors and writers were forced to watch the film as it demonstrates the power of excellent writing and acting. imagine...a film that is great that does not have special effects, was filmed in black and white, and 99% of which takes place in one small room. aside from henry fonda, all the other actors are a virtual ""who's who"" of supporting character actors from the 1950s--and all were at the top of their game in this film. unfortunately, the film has been parodied and copied so many times that the film's originality has been blunted. oddly, one of the parodies of this plot came from the tv show ""the odd couple""--which starred jack klugman who was also in 12 angry men! see this film. and, if it turns out you don't like it, then i suggest you see a psychiatrist!!!";13 April 2007;10;['great', 'much', 'exceptional', 'much', 'amazing', 'good', 'ensemble', 'serious', 'young', 'excellent', 'great', 'special', 'black', 'white', 'small', 'other', 'virtual', 'many', 'odd', 'angry'];0.2488839285714285
1;TheLittleSongbird;there are a few wonderful courtroom dramas out there, anatomy of a murder, to kill a mockingbird and witness for the prosecution immediately springing to mind. 12 angry men is so brilliant, it could very well be the definitive courtroom drama on film. sidney lumet's direction is masterly, and although the action takes place on one set(an actual new york drawing room) there are a huge variety of innovative camera angles and visual set-ups. the screenplay is sophisticated and smart, and the story is compelling and intelligent. the film is also brilliantly made, and the acting is superb. henry fonda especially dominates the film, with an integrity that makes his character so wonderful, but the other actors are wonderful as well, ed begley, jack warden, john fiedler, lee j cobb, rudy bond et al. are all impeccable support to fonda. overall, brilliant courtroom drama. 10/10 bethany cox;10 June 2010;10;['few', 'wonderful', 'angry', 'brilliant', 'definitive', 'masterly', 'actual', 'huge', 'innovative', 'visual', 'sophisticated', 'smart', 'compelling', 'intelligent', 'superb', 'wonderful', 'other', 'wonderful', 'impeccable', 'brilliant'];0.4688492063492064
2;bkoganbing;when i was younger i thought 12 angry men was a near perfect ensemble film with a great group of male players. at that time in those sexist fifties women had an automatic out from jury duty. it was not unusual to have all male juries as we have here. then i served on a few juries and my concepts changed. one of the key scenes of the film is when henry fonda produces a switchblade knife exactly like the weapon the young perpetrator allegedly used in the stabbing death of his father. the second that fonda produced that knife, someone should have yelled for a mistrial. in all 50 states of the united states of america, a standard jury instruction is that the jury is to decide the guilt or innocence of a defendent on the evidence presented at trial. jurors are free to come and go until they are sequestered for the verdict. but they are instructed not to go near the crime scene or gather any independent evidence. i remember being on jury duty and assigned on a case where the crime took place in an apartment that was one block away from one of two routes to a bmt subway stop that took me to work. and those same subways also took me to downtown brooklyn and the court house. i made it a point to take the irt to court for the next two weeks while the trial went on to avoid the temptation of going over to the crime scene. it was a great dramatic effect, but totally at odds with our legal system. i can't believe that something that elementary was left in a film that was purported to be a realistic look at jury deliberations. the juries i was on did debate and in some cases quibble over all the points of the trial. they were a good cross section of the breed brooklynus americanus just as in 12 angry men. if you watch law and order you know how hard the prosecutors job is to get 12 people to convict. still it's a wonderful group of players that participated here. henry fonda and lee j. cobb are the biggest names in the cast. but others like robert webber, john fiedler, martin balsam, and jack klugman got their first real notice in this film. jack klugman's portrayal was a particular favorite of mine among the group. he's from the same slum background as the defendent and some of the knowledge he has from that environment makes for the most compelling argument for the defendent's innocence. we should be thankful that sidney lumet assembled and directed the find cast he did.;3 September 2005;6;['young', 'angry', 'near', 'perfect', 'ensemble', 'great', 'male', 'sexist', 'automatic', 'unusual', 'male', 'few', 'key', 'young', 'second', 'standard', 'free', 'independent', 'bmt', 'same', 'next', 'great', 'dramatic', 'legal', 'elementary', 'realistic', 'quibble', 'good', 'americanus', 'angry', 'wonderful', 'big', 'first', 'real', 'particular', 'same', 'compelling', 'thankful'];0.1677777777777777

4;SnoopyStyle;in a nyc courtroom, a first degree murder case against a poor 18 year old boy with a troubled history has just rested. the 12 men of the jury are sent to decide the seemingly open and shut case. they hold a vote and it's 11-1 guilty. henry fonda is the only not-guilty vote. he's not sure and wants to spend time discussing the case. this is the classic stage play. i say this meaning it's a bunch of characters in a room. the characters don't even have names. lee j. cobb and jack warden have the flashiest roles. henry fonda is essentially the lead as the central heroic role. he has the nobility. the roles are all filled with first rate character actors. this is an actor's movie. the only drawback is the cinematic potential. in the end, it is 12 men around a table in a room. the visual opportunities are limited. despite that, the debate interplay is engrossing and the movie is satisfying.;18 April 2016;7;['first', 'poor', 'old', 'troubled', 'open', 'shut', 'guilty', 'only', 'guilty', 'sure', 'classic', 'flashy', 'central', 'heroic', 'first', 'only', 'cinematic', 'visual', 'limited'];-0.028042328042328
5;Hitchcoc;"this movie came out of an era that i really loved, when ensemble acting was so strong. we had a whole group of character actors who really took seriously the smaller roles that they had. the direction by sidney lumet on this film is outstanding. to take the henry fonda character from the meek, inconsequential juror, simply putting forth a theory, to watching the other men slowly see his way of thinking, is subtlety at its best. lee j. cobb does his burn, done in by impatience and inconvenience. pusing an agenda that fits only him. underlying the entire plot is the defendant whom we never see but get to know through a slow, methodical, yet fascinating series of revelations. it's quiet, suspenseful, and human. it's the true whodunnit without hercule poirot. this is the element that is most obvious; that 12 men can sit in a single room for the entire movie and interact and still keep us totally occupied. enough has been said about this. i just wish that contemporary film making could take a bit more from these masterpieces; let the fine actors that we have do their individual things.";17 February 2006;10;['ensemble', 'strong', 'whole', 'small', 'outstanding', 'inconsequential', 'other', 'good', 'entire', 'slow', 'methodical', 'fascinating', 'quiet', 'suspenseful', 'human', 'true', 'hercule', 'obvious', 'single', 'entire', 'enough', 'contemporary', 'more', 'fine', 'individual'];0.153344671201814
6;mark.waltz;"theater at its best is practically impossible to get down on film correctly. when hollywood gets it right, they create a work of art. in this case, they did it simply, without frills, casting actors who looked real and fell into their individual parts like kids into a swimming pool on a hot summers day. it's the hottest day of the year, and these twelve men must decide the fate of an accused killer. but twelve men means twelve personalities, twelve temperaments, twelve political views, twelve religious opinions and twelve preconceived notions. as the temperature swells, so does the temperament. having been a very reluctant jury foreman, i find myself seeing eye to eye with the shyness of the man forced to lead the proceedings. everybody looks at you to get the ball rolling and hopefully get out of there as quickly as possible. martin balsam, as the foreman, tries to remain dignified and not be overly in control, losing that to one of the jurors who looks at the case in a completely different way than the others. twelve personalities means plenty of neuroses, and in a very short time, seeing what's really going on in the minds of strangers whom you'll never see again. this trial involves young john sacova, accused of killing his own father, and the twelve men must decide whether he gets the chair or not. these men, only identified through their juror number, are completely different, and it's obvious from the start that some of them (john fiedler in particular) vote guilty because they think they have to. only one (henry fonda) votes not guilty, and of course, one of them says, ""there's always one."" there are the aggressive ones certain of guilt, empathetic ones who would like to see the charges reduced, and those who view all young people from certain areas as scum regardless of their situation. at 60 years old, this film shows the same prejudices we face today, yet shows that there is always someone not about to follow the crowd simply because something strikes them as off. it is fonda who will pretty much control the room, although he does it in a subtle way where nobody realizes that he's pretty much taken over. while jury's have changed in 60 years (allowing women to serve being the most obvious change), what hasn't changed in the conflict of trying to understand the truth and to agree with 11 other people about it. fonda goes against what would be allowed today by acting on his own and visiting the neighborhood of the crime, but his passion in figuring out the truth is very admirable. he is quiet in his determination, making this typical fonda but one that fills his soul with humility and integrity. under the direction of novice sidney lumet, the entire cast is outstanding. familiar faces from all walks of show business each get their chance to shine. jack klugman, ed begley, e.g. marshall, jack warden, to name a few. i could easily write something about each of them, but it's worth checking them all out yourself. the one juror who really makes an impression in creating his character is lee j. cobb as the very aggressive juror who is hiding behind similarities to the case, having had a contentious relationship with his son that sparks his instant sense that the defendant is guilty beyond a shadow of a doubt. he was deservedly nominated for a golden globe (as was fonda), but the oscars only acknowledged the film, director and script for nominations. each jury is its own story, and from city to city, nothing changes but the type of case and the date.";20 March 2017;10;['good', 'impossible', 'individual', 'hot', 'hot', 'political', 'religious', 'twelve', 'preconceived', 'reluctant', 'possible', 'dignified', 'different', 'short', 'young', 'own', 'different', 'obvious', 'particular', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'aggressive', 'certain', 'empathetic', 'young', 'certain', 'old', 'same', 'subtle', 'obvious', 'other', 'own', 'admirable', 'quiet', 'typical', 'entire', 'outstanding', 'familiar', 'few', 'worth', 'aggressive', 'contentious', 'instant', 'guilty', 'golden', 'own'];0.0642857142857143
7;kosmasp;i could go on, but i thought i'd stop there before my summary line gets too big. now just because this is a classic movie (and we really should try to use that term lightly, but this movie really deserves it and i'll elaborate on that), does not mean everybody will love it. and if one does not like it, it does not mean they have no taste. they just have different tastes, which is a good thing, because if every human on earth would have the same taste, life would be very boring now wouldn't it? the asnwer is yes, in case you were wondering. but back to this, which begins outside and takes us inside. and it is important that we were outside because we will live inside a building (a room to be more specific) for the most time. there is also a brief shot of the alleged culprit/criminal. after that we get in a room with 12 men, who are quite different from each other. and while it wasn't yet time to give african american a chance in a movie like that (or asian american for that matter), there is a critical racial line that is drawn. if you follow what is happening and who says what or argues in certain ways, you will see that this movie has quite the social commentary in it. now that is one part of this being genius, because it never rubs your nose in it. it never says, this guy who is i.e. from italian descent has a reasonable thing/argument to say. no you just hear the things and see the people interact. and i have not even mentioned the way the movie is shot. and i'm not talking about the black and white cinematography (which is beautifully lit), no. i mean the framing and the set-ups. the editing and how everything flows. you feel like you're inside the room. you feel like this really happens or happened. even the things that seem not staged (someone blocking another person, a shadow, peoples back and more) are in fact staged and masterfully done so. there are way smarter people than me, that can list you many things this movie has done right and i'm sure there quite a few sources online to look for. just listening to the audio commentary can give a small glimpse into certain things too. but again, since this is not something that one might call light entertaining, if it does not appeal to you, then it is so. it does not mean you are wrong and it surely does not mean that this movie is falsely considered a masterpiece!;21 October 2019;10;['big', 'classic', 'different', 'good', 'same', 'boring', 'important', 'specific', 'most', 'brief', 'different', 'other', 'asian', 'critical', 'racial', 'certain', 'social', 'italian', 'reasonable', 'black', 'white', 'more', 'smart', 'many', 'sure', 'few', 'audio', 'small', 'certain', 'light', 'entertaining', 'wrong'];0.0933730158730158
8;classicsoncall;"when i was a store manager for a regional supermarket chain, about thirty years or so ago, our team was presented a developmental seminar featuring ""12 angry men"". breaking into work groups, our task was to watch the film, and at strategically paused moments, predict which of the jurors would be the next to change their verdict from guilty to not guilty. it was an exercise in analytical thinking and observation of human behavior, characteristics that a good manager needs in order to develop a work force toward a common goal. there was actually a group that got all the positions right from one through twelve, which astounded me. watching today, i got stuck again right at the outset, figuring jack klugman's juror #5 would be the first to be influenced by henry fonda's argument. the film is an extraordinary piece of ensemble acting, and if the players weren't that well known back in the day, they have certainly made themselves a name since. almost all have passed on, but to see actors like henry fonda, lee j. cobb, e.g. marshall, martin balsam, ed begley and klugman all in one film is a veritable treat, even apart from the story. but it's the story itself that rivets one's attention to the screen, and the slow, methodical plodding fonda brings to the table with convincing arguments even in the face of his own uncertainty about the case. with a surety that ""the facts are supposed to determine the case"", fonda's character struggles to assure his fellow jurors that the life of an accused killer is worth the effort to consider reasonable doubt. aside from fonda, the two most galvanizing characters are portrayed by lee j. cobb and ed begley. begley, juror #10, who exhibits the most extreme traits of racism and bigotry, forces each of the jurors to confront their own prejudices in an uncomfortable scene where almost every other juror stands up and turns their back on him. cobb, juror #3, has a much more personal investment in the trial, harboring a failed relationship with his own son that colors his view of the world. the really interesting point regarding fonda's character is that he accomplished his mission without ever raising his voice. i don't think i could have done that considering the stakes involved. it's a rare film that can anchor the viewer in one spot for an hour and a half and make time fly by with an intriguing story and realistic dialog. rarer still is the ability to poke a finger at one's own pre-conceived notions of guilt or innocence, forcing the serious viewer to take a seat at the jury table and examine the facts from all sides before voting guilty or not guilty.";30 July 2011;9;['regional', 'developmental', 'angry', 'next', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'analytical', 'human', 'good', 'common', 'right', 'first', 'extraordinary', 'ensemble', 'veritable', 'slow', 'methodical', 'convincing', 'own', 'fellow', 'worth', 'reasonable', 'extreme', 'own', 'uncomfortable', 'other', 'personal', 'own', 'interesting', 'rare', 'intriguing', 'realistic', 'rare', 'own', 'pre', 'conceived', 'serious', 'guilty', 'guilty'];0.0784126984126983

10;Woodyanders;a teenage puerto rican boy from the slums is on trial for allegedly murdering his own father. eleven of the twelve jurors are certain that he's guilty, but one token odd man out dissenting juror (beautifully played with subtle understatement by henry fonda) has his doubts. the juror gets everyone else to question their motives and more heavily scrutinize every last minute detail of the seemingly cut and dried case. director sidney lumet, working from reginald rose's smart, literate and incisive script, further aided by boris kaufman's sharp black and white cinematography and kenyon hopkins' spare, unobtrusive score, works wonders with the simple premise, placing a keen and intimate emphasis on the exceptionally colorful and distinctive dozen characters. the uniformly marvelous acting from a bang-up ensemble cast qualifies as a substantial sterling asset: fonda and lee j. cobb are both terrific as radically opposing guys who are at continual loggerheads with each other while ed begley (incredibly fearless as a despicable racist jerk), jack warden, joseph sweeney (simply lovely as the old man), george voskovec, martin balsam, jack klugman, john fiedler, robert webber, e.g. marshall and the criminally underrated edward binns all lend top-drawer support in equally meaty roles. the twelve individual jurors serve as a very revealing and insightful microcosm of our justice system in particular and our society in general, representing all the various flaws, strengths and quirks of our culture which range from blithe indifference (warden's boorish baseball fan, webber's slick advertising executive) to cold pragmatism (marshall's prissy intellectual) to meek passivity (fiedler's soft-spoken wimp) to foul prejudice (begley's unforgettably odious hatemonger, cobb's seething ball of roaring rage and resentment) to true blue responsible patriotism (fonda's calm voice of liberal reason, sweeney's supportive old man, voskovec's proud adopted american immigrant). kaufman's gorgeously crisp photography tremendously heightens the considerable tension, palpably evoking a sweaty, uncomfortable and claustrophobic sweltering hot atmosphere that's as gripping as it is convincing. in the hands of a lesser cast and director the story could have been flat and stagy. but lumet's tight direction and the seamless ensemble acting from an amazing cast effortlessly blend together to create a crackling sense of absorbing drama and rip-snorting energy that's constantly engrossing and exciting throughout. an undeniable classic.;30 July 2006;10;['teenage', 'puerto', 'rican', 'own', 'certain', 'guilty', 'token', 'odd', 'subtle', 'last', 'smart', 'literate', 'incisive', 'sharp', 'black', 'white', 'spare', 'unobtrusive', 'simple', 'keen', 'intimate', 'colorful', 'distinctive', 'marvelous', 'ensemble', 'substantial', 'sterling', 'terrific', 'continual', 'other', 'fearless', 'despicable', 'racist', 'lovely', 'old', 'underrated', 'top', 'individual', 'revealing', 'insightful', 'particular', 'general', 'various', 'boorish', 'slick', 'prissy', 'soft', 'spoken', 'foul', 'odious', 'seething', 'true', 'blue', 'responsible', 'calm', 'liberal', 'supportive', 'old', 'proud', 'crisp', 'considerable', 'uncomfortable', 'claustrophobic', 'hot', 'convincing', 'less', 'flat', 'tight', 'seamless', 'amazing', 'rip', 'exciting', 'undeniable'];0.1023550724637681

12;jboothmillard;"i should start by saying that twelve is my favourite number, but it wasn't just because of that that i planned to see this film, i had heard many people state it is one of the finest films in the genre, from debuting oscar and golden globe nominated director sidney lumet (murder on the orient express, dog day afternoon). basically the jury of twelve men (a jury is always twelve people) has just come from the courtroom after hearing the defence and prosecution rest their cases, and they are now the people who must decide the verdict for the case. they must determine if a young spanish-american is guilty or not guilty of the first degree murder by stabbing of his father, and if they all unanimously agree to find him guilty he instantly gets sentenced to death. with a weak alibi of going out to the movies and not remembering what he saw, a knife he supposedly bought and lost, and a number of witnessed hearing screams, someone shouting the words ""i'm going to kill you"" and possible seeing it happen, it seems open and shut. all jurors have immediately decided to vote guilty, one juror however is voting not guilty until he clears up the facts, this is mr. davis, aka juror #8 (bafta winning henry fonda, also producing). at first he is voting opposite to everyone else for the sake of conversation and discussion, deliberations however crop up and he slowly straightens things out and brings forward things that the defence, prosecution and ultimately witnesses may have missed. these include juror #8 having the same knife as the boy and pondering the stabbing, the noises going on when the murder happened, the reason for the shouted words, the timing of the old man heading to answer the door, and most importantly, a key witness who chose not to wear glasses but marks on her nose prove she does. slowly the jurors, some wise, bright and empathetic, one or two arrogant, prejudiced and merciless, may be seeing that this lone juror has some good points and brings forward some good ideas as to what may have happened. juror #3 (the exorcist's golden globe nominated lee j. cobb) and juror #10 (ed begley) for a long while seem adamant to stick to their verdicts of guilty, but slowly the others: juror #1 (psycho's martin balsam), juror #2 (john fiedler), juror #4 (e.g. marshall), juror #5 (jack klugman), juror #6 (edward binns), juror #7 (being there's jack warden), juror #9 (joseph sweeney), juror #11 (george voskovec) and juror #12 (robert webber), do start to doubt their decision is right. being swayed by the very convincing predictions of the murder events, one by one the jurors change their verdict to not guilty, until the final one sobbingly gives in, and in the end they all agree the boy should go free. fonda gives a magnificent performance as the calm, collective and convincing lone voting juror to turn the others decision, cobb is equally fantastic as the one who takes ages to change the mind of, and the other actors all get their moments on screen as well. the one location film based on a play could have been a little dull, but director lumet keeps you gripped with a marvellously worded script played out to perfection by the actors, with the addition of great camera work and set pieces as well, it is a brilliant classic courtroom drama. it was nominated the oscars for best picture and best writing, screenplay based on material from another medium, it was nominated the bafta for best film from any source, and it was nominated the golden globe for best motion picture - drama. henry fonda was number 6 on 100 years, 100 stars - men, juror #8 was number 28 on 100 years, 100 heroes & villains, the film was number 88 on 100 years, 100 thrills, it was number 87 on 100 years, 100 greatest movies, and it was number 42 on 100 years, 100 cheers. very good!";5 June 2011;9;['favourite', 'many', 'fine', 'golden', 'nominated', 'young', 'spanish', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'first', 'guilty', 'weak', 'witnessed', 'possible', 'open', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'same', 'old', 'key', 'wise', 'bright', 'empathetic', 'arrogant', 'prejudiced', 'lone', 'good', 'good', 'golden', 'long', 'adamant', 'guilty', 'right', 'convincing', 'guilty', 'final', 'free', 'magnificent', 'calm', 'collective', 'convincing', 'lone', 'fantastic', 'other', 'little', 'dull', 'great', 'brilliant', 'classic', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'golden', 'good', 'great', 'good'];0.216805977710233
13;rmax304823;"first of all, what a cast! fonda doesn't seem like much of a new yorker, but the rest of the cast reads like a who's who in new york movies. all of them except sweeney and voscovek went on to lengthy careers in character and support roles. the plot comes from a tv show and is very tightly written. there's hardly a wasted word or an unnecessary gesture. this has its drawbacks because it imposes a dramatic frame on the characters and the development. there's not much sense of ""real life"" here. everything fits together too neatly for that. but if events follow earlier events with a logic that is a bit obvious, it's forgivable because the screenplay is done so well. like ""stagecoach,"" it may be mechanical but it's as finely tuned as a good wristwatch. also more or less unavoidable in a short movie dealing with a dozen often conflicting characters is the reduction in their complexity. each is a stereotype. they practically wear sweatshirts with logos on them. ""i am a shallow ad man."" ""bored marmalade salesman here."" ""kick me, i am an ignorant racist."" they are capable of changing their opinions but they show only one side of their characters. a third unfortunate quality in the script is that it is imbued with what tom wolfe referred to as ""nostalgie de la bou"" -- a kind of admiration for the lowbrow. pauline kael made the same observation back in the early 60s in an essay called ""fantasies of the art house audience."" what it boils down to is a dislike of the middle-class. fonda is an architect, a professional. the other good guys in the movie are members of minority groups or ordinary working stiffs with slum backgrounds. the two most repulsive villains (ed begley and lee j. cobb) are self-made men who run their own successful businesses. the rufescent begley has a line, something like, ""i got ten factories going to pot while we're talking' here."" cobb brags about how he built up his delivery business starting out with nothing. a third dummy is a salesman -- of marmalade! (yukk.) okay. that gets pretty much all of the weaknesses out of the way. the pluses outweigh the minuses by exactly two short tons. the acting is almost impossible to improve upon, not surprisingly. it's unfair to single out jack warden and martin balsam for their performances but i'll do it anyway. the photography, by boris kaufman, is perceptive and adds to the tension, the feeling of claustrophobia. especially memorable is the scene in which most of the jurors are standing together, there is a rumble of thunder, and a shadow falls gloomily over the group. it's a small touch but palpable. lumet manages to suggest new york city effectively in this crowded room, practically the only set. (there is a shot at the end that is done on the steps of the real courthouse.) lumet's direction makes the most of his actors' talents. the pauses in their arguments last just long enough for us to take a few breaths. rose's script avoids an easy ending. yes, there is reasonable doubt enough for the verdict to turn out as it does, but there is no dramatic introduction of crucial evidence to demonstrate that the defendant is innocent. did he do it? we don't know. suppose the kid actually did it and gets away with it? fonda is twice challenged on that point -- once at the table and once in the men's room -- and in neither instance does he have a reply. overall, it's a marvelous movie, a lesson in acting, directing, writing, and shooting. the recent updated version has been made politically correct but is not an improvement over this original. see it if you have the chance.";11 November 2003;8;['much', 'new', 'lengthy', 'unnecessary', 'dramatic', 'much', 'real', 'early', 'obvious', 'forgivable', 'mechanical', 'good', 'unavoidable', 'short', 'shallow', 'bored', 'ignorant', 'capable', 'third', 'unfortunate', 'same', 'early', 'middle', 'other', 'good', 'ordinary', 'repulsive', 'own', 'successful', 'third', 'short', 'impossible', 'unfair', 'perceptive', 'memorable', 'most', 'small', 'palpable', 'crowded', 'only', 'real', 'most', 'last', 'few', 'easy', 'reasonable', 'dramatic', 'crucial', 'innocent', 'marvelous', 'recent', 'correct', 'original'];0.0750757575757575

28;Doylenf;twelve angry men is essentially a claustrophobic slice of jury duty, where jurors are herded into a new york city courtroom to discuss the facts of a murder trial of a boy accused of murdering his father. gradually, with stark close-ups of sweating faces, we get to know the men after a brief round of small talk leads to the small details of the case after choosing a jury foreman (martin balsam). most of these fine actors are gone now, but interestingly enough the three who played the angriest men (lee j. cobb, e.g. marshall and ed begley) all died of heart attack several years after filming this one. henry fonda, as the man who carefully reconstructs what might have happened, had a long screen career that ended after winning an oscar for on golden pond. based on a tv play directed by sidney lumet, it's a faithful retelling of the tale, photographed with stark realism that catches the sweaty courtroom on a hot summer day and is basically a character study of each man, each one put under the microscope by a shrewd director who gets the most from his players. the tension builds from the disagreements that arise over deliberations until the final struggle to reach a decision depends on the vote of the one stubborn hold-out (lee j. cobb). fonda is the man who presents his own theory of what actually happened and is able to persuade the others, one by one, to his side of the argument. extremely well done drama seems almost documentary in its display of jury room deliberations when tempers flash, where patience is strained and reason finally sees the light of day after fonda (never convinced of the boy's guilt in killing his father) is able to present his doubts to the other jurors. gripping stuff, well worth watching.;7 January 2007;7;['angry', 'claustrophobic', 'stark', 'close', 'brief', 'small', 'small', 'most', 'fine', 'enough', 'angry', 'several', 'long', 'golden', 'faithful', 'stark', 'hot', 'shrewd', 'most', 'final', 'stubborn', 'own', 'able', 'strained', 'able', 'other', 'worth'];0.0473484848484848

33;Boba_Fett1138;this is minimalistic movie making at its very best. i mean as far as movies set in a single room go this is simply the best one out there. lots of later movies tried to imitate it and attempted to reach the same level of successful and brilliance but none of them have even come close yet. it also has one of the most simple premises out there. all that the movie is about is 12 jurors trying to decide whether or not the accused in a murder-trial is guilty of the crime or not. so the movie is all talk but sure no bore. it's a movie that is always going and at all times interesting, due to its diverse and rich characters and its simple, yet greatly intriguing concept. i have no illusions about it though that this is also how its like in real life. so even though the movie takes a realistic approach with its story, it's still obviously fiction but at least it's not overwritten or ever exaggerated. interesting and most effective thing about the movie is that it starts off with only one guy voting for the accused being not guilty, even though he himself is not at all convinced that he is actually innocent. he only wants to talk about it because he feels like he owes it to the guy, who's life they are deciding about. all are reluctant at first, since it seemed to be a clear and done case but the more elements and proof gets debated about the more doubt arises about his guilt. so slowly opinions start to slide and some of the jurors get set up against each other, due to their different opinions. its what keeps the movie so interesting to watch and is also what makes the movie a real well flowing well. it's also brilliantly brought to the screen by director sidney lumet, who had never directed a theatrical movie before actually. even though the movie is set in mostly one room he uses this aspect to the maximum and to the movie its own advantage. it gives the movie a great atmosphere and feel to it. there are some long and dynamic shots, that allow all of the characters to often do their say in a sequences. it gives the characters actually some depth and personality, even though we never get to know all of their names and of course it's not being the type of movie that has the space and time to do some character building. sidney lumet really did the most and best with the story and its characters. it's obviously a character drive movie and in a way also a real great character study. so it also really helps the movie that it has some truly great actors in it. i was a bit worried about henry fonda being what was supposed to be the most sympathetic character, also since i was used to seeing jack lemmon in that role, in the 1997 remake. but no, fonda was just surprisingly great and effective in his role. lee j. cobb was also really great but by saying that i feel like i'm not given the rest of the cast enough credit. all are simply great in their roles, though it are fonda and cobb that stand out, also because they are being the main characters of the movie, that throughout stand opposite to each other with their views and opinions. it's were most of the movie its fireworks comes from. one great and fantastically effective minimalistic and simplistic movie. movie-making at its best and purest. 9/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/;27 July 2010;9;['minimalistic', 'good', 'single', 'good', 'later', 'same', 'successful', 'simple', 'guilty', 'interesting', 'diverse', 'rich', 'intriguing', 'real', 'realistic', 'least', 'overwritten', 'exaggerated', 'interesting', 'effective', 'guilty', 'innocent', 'reluctant', 'clear', 'more', 'other', 'different', 'interesting', 'theatrical', 'own', 'great', 'long', 'dynamic', 'good', 'great', 'great', 'worried', 'sympathetic', 'great', 'effective', 'great', 'cast', 'enough', 'great', 'main', 'other', 'most', 'great', 'effective', 'minimalistic', 'simplistic', 'good'];0.3084145021645021

35;AlsExGal;"... the main flaw being that everybody brings their own life experiences and history into the jury room with them, no matter how hard they try to be impartial. here you have a trial of a young boy who supposedly stabbed his father to death. when the jurors go back to deliberate on the case, all but one lone man played with a quiet courage by henry fonda states not guilty and the rest of the film is about trying to get them to his side. quite amazing movie if you ask me. fonda's case is not that the boy is innocent, but that the threshold of reasonable doubt has not been reached. the trick in this film is that it never leaves the jury room. you have no idea of what the defendant, the prosecuting attorney, or the defense attorney were like other than retroactively through the words of the jurors. writing this good just can't be ignored. reginald rose's screenplay is absolutely brilliant. not only are the characters of twelve individuals indelibly implanted in your brain within the limited time span of about 100 minutes, but rose accomplishes this feat without undue speechifying or pontificating about injustice or the failures of the jury system or expositional dialogue. the characters personalities come out in the course of the film and are not ""set up"" in the first half hour, (as in having the jurors explain to each other what their occupations and backgrounds are) as is the case with mediocre screenplays. as for the acting it is true ensemble greatness. all twelve cast members are excellent, although if you put a gun to my head and forced me to say who was best i'd express a partiality for lee j cobb as the toughest nut to crack for acquittal and e.g. marshall as a juror who is all logic and no emotion other than arrogance. and sidney lumet's first film just may be his most fast paced. the hundred minutes whiz by! not a dull stretch to be seen anywhere. and yes, these are twelve white men judging a puerto rican boy, and yes henry fonda violated many classic rules of jury behavior when he introduced items into the discussion that were not official evidence, but this was 60 years ago and it is a movie. so just suspend your beliefs and try to enjoy the art of the thing -the riveting dialogue, the character studies that don't choke each other out, and the brilliant camera-work that manages to make the room seem increasingly smaller so that you can appreciate the claustrophobia that must be setting in with the jurors as deliberations wear on and get more heated.";19 February 2017;9;['main', 'own', 'impartial', 'young', 'lone', 'quiet', 'guilty', 'amazing', 'innocent', 'reasonable', 'other', 'brilliant', 'limited', 'undue', 'expositional', 'first', 'half', 'other', 'mediocre', 'true', 'ensemble', 'excellent', 'good', 'tough', 'acquittal', 'other', 'first', 'dull', 'white', 'puerto', 'rican', 'many', 'classic', 'official', 'riveting', 'other', 'brilliant', 'small', 'heated'];0.17292008757526

40;JamesHitchcock;"this is a courtroom drama with a difference; we see nothing of the actual trial except the end of the judge's summing up. we only get a brief glimpse of the defendant, a young man accused of stabbing to death his abusive father. we do not see the lawyers or any of the witnesses. the action is confined to the jury room after the trial has finished. at first, eleven jurors believe that the defendant is guilty but one, played by henry fonda, has doubts, and tries to convince his colleagues that the case has not been proved beyond reasonable doubt. the remarkable thing about this film is that each of the twelve jurymen (all are male) emerges as an individual in his own right. thanks are due to vukodlak whose helpful review accurately summarises their characters. the jurors are referred to by their jury numbers, not their names, although we discover the surnames of henry fonda's character number 8 (davis) and of his colleague number 9 (mccardle) right at the end. number 8 is the key character. at first he is somewhat hesitant in his views. he is not convinced of the boy's innocence, and perhaps, at first, not even of the reasonable doubt about his guilt that would justify bringing in a ""not guilty"" verdict. he is, however, unwilling to condemn a young man to the electric chair without close consideration of all the issues, and suggests that the jury should take its time to talk the matter over. as they do, each piece of evidence is subjected to close scrutiny, the reliability of witnesses is cast into doubt, and holes start to emerge in what had previously seemed a watertight prosecution case. one by one the more conscientious members of the jury, with one exception, start to come over to number 8's point of view. four other jurors play particularly important parts in the drama. number 7, played by jack warden, is the least conscientious of all. he is not worried in the least about the defendant's guilt or innocence. he has tickets for a baseball game that evening and wants to reach a verdict as quickly as possible so that he does not miss the match. at first he votes to find the defendant guilty, but when he sees how things are going he abruptly changes his vote to not guilty in order to get home more quickly. (he is deservedly rebuked by number 11, a painstaking, foreign-born watchmaker). number 4, played by e. g. marshall, is the exception mentioned above, the one juror who approaches his duties conscientiously but who nevertheless holds out for a guilty verdict almost to the very end. he is a stockbroker by profession, clearly something of an intellectual. he approaches the case calmly, logically and methodically, weighing every piece of evidence. the problem is that his approach takes no account of the emotions involved and leaves no room for doubt. as one of the other jurors says, weighing up evidence is not a precise science, but number 4 treats it as though it is. when convinced by number 8's arguments, however, he concedes with good grace that there is now reasonable doubt in his mind and changes his vote to not guilty. number 10 and number 3, although number 4's allies, are completely different in their approach to the case. whereas he approaches it with too much scientific detachment, they approach it with too much passion and prejudice. number 10, played by ed begley, is prejudiced against the young man because of his social background. in a memorable scene he gives vent to his feelings in a long rant about ""those people""; this could mean slum dwellers in general or could be a racist diatribe. (the defendant's ethnicity is never precisely established). one by one the other jurors, even those who have previously supported him, turn their backs on him. number 3 is as violent in his feelings as number 10, but his hatred of the young man arises less from social or racial prejudice than from his resentment of his own son, from whom he is estranged. all of the parts are very well played, including the calm, authoritative fonda. the best, however, was lee j cobb as number 3. whereas begley's character is simply contemptible, cobb's is, in a way, pitiable. he is full of anger, but we see that his anger arises out of the anguish caused by his failed relationship with his own son. this is, in fact, one of those rare films where everything works perfectly- the script, the acting and sidney lumet's direction which emphasises the claustrophobic atmosphere of the jury room and the tension of the plot. (lumet is one of a select band of directors who have made a masterpiece with their first film). the result is a true classic of the cinema, the greatest-ever legal drama and one of the greatest films of all time. it did not do well at the oscars, but that is because it had the misfortune to come out in the same year as another great film, ""bridge on the river kwai"". unlike some, i did not see the film as reflecting a preference for liberal political values over conservative ones; a belief in the importance of the presumption of innocence is not confined to liberals. also, i did not see it necessarily as a vindication of the jury system. at the end of the film we feel a sense of relief that a possible miscarriage of justice has been averted, but we are also left with an uneasy feeling that, in real life, innocent people may have been convicted because their juries contained too many wardens, cobbs or begleys and not enough fondas. 10/10";12 April 2006;10;['actual', 'brief', 'young', 'abusive', 'guilty', 'reasonable', 'remarkable', 'male', 'own', 'due', 'helpful', 'key', 'hesitant', 'reasonable', 'guilty', 'unwilling', 'young', 'electric', 'close', 'close', 'conscientious', 'other', 'important', 'least', 'conscientious', 'worried', 'least', 'possible', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'very', 'other', 'precise', 'good', 'reasonable', 'guilty', 'different', 'much', 'scientific', 'much', 'young', 'social', 'memorable', 'long', 'general', 'racist', 'other', 'violent', 'young', 'less', 'social', 'racial', 'own', 'estranged', 'calm', 'authoritative', 'good', 'contemptible', 'pitiable', 'full', 'own', 'rare', 'claustrophobic', 'select', 'first', 'true', 'great', 'legal', 'great', 'same', 'great', 'liberal', 'political', 'conservative', 'possible', 'uneasy', 'real', 'innocent', 'many', 'enough'];0.1096982758620689
41;StevePulaski;"sidney lumet's 12 angry men is an interesting choice for one of the greatest american films of all time given its simultaneous abstraction and straight-forwardness as a film. it concerns a group of twelve jurors who are retired to reach a verdict on a murder case involving an eighteen-year-old living in the slums of new york, who is accused of murdering his father at their home. we are immediately taken into the new york city courthouse, where the twelve jurors are sent to their private room to discuss the case and come to a unanimous vote in favor of life or death for the boy. all but one juror is positive beyond a reasonable doubt that the boy in question is guilty and deserves the chair for his crimes. the man is henry fonda's character, a man who, like all but one other soul in the room, remains nameless until the end of the film. while he doesn't entirely believe the boy's innocence, he is unsure that he is guilty and feels it is wrong to jump to a decision about a young life so quickly without at least talking over the facts. with that, the jurors are forced to divulge some sort of conversation to get on the same page in favor of one side or the other. during this time, the new york city heat is sweltering, the fan in the room isn't working, and one juror cannot wait until he is released so he can go to a baseball game in the evening. what would normally be a quick meeting between twelve men turns into a bitter, but rational display or exchanging facts about the case and going against groupthink by providing logical alternatives to the events recounted by the witnesses. fonda's character is called a lot of things in the film and many of them are accurate to his persona, albeit in a bitter, shortchanging manner. he is referred to as a ""golden boy,"" sympathizing a young boy in the slums who has ostensibly taken on a life of savagery if he is in fact guilty. his character basically recites the same dialog repeatedly throughout the film, stating how he is not totally sure if he indeed not guilty, but can't be certain that he is guilty, leaving a reasonable doubt on his mind that he is too ethical to override. one of the many intriguing things about fonda's stance is his ability to go against the grain; the slightest doubt in his mind, at first, the commonality of the boy's alleged murder-weapon, a pocketknife, leads him to stall an otherwise unanimously convinced jury that the boy on trial is guilty. how many people, even if they had the slightest doubt in their mind, would challenge eleven other men who have raised their hands in favor of the boy's guilt and subsequent death? most people, including myself probably, would bury our skepticism under our own volition of self-deprecation: ""maybe i missed something,"" we'd think, ""maybe i'm just way off,"" we'd add, before humbly raising our hand in a delayed fashion to make what looked to be a hung jury a unanimous vote. if fonda's character would've done that, 12 angry men would be a depressingly common and pointless short film; not one of the greatest works of american cinema. the key to the film's renowned qualities lies in a few places. as stated, the first is the plausibility to believe the jurors become wrong-headed once they begin agreeing with fonda's character. some would argue that having these characters basing an entire trial/murder on the happenings of scattered incidents that were relatively minor in the grand-scheme would result in a miscarriage of justice. film critic mike d'angelo says that these twelve jurors would probably be the same ones who would acquit o.j. simpson of his murder charges. the fact is, we don't know at the end of it; we weren't there, we were never destined to be there, and all we know is that one person is dead, one person is about to own or disown responsibility to that death, and there is reasonable doubt lingering in the room like fragrant cologne. the correctness or morality of the jurors' decision isn't so much in question, for i'm sure a dinner conversation between two people who viewed the film disagreeing with the jurors' decisions could indeed occur with both parties having enough well-founded evidence. this brings me to the other noteworthy element about the film, which is its ability to operate in several different genres. the attributes of the film i just mentioned, leading it to be discussed and interpreted in a number of different ways, makes it a biting mystery, while the rapid-fire, investigative dialog in the second and third act turns the film more in the direction of a suspense film or a crime-drama. finally, there's the inherent melodrama of character relations, with numerous not getting along with one another and the hard-headedness of other jurors standing in the way in preventing what could be a potential miscarriage of justice (ed begley's character, for example, who remains incorruptibly certain that the boy is guilty). finally, above all in some minds, there's the sheer entertainment value of 12 angry men. this is a film that further proves my point that a film that takes place in one room and is heavily built on character relations and character development can be just as gripping as a film predicated upon large action setpieces and costly displays of action. as droll as the film may seem, this is one of the most entertaining courtroom-dramas i've yet to see with some of the most ambiguous questions about rebelling against groupthink, the analysis of justice and legal practices, and the sheer impact and significance of reasonable doubt(s) i have ever seen.";12 November 2015;10;['angry', 'interesting', 'great', 'american', 'simultaneous', 'straight', 'old', 'private', 'unanimous', 'positive', 'reasonable', 'guilty', 'other', 'unsure', 'guilty', 'wrong', 'young', 'least', 'same', 'other', 'quick', 'bitter', 'rational', 'logical', 'many', 'accurate', 'bitter', 'golden', 'young', 'guilty', 'same', 'sure', 'guilty', 'certain', 'guilty', 'reasonable', 'ethical', 'many', 'intriguing', 'slight', 'guilty', 'many', 'slight', 'other', 'subsequent', 'most', 'own', 'delayed', 'hung', 'unanimous', 'angry', 'common', 'pointless', 'short', 'great', 'american', 'renowned', 'few', 'first', 'entire', 'minor', 'grand', 'same', 'dead', 'about', 'reasonable', 'fragrant', 'much', 'sure', 'enough', 'other', 'noteworthy', 'several', 'different', 'different', 'biting', 'rapid', 'investigative', 'second', 'third', 'inherent', 'numerous', 'hard', 'other', 'potential', 'certain', 'guilty', 'sheer', 'angry', 'large', 'costly', 'entertaining', 'ambiguous', 'legal', 'sheer', 'reasonable'];0.0365828615828615

43;Red-Barracuda;"the interesting thing about 12 angry men is that you come away from it and can't honestly say if the jury were right to acquit the accused man. the film never really answers the question of whether he was guilty or not. it just simply says that it was impossible to be sure. the film is ultimately about the not proved verdict. at least i certainly hope that we as an audience were not supposed to leave the film thinking that the accused man was definitely innocent. the counter-evidence brought to our attention by juror no. 8 (henry fonda) is often not especially convincing but seems to be taken very seriously by progressively more and more men in the room until inevitably we have a unanimous not guilty verdict. an example of this, is when fonda successfully gets the others to acknowledge that the old man witness is unreliable, yet then goes on to base a major part of his own evidence on the old fellows testimony that he took fifteen seconds to get to the door to witness the murderer fleeing. fonda clearly assumes that this man he has determined as unreliable would get his exact timings spot on in a moment of heightened emotion. it may seem like a minor point but there are just a little too many of these small inconsistent assumptions littering 12 angry men for me to feel it was an entirely successful exercise. i really couldn't help shake the notion that fonda's character had his own agenda and was simply unwilling to back down. perhaps he was the most persuasive man in the room and that was ultimately the reason that the decision was made. it's difficult to really say with any certainty that the accused was innocent at all. did they really make the correct decision? setting this consideration aside, one thing the movie does have in abundance is stellar acting talent. the 12 members of the jury are well played by all. while the direction is simple but highly efficient; it is not an easy task to set a movie in one room with dialogue the only action on offer but sidney lumet does keep things moving along at a good pace and maintains the interest. this is certainly a good movie despite my misgivings. for me it does ultimately have a definite ambiguous quality and if that was the intention then i can hardly argue with that.";9 September 2011;7;['interesting', 'angry', 'right', 'guilty', 'impossible', 'sure', 'least', 'innocent', 'convincing', 'more', 'unanimous', 'guilty', 'old', 'unreliable', 'major', 'own', 'old', 'unreliable', 'exact', 'minor', 'little', 'many', 'small', 'inconsistent', 'angry', 'successful', 'own', 'unwilling', 'persuasive', 'difficult', 'innocent', 'correct', 'stellar', 'acting', 'simple', 'efficient', 'easy', 'only', 'good', 'good', 'definite', 'ambiguous'];0.1326479076479076

46;sddavis63;"modern movies have convinced us that if a movie doesn't have big budget special effects and lots of action it's not worth watching. if you want to be healed of that viewpoint, ""12 angry men"" is the tonic. here we have the simplest of movies. except for the opening and closing couple of minutes this entire movie is set in a jury room, as 12 men debate the fate of a young man charged with murdering his father. is he guilty or not? will he be executed or not? the 12 jurors debate the case. and that's it, basically. and it's powerful and fascinating and you won't take your eye off the screen from the moment it starts. henry fonda put on an excellent (if, i thought, a little bit too preachy) performance as juror davis, the lone hold out as the movie starts, the vote being 11-1 in favour of guilty. davis may not be convinced of the young man's innocence, but he sure isn't convinced of his guilt and he sets out to convince the others to give the kid a break. as good as fonda was, though, lee j. cobb stole the show as juror number 3, an angry, hateful and vengeful man who lashes out at the ""bleeding hearts"" as they start to be convinced by davis' arguments. an excellent supporting cast (including the likes of e.g. marshall, jack warden and jack klugman among others) also put on wonderful performances. i thought the movie was summed up perfectly at the very end. as davis is leaving the courthouse, he's met by juror mccardle (joseph sweeney). they introduce themselves to each other (they are the only two jurors named in the movie) and then go their separate ways. these twelve men who held the life of another man in their hands didn't have a clue who each other were and would probably never see each other again. but for this brief period of time they could hold us fixated, even if we didn't know who they were. movie-making at its finest. 10/10";28 January 2003;10;['modern', 'big', 'special', 'worth', 'angry', 'simple', 'entire', 'young', 'guilty', 'powerful', 'fascinating', 'excellent', 'little', 'preachy', 'young', 'good', 'angry', 'hateful', 'vengeful', 'excellent', 'wonderful', 'very', 'other', 'separate', 'other', 'other', 'brief', 'fine'];0.1614087301587301

49;gbill-74877;"a film whose action takes almost completely in the deliberation room of a jury may sound as if it's going to be awfully dry or uninteresting, but on the contrary, '12 angry men' is powerful and stirring, with real tension, fantastic characters, and great dialogue. it probes into the american judicial system, and in a larger sense, the human condition. i couldn't recommend it more highly. as a jury of twelve retire to reach a verdict in a murder trial on a sweltering day in new york, it's clear that most - in fact, eleven of them - believe the evidence against the accused is overwhelming. to me it's notable that early on, the lone holdout (henry fonda) isn't making all sorts of arguments as to why the defendant isn't guilty: he simply wants to make sure they proceed carefully and talk it through. he empathizes with the defendant's difficult upbringing not because he thinks it's relevant to the charges or a defense in and of itself, but because he's a decent guy who senses a rush to judgment, and perhaps most importantly, senses a bias in the room against one of ""those kinds of kids"" from the slums. what follows from there is a tour de force in critical thinking, rational discourse, and civility - all of the best things about mankind, and which save us from injustice and the mob. while the film is taut and focused on this single trial - and only this aspect of the trial - it has a number of larger messages. first and foremost, it tells us that wisdom never needs to shout. patience and silence are powerful. there are such lessons here in how to interact with others in calm, respectful, and yet assertive ways - even when tempers flare, things get personal, or when one has to stand up to a bully with a big mouth. in one of my favorite moments, when a bigoted juror (ed begley) is going on about ""those kind of people"" in clearly prejudiced ways, his fellow jurors quietly get up and turn their backs on him to show their disdain, and even those who agree with his vote do not support him. in another great rebuke, when begley asks the immigrant watchmaker (george voskovec) why he's being so polite, he responds ""for the same reason you are not; it's the way i was brought up."" the film also affirms the importance of the american justice system, and by extension, other countries with trial by jury in one form or another. flawed though it may be, the concept that one must be found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt by a jury of one's peers, and that the decision must be unanimous - that it's better to let a guilty man go free than to convict an innocent man - is fundamental to a functioning democracy. how fantastic it is when fonda's character states these points so simply and clearly. however, with that said, the film shows that this system only works when it's 'run' (or participated in) properly. justice and democracy require thoughtful participation, and are not things to be dismissed quickly so that we can resume our lives, and in the case of jack warden's character, get on to the baseball game. it's a wonderful moment when voskovec, otherwise relatively quiet, chastises him for his backward priorities while another man's life hangs in the balance. from these moments we can infer that the film is a criticism of those who avoid jury duty by pretending to show bias or conflict, and though it may be a stretch, you can apply this to other important civic duties as well, such as voting. it's to the film's credit that while there are a few who spew bigotry and bully others, everyone makes valid points about the evidence they've heard, including the loudmouths, and that's part of what makes it so gripping. sifting through these points and reaching consensus is a big part of the film. the flow of the discussion is intelligent, with the natural questions or responses to an argument vocalized by one character or another. there is such rawness and realism in the dialogue, and we wrestle with the facts ourselves, and feel the weight of it all. we see the importance of rational, careful thought, but also the importance of understanding others, and not just the defendant or witnesses in the case, but the jurors themselves, who all have their own backgrounds, and in some cases, their own baggage. if all of this sounds too heavy or moralistic, i apologize, because it really isn't. the performance are natural and brilliant across the board. there are powerful emotional moments, but there is also humor peppered throughout the film. when fonda's character queries marshall's own ability to recall events from past evenings, we hear warden quip in the background ""when you get to new year's eve 1954, let me know."" before the advertising man (robert webber) puts forth an idea, he says ""let's throw it out and see if the cat licks it up."" these types of lines not only make the characters more interesting, but they also add realism. it's telling to me that while lee j. cobb comes across as the 'rival' to henry fonda, and he is quite bombastic in several emotional moments, it's really the cold, factual juror (e.g. marshall) who really needs to be swayed at the end, and it's a discussion of reason against reason. cobb is the last juror to change his mind, but the final discussion is really between marshall and fonda. marshall admits that fonda has ""made some excellent points"", but then reminds him of the eyewitness testimony, and then says ""what do you think?"" civility and decency are triumphing, and it's a metaphor for the only hope for man. the ending is absolutely brilliant, with the jurors returning into the streets to head back to their twelve separate lives, having performed their civic duty. director sidney lumet shows incredible restraint to not then cut to 'what actually happened' on the night in question, or to a plot twist, or to some outcome good or bad (e.g. some of type of feel-good fanfare with the young defendant weeping tears of relief, or a horrifying realization fonda has when he somehow finds out that he's let a killer go free, etc). there's none of that, and quite simply because they've done what they're meant to do, and justice has been served.";1 October 2018;10;['dry', 'uninteresting', 'angry', 'powerful', 'stirring', 'real', 'fantastic', 'great', 'american', 'judicial', 'large', 'human', 'clear', 'overwhelming', 'notable', 'lone', 'guilty', 'sure', 'difficult', 'relevant', 'decent', 'critical', 'rational', 'good', 'single', 'large', 'powerful', 'such', 'calm', 'respectful', 'assertive', 'personal', 'big', 'favorite', 'bigoted', 'prejudiced', 'fellow', 'great', 'immigrant', 'polite', 'same', 'other', 'flawed', 'guilty', 'reasonable', 'unanimous', 'well', 'guilty', 'free', 'innocent', 'fundamental', 'fantastic', 'thoughtful', 'wonderful', 'quiet', 'backward', 'other', 'important', 'civic', 'such', 'few', 'valid', 'big', 'intelligent', 'natural', 'such', 'rational', 'careful', 'own', 'own', 'heavy', 'moralistic', 'natural', 'brilliant', 'powerful', 'emotional', 'own', 'past', 'new', 'interesting', 'bombastic', 'several', 'emotional', 'cold', 'factual', 'last', 'final', 'excellent', 'only', 'brilliant', 'separate', 'civic', 'incredible', 'good', 'bad', 'good', 'young', 'horrifying', 'free'];0.1825800865800866

51;ThomasDrufke;"being a film buff myself, i'd like to think i know good movies when i see them. with 12 angry men, all it took was a few scenes and i knew this was one of the great ones. not only was this movie important and influential, it's also easily re-watchable. i've seen it three times now and each time i pick up on new tidbits of information and dialogue that i missed the time before. i would imagine it's not easy directing an ensemble of 12 in one small room, but sidney lumet managed to do it, and do it very well. i often find crime-drama's to be my favorite genre of movies in large part because of the suspenseful aspects of that particular storytelling. while 12 angry men is far from a prototypical crime drama, it's certainly suspenseful. what begins as one man's doubts against 11 other men's desire to leave the courthouse as fast as possible, ends with a powerful message of prejudices and class issues. the nice thing about this particular criminal case is that at first listen, it's hard to argue with what some of the men are saying. there's definitely a grey area to this particular case, and that proves to help the development of the suspense and third-act revelations. perhaps even more important than the simple theme of class issues is the idea of communication, and how far a little talking can take you. as henry fonda nicely put it ""we have a reasonable doubt, and that's something that's very valuable in our system. no jury can declare a man guilty unless it's sure."" all of these men were under difficult conditions, considering the small room and blistering heat, but all of them also needed to understand that communicating with each other was the only way they were going to get through the night. i loved the way lumet gracefully gave every one of the actor's their time to shine. although fonda was the clear star, and likely had the most lines, here, every single one of them brought their a-game. the film also points out how easy it is to involve your own personal prejudices into cases like this. perhaps even to some viewers it may be hard to against the grain of 11 other ""angry men"" and vote not guilty, but sometimes it takes more than just sitting around and waiting for someone else to step up. sometimes you have to be the one to point out the questionable things in whatever job field or discussion you are in. communication can be a difficult thing, but if you're willing to listen to others share their opinion, you should be willing to talk as well. but i do know one thing that can't be disputed, the greatness that is sidney lumet's 12 angry men. 93/100";5 September 2016;9;['good', 'angry', 'few', 'great', 'important', 'influential', 'watchable', 'new', 'easy', 'small', 'favorite', 'large', 'suspenseful', 'particular', 'angry', 'prototypical', 'suspenseful', 'other', 'possible', 'powerful', 'nice', 'particular', 'criminal', 'first', 'hard', 'grey', 'particular', 'third', 'important', 'simple', 'little', 'reasonable', 'valuable', 'guilty', 'sure', 'difficult', 'small', 'other', 'only', 'clear', 'most', 'single', 'easy', 'own', 'personal', 'hard', 'other', 'angry', 'guilty', 'more', 'questionable', 'difficult', 'willing', 'willing', 'angry'];0.0333343943638061

55;secondtake;"12 angry men (1957) what makes a movie shot almost entirely in a single room so compelling? it isn't the built-in civics lesson, even though it does make you glad for the jury system. even more than the apparent plot about twelve men and their deliberations about a crime, there is a plot about human nature. the men are all etched just enough to become types--not stereotypes in a bad sense, miraculously, but kinds of people we recognize. and with amazing economy, the strengths and flaws of those kinds of people, simplified too much for reality but compressed just perfectly for the movies, become the guts of this play of passion. it doesn't hurt that the editing is supremely crisp, the continuity is spot-on, and the casting is brilliant, if color-blind (see below). it also doesn't hurt one bit that the cinematography by boris kaufman (see on the waterfront), is that really clear, dramatic black and white photography of post-noir 1950s. it's beautiful and startling, showing at times the interactions of the group in the room as a whole in a kind of walking ballet, and at other times close-ups of hot faces straining to come to terms with the other eleven people in the room. in other words, this is a technically virtuosic ensemble piece, cast and crew, top to bottom. as viewers, it is this coming to understand people that makes us part of the scenario. we might see ourselves or our friends in these people, but even if they are strangers, if they seem a full half-century away from our own types, they are still people we are curious about. sitting on a jury, being locked together in a room, and having to decide about the execution of the accused, all of this makes you grapple with personalities and motives quickly. there is not getting around deciding--both on the verdict, of course, but also on what kind of men are in the room. why are they voting one way or the other? what makes them stubborn, or wise, or clever? or funny, annoying, selfish? the all white male jury is potentially a problem. it should have been a problem back then, when planning the movie, and it becomes one now because the movie represents history, whether or not it likes it. after the civil war (by amending the constitution, and with a civil rights act in 1875) it was illegal to exclude blacks from juries, and this was tested in court many times (often in the south). new york city could easily end up with an all white jury (and downtown manhattan it isn't unlikely) but it is surely conspicuous for a movie trying to represent the sweep of humanity in a single room. likewise with women, who by the 1930s were regularly part of new york city juries. in the 1950s, white men might have been more clearly enrolled on the lists used to select jurors (such as voting lists), so again, an all-male white jury isn't so unlikely, just conspicuous. having said all that, i think the movie works partly because on some simple level, the jurors are all the same! to have made them more clearly diverse would have changed the way we saw them get to know each other. having one guy be from a ""slum"" and know about knives is revealed slowly, and we can't really outwardly distinguish that man from any other. even the one clear immigrant has assimilated. so 12 angry men isn't an accurate capsule or a documentary exercise, but a study in types and countertypes, reactions and resistance to action. director sidney lumet cut his teeth for a decade with early t.v. and when he ventured into movies (this was his first success) he did so with a visual reaction against the flatness and static cameras of much of that medium, back then especially. he and fonda worked together notably in fail-safe, another politically charged drama in black and white (and one where fonda is again trapped in a small room). and later, in dog day afternoon and serpico (both starring a young and amazing al pacino) he again uses a highly charged external problem to deal with psychological responses that are even more intense. i want to live long enough to see this movie in 2057, just to see if it holds water once that period is looking quaint and distant (the way 1909 does to us from here). already, as much as this is a fabulous, inspiring, vivid movie, it is also showing its seams, its contrivance, and its agenda too clearly. for now it's a concise dramatic masterpiece.";26 September 2009;9;['angry', 'single', 'compelling', 'glad', 'more', 'apparent', 'human', 'bad', 'amazing', 'much', 'crisp', 'brilliant', 'blind', 'clear', 'dramatic', 'black', 'white', 'post', 'noir', 'beautiful', 'startling', 'other', 'close', 'hot', 'other', 'other', 'virtuosic', 'ensemble', 'top', 'full', 'half', 'own', 'curious', 'other', 'stubborn', 'wise', 'clever', 'funny', 'annoying', 'selfish', 'white', 'male', 'civil', 'civil', 'illegal', 'many', 'white', 'unlikely', 'conspicuous', 'single', 'white', 'such', 'male', 'white', 'unlikely', 'conspicuous', 'simple', 'same', 'diverse', 'other', 'other', 'clear', 'angry', 'accurate', 'early', 'first', 'visual', 'static', 'much', 'safe', 'black', 'white', 'small', 'young', 'amazing', 'external', 'psychological', 'intense', 'distant', 'fabulous', 'inspiring', 'vivid', 'concise', 'dramatic'];0.0427062374245472

59;ironhorse_iv;"12 angry men is one of the best plays turn into movies films ever. 12 angry men was adapted from a teleplay of the same name by reginald rose by director sidney lumet. there is no music score, no action scenes, no sex appeal, but this movie is one of the best, due to two reasons: great writing, and great acting. one thing that i love about this movie is how little locations there are in this film. beside the opening scene, most of the film takes place in a room made up of 12 men jury as they deliberate the guilt or acquittal of a defendant on the basis of reasonable doubt. they must stay there, until they can be make a unanimous decision. to add to the pressure, the room goes from hot and humid to warm, and cold, making each character go through a chain full of emotions. the way, the film is filmed is amazing. it shot in a way that makes the room feel a bit claustrophobia. since there is a lack of locations, the character of the film had to be very interesting people, and they were. like the title says, 96 minutes of the movie is pure intense arguments between a group of men whose personalities ranges from quiet and good-hearted to outright anger and hate. none of the jury members have their real names mention, as most are refers to each other by a number given to them beforehand. when you think about it, nobody name was used in the film; the defendant is referred to as ""the boy"" and the witnesses as the ""old man"" and ""the lady across the street"". the film use anonymity as a way to make the film more a general representation of america. these are everyday people that could very well be on your jury. this sense of anonymity raises the stakes of the play as a social drama, in that is a more general commentary of our society. who were these men is still a mystery? we only get a glimpse of what they do in their real life. they soon become acquainted with the personalities of each other and want to vote. some of these men believe that the young teen killed his father in a fit of rage but only one juror, juror number 8 (henry fonda) is not certain beyond a reasonable doubt that the young boy did it and felt they should talk more about it. the jury soon came head to head with clashing of arguments and questioning of the evidence. without spoiling too much about it, i have to say the heated discussion of evidences is the best part of the film as find out more about the true personalities of the jury members. all the actors did a great job. henry fonda does a great job as juror 8, as the lone man wanting to convince his peers to evaluate the matter beyond their initial, largely emotion-based judgments to determine what the kid really did do. he does this, by explaining the murder weapon and the faults of the two witnesses. still, i doubt, even in 1950's standards, a jury member can carry a knife in a jury room. ed begley as juror number 10 is chilling as the loudmouth racist whom based on the locality where the accused lived. lee cobb as juror #3 is painted as a father who allows his poor relationship with his own son to influence his judgment of the case gives one hell of a performance. last, worth noting is jack warden as number 7, a sport fan who cares more about a baseball game than the case that he is given. while the others jurors members, are interesting characters, none of them were as great as these 4 men who brings the best out of this play. throughout the play, we see two opposing views of justice which i love. the two-sided nature of justice create tension and contrast the characters. each character wants ""justice,"" but what justice becomes unclear and fluid throughout the course of the play. if i can find one fault in the film is how the movie makes henry fonda seem like the protagonist and everybody else the antagonist. we don't know if juror 8 is right and yet, his actions are framed as an act of bravery, standing up against the group to do what's right. in the end, of the film in a chilling reverse of roles, juror 3 is view as a stubborn man, refusing to come over to the side of reason. what's really interesting about the case within 12 angry men is that we never ultimately find out for sure whether the accused is guilty or innocent. it's up to question. people even today, still have open debate about if the boy did the crime or not. in modern terms, most likely the results would happen, is a mistrial assuming, of course, that applicable law permitted the content of jury deliberations to be revealed. it's one of the few movies that make you think. the film should be view by anybody going to law, but not only that, but regular people in general. yes, the film is a bit outdated, and younger people might not want to see a black and white film with old men yelling at each other, but i think once they mature enough, they would find this movie great as well. if not, this movie. they can watch the 1997's remake of 12 angry men. that version is also pretty well done. there is a lot of things that people can learn from this film, like issuing dealing with class, racism, family relationships, psychology and communications. it's really hard to hate this film. the more years pass by, the more praise it gets.";19 November 2013;9;['angry', 'good', 'angry', 'same', 'good', 'due', 'great', 'great', 'little', 'most', 'reasonable', 'unanimous', 'hot', 'humid', 'cold', 'full', 'amazing', 'interesting', 'pure', 'intense', 'quiet', 'hearted', 'outright', 'real', 'most', 'other', 'old', 'more', 'general', 'everyday', 'social', 'general', 'real', 'acquainted', 'other', 'young', 'certain', 'reasonable', 'young', 'more', 'heated', 'good', 'more', 'true', 'great', 'great', 'lone', 'initial', 'chilling', 'poor', 'own', 'last', 'worth', 'interesting', 'great', 'good', 'sided', 'unclear', 'fluid', 'right', 'right', 'chilling', 'stubborn', 'interesting', 'angry', 'sure', 'guilty', 'innocent', 'open', 'modern', 'mistrial', 'applicable', 'few', 'regular', 'general', 'outdated', 'young', 'black', 'white', 'old', 'other', 'great', 'angry', 'hard', 'more', 'more'];0.1792808219178082

66;didi-5;this is the famous courtroom drama starring henry fonda, martin balsam and lee j cobb which takes place largely in the jury room where the twelve men are discussing the likelihood of the young outsider having killed his father. of the dozen passing judgement, only fonda has initial doubts, acting as the voice of conscience and coercion to change the minds of his fellow jurors. the film is rightly famous for its tight structure, economical script, and claustrophobic acting. perhaps cobb's character is too extreme and more than a bit cliched, but the types present around the table are well-drawn and convincing. prejudices tumble out and coincidences jostle to turn the initial premise completely on its head. it is significant that on this hot day there are such a group of hotheads confined in one place. a remake forty years later was of some interest but this is the superior piece of the two. a gripping play, done with economy.;7 June 2004;6;['famous', 'young', 'initial', 'fellow', 'famous', 'tight', 'economical', 'claustrophobic', 'extreme', 'more', 'cliched', 'present', 'convincing', 'initial', 'significant', 'hot', 'superior', 'gripping'];0.1982142857142857

69;TheMovieDiorama;released in 1957, this is about a group of jurors deciding the fate of a young boy who is accused of murder. one man believes he is not guilty and attempts to convince the rest of the jurors of his innocence. this is, without a doubt, one of the best dramas ever created. nice short runtime, small cast, all filmed in one room...it's just so tight!! the beauty of it is that just from dialogue alone we are thoroughly entertained and it maintains a sense of tension throughout. the crime is never re-enacted, it's from the descriptive dialogue that we picture it in our heads. writer reginald rose knew that the most powerful tool in film (at that time) was words. the cast was high calibre, henry fonda leading the view of not guilty...it's pretty difficult to go against him when he is full of suaveness and so convincing. we get to know each juror as the film goes on and we soon start to explore the possibility that their personal lives are tainting their decision. that, was what made it so palpable. it was clouding their judgement, and their stubborn personalities made it all the more satisfying if they did change their mind. persuasion is a powerful tool, but add a hint of conviction and you can manipulate anyone's mind. several nice details were included, i like the fact it was set on the hottest day of the year. the heat evidently getting to the jurors, it made them more irritable and heightened the angry emotions within. director sidney lumet did so much in such a little space, technically. when the jurors enter the room, its a sublime long five minute shot and he manages to share the screen time with each juror equally. he was able to convey their personalities instantaneously just by their attire, then when the discussion commences we start to dig a little deeper. the screenplay really is the winner here, if anything it makes me want to work in law! dramas do not come better than this, 12 angry men easily gets the perfect rating. it sits in the inclusive list of masterpieces.;9 March 2018;10;['young', 'guilty', 'good', 'nice', 'short', 'small', 'tight', 'descriptive', 'powerful', 'high', 'guilty', 'difficult', 'full', 'convincing', 'personal', 'palpable', 'stubborn', 'satisfying', 'powerful', 'several', 'nice', 'hot', 'irritable', 'angry', 'little', 'sublime', 'long', 'able', 'little', 'deep', 'angry', 'perfect', 'inclusive'];0.0895153061224489

71;l_rawjalaurence;"based on the classic 1954 television drama of the same name, twelve angry man was director sidney lumet's first feature, after a career in television. it was also the first (and only) film that star henry fonda also produced, apparently he grew quite frustrated with the responsibilities associated with the role, even though he enjoyed the acting task. shot in only nineteen days after an intense rehearsal period, twelve angry men makes effective use of the confined space of the jury- room. lumet employs different types of shot to convey the increasing sense of tension, ranging from the close-up, the two-shot and the tracking shot as well as the basic shot/reverse shot sequence. through such strategies we focus on the jurors' faces as well as their reactions to one another. it's clear, for example, that juror #3 (lee j. cobb) cannot stand juror #8 (fonda); not only are they ideologically poles apart, but juror #3 cannot stand what might be described as the ""bleeding heart liberalism"" that prompts juror #8 to question whether the accused was guilty or not. juror #3's frustration is signaled as his face becomes more and more contorted and his voice rises into a high-pitched scream as he discovers that no one appears to listen to him. the shot/reverse shot strategy works most effectively in the confrontation between juror #4 (e. g. marshall) and juror #9 (joseph sweeney), where they discuss the effect of wearing glasses. we watch juror #4's air of self-confidence gradually evaporating from juror #9's point of view, until juror #4 is forced to alter his judgment. stylistically speaking, the film is divided into three movements. in the first, lumet shoots most of the action from an aerial perspective; this has the effect of belittling the characters, almost as if their discussions were unnecessary in light of the verdict. in the central section the characters are shot from eye level; hence we become more and more interested in their reactions to one another. in the final act lumet photographs them from below, with the camera looking up at the characters; as we see the ceiling of the jury-room behind them as they speak, we feel that the situation is becoming more and more claustrophobic as previously-held prejudices are broken down and the characters' true natures revealed. the film comes to a dramatic climax - which is not in the 1954 version - as we understand why juror #3 has been behaving in such extreme fashion. the reason has little or nothing to do with the case in hand, and everything to do with juror #3's familial struggles. in light of his collapse, fonda's long speeches (delivered slightly earlier on) about the importance of fairness and tolerance appear even more pertinent. even after nearly sixty years, twelve angry men still packs a punch, not only in its analysis of the american judicial system and its emphasis on being innocent until proved guilty, but also for its stylistic brilliance, as lumet shows just what can be done with a confined setting, a superb photographer and a brilliant art director (boris kaufman, robert markel).";25 March 2016;9;['classic', 'same', 'angry', 'first', 'first', 'frustrated', 'intense', 'angry', 'effective', 'different', 'basic', 'such', 'clear', 'guilty', 'first', 'lumet', 'most', 'aerial', 'unnecessary', 'central', 'interested', 'final', 'claustrophobic', 'true', 'dramatic', 'such', 'extreme', 'little', 'familial', 'long', 'pertinent', 'angry', 'american', 'judicial', 'innocent', 'guilty', 'stylistic', 'confined', 'brilliant'];-0.0259114583333333
72;Movie_Muse_Reviews;"96 minute film with all but 3 minutes taking place in the same room: that's daring. it's hard to believe, but director sidney lumet finds a way to make ""12 angry men"" move at an attention-holding pace while being hardly dull at all. now that's film-making. lumet's camera techniques and the phenomenal performances from the actors he captures makes ""12 angry men"" a terrifically interesting court drama that is so elemental but so profound. in the opening minutes, a 12-man jury breaks into deliberation over a case where a teenager has been charged with killing his father. if found unanimously guilty, the boy will be executed. after a preliminary vote, every man votes guilty except for one juror played by henry fonda, who is afraid of being too quick to reach a verdict. the story basically paints a picture of 12 strangers. if you follow closely, you can learn a lot about these people, but the point is that you learn a lot about them and what makes them tick as they argue and reason. the first thing achieving that requires is great acting. this film is loaded with classic actors of the 40s and 50s. it's hard to really single out one performance as the best, though certainly lee j. cobb as juror #3 is the most dramatic and he very much helps give the story an adrenaline boost when his character acts out. but the most excellent aspect of this film, what pushes it above a lot of other drama, is lumet's directing choices in what is his first feature film. filming in one room, it can be easy to put little thought into camera angles and movement, but lumet considers everything very carefully and no single shot in the film feels arbitrary. the camera moves with incredible purpose, zooming in at perfect speeds and picking angles that best reveal the characters. also, his attention to the idea of the heat in the room, the impatience, the confinement, all comes across in his directing. his angles start above the actors in the beginning and thus more impersonal, but the camera lowers more and more as the film goes on. you're so interested in the story at this point that you don't even notice, but you feel it. lumet makes you feel much like a 13th juror and you begin to form your own opinion, bouncing back and forth (that is if lumet and writer reginald rose did their job right, which they do.) the film is--and this really isn't a spoiler--without a climactic payoff for those that need a little something more or a resolution or mystery solved. you're supposed to find it satisfying in the way that it reveals a bit about who we are and how we arrive at the moral conclusions we make. you're supposed to learn so much about these characters that by the end you're shocked that you never even learned their names. the film is like a social experiment on screen and it's very realistic and yet still very interesting. it's an absolute marvel for being stationary, dialogue-heavy film. ~mmr visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com/";6 August 2008;10;['same', 'daring', 'hard', 'angry', 'dull', 'phenomenal', 'angry', 'interesting', 'elemental', 'profound', 'guilty', 'preliminary', 'guilty', 'afraid', 'quick', 'first', 'great', 'classic', 'hard', 'good', 'dramatic', 'excellent', 'other', 'lumet', 'first', 'easy', 'little', 'single', 'arbitrary', 'incredible', 'perfect', 'good', 'impersonal', 'more', 'interested', 'own', 'lumet', 'climactic', 'little', 'more', 'moral', 'much', 'shocked', 'social', 'realistic', 'interesting', 'absolute', 'stationary', 'heavy'];0.122172619047619

74;Anonymous_Maxine;it seems that the message of 12 angry men (above) comes across as the film's only weakness. it starts with the very close of a trial that we never see and convenes immediately into the jury room, where we spend the rest of the movie. it seems an open and shut case, and by a show of hands, there are 11 jury members convinced that the defendant is guilty, and a single man who believes not that he is not guilty just that there is a chance that he's not guilty. the film's weakness comes in because it seems that every single person who believes the kid is guilty ultimately reveals that they have some kind of personal vendetta and want to secure a conviction regardless of the sureness of the truth. the problem here is that people who believe in guilty are bad guys (and they rarely let you forget this, as one or two of them increasingly show off as brutish jerks, while the calm, endlessly likable henry fonda heads up the good guy side. maybe the movie should have been called 11 angry men instead. there is also a certain level of ham-handedness involved in the initial presentation of how little the case means to most of the jurors. the story is about how important such legal cases are, because the decision that they make in that room will change someone's life forever, and it is absolutely imperative that they make the right decision. but at the beginning, all of the jurors have their minds somewhere else. they're talking about sports or their jobs or some other casual subject, and it takes one brave juror to stand up to the rest and get them to pay attention and think about what they are about to do. sidney lumet, in his book making movies, gives us invaluable insight into his goals and experience making 12 angry men, including the positioning of the camera (watch for the appearance of the ceiling late in the film as the tension mounts) and his brilliant use of lighting. late in the movie, as the jurors remain in the room until darkness falls outside, it is so gradual and so cleverly done that we don't even realize the movie is getting darker and darker until they flip the lights on, and when they do, it's not just the room that is lighting up. the performances themselves have not aged well, but it is a brilliant analysis of some facts that seemed to so obviously point to one foregone conclusion, although i have to say that the film's other weakness is that a lot of the facts that they re-analyze (or analyze for the first time) should have been ridiculously obvious in the original courtroom trial. the jurors question for the first time, for example, the eyesight of the case's key eyewitness, who claims to have seen the murder take place at night and through the windows of a passing elevated train. i should hope that such a situation would have been scrutinized more closely by even the most inexperienced defense attorney, but maybe that person was secretly hoping for a conviction, too. at any rate, the film is a brilliant achievement, given that it is so engaging even though it literally never leaves the room. it reminds us of the importance of certainty in trials, even when the result seems completely obvious. the end of the movie is perfect, as there is only one way that it could really end (and i don't mean the jury's final decision), and yet it is not predictable. this is one of lumet's most glowing achievements.;26 April 2008;10;['angry', 'only', 'close', 'open', 'shut', 'guilty', 'single', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'single', 'guilty', 'personal', 'guilty', 'bad', 'brutish', 'likable', 'good', 'angry', 'certain', 'initial', 'little', 'most', 'important', 'such', 'legal', 'imperative', 'right', 'other', 'casual', 'brave', 'about', 'invaluable', 'angry', 'brilliant', 'gradual', 'dark', 'dark', 'brilliant', 'other', 'first', 'obvious', 'original', 'first', 'key', 'elevated', 'inexperienced', 'brilliant', 'obvious', 'perfect', 'final', 'predictable', 'glowing'];0.0417358803986711

76;freemantle_uk;12 angry men is one of those films with a high reputation, high in the imdb top 250 and a rare 100% rating on rotten tomatoes. i too think its a very good film. the premise for the film is very simply, a jury of 12 men much decide on whether an 18-year-old man is guilty of murdering his father. if they find him guilty then the defendant would be sent to the electric chair. the film is set in a small room, on one of the hottest days of the year in a new york court. the jury at first vote that the man is guilty, all but juror #8 (henry fonda). he believes there is enough reasonable doubt and it is up to convict them of that, looking at all the evidence, witness testimony and pretty much the whole trial. juror #8 is a righteous man who is trying to do the right thing, give the man the fair trial he deserves. he gains allies along the way and they are sympathetic characters, but they are rivals, especially the hostile juror #3 (franchot tone), who is convinced of the man's guilt. 12 angry men is based on a play by reginald rose, and it shows with excellent dialogue, a tight plot and great character development. it's writing at its best. the director sidney lumet, keeps the film within it play roots, keeping the film in a close, claustrophobic environment, like a real jury would be under. they are some wonderful shots and close ups, especially at the beginning when follow many different conversations in one continuous tracking shot for 5 minutes. lumet knew how to work the camera, use the script, keep the tension going and gets the best out of his actors. this is a strong debut from a legendary director. 12 angry men is also great example of an actor's film. you believe in these actor's performance and all of them are on the top of their game, matching each other. henry fonda said this is one of his favourite films. some of the characters are likable, some unlikeable, but all are real. the film also raises questions about legal ethic, the american legal system, the american constitution and is international in its message to any country that has trial by jury. it shows many different sectors of american society at the time.;1 September 2009;9;['angry', 'high', 'high', 'rare', 'rotten', 'good', 'much', 'old', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'electric', 'small', 'hot', 'first', 'guilty', 'enough', 'reasonable', 'whole', 'righteous', 'right', 'fair', 'sympathetic', 'hostile', 'angry', 'excellent', 'tight', 'great', 'good', 'close', 'claustrophobic', 'real', 'wonderful', 'close', 'many', 'different', 'continuous', 'good', 'strong', 'legendary', 'angry', 'great', 'other', 'favourite', 'likable', 'unlikeable', 'real', 'legal', 'american', 'legal', 'american', 'international', 'many', 'different', 'american'];0.1889399092970521
77;Polaris_DiB;"for a movie based mostly in the necessity for repetition and seeing both sides of the issue, it does not, like it would seem, make one tired of hearing the phrase ""beyond a reasonable doubt."" this is an issue of objectivity, the idea that has taken centuries of philosophers to finally understand doesn't exist in a subjective standpoint. i can say nothing about this film that isn't repeated, with full clarity, in the dialog under many different contexts. they hold a man's life in their hands, and in the process are going to learn a lot about what must go into the proof. to be a bit honest, and a little hesitant, i must say that a lot of it strikes me as pretty liberal. i think this film is strongest when it doesn't get into politics, so the constant repetition of the phrase ""bleeding heart"" kind of gets to me. however, it's something of a necessity, because one of the things that these characters have to overcome is personal politics and prejudice to figure out where exactly to take a stand and where to leave be. and as a product of its time, it's immensely profound. what i like most about it is that it is not a criticism of the american system, it's actually in full support of it. if it criticizes anything, it criticizes the people who take it aloofly and don't understand the power they hold when they operate within said system. responsibility is something i personally find quite lacking currently, and it's nice to see a movie expound the virtues of personal responsibility towards lawful conduct. this does not mean falling into hegemonic status quo, for that would mean the boy dies because nobody takes the time to question him. this means making sure you understand what you know and what you can't know. beyond the writing itself, the directing and the acting really shine. it must be appallingly difficult to shoot an entire movie in such a small space, but lumet does it superbly and the camera shows the audience exactly what it needs to know when it needs to know it. it's art to be beheld. also, all of the actors maintain their characters and the characters' mood swings amazingly, making it fluid and above all, very real. --polarisdib";3 April 2006;9;['tired', 'reasonable', 'subjective', 'full', 'many', 'different', 'honest', 'little', 'hesitant', 'liberal', 'strong', 'constant', 'personal', 'profound', 'most', 'american', 'full', 'nice', 'personal', 'lawful', 'hegemonic', 'sure', 'difficult', 'entire', 'small', 'beheld', 'fluid', 'real'];0.1295289855072464

room, as a group of twelve jurors {all male, mostly middle-aged and middle-class}, with vastly differing attitudes and prejudices, debate the innocence or guilt of a young hispanic man charged with the premeditated stabbing murder of his father. prior to 1957, director sidney lumet had already acquired some experience in television, though it wasn't until he released his first feature film, a low-budget offering shot in only 17 days, that he began to attract the attention of critics. though '12 angry men' was commercially unsuccessful {in an age of lavish, technicolour adventures, david lean's magnificent 'the bridge on the river kwai (1957)' was more to the taste of audiences of the day}, the film received three oscar nominations, for best writing, best director and best picture. of course, it was lean's epic that won each of these categories, among numerous others. lumet's film, adapted by reginald rose from his own 1954 studio one teleplay, explores the fairness and infallibility of the american judicial system, and the ways by which personal prejudice may affect the outcome of a criminal case. though the film opens at the conclusion of the hearing, as the apparently-bored judge (rudy bond) offers his final instructions to the jury members, the events of the trial are later recreated through dialogue, without ever resorting to cumbersome flashbacks or heavy-handed narration. what ultimately makes '12 angry men' such an electrifying viewing experience are the incredible performances of the twelve main actors, each player delivering a distinct, perfectly-pitched characterisation that contributes richly towards their jury's deliberations on the court-case. central to the story, of course, is juror #8 (henry fonda), the lone dissenting member, whose unwillingness to send a conceivably-innocent man to the electric chair forces the other jurors to reconsider their stance on what had initially seemed an ""open-and-shut case."" fonda, who also co-produced the film, gives a sincere and righteous performance, his actions assuredly heroic, despite the very real possibility that he has helped a guilty criminal escape from justice. the remaining players (in clock-wise order around the juror's table: martin balsam, john fiedler, lee j. cobb, e.g. marshall, jack klugman, ed binns, jack warden, joseph sweeney, ed begley, george voskovec and robert webber) each contribute with faultless performances, though some play a more significant role in the proceedings than do others. it would be plain naive to label any one of the twelve jurors a ""villain,"" but the man who clashes most frequently with the fonda's well-meaning dissenter is juror #3 (lee j. cobb), a loud-mouthed and temperamental bully, whose failed relationship with his own adult son has given him an overwhelming prejudice towards young people. rather than deciding the murder trial based on the evidence, juror #3 subconsciously relies on his own tremendous bias to settle the eventual fate of the accused man. equally bigoted is juror #10 (ed begley), whose astonishing partiality is fully revealed in his final manic tirade against lower-class citizens. in one of the film's most brutally powerful sequences, the remaining jurors callously rise from their tables in response to juror #10's deplorable outburst, his confidence shattering as he realises that he is alone in his narrow-minded views. also interesting is jack warden's juror #7, an impatient salesman, whose complete indifference to the fate of the accused prompts him to alter his vote in favour of the majority. despite working in an extremely confined space, lumet certainly makes the most of his minimalist setting, and cinematographer boris kaufman {who also worked on 'on the waterfront (1954)'} employed lenses with gradually-increasing focal lengths to make it seem as though the walls were closing in on the characters, heightening the ever-present sense of claustrophobia. lumet is a master of creating mood, as he also demonstrated in his finest film, 'fail-safe (1964),' and there's a certain, illogical urgency in the jurors' proceedings, as though fonda's character is continually fighting a losing battle. though some of events of the jury room would technically not be allowed {juror #8's extra investigations purchasing the knife, pacing the old witness' journey to the door would undoubtedly have resulted in a mistrial}, the discussions in the film work merely to prove a single, all-too-significant moral: according to the constitution, the accused can only be convicted if there exists no reasonable doubt of his guilt. ultimately, whether he actually committed the murder or not is almost beside the point, particularly when the life of a potentially-innocent man is hanging in the balance.";1 January 2008;10;['classic', 'bare', 'extravagant', 'sweeping', 'lavish', 'visual', 'epic', 'pure', 'sole', 'thorough', 'bare', 'angry', 'arresting', 'veritable',

89;estebangonzalez10;it's always difficult to keep personal prejudice out of a thing like this. and wherever you run into it, prejudice always obscures the truth. i don't really know what the truth is. 12 angry men is one of the best courtroom dramas i've seen despite the fact of it being filmed way back in 1957 in black and white and happening almost entirely (except for the opening 3 minutes and a few seconds in the end) inside an enclosed room. so why is this so good? because reginald rose came up with an excellent story, which he wrote as a play first and was later turned into a movie under the direction of the great sidney lumet. this was actually lumet's first feature film and among his best movies all time, although it wasn't received really well when it first came out. this film paved the way for sidney who in the 70's made one great film after another (serpico, dog day afternoon, and network). 12 angry men works thanks to the strong characters that are introduced in the story starring henry fonda and lee j. cobb. in order for a film in an enclosed room to work you need a very engaging story with interesting characters and that is what rose was able to do. many great plays have failed to perform well in film, so credit has to be given to sidney who managed to maintain the tension and suspense in the movie. as the film moves on the enclosed room seems to be closing in on each character, and this was achieved really well by sidney. the dialogue in this film is really powerful and authentic as we see how each character interacts with one another. sidney manages to let the action play out through words because the entire film is one giant deliberation between these 12 men. the film opens in a courtroom where we hear the judge say his final words before sending the 12 men in the jury to deliberate over whether the accused young spanish american is guilty or not of murdering his father. he reminds the jury that if they find the teenager to be guilty then he will be sentenced to death. the 12 men enter the jury room where the rest of the film takes place as they deliberate whether or not the kid is guilty. everyone seems to have made their mind up and believe he's guilty even before beginning to debate the issue. the first thing they do is vote and 11 of the 12 men believe he's guilty pointing to the clear evidence, but juror #8 (henry fonda) claims to have his doubts. he isn't sure the guy is innocent, but he has reasonable doubts so he asks the rest of the jurors to deliberate about it for the next hour considering that the young man's life is in their hands. once the jurors begin to debate the issue the more difficult the case becomes and doubts begin to creep in all over the place. the rest of the jury is played by martin balsam (#1), john fiedler (#3), lee j. cobb (#4), e.g. marshall (#4), jack klugman (#5), edward binns (#6), jack warden (#7), joseph sweeney (#9), ed begley (#10), george voskovec (#11), and robert webber (#12). the debate escalates as tension builds and the jurors begin to grow impatient over one another's arguments. the small room and the heat also seem to play an important factor in the story. one of the greatest things about the film is that it actually serves as a case study as how small groups work and how important communication can be in these scenarios. many of the jurors entered the room with prejudice and had their own conceived ideas, but sometimes in order to find the truth you have to discuss the issue as objectively as possible. as the men debate we see how all of this plays out, and reginald rose writes the story in such a way that it begins to unfold through the conversations these men are having about their own views. there is no mention of names (except for the final scene where we hear the name of two of the jurors), but we do find out a lot about each character through the way they think and act. their personalities are very different and that always makes it hard to have everyone agree with each other. this is why the film is used in so many business and communication schools today. these characters are well crafted and we might even have come across a couple of these jurors in real life because their personalities and views are still very much alive in the 21st century. overall i believe this to be a great film and a must watch for all cinema lovers. it is really well executed and one has to admire the talents of sidney lumet and henry fonda who have left us with their rich legacy. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com;27 June 2012;10;['difficult', 'personal', 'angry', 'good', 'black', 'white', 'few', 'good', 'excellent', 'great', 'first', 'good', 'great', 'angry', 'strong', 'engaging', 'interesting', 'able', 'many', 'great', 'powerful', 'authentic', 'entire', 'giant', 'final', 'young', 'spanish', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'first', 'guilty', 'clear', 'sure', 'innocent', 'reasonable', 'next', 'young', 'difficult', 'impatient', 'small', 'important', 'great', 'small', 'important', 'many', 'own', 'conceived', 'possible', 'own', 'final', 'different', 'hard', 'other', 'many', 'real', 'alive', 'great', 'rich'];0.1685344827586207
90;jimbo-53-186511;a teenage boy is on trial accused of murdering his father. at the end of his trial, the 12 members of the jury (lead by foreman martin balsam) retire to the jury room to reach their verdict. it initially seems like an open and shut case, but when eleven out of the twelve jurors reach a verdict of guilty with only juror number eight (henry fonda) reaching a 'not guilty' verdict, juror number eight takes it upon himself to try to convince the other jurors that the case against the teenager may not be quite as open and shut as it seems. on the surface, 12 angry men seems to focus on whether the teenage boy is guilty of said crime. however, if you scratch beneath the surface this film isn't really about whether the teenager did or did not commit the crime, but rather it focuses on the notion of making sure that he gets a fair trial. henry fonda as juror number 8 is the initial dissenting juror, but if you observe closely he never actually says that the boy is guilty or innocent, but merely offers reasonable doubt to counter any arguments or objections that are raised by the other jurors. of course, predictably one by one the 'guilty verdict' jurors start to come round, but despite this the film is still involving because it's interesting to see how fonda will convince everyone - clearly some men are more difficult to persuade than others, but i just found how fonda achieved this to be fascinating and ingenious. one could perhaps argue that it may be a bit contrived that a juror with no legal experience could convince his fellow jurors of a seemingly guilty mans innocence, but i think to criticise this film for doing that would be missing the point. i think the point here was to try to remind us that just because we're told that something is true or that we want to believe that it's true it doesn't necessarily mean that it is true. reasonable doubt was clearly the pivotal factor in this film. i'm all for a good character study, but here we actually have 12 character studies. despite its meagre running time, 12 angry men does enough to develop each character sufficiently. all 12 men are from different walks of life - some of submissive, some are loud, some are aggressive, some are leaders - it all just felt so real and gritty and i must admit that i was immersed in almost every aspect of this impressive drama. i really don't think there's much more that i can say other than i'm glad that i watched this film and also that i found it to be a tense, involving and thoroughly enjoyable 90 minutes.;9 June 2015;8;['teenage', 'open', 'shut', 'guilty', 'only', 'guilty', 'other', 'open', 'angry', 'teenage', 'guilty', 'said', 'sure', 'fair', 'initial', 'guilty', 'innocent', 'reasonable', 'other', 'guilty', 'interesting', 'difficult', 'fascinating', 'ingenious', 'legal', 'fellow', 'guilty', 'true', 'true', 'true', 'reasonable', 'pivotal', 'good', 'angry', 'different', 'submissive', 'loud', 'aggressive', 'real', 'gritty', 'impressive', 'more', 'other', 'glad', 'tense', 'enjoyable'];0.0910416666666666
91;barnabyrudge;"12 angry men is one of the movies which doesn't particularly divide audiences: virtually everyone agrees that this is a masterpiece. what is amazing is that the film is set wholly in one location, yet for its entire duration it maintains suspense, interest and topicality. not a line is wasted, not a character is underdeveloped and not a single minute is surplus to requirement. twelve jury members retire to a jury room to debate the innocence or guilt of a young kid accused of murdering his father. eleven of the men are ready to return an instant guilty verdict. the one thorn-in-their-side is henry fonda, who isn't totally compelled by the evidence he has heard and who wants to debate the case a little more. slowly but surely, he raises points and possibilities which get the other eleven men considering whether or not the murder is really such a straightforward open-and-shut case. sidney lumet directs the film with claustrophobic brilliance. the sweltering hot weather adds to the mens' frustrations and leads to some vociferous and provocative confrontations. fonda is excellent as the liberal jury member who dares to invite ridicule for his seemingly untenable opinion, but he is upstaged by the extraordinary performance of lee j. cobb as the most aggressive and sharp-tongued of his rivals. there are superb performances also from jack warden as a juror who isn't especially bothered about the verdict as long as he can get to the baseball match on time; john fiedler as a softly-spoken juror whose opinions often go unnoticed; martin balsam as the self-appointed spokesman; and robert webber as a rather self-conscious ad executive. indeed every juror is played to perfection, and in some ways it is unfair to single out one above the rest. the script by reginald rose is pure genius. the whole story is told via talk - there's no direct action and no fancy flashbacks - yet it is enthralling from first minute to last. see 12 angry men. this is what film as a serious medium is all about!!!";13 January 2004;10;['angry', 'amazing', 'entire', 'underdeveloped', 'single', 'young', 'ready', 'instant', 'guilty', 'little', 'more', 'other', 'straightforward', 'shut', 'claustrophobic', 'hot', 'vociferous', 'provocative', 'excellent', 'liberal', 'untenable', 'extraordinary', 'aggressive', 'superb', 'unnoticed', 'conscious', 'unfair', 'pure', 'whole', 'direct', 'fancy', 'first', 'angry', 'serious'];0.0598214285714285

93;EUyeshima;"with the recent deaths of jack warden (just this past week) and john fiedler, only jack klugman survives from the original 1957 movie cast of this blistering, uncommonly well acted drama, a triumphant first feature for now-revered director sidney lumet. written by veteran tv scribe reginald rose, the story takes place almost entirely within the confines of a manhattan jury room. already overheated by the scorching weather, the twelve men are locked in heated debate over the fate of a ghetto youth accused of murdering his father. over the course of ninety minutes, we get to know the individual personalities of the jurors in ways that surprise even themselves in a most claustrophobic setting. the chief battle occurs between juror #8, who believes a comprehensive discussion of the evidence is necessary before coming to a verdict, and juror #3, who is convinced it is an open-and-shut case. the drama unfolds as the others move from one side to the other, as questions of objectivity and neutrality are put to the test with each character. it certainly helps to have a sterling cast of familiar faces inhabit the roles of the nameless jurors. henry fonda plays juror #8 with his becalming dignity constantly stretched by the ongoing pressure of a fast verdict. never the most subtle of actors, lee j. cobb is a blustery force as juror #3 as he slowly reveals his own personal issues leading to his seemingly intractable guilty verdict. e.g. marshall plays the cold-blooded elitist stockbroker, while edward binns is the inarticulate house painter intent on maintaining a sense of fair play in the room. warden is a small-time hustler only interested in making the baseball game, fiedler (later memorable as the meek mr. peterson on ""the bob newhart show"") is the eager bank teller who demands to be heard, martin balsam is the overly accommodating foreman uncomfortable in his role as the foreman and robert webber is the glad-hand pre-yuppie willing to go with the crowd. the most vivid impressions are left by ed begley's unapologetic racist, george voskovec's dignified watch maker, joseph sweeney's seemingly befuddled senior; and klugman's shy juror who more than anyone else, comes to empathize with the accused. the film's one slight flaw is that it tips its hand at the outset with the tone of passivity emanating from the judge and the wide-eyed fear in the accused's face. the black-and-white film comes in a clean print on the 2001 dvd but little else except the original theatrical trailer. a masterful work of economy and escalating dramatic tension.";1 August 2006;9;['recent', 'past', 'original', 'triumphant', 'first', 'heated', 'ghetto', 'individual', 'claustrophobic', 'chief', 'comprehensive', 'necessary', 'open', 'shut', 'other', 'sterling', 'familiar', 'ongoing', 'fast', 'subtle', 'blustery', 'own', 'personal', 'intractable', 'guilty', 'cold', 'blooded', 'elitist', 'inarticulate', 'fair', 'small', 'interested', 'memorable', 'eager', 'uncomfortable', 'glad', 'pre', 'willing', 'vivid', 'unapologetic', 'dignified', 'senior', 'shy', 'slight', 'wide', 'eyed', 'black', 'white', 'clean', 'little', 'original', 'theatrical', 'masterful', 'dramatic'];0.0251157407407407
94;JoeKarlosi;"for viewers out there who don't like ""old movies"" or ""black and white,"" please give this gem a try. i think you'll find it completely engrossing. it's a masterful piece of work, expertly directed by sidney lumet and contains no sex, explosions or special effects, not even a single female (it's still worth it!). flawlessly acted by fine performers: henry fonda, lee j. cobb, e.g. marshall, ed begley, jack warden, martin balsam, jack klugman, etc. the simple setup involves only 12 jurors in a little juror's room, nothing else. it's the power of the story and the interaction between the varied personalities of these men that keeps you riveted. it's why less can be more when it's done well. spoilers ahead: it's perfect symmetry the way these men each have a personality all his own: the liberal, the bigot, the wise man, the jerk, the haunted man, the immigrant, the hard worker, the know-it-all, etc.... during the course of this film we get to know them all, maybe can identify with one or two. there's an air of political correctness which tends to favor the liberal side, painting the ""guilty"" voters as racists, loudmouthes with personal agendas, or ignorant sports fans. it's because of this (and more objections) that i'm hesitant to award the movie a complete 4-star rating. it's a ""great"" film, but i just cannot call it ""excellent"" when i can't seem to side with fonda's noble cause. from the moment we see fonda (juror 8) in angelic white, he's a ""do-gooder"". he ""says"" that he does not really know if the young defendant is innocent of killing his father, but his facial expressions and sighs of relief tell me he had his mind made up to free this boy all along. fonda even goes out of his way to buy a knife - breaking the law in doing so - just to plead innocence for the kid. he constantly asks jurors: ""isn't this possible?"" but the same could be asked by other jurors and their ideas. our justice system is a scary mess. because i believe any murder case can have ""reasonable doubts"" raised in them, if someone wants them to. so no witnesses are ever to be considered reliable? luckily for the kid here, one of the jurors wearing glasses scratched his nose, so there's an instant case for ""reasonable doubt"" because a juror recalls that a female witness also rubbed her nose (maybe she wore glasses). there is a lonely old juror who observes that an elderly witness seemed lonely and ashamed. so this juror ""relates"" to him and decides that the old witness may have wanted to ""appear important"" and so maybe his testimony was unreliable! a truly guilty man could get released by this! whenever fonda wants something to fit his agenda for ""not guilty,"" he believes the old witness' every word; when it won't help his cause, he dismisses his feeble testimony! there's a crude re-enactment where fonda hobbles around to determine if the old witness was able to get to his door in 15 seconds as he testified - it actually takes 41 seconds - but is this as conclusive as fonda claims? maybe the man was mistaken when he said ""15 seconds""; maybe the man said ""50"" . fonda doesn't care; this is one of those times he'll trust the man's testimony if it proves his agenda! he sure works awful hard to ignore anything the other jurors suggest. the boy claims he was at the movies when the murder was committed, yet one hour later cannot recall anything about the films he watched. how does fonda chip away at this evidence? he tests juror e. g. marshall by asking him if he recalls what he did last night. when marshall easily replies, fonda goes back to the night before. marshall still doesn't miss a beat, so fonda goes back a couple more days (why doesn't he just go back three years?) until he's back to a week. naturally, marshall eventually can no longer remember, so a ""point"" is supposedly made (um, not really). is fonda correct that some of his points are feasible? yes - but so are the others'. ""juror 8"" won't give up until the kid's life is spared, it seems. even when the ""guilty"" voters suggest to ""have a hung jury,"" fonda will not accept. it's not good enough for him. here's the key to me that fonda's not interested in a ""fair verdict"": jack warden votes ""not guilty"" with all the others, just because he doesn't care and wants to get out. if fonda was so self-righteous, he should have gracefully said: ""11 of us have now voted 'not guilty'. but i cannot accept the 12th vote, as this man is only voting for whatever verdict will let him get out of here"". but fonda will take it -- the boy's free, even if he had to get one ""fake"" vote to achieve it. we have to give the benefit of the doubt. i don't want an innocent man executed. but nor do i want guilty predators freed because a witness ""had lines on her nose,"" or ""maybe that witness lied to feel important."" when fonda says ""this isn't a game!"", it seems to me the jury system is a game - who can think of a twist the fastest, who has the best lawyer. i think fonda plays a ""game"" very well and won - even if society lost. because when he marches out of court at the end, thinking he's a hero, i can't help thinking he let a killer fall through the cracks to satisfy his own conscience. still, i wish i could side with him. i think this is a more fulfilling film for those who do, and i believe we're supposed to. either way, this is a very powerful piece of cinema. that's the main thing. ***1/2 out of ****";29 September 2004;9;['old', 'black', 'white', 'masterful', 'special', 'single', 'worth', 'fine', 'simple', 'little', 'varied', 'less', 'more', 'perfect', 'own', 'liberal', 'wise', 'haunted', 'hard', 'political', 'liberal', 'guilty', 'personal', 'ignorant', 'more', 'hesitant', 'complete', 'great', 'excellent', 'noble', 'angelic', 'young', 'innocent', 'facial', 'possible', 'same', 'other', 'scary', 'reasonable', 'reliable', 'instant', 'reasonable', 'female', 'lonely', 'old', 'elderly', 'lonely', 'ashamed', 'old', 'important', 'unreliable', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'old', 'feeble', 'crude', 'old', 'able', 'conclusive', 'mistaken', 'awful', 'other', 'last', 'more', 'correct', 'feasible', 'guilty', 'hung', 'good', 'interested', 'fair', 'guilty', 'righteous', 'guilty', 'free', 'fake', 'innocent', 'guilty', 'important', 'fast', 'good', 'own', 'powerful', 'main'];0.114276830135039
95;slokes;"a courtroom drama which spends about a minute inside an actual courtroom, ""12 angry men"" defies expectations in other ways, too, most particularly by not being a star vehicle despite starring henry fonda. it's a bit of a trojan horse, too; screenwriter reginald rose making his case against the death penalty by showing a kid who appears guilty of having stabbed his father in a moment of rage and encouraging us to root for jury nullification, a la oj, because he shouldn't have to die for his crime. if the charge wasn't first-degree murder and execution not concomitant with a guilty verdict, we might see the pesky mr. davis (fonda) and his tireless ""supposing"" not much differently than does angry juror #3 (lee j. cobb). ""it's now your duty to sit down and try and separate the facts from the fancy,"" a supremely bored judge tells the jury at the start of the movie. but a lot of ""fancy"" gets tossed around in the jury room, not just ethnic slurs from juror #10 (ed begley) and baseball chatter from juror #7 (jack warden), two solid early votes for conviction. much of the fancy comes from davis himself, who asks the other jurors to accept an odd set of coincidences and aspersions in order to ignore the stubborn fact that someone walked into a man's apartment and stabbed him to death with the same kind of switchblade that had belonged to his angry son. ""this kid's been kicked around all his life,"" davis says. ""he's had a pretty miserable 18 years. i think we owe him a few words."" does anyone really believe this should work? well, in ""12 angry men"" it does, aided by rose's clever manipulation, sidney lumet's seamless but unshowy directing, and a performance by fonda that demonstrates his egoless mastery of the screen acting craft at its near-height. the supporting cast is great, too, even the underdiscussed ones like ed binns' salt-of-the-earth painter #6 and robert webber's marketing whizkid #12, who apparently invents rice krispies before our very eyes. the script does have its weak moments, none worse than when #10 goes off on his unfortunate diatribe regarding ""them"", in which all but two of his fellows leave their seats and symbolically turn away from him. a richard thomas stage production i saw handled this awkward business more cleverly. the music is a collection of ugly off-notes, and much of the background chatter is unconvincing. ""12 angry men"" does have terrific setwork and piercing character moments, like how stuffy stockbroker #4 (e.g. marshall) sniffily ignores #3's attempt to hand him a business card. cobb as #3 is stuck with the most over-the-top moments, but sells them well. cobb could yell with the best of them, and proves it here. but ""12 angry men"", while a good movie, is not great film, pushing a dubious rooting interest for a killer's freedom. maybe he doesn't deserve to die, but ""12 angry men"" stacks the deck too much in his favor to be called high art.";21 July 2008;7;['actual', 'angry', 'other', 'guilty', 'first', 'concomitant', 'guilty', 'pesky', 'angry', 'bored', 'fancy', 'ethnic', 'solid', 'early', 'much', 'other', 'odd', 'stubborn', 'same', 'angry', 'miserable', 'few', 'angry', 'clever', 'unshowy', 'near', 'great', 'underdiscussed', 'very', 'weak', 'bad', 'unfortunate', 'awkward', 'ugly', 'much', 'unconvincing', 'angry', 'terrific', 'stuffy', 'good', 'angry', 'good', 'great', 'dubious', 'angry', 'high'];-0.1655147058823529

98;MarieGabrielle;"having watched this film again last evening for at least the twentieth time, it struck me how this film has so much to it that is real and important, each character reflecting an attitude of society. racism, intolerance, rage, hatred, class distinctions, family discord. it is remarkable that each trait and character is so clearly developed and reflected on film. a newer version has been made for hbo which includes women, not sure what the jury selection criteria was in 1957 but apparently women were not considered for jury duty as often. henry fonda is of course the standout as fair-minded and intellectual architect, a reflective man who sees the flaws in the judicial system and wants the case to be considered on its own merits. jack warden as the selfish yet humorous baseball fan irritated that he is missing his yankee game. robert webber as the man in the gray flannel suit, not wanting to make waves. ed binns as a working man who at first needs convincing by fonda. ed begley as a hateful racist who could care less whether a man is executed unjustly for a crime he didn't commit. lee j. cobb, as a man alienated from his own son after beating him, who takes out his rage on the accused. jack klugman as a man who grew up in ""slums"", as they were then called, and has compassion for those who survived it. e.g. marshall, an analytical yet sheltered man who comes to see his own veiled prejudices have caused him to vilify the culprit. the young boy accused of stabbing his father was supposedly seen by several eyewitnesses, but their testimony is then questioned. the entire film is twelve men in a heated and uncomfortable sequestered jury, and their thoughts and reactions to the case. this film should be watched thoroughly to appreciate it: for instance when e.g. marshall, who seems to be a fair and intellectual man suddenly realizes that yes, the witness which may send a young man to his death may have been mistaken. do not miss, the remake has no such stellar performances. 10/10.";22 July 2010;10;['last', 'least', 'twentieth', 'much', 'real', 'important', 'remarkable', 'new', 'sure', 'fair', 'minded', 'intellectual', 'reflective', 'judicial', 'own', 'selfish', 'humorous', 'irritated', 'gray', 'first', 'hateful', 'own', 'analytical', 'own', 'veiled', 'young', 'several', 'entire', 'heated', 'uncomfortable', 'fair', 'intellectual', 'young', 'such', 'stellar'];0.2472332015810276

101;Steffi_P;"the 50s are known as the age of the big picture the epics and the uber-budget monstrosities. but it was also the era when the indy film came of age, and every now and then a mini-budget wonder peeped through between the tall trees of the major studios. and 12 angry men is quite literally a small picture, taking place almost exclusively on the one set. it's unusual that a production that is so minimalist in terms of locations is derived not from the stage (as was, say, rope) but from an earlier television edition testament to the growing influence of tv at that time. this is the cinematic debut of director sidney lumet, who has something of a flair for these claustrophobic little dramas (he also did the job on murder on the orient express and dog day afternoon). already you can see him thinking about how to turn the one space into several different kinds of space. we begin rather objectively, with the camera holding back unmoving in a far corner as the jurors potter about. we then gradually close in, the shots becoming more personal. crucially, the camera now often follows actors around as they move (especially the restless ed begley) to get that more aggravated feel to the shots. finally towards the end the camera starts to pull back again, revealing the group dynamic as they spiral into heated argument. lumet shows his inexperience (some shots don't match up very well, and the close-ups are too close) but essentially his ideas are geared in the right direction. such a tight little drama calls for some first class acting. henry fonda gives a subtle, considered performance, showing with his face and general demeanour that he is really not thinking just about how to persuade the other jurors, but about the implications of the trial, and the life that is at stake. fonda clearly understands that juror #8 is not simply a man doing the job he has been called up for, but one who has found himself under the burden of an almighty responsibility. lee j. cobb gives a performance of great power, and one that is needed since it is really his character that ends up holding the emotional weight of the picture. honourable mentions also go to george voskovec and martin balsam for giving the most realistic and human portrayals of the other jurors. 12 angry men is a hugely affecting and effective piece of work, not to mention a really neatly structured one. but is it perhaps sometimes a little too neat? it ought to be entirely believable, entirely smooth and unforced in feel, and yet too much of the dialogue seems so calculated. the writer's thought processes are too much on display. i'm talking, for example, about the way juror #3 keeps saying something so perfectly hypocritical at exactly the ideal moment. and while it's true that each character must clearly represent a different attitude or segment of society, some of them are embarrassingly stereotyped, and the twee acting styles of joe sweeney and john ""winnie-the-pooh"" fiedler don't help. none of these things is a big enough flaw to bring 12 angry men tumbling to the ground don't get me wrong, this is still a mighty picture but they do serve as a warning that the little pictures are just a susceptible to corn and gimmicks as the big ones.";26 May 2010;9;['big', 'tall', 'major', 'angry', 'small', 'unusual', 'minimalist', 'early', 'cinematic', 'claustrophobic', 'little', 'several', 'different', 'far', 'close', 'personal', 'aggravated', 'dynamic', 'heated', 'close', 'close', 'right', 'tight', 'little', 'first', 'subtle', 'general', 'other', 'almighty', 'great', 'emotional', 'honourable', 'realistic', 'human', 'other', 'angry', 'effective', 'little', 'neat', 'believable', 'smooth', 'unforced', 'much', 'much', 'hypocritical', 'ideal', 'true', 'different', 'big', 'enough', 'angry', 'wrong', 'mighty', 'little', 'susceptible', 'big'];0.0203089569160997

107;Spleen;"here's an illustration of the difference between theatre and cinema. this is the definitive cinematic ""performance"" of reginald rose's play; the one or two trivial flaws are of no consequence whatever. on the stage, they would be of consequence. as e.g. marshall performs the role, juror nr. 4 is so humourless and anal that you start to wonder if he's really all that bright (and the story requires that he really is all that bright). and henry fonda tends to play juror nr. 8 from moment to moment, in effect contradicting himself (if you find yourself failing to warm to him as much as you should, this is the reason). the two key performances, in short, are weak. on stage this would be fatal. on the other hand, with strong performances all round, ""12 angry men"" on the stage could not possibly go wrong, however much the director takes it upon himself to stuff things up - just as the stage director of ""don giovanni"" can make a donkey of himself by setting the action in present-day darlinghurst, if he likes, and, with sufficiently good musical performances, the opera will not be harmed. if you exclude ed wood movies and the like, ""12 angry men"" was shot with as much economy as any other film in history, with roughly half of the exposed footage making it into the final cut (i find this hard to believe, too, but it's what the director says, and it's not inherently impossible). no doubt accounts for the odd touch of unpolished acting here and there. what's amazing is how perfectly lumet has paced the action, how right each shot is. lumet conveys the confined space all the more effectively by including thirty seconds, perhaps a minute of footage of the outside: the opening shot where we track into the jury room, and the closing shot in the open air outside. these moments - which established there was a wider world while cutting the jury room off from it - were crucial.";1 July 2002;9;['definitive', 'cinematic', 'trivial', 'anal', 'bright', 'bright', 'key', 'short', 'weak', 'fatal', 'other', 'strong', 'round', 'angry', 'wrong', 'much', 'present', 'good', 'musical', 'like', 'angry', 'much', 'other', 'final', 'hard', 'impossible', 'odd', 'unpolished', 'amazing', 'lumet', 'right', 'open', 'wide', 'crucial'];-0.0052380952380952

109;onepotato2;"for decades now, films about 'social issues' have been problematic; making conscientious viewers believe they've thought deeply about a noble cause, and getting them to applaud themselves for embracing some progressive value that they probably already support*. this movie, in considering the responsibility of jury duty, neglects a finer point (& a larger idea) which remains undramatised; the process of american justice is not designed to declare people innocent... it only concludes whether the prosecution succeeded or failed at proving a person guilty; this is reflected by the very specific terms, guilty and not guilty. a suspect is freed when the prosecution hasn't made its case, not when the suspect is proved innocent. no one is ever declared ""innocent."" the difference is important (occasionally not guilty and innocent are equivalent, but innocence is generally a higher standard). the jurors of '12 angry men' are confused about many things, but none moreso than this. the movie never clarifies this point. it would help these gentlemen immensely. at both ends of the spectrum - lynch mob to gee-whiz pushovers - the jury here utilizes thought-processes which are toxic to justice. the jerks are too interested in hanging. the 'bleeding hearts' - in the films parlance - are way too engaged in actively dismissing the whole case, not in merely detecting reasonable doubt. at one point fonda has been able to discredit evidence (which is ok - a discovery supports this) and use a dicey method to disregard so much witness testimony (which is frankly, bizarre) that he might just as well start denying there was a victim, or that a crime occurred at all. ""what if the victim isn't dead?"" and ""what if there was no body?"" are only slightly more unreasonable than a few of his crazy, trial-negating suppositions. it remains a good idea for a movie. there are strong points (a moment when e.g. marshall, as the reasonable opposition, quietly concedes is particularly powerful), and it's directed and shot well, but the script is so off-course that by the time the film ends most viewers will feel content that an innocent life has been saved, a moral determination not supported by the film, which is neutral concerning culpability. worse, the offscreen case rings dramatically hollow when reassembled from the details we do get; it suggests some kind of flimsy, polemical courtroom, 'what on earth did these lawyers debate, if it wasn't the crime details? was this a 4-minute trial?' i'm sure this movie had an impact on viewers likely to be called to jury duty, who would prefer to wind things up so they could get to a ball game, but it does end up affirming that 12 people off the street are usually ignorant, and without some enlightened golden-boy on your jury (and a dramatic structure to reign them in) will hang your sorry ass. in a shocking example of tunnel-vision, the movie neglects to note that this nifty trick of persuasion might also be deployed by the morally un-righteous. to wit, couldn't just as interesting a scenario be imagined in which a juror whose motives are secretly nefarious, and who is intentionally trying to undermine the process, achieve the same reversal and get someone executed? could one clever sociopath with a quick mind get a jury to reverse its verdict? that's a creepy, equally promising possibility which viewers aren't supposed to consider, but which is inherent in the premise, and which should have troubled a mccarthy-era audience. i think i'd actually like this movie if fonda's moral value was left intentionally vague in the end, but it isn't. his righteousness is endorsed by heraldic music on the soundtrack and just so there's no mistaking his virtue, he walks away in a glowing white suit. this is only a good argument, not a good film. if you're the kind of viewer who prefers that there's no work to do to find a films meaning or your own nobility (do you like to kill a mockingbird?), this is for you. there's no meaning to find, because none of it is hidden. it's all important on the surface. there isn't movie i love that's this overt with its meaning. 12 angry men is a nobility machine. viewers are fed through it, and come out the other end righteous.

118;bkrauser-81-311064;"what can be said about twelve angry men that hasn't already been said before with more eloquence. sidney lumet's first and arguably best feature has entered into the annals of film history and has been picked apart ad nauseum by critics, industry professionals and academics alike. twelve men walk into a jury room eleven say guilty, the one played by henry fonda says not guilty; etc. etc. there is a reason for this however; not the least of which is the films enduring timelessness made all the more impressive by its subject matter. made during the decline of the studio system, the film was an oddity onto itself. a tiny black and white film at a time of technicolor, a principle cast of character actors at a time of a-list credit cramming, and a director who up until then stuck to television and stage. still twelve angry men was far from conventional and in many ways ushered in a new age of cinema. it can be reasonably argued that lumet paved the way for robert altman, sydney pollack and john schlesinger among others to make the jump from tv to features. within its own confines, the movie is flawless. most of the film takes place in a single room and most of the information pertinent to the case is told second-handedly. despite this, the film has the tension of a modern day thriller and then some. the dialogue is so innately organic though never rambling and the characterizations are rich and detailed. the camera moves through the room effortlessly making enough cuts to keep things interesting without being distracting. many large lugubrious epics wish they could keep things this interesting! the inspired script written by reginald rose is so fluid that it has been open to interpretation not all of which are good. many argue that fonda's juror #8 manipulates the other jurors and is less a fleshed out character than a symbol of ivory tower intellectualism. additionally the points he raises range from valid to a bit sketchy and he takes ""beyond reasonable doubt"" to extremes. i wouldn't put it quite in that context. i think just like everyone else in the room, juror #8's choices are made based on his personal perspective. he feels compelled to push and push because no one else will. it's a character flaw that may not be admonished like the racial ramblings of juror #10 (ed begley) but isn't legitimized by definitive answers either. however you interpret the film, twelve angry men still remains a taut emotional roller-coaster, a thoughtful introspective and a brilliant character piece. i didn't even mention the wonderfully nuanced work of lee j. cobb, e.g. marshall and jack warden. it launched the career of a brilliant auteur and helped define an era in filmmaking that became the norm until the age of the blockbuster. out of all the films of the period, this courtroom drama is with little doubt the most deserving of its reputation. http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/";30 August 2011;10;['angry', 'more', 'first', 'good', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'least', 'impressive', 'subject', 'tiny', 'black', 'white', 'principle', 'angry', 'conventional', 'many', 'new', 'own', 'flawless', 'most', 'single', 'most', 'pertinent', 'modern', 'organic', 'rich', 'detailed', 'enough', 'interesting', 'many', 'large', 'lugubrious', 'interesting', 'inspired', 'fluid', 'open', 'good', 'many', 'other', 'fleshed', 'out', 'valid', 'sketchy', 'reasonable', 'personal', 'racial', 'definitive', 'angry', 'taut', 'emotional', 'thoughtful', 'introspective', 'brilliant', 'brilliant', 'little', 'deserving'];0.2073379140239605

123;Howlin Wolf;"i liked the observation that even juries can become suspicious of one another despite the fact that they're all working toward the same end, and since legal teams are all human they may still be subject to the same propensity to err as the rest of us. there were times however when i disagreed with the influences that brought about the verdict. one of those cornerstones is the notion of 'reasonable doubt'. clearly this particular principal isn't applied as strenuously as the justice system says it ought to be in all cases that are heard today. my bet is that often these days verdicts are reached by the appeal of common consensus, and any apparent holes are ironed out by majority opinion instead of meriting closer inspection. as one juror says, you can use the counter-argument of ""supposing it happened this way?!"" for just about anything. if that is meant to be the clincher that makes adjudicators unsure, then almost nobody would be getting locked away even with lots of admissible evidence stacked up against them. secondly, unlike on its first general release in 1957, the death penalty is no longer enforced in a heck of a lot of places. in a film where so much of the drama derives from a miscalculation in good faith being enough to condemn an innocent to death, the stakes are no longer quite so high in a lot of territories, which speaks well of the modern age. now i'm not arguing that wrongful imprisonment is in any way some kind of a picnic, but when you have the facility of a seemingly endless appeals system that can be fully exploited by a canny lawyer, the intricacies of the justice system somehow don't seem quite so immediate or important anymore. we know that sentencing is no longer the final word, because we hear of judgements quashed and rulings overturned virtually every day. ... and thirdly, does any ordinary member of the public nowadays really have the confidence to believe that a juror could be so observant to notice marks left by a pair of spectacles?! many are probably on the verge of dozing off when testimonies are being heard, or at least they would only be listening to the account without having the alertness to take in every minute detail about the personage in front of them, as well. i would think that juries have fallen into a habit of working with details that are overtly given to them by officials, not scrutinising closely enough to allow for consideration of things that they happen to have noticed themselves. whether or not such idealistic events are indeed credible in these times, ""12 angry men"" is unfailingly, rigorously intelligent in its deconstruction of deliberation. i only wish that in the real world we were without doubt certain to arrive at the proper outcome, so long as we made sure to follow all of the 'rules'...";17 February 2008;10;['suspicious', 'same', 'legal', 'human', 'subject', 'same', 'reasonable', 'particular', 'common', 'apparent', 'close', 'unsure', 'admissible', 'first', 'general', 'much', 'good', 'enough', 'innocent', 'high', 'modern', 'wrongful', 'endless', 'canny', 'immediate', 'important', 'final', 'ordinary', 'observant', 'many', 'least', 'enough', 'such', 'idealistic', 'credible', 'angry', 'intelligent', 'real', 'certain', 'proper', 'sure'];0.1252142857142857
124;schappe1;"the archive of american television has finally come out with a dvd version of the original studio one teleplay, ""12 angry men"" by reginald rose, directed by franklyn j. schaffner, who did many studio ones and much later was the director of ""patton"". i can now compare it to the famous movie version, starring henry fonda, which was directled by sidney lumet three years later. a lot of the things lumet gets credited for in some of these reviews are already present in schaffner's staging, including starting with the high camera angle and ending with the close-ups. a key difference is that the tv version is only an hour long, (actually only 50 minutes due to commercials), while the film uses 96 minutes to tell its story. some of the lesser characters suffer as a result. in the film robert webber's nice-guy businessman wants so much to go along with anybody else that he changes his vote simply to be part of the majority when the tide turns. in the teleplay, we never learn why will west changes his mind. edward binns as juror #6, is very protective of ""the old man"", juror #9, (played by joseph sweeney in both versions), in the movie. he clearly sees him as a similar to his own elderly but beloved father. in the teleplay, bart burns is little more than a spectator, except for one key moment that has nothing to do with the old man. but the big difference is in the lead actor, robert cummings, (he was ""bob"" in a comedy, ""robert in a drama""), vs. henry fonda in the film. fonda is, of course, an actor of much greater repute but cummings was much underrated. he was a thoughtful actor in dramas, carefully weighing his words and inviting the audience to think along with him. as juror#8, cummings portrays a man who is not sure of himself as the beginning but wants to answer some key questions before he makes a decision. in the film, fonda seems like a man who has already decided to vote ""not guilty"" from the beginning and is trying to figure out how to loosen up his fellow jurors from their stances so he can draw them over to his view of things. a key point is that fact that the lady who ""saw"" the murder through the windows of the train wore glasses. in the film, fonda divines this by noting how e.g. marshall, as juror #4 rubs his nose to deal with the irritation the glasses cause. it's the final piece to the mosaic fonda is trying to create. in the teleplay, it is burns' juror #6 who makes this point after watching juror #2 and this seems to be the final piece of the puzzle for cummings who for the first time, has become firm in his decision to vote not guilty. his two antagonists are jurors #3 and #10. #10 is edward arnold in the teleplay, ed begley in the film. both are good. the scene where #10 is ranting on about ""people like that"" is more effective in the film. it's just a matter of timing. on tv, the jurors get up and begin to walk away as soon as he starts talking. in the movie they do so more slowly, each one making the decision on his own. franchot tone, another underrated actor, (he started out playing charming men about town and wound up playing garrulous old timers), is just as strong and forceful as lee j. cobb. his true motivation, his resentment of his own son, is hinted at early but is not part of his breakdown at the end. in fact, he doesn't break down at all. he simply surrenders. he doesn't become cobb's ""shell of a man"". as to the other jurors, martin balsam has more to do than norman fell as juror #1, the foreman. martin's a nice guy who just wants everybody to get along. we don't' know that much about norman. john beal's role as juror #2 just calls for him to use his watch to time cummings' performance as the old man walking and to wipe his glasses clean at the right time. marshall came through a little stronger than walter abel as a relentless ""logic machine"" who can't think outside the box. lee phillips is solid as the shy young man, somewhat ashamed of coming from a disadvantaged background. burns has little to do besides noting the significance of beal's glasses. paul hartman is ok as the guy who wants to leave early, (he has tickets to the theater, not a ballgame). much of the additional dialog in the movie goes to jack warden's version of this character. sweeney and george voskovic are the only two actors in both versions and both are fine, with voskovic underlining the significance of this procedure to someone who came here to experience freedom. missing though, is his empathy for the defendant as an outsider like him, which is emphasized in the film. west, as indicated, is a non-entity in the teleplay. on the whole, i'll take the movie over the tv original but it's a close thing. but the tv version, which was ""missing"" for many years, is certainly worth seeing.";28 November 2008;10;['american', 'original', 'angry', 'many', 'patton', 'famous', 'lumet', 'present', 'high', 'close', 'key', 'long', 'due', 'less', 'nice', 'protective',

125;sme_no_densetsu;"in this, sidney lumet's debut feature, we're taken into the jury room as twelve jurors deliberate over the fate of a young man accused of murder. all of the evidence points to a guilty verdict but one juror is determined to explore every possibility for reasonable doubt, lest they send an innocent man to his death. one remarkable thing about this film is that it unfolds almost completely in real time within a single room. while that might sound like a limitation, sidney lumet managed to keep the visuals interesting throughout, resulting in a well-deserved oscar nomination. meanwhile, reginald rose's taut, oscar-nominated script deserves equal credit for keeping the narrative flowing. lastly, and perhaps most importantly, the cast is stellar. henry fonda turned in a solid performance in the lead role and all of the supporting actors gave it their all. in my mind, the standout performances came from lee j. cobb, ed begley & jack warden. however, the group as a whole is a diverse one and each of the actors contributes a unique piece to the puzzle. my only complaint (a minor one) is that the mechanics of the script are sometimes overly apparent, particularly in the early stages when fonda's character supposedly has only a vague apprehension about certain pieces of evidence. luckily, when the story unfolds it is compelling enough that i can forgive the screenwriter's dramatic license in setting up the events. at the moment this film is rated #8 among the top 250 films on this site. i think that it definitely deserves a spot on the list but the current ranking seems somewhat generous, especially when you consider that it's above the likes of ""casablanca"", ""seven samurai"", ""chinatown"", ""2001: a space odyssey"" and several other highly acclaimed films. so, by all means, see this movie but don't be surprised if it doesn't turn out to be one of the ten best films of all time.";25 August 2010;8;['young', 'guilty', 'determined', 'reasonable', 'innocent', 'remarkable', 'real', 'single', 'interesting', 'equal', 'stellar', 'solid', 'lead', 'diverse', 'unique', 'only', 'minor', 'apparent', 'early', 'vague', 'certain', 'compelling', 'dramatic', 'top', 'current', 'generous', 'several', 'other', 'surprised', 'good'];0.1169523809523809
126;pyrocitor;generally the premise of twelve middle aged men locked into a room arguing would hardly be considered the basis for particularly riveting or dramatic cinema, with theatrical potential at best, but hardly dynamic or visual enough to appeal to a mass audience. it can only be considered merciful that such an attitude was not one shared by television director sidney lumet, who instead seized advantage of a myriad of factors which could have resulted in a catastrophic film (a solitary location, a hasty shoot, budget constraints) and somehow extracted from them an effort to which the billing of 'one of the greatest motion pictures of all time' would be a title hardly disputed by the general public. lumet's persistence in the face of adversity suggests he may have scented something great in the making, and the raw energy and crackling intensity 12 angry men generates is a testament that such dedication was entirely justified. while the legal thriller is always a precarious genre, walking an uncertain line between being plausible in a real life context while avoiding being too slow and talky to appeal to an audience, lumet centers in upon the inherent drama in the court setting, while consciously shying away from the tendency to approach such cases in black and white terms. what makes fonda's juror #8's solitary quest to sway his fellow jurors all the more compelling is the moral ambiguity of the situation. fonda is not a white knight crusader unflappably convinced of the righteousness of his actions or the accused party's innocence - in fact, he openly admits that his actions may be resulting in the release of a guilty murderer. instead, fonda becomes a crusader for the ideal of truth and plausible evidence, notions that lumet's film toys with throughout as its rashomon-style construction of past events through various uncertain accounts becomes a more philosophical meditation on society's constant yearning for information and knowledge. taking similar notes from hitchcock's rear window, the film addresses the voyeuristic insatiable desire to be a privileged spectator, but crucially, just like the jurors, the audience is continually kept in the dark despite similar desperation to piece together a definitive account of the crime committed. eventually the conclusion can be drawn that it scarcely matters in the end, as the facts of the case have become so twisted and warped by human preconceptions that only gut instinct and an earnest lust for honesty and justice can hope to prop up a system so reliant on fallible misconstructions. and although lumet draws out the tension surrounding the eventual verdict to uncomfortably taut levels, by the end, the crux of the film appears to scarcely center around the court case itself anymore, the focus subtly shifting instead towards the men deliberating it. the jury's cross section of middle aged men serves as a microcosm for 1950s variations on masculine identity, slowly but surely sweating away their polished exteriors to reveal the flaws, prejudices and hatreds concealed underneath. masterfully tackling sensitive thematic issues such as class and age discrimination (while the teenaged suspect is initially dismissed as being a dangerous youth, the elderly woman witness' testimony is similarly scrutinized due to her age) the film dares to expose the dark secrets lurking beyond the wholesome exteriors of 1950s society without ever coming across as excessively heavy handed or moralistic. indeed, the film could hardly be farther from it, as lumet's remarkable deftness of touch makes the picture riveting as much through its subtlety as its heated emotional grandstanding, using slyly inconspicuous zooms and tensely circling camera-work to unobtrusively underscore the white knuckled drama of the scene without unnecessarily wrenching emotion out of the scene or performers. perhaps the film may be a few shades away from perfection, carrying a whiff of being overly coincidental and slightly unrealistic through having the jurors swayed one by one, but the unexpected moment of quiet humanity culminating the picture is a textbook example of the rare sort of uplifting ending which can ring true, and it is near impossible to dispute the raw power and honest intensity building up to that point, making the potentially dubious logic of the narrative easy to ignore and exceedingly difficult to resist. such a dialogue heavy story relies upon hefty acting clout to achieve full effect, and lumet's uniformly exceptional cast does not disappoint, with not a single performer in the delightfully colourful and versatile collection of characters delivering an unsatisfactory or unbelievable performance. no one could have been better cast as the stoic protagonist juror #8 than the time etched monolith of american honesty and decency that is henry fonda, and fonda radiates the ideal quiet confidence to draw in the support of the audience as much as his fellow jurors. fonda's unassuming lack of pretension makes him far more than the traditional populist hero, and his eshewal of soapbox moralizing in favour of calculated appeals to reason make his message all the more plausible, and his character all the more timeless. lee j. cobb similarly shines as the abrasive juror #3, with cobb's fleeting moments of tortured humanity barely discernible under an appalling mask of unsavoury characterization making his role far deeper than a simply stubborn oppositional force, and far more resonant. martin balsam is also a noteworthy presence as the level headed juror #1, with a quirky edginess underscoring his appeals for reason, bringing a potentially simply expositional character to highly watchable life. what could have made for a plodding, overly literary waste of time is instead transformed into crackling movie magic, bursting with barely stifled raw emotion and pulsing with social significance. 12 angry men is just about as sublime a legal thriller as one could hope to find, its reputation as one of the strongest american films of all time holding up, and the half a century since its release failing to dilute its power and abject fascination in the slightest. -10/10;18 February 2009;10;['middle', 'aged', 'riveting', 'dramatic', 'theatrical', 'good', 'dynamic', 'visual', 'mass', 'merciful', 'catastrophic', 'solitary', 'hasty',

133;baumer;it seems as you grow older, you can appreciate older films more. that does not mean that when i hit the age of 65 i will appreciate a film like citizen kane, but now that i am in my late 20's i have a desire to see some of the greats from years past. just five years ago i was too narrow minded to want to even try to appreciate older cinema and some of the screen greats. but today i rented the 1957 classic, 12 angry men and was not only pleasantly surprised, but i truly liked it and thought it to be quite a good film. what's quite fascinating is to see the change in political and social climates since the days of black and white film. in this film, there were no black jury members, no women, and no swearing. this was also, to be fair, probably the worst handled case in the history of trials next to the warren report. questions that today would be common place were avoided like the plague. evidence was not handled properly, very little effort was put forth by the defense to come up with a defense at all and witnesses were never thoroughly interrogated or cross examined to refute what can only be regarded as flimsy testimony. but, not only was i not around in the 50's, i have no idea what the north american justice system was like back then, and perhaps that is what makes this film so interesting. so i can only say that it is possible that a case could be handled this poorly, given its circumstances. you would have to compare and dissect what society was like back then to get a true appreciation of what was and wasn't possible. to talk about the film, yes it was very enjoyable. it was a great film that unwound piece by piece all of the apparent infallible theories that pointed to the guilt of this kid. the writer should be given a lot of credit for that. but having said that, a film like this would never see the light of day with today's fickle audience that would rather see a film like con air than high fidelity. i am not critisizing today's audience for that, just pointing it out. but the 40's and 50's were different. spielberg and lucas and don simpson and joel silver were just little tykes then. it was a different time. a film that only talks and has no action was perhaps a possible sell back then with a cast like this. lee j. cobb and henry fonda and jack warden must have been at the height of their popularity so that immediately leant credence and respect to the project. but it wouldn't matter who did this film in today's age, it would not work. again, not a critisism, just an opinion. i think it is important to go back to the roots of cinema every once in a while to view some of it. you come across gems like this and you learn to appreciate them. 12 angry men is a fascinating film and it is one that serious lovers of film should watch every now and again to feel the aesthetic of film before special effects started to replace a good script and a good director. tarantino would appreciate something like this. in his version of 12 angry men, the 12 jurors would probably have names of colours and at the end they would all have grabbed henry fonda's knife and tried to kill each while uttering the f-word in, but a film that prides itself on dialogue more than action is what he is all about. this could be a pioneer of a tarantino film project. 12 angry men is a great film and it is one that henry fonda should have been proud of. a wonderful experience! and it is great to see some of his work, other than on golden pond. 9 out of 10;22 May 2000;9;['old', 'old', 'late', 'narrow', 'minded', 'old', 'angry', 'surprised', 'good', 'fascinating', 'political', 'social', 'black', 'white', 'black', 'fair', 'common', 'little', 'flimsy', 'interesting', 'possible', 'true', 'possible', 'enjoyable', 'great', 'apparent', 'infallible', 'fickle', 'high', 'different', 'little', 'different', 'possible', 'important', 'angry', 'fascinating', 'serious', 'special', 'good', 'good', 'angry', 'tarantino', 'angry', 'great', 'proud', 'wonderful', 'great', 'other', 'golden'];0.17008658008658
134;telegonus;"i love this film, and watch it whenever it's on. it was adapted from a television play by reginald rose, and directed by sidney lumet. a deceptively simple story of twelve jurors who must decide the fate of a very young man who may or may not have killed his father. these men are a cross-section of american and in particular new york society, circa 1957, and range from the working to the upper middle classes; from the highly sensitive to the appallingly crude; and from those who think they're smart and perceptive and often are not, to those who think little of themselves and who really ought to rate themselves more highly. the play is so intensely written, and rose had such an excellent ear for dialogue, that one often finds oneself caring more for the jurors than for the outcome of the case they're deliberating. at the start of the film, there is one holdout for not guilty against the eleven who believe, with varying degrees of sincerity and seriousness, in the guilt of defendant. it's the job of the lone juror to convince the rest of the logic of his position, which is one of reasonable doubt. it's here that mr. rose, or rather his lead character, plays fast and loose with the rules of evidence, as has been pointed out over the years; and while i'm generally a stickler for rules when it comes to matters that plays and movies are often reckless with, especially where medicine and science are concerned, i make an exception in this case due to the excellence of the writing, and of the movie as a whole. if ever there was an actor's film, it's this one. every actor gives a superb performance. some characters are better conceived than others, and thus john fiedler, as the milquetoast of the bunch, and ed binns as the working man, are at somewhat of a disadvantage, no fault of the actor. ed begley's character, a bigot, starts out interestingly, then descends into somewhat of a cliche, which is too bad in way, since begley was at the top of his game at this stage of his career. martin balsam's sighing self-pity is put to excellent use in his performance of a man who likes to coach football. george voskovec is magnificent as a foreign-born watchmaker who challenges jack warden's loudmouth salesman. i've never seen warden better than he is here. his character is a jerk and a joker, borderline runyon, or rather the way runyon types often are in real life: insufferable. warden plays for effect rather than charm, and has a way of making other performers look good in their reactions to him, which tend to be unfavorable. e.g. marshall is imposing as the icily superior stockbroker, oozing contempt for others while maintaining a facade of fairness. not a bad man, just a snob, of the sort one encounters often in the real world, seldom in the movies. lee j. cobb is the juror with a deep personal involvement in the case, and becomes in time the nearest to a true villain (albeit a pathetic one) of the piece; while henry fonda's dissenter more or less wears the white hat. cobb gives the sort of highly charged, emotional performance he gave in on the waterfront, a bit quieter here, and not so malevolent. he was brilliant at conveying the demons of men who don't know they have demons. fonda manages to be saintly with becoming sanctimonious. his character has the thankless job that liberals often take on, which is that of defender of the damned. one senses at times that the man would rather be elsewhere, that he's a tad too retiring for the this sort of thing. what i remember most fondly about the movie is its exploration of the architecture of the human face, often in close-up or medium shot. we see old faces and youngish ones, the craggy and the smooth, the granite-jawed and the slack-jawed. there are anxious faces with eagle eyes and lazy ones with drowsy eyes. some faces smile automatically, others benignly, some not at all. with so much emphasis nowadays on action pictures, it would be good for young directors to study 12 angry men, to see just how much action there is in the human face. i'll take this one over pearl harbor any old day.";18 December 2002;10;['simple', 'young', 'particular', 'upper', 'middle', 'sensitive', 'crude', 'smart', 'perceptive', 'little', 'excellent', 'guilty', 'lone', 'reasonable', 'lead', 'loose', 'reckless', 'superb', 'bad', 'sighing', 'excellent', 'magnificent', 'real', 'insufferable', 'other', 'good', 'unfavorable', 'bad', 'real', 'deep', 'personal', 'near', 'true', 'pathetic', 'less', 'white', 'emotional', 'malevolent', 'brilliant', 'sanctimonious', 'thankless', 'human', 'close', 'medium', 'old', 'youngish', 'smooth', 'anxious', 'lazy', 'benignly', 'much', 'good', 'young', 'angry', 'much', 'human', 'old'];0.0684491104133961
135;gab-14712;"12 angry men is one of best courtroom dramas in the history of cinema. even though it is an older film, it is also a refreshing take on courtroom dramas. on the surface, this film is a pure drama about the courtroom, but it goes much, much deeper than that. i was discussing in an earlier review (dial m for murder) about the use of a single location. well, this film inhabits that single location very much so, and the film is actually famous for that. outside of three minutes, the film takes place in a single new york city courtroom. that works very well in this film takes to the expert directing by first-time director sidney lumet and veteran cinematographer boris kaufman. the film is expertly shot and the use of the focal length's shots allow the audience to feel more of each character's feelings. lumet later discussed how a ""lens plot"" occurred to him. as the movie progressed, he changed the lenses to longer focal lengths, in order for the background to gradually close in on the characters. a very good technique i must point out. another thing that made this film an interesting addition to the courtroom dramas is we don't know much about the case, only through secondhand evidence do we piece together what is going on. all we know is that a spanish-american boy is accused of murdering his father. other than a very bored-looking judge who assumes he knows the outcome of the case, we learn the case through the eyes of twelve jurors. in most courtroom movies, it's clear they like to come to a final verdict. this movie is very different because we don't know whether the boy is guilty or not, although we can assume based off the events of the movie. the movie is all about reasonable evidence, a very important study in criminal justice. through the evidence depicted in the case, did the boy commit the murder or not? in the first few minutes in the jury room, it's clear that the majority of the jurors believe he is guilty. however, there must be an unanimous vote before they can issue their decision. the problem is that one juror, juror #8 believes the boy is not guilty. this is where all the fun begins. the film is based on emotion, logic, and even prejudice to describe what is going on. this particular juror does not sway from his opinion, even though the other jurors are growing more angry, more restless. but as juror #8 (henry fonda) describes why he believes the boy is not guilty, and he presents an admirable case why, people begin to agree with #8. there are a few arrogant jurors who refuse to move their votes for their own reasons. for example, juror #10 (ed begley) is an extreme racist, as seen in a massive prejudiced rant in which the reaction of the other jurors proved to be one of the most powerful scenes of the movie. then there is juror #3 (lee j. cobb), who is just a very angry man in general and he gradually becomes angrier as more people side with #8. then there is juror #4 (e.g marshall), a man with wire-rimmed glasses who tries to avoid emotion in this thinking with only the use of logic. i think it was a wise movie not to give the character names. it makes each character much more powerful. i could actually remember the juror by their numbers, that's a testament for how great and unique each character is. in the 95 minutes the film runs, we become invested in each character very much so. whether he is a racist bigot or whether he is a man who simply believes in what is right, we truly sympathize with them all. that is what you can attribute to a wonderful cast. it's interesting, because there was only one bankable star here (at the time), and that was henry fonda who played juror #8 very well. he presented his case as believable as he can be. the rest of the cast were some of the best actors of new york city at the time, such as lee j. cobb, martin balsam, jack warden, ed begley, joseph sweeney, jack klugman, e.g marshall, john fiedler, edward binns, robert webber, and george voskovec. they all perform very well in their roles. they need to be angry, and they certainly did get angry. sidney lumet is one of the best and influential american directors of all time. this was is first feature film, and he knocks it out of the park from the very first scene. in each film he does, he always has something to say-usually something controversial. not so much in this film, but in subsequent films. he does talk about how emotions can cloud the thinking of people, and cause them to think and act irrationally. as some of the conversations and rants in this film will point out. 12 angry men, based off a television play, ended up being one of the greatest courtroom dramas ever made. it came out at a time where lavish productions were aplenty. despite the critical acclaim of this film, the movie actually wasn't a box-office hit when it originally opened. but enough people have seen this over the years and to see how great this film is. it spends 92 minutes in a room filled with a table and twelve men, and somehow we get incredibly tense moments that added up to be a very powerful, influential film. my grade: a";12 December 2015;9;['angry', 'good', 'old', 'refreshing', 'pure', 'much', 'deep', 'early', 'single', 'single', 'famous', 'single', 'first', 'veteran', 'focal', 'more', 'long', 'focal', 'good', 'interesting', 'much', 'secondhand', 'spanish', 'american', 'other', 'bored', 'most', 'clear', 'final', 'different', 'guilty', 'reasonable', 'important', 'criminal', 'first', 'few', 'clear', 'guilty', 'unanimous', 'guilty', 'particular', 'other', 'angry', 'guilty', 'admirable', 'few', 'arrogant', 'own', 'extreme', 'massive', 'prejudiced', 'other', 'powerful', 'angry', 'general', 'angry', 'more', 'wise', 'powerful', 'great', 'unique', 'racist', 'right', 'wonderful', 'interesting', 'bankable', 'believable', 'good', 'such', 'angry', 'angry', 'good', 'influential', 'american', 'first', 'first', 'controversial', 'much', 'subsequent', 'angry', 'great', 'lavish', 'aplenty', 'critical', 'enough', 'great', 'tense', 'powerful', 'influential'];0.1087033462033462
136;classicalsteve;"most courtroom dramas tell the story of a trial, and typically most films of the genre center on the building of the cases, the trial in a courtroom, and the climactic moment the jury renders the final verdict. in ""12 angry men"", we see none of these aspects. we don't see the trial, we don't see the lawyers, and we don't see how the case was built. almost the entire story is told in the confines of a jury room. the indisputable facts and the prosecution's case trickle in as the story progresses. there's a brief ""prelude"" where we see the courtroom, the judge, and a brief shot of the boy on trial for murder. this is the world of ""12 angry men"". except for a brief courtroom shot and one other codetta scene at the end, ""12 angry men"" spends about 90 of its 96 minutes running time inside a claustrophobic room where the fan doesn't work and it's supposed to be the hottest day of the year. twelve men from differing backgrounds and age groups are put together to determine the guilt or innocence of a young man accused of murder. fairly quickly we learn that an older middle-age man was murdered in an apartment and his son in his late teens has been accused of the crime. two witnesses during the trial testified it was the boy, a woman across the street and an older gentleman in an apartment just above the apartment where the crime took place. without giving two much away, the story begins with an initial poll taken by the jurors. almost all of them believe the boy is guilty, except one, juror no. 8 (henry fonda). the trial occurred over the course of six days and all of them seem a bit worn out. in addition, each juror seems to have differing agendas which start to rear their ugly heads. juror no. 3 (lee j. cob) is one of two jurors who has a personal agenda about the trial. the other is juror no. 10 (ed begley) who constantly talks about ""those people"" and repeatedly stands from his chair when he hears evidence which might contradict the probably guilt of the accused. juror no. 5 (jack klugman) is a soft-spoken young man who grew up in the slums, like the defendant. juror no. 7 (jack warden) is a sports fan who cares less about the trial and doesn't want to miss a sporting event taking place in the evening. there's a kindly and wise older gentleman, juror no. 9, who turns out to have unexpected wisdom (joseph sweeney). and martin balsam plays the foreman of the jury who can't seem to keep the group from going at each other's throats. juror no. 8 at first can't seem to convince anyone there's any reason to doubt the guilt of the accused. even when he says he simply wishes to talk about the case, many of the jurors dismiss him. he then takes a chance and asks the others for a re-vote in which he abstains. if the other 11 jurors still vote guilty, he's willing to take the verdict into the court. a brilliantly acted one-scene film about the possibly dynamic of a jury room. many real-life juries have taken many hours, sometimes days to reach verdicts. other verdicts have been rendered in seemingly short periods of time. each actor ""owns"" his character and as the discussion continues, the prejudices and irrationalities of the characters gradually reveal themselves. interestingly, we have the notion that juries should be objective in their verdicts, but ""12 angry men"" poses the question: do verdicts reflect personal prejudices as much or in some cases more than simply reviewing and determining objective facts?";31 January 2017;9;['most', 'most', 'climactic', 'final', 'angry', 'entire', 'indisputable', 'brief', 'brief', 'angry', 'brief', 'other', 'angry', 'claustrophobic', 'hot', 'young', 'old', 'middle', 'late', 'old', 'initial', 'guilty', 'worn', 'ugly', 'personal', 'other', 'soft', 'young', 'kindly', 'wise', 'old', 'unexpected', 'other', 'many', 'other', 'guilty', 'willing', 'many', 'real', 'many', 'other', 'short', 'objective', 'angry', 'personal', 'much', 'more', 'objective'];-0.0053571428571428
137;hall895;twelve men sit around a table and talk for an hour and a half. there's your movie. doesn't sound like much now does it? but 12 angry men turns out to be an exercise in wonderful simplicity. it is refreshing to know that in order to make a great movie you do not need a huge budget. no special effects are necessary. wonderfully vibrant locations can be done without. in some cases all you need to make a great movie is a great story performed by great actors. and in 12 angry men that is what you get. 12 angry men presents an exceedingly simple yet undeniably powerful story. we follow the jury deliberations in the new york city trial of a young man, a boy really, who is accused of killing his father. there is a very brief introductory scene in the courtroom as the judge presents the jury with its instructions. apart from that scene and another very brief moment outdoors at the very end the entire film takes place within the confines of the jury room. and what goes on inside that room will fascinate. what seems to be, as one juror points out immediately, an open and shut case turns out to be much more complex. we will get to know each of the twelve members of this jury, men who come to this room from all different types of backgrounds, each with his own unique perspective. some of the twelve will end up playing a bigger role than others but each man certainly plays his part in what unfolds. initially eleven of the jurors vote to find the defendant guilty. there is only one holdout, juror #8, played by henry fonda. fonda's character may not be convinced of the boy's innocence but he feels the defendant is at least owed a fair deliberation to determine if there could in fact be reasonable doubt. and off the movie goes, with juror #8 seeking to convince his fellow jurors that maybe this is not such an open and shut case after all. suffice to say it will be quite difficult to get some of those in the room to change their mind. there are dramatic twists and turns along the way and in their interactions we learn a lot about each of these twelve men who bring their own prejudices and emotions to the proceedings. a few of the jurors stand out, most notably numbers 3 and 10 who are most adamant about the boy's guilt. played by lee j. cobb and ed begley respectively this pair threaten to overwhelm the proceedings at times with their explosive outbursts. the contrast between this pair's rantings and the calm, rational, reasoned arguments presented by fonda's character are quite clear. without a doubt fonda is the star of the film but it is the opportunity he gets to play off of the other characters which really makes the film. without the contributions of cobb and begley the whole thing would be rather mundane. and the other nine actors are not to be forgotten either. each of the jurors is completely unique and every performer in the cast does a terrific job in breathing life into their character. when a movie consists almost entirely of a group of men sitting around talking there are certain to be a few lulls and sure enough this film has a few. but once the deliberations really hit their stride and the arguments are flying back and forth the film never fails to fascinate. it's an incredibly simple movie. in this case simplicity works wonderfully. great performances, from fonda of course but from each of the other eleven actors as well, make this simple story real edge of the seat stuff. what goes on inside the confines of that jury room is truly memorable. it's a wonderful film and a wonderful look inside the american justice system, serving as a reminder that even the most seemingly open and shut case may not be so clear cut after all.;5 December 2008;8;['much', 'angry', 'wonderful', 'refreshing', 'great', 'huge', 'special', 'necessary', 'vibrant', 'great', 'great', 'great', 'angry', 'angry', 'simple', 'powerful', 'young', 'brief', 'introductory', 'brief', 'very', 'entire', 'open', 'shut', 'complex', 'different', 'own', 'unique', 'big', 'guilty', 'least', 'fair', 'reasonable', 'fellow', 'open', 'shut', 'difficult', 'dramatic', 'own', 'few', 'adamant', 'explosive', 'calm', 'rational', 'clear', 'other', 'whole', 'mundane', 'other', 'unique', 'terrific', 'certain', 'few', 'few', 'simple', 'great', 'other', 'simple', 'real', 'memorable', 'wonderful', 'wonderful', 'open', 'shut'];0.1604276895943562

144;Hollywood_Yoda;too much we often think that courtroom dramas are full of suspense and sometimes an overkill of information presented, but this film has stood the test of time and become the classic courtroom drama. a man's life is on the line, and twelve men must decide his fate, send him to the chair, or set him free. they were the chosen few to serve their community, and ultimately serve the accused. a doubt of guilt can change even the most unlikely of outcomes, and that is what we see in this film. raw emotion is let loose, as one by one, each man finds that the accused is too, human. the jury was hung because of one man's belief that there might be some reason of not guilty. standing by that, he tries to convince the other jurors as well. starring henry fonda and directed by sidney lumet, this is one great film you should see. only one word can describe this film, excellent, and that's the icing on the cake.;21 March 2008;10;['full', 'classic', 'free', 'few', 'unlikely', 'raw', 'loose', 'human', 'guilty', 'other', 'great', 'excellent'];0.0903311965811965

146;juliankennedy23;"12 angry men (1957): 6 out of 10: 12 angry men currently ranks 5th on imdb's top rated movies list. i just don't get it. it is not a bad movie mind you, but tied with schindler's list, the lord of the rings: the return of the king, and pulp fiction as the fifth best movie ever? yeah maybe i am missing something here. 12 angry men takes place during jury deliberations in a death penalty case involving a young man accused of stabbing his father to death with a switchblade. eleven jurors are ready to vote guilty, but one standout juror feels that they should take another look at the evidence. one by one, his examination of both the evidence as well as the other jurors' prejudices turns the overall vote from guilty to not guilty. the movie is shot basically on one set and gives the impression of being shot in real time. the cast is uniformly excellent. still like any good juror, i have questions. is the defendant supposed to be puerto rican? we only barely get a look at the defendant and he seems ethnic but white. could be arab, italian, puerto rican, etc.? much is made that the kid is a slum dweller but juror #5 was also a slum dweller and he is played by russian jew jack klugman so that's no help. normally, none of this would matter, but a big dramatic turning point is juror #10 (ed begley) ranting and raving about how ""you know how these people lie. it's born in them. they don't know what the truth is. and let me tell you, they don't need any real big reason to kill someone, either."" with no one explaining who ""those people"" are supposed to be. french canadians? irish travellers? what? the actor that portrayed the defendant (john savoca) is sicilian and the speech above certainly fits a stereotype for sicilians as least as well as it would for a puerto rican. most modern viewers think the defendant is puerto rican because of the contemporaneous musical west side story with world famous puerto rican natalie wood. is the kid guilty? i will go with a solid yes. the movie in all fairness is about reasonable doubt not absolute guilt or innocence. the evidence, however, is pretty clear cut. juror 8's admonishment that they shouldn't just give a verdict in five minutes is reasonable, (you ought to at least make it look good) but his theory that there is a reasonable doubt doesn't hold water. the switchblade used in the murder was identical to the one owned by the kid. the kid is the only other person who had access to the apartment. the kid was the only person with a motive to kill the father (he was abusive). all the crippled or blind eyewitnesses in the world really don't change these basic facts. is juror #8 the devil? you know you might be onto something there. or at the very least, since this is a film from the late fifties, he could represent a fifth columnist undermining american institutions and allowing murderers to continue to walk our streets. i am not the only one to have this notion. some later productions of the play portray juror #8 not as a noble crusader but as a manipulative who's trying to get a murderer set free basically just to see if he can. henry fonda's portrayal in the movie borders that of a sociopath. it is almost a parody of the do-gooder liberal taken to the extreme. one of those types that looks down on his fellow man and sees it as his responsibility to lift them up to his higher plane. notice how fonda's character has an impeccable white suit throughout the proceedings while the others, often working class, seem disheveled and dark. how did juror #8 get a second switchblade? he walked the neighborhood where the crime took place and bought one. while he was a juror on this case. then he brought the switchblade into the juror room. so let's break this down. do you want to get thrown off a jury? conducting your own investigation is a quick and easy way to get thrown off a jury. heck, you might even catch a misconduct charge. that's a class a misdemeanor. now that would be the least of jury 8's worries. it was illegal to posses for any reason (no matter how noble your intentions) a switchblade knife in new york in 1957. heck, it is still illegal to posses a switchblade knife in new york city in 2019 and it will catch you a class a misdemeanor with minimum jail time sentencing guidelines. bring that same switchblade knife concealed into a courthouse? yup, you have now won a class e felony. twelve angry men gets a sequel. yikes is there anything you liked in the movie?: i liked the film overall. i really did. as i stated above it has good acting across the board with an incredible cast. along with those i have already mentioned you have such greats as martin balsam, e. g. marshall, jack warden, and john fiedler. the pacing of 12 angry men is excellent and the use of one set is well done. (they made the set smaller as time went on to increase the tension.) as a bonus if you are ever asked what is the best remake of a made for tv movie here is your answer right here (12 angry men is a remake of a 1954 teleplay for cbs' studio one anthology series). any other random complaints?: well, the title is a lie. only jurors 3,5,7,and 10 ever really get angry. the other real problem is that no one, on either side of the verdict seems to bring up a motive. the kid had all the motive and opportunity in the world to stab his father. the problem is that no one else really had either. no one else besides the kid had access to the apartment and no one else besides the kid had a motive to want to see the old man dead. i know i am beating a dead horse here, but why is this never really discussed? more to the point, why is this never used as a proper rebuttal to juror #8's non sequiturs? the entire enterprise seems to have a stacked deck from the beginning with everyone playing (and sometimes overplaying) their roles. it really reminds me of an old twilight zone episode with the easily wrapped up aesop and gotcha moments manipulating the audience to the author's conclusion. the fact is takes place in one room, is in black in white, and with a group of mostly character actors also contributes to the twilight zone vibe. a superb twilight zone episode mind you but a twilight zone episode nevertheless. not the fifth greatest movie of all time.";22 December 2019;6;['angry', 'angry', 'top', 'bad', 'fifth', 'good', 'angry', 'young', 'ready', 'guilty', 'other', 'overall', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'real', 'excellent', 'good', 'puerto', 'rican', 'ethnic', 'white', 'arab', 'italian', 'puerto', 'big', 'dramatic', 'real', 'big', 'french', 'irish', 'least', 'puerto', 'most', 'modern', 'puerto', 'rican', 'contemporaneous', 'musical', 'famous', 'rican', 'guilty', 'solid', 'reasonable', 'absolute', 'clear', 'reasonable', 'least', 'good', 'reasonable', 'identical', 'only', 'other', 'only', 'abusive', 'crippled', 'blind', 'basic', 'least', 'late', 'fifth', 'american', 'only', 'later', 'noble', 'free', 'fellow', 'high', 'impeccable', 'white', 'disheveled', 'dark', 'second', 'own', 'quick', 'easy', 'least', 'illegal', 'noble', 'illegal', 'minimum', 'same', 'angry', 'good', 'incredible', 'such', 'angry', 'excellent', 'small', 'good', 'angry', 'other', 'random', 'angry', 'other', 'real', 'old', 'dead', 'dead', 'more', 'proper', 'non', 'entire', 'stacked', 'old', 'black', 'white', 'superb', 'fifth', 'great'];0.0485490196078431
147;The_Movie_Cat;"warning: review contains mild spoilers the notion of a ninety-five minute movie featuring twelve middle-aged men in real-time, almost exclusively on a single set, isn't one that sounds promising. yet 12 angry men does exactly that, and works as a masterclass in film drama. there are some nice subliminal moments, such as rudy bond as the bored judge, obviously resigned to what seems a cut and dried case. dialogue and characterisation is well noted, despite occasional leaning in the latter stages towards platitudes (""wherever you run into it, blind prejudice always obscures the truth"" says fonda commendably, but embarrassingly). direction is where the film truly excels, though, with sidney lumet's camera waltzing constantly around the set, though never so that it's showy. a nice trick that i wasn't aware of was his gradual moving in of the set walls as the film goes on. for notable moments, it's interesting that the ""good"" juror from step one, henry fonda, leaves the room wearing a white coat, and passes the dark coat to the ""bad"" juror, played by lee j. cobb. i'm not suggesting this was a religious reference, but it is nicely symbolic. also interesting is the step count fonda does when he assumes the role of the elderly witness. while it's timed at ""41 seconds exactly"", in actual fact it all takes place 10 seconds quicker. there are perhaps times when character flaws are presented too readily, or too obviously, and the ""vote count"" is increased with unnecessary regularity, dissipating the tension somewhat. as the film moves on, fonda's inevitable moral victory becomes more obvious, though this is a minor flaw and detracts little. the sweat, then the rain, and the excellent black and white cinematography all go towards making this a very special achievement. a mainstream film, though not a dumb one, cruelly overlooked by the academy, who nominated it three times, but failed to give it a single oscar. versions of the film that wouldn't have worked: two angry men: henry fonda tries to convince one other man that the kid is innocent. only lasts ten minutes. twelve moderately angry, but not especially heated men: twelve blokes sit around and calmly discuss the issues, while being polite and getting to know their feminine sides. the twist ending: henry fonda turns round and says ""i was only kidding, i think he's guilty as hell really - let him fry!"" twelve angry men is a textbook example of good filmmaking, and an exceptionally good movie. 8/10.";5 October 2000;8;['mild', 'middle', 'aged', 'real', 'single', 'promising', 'angry', 'nice', 'subliminal', 'such', 'bored', 'occasional', 'latter', 'blind', 'nice', 'aware', 'gradual', 'set', 'notable', 'interesting', 'good', 'white', 'dark', 'bad', 'religious', 'symbolic', 'interesting', 'elderly', 'actual', 'unnecessary', 'inevitable', 'moral', 'obvious', 'minor', 'little', 'excellent', 'black', 'white', 'special', 'dumb', 'single', 'angry', 'other', 'innocent', 'angry', 'polite', 'feminine', 'guilty', 'angry', 'good', 'good'];0.035063676633444
148;krorie;so much has already been said about this magnificent movie by imdb reviewers but i would like to make one other plaudit, the creative synchronization of camera, script, and music that intensifies the drama almost to the breaking point. the outstanding acting by a handpicked cast has already been noted. not one of the twelve gave a mediocre performance. it would be hard to say which one was best. even the ones with the fewest lines shine as few thespians can on the big screen. oscar-winning cinematographer boris kaufman focuses in on the heart of what director sidney lumet and writer reginald rose are attempting to convey to the audience through the brilliant acting of all concerned. watch as the jurors vote to make it six to six. the camera hones in for just the right lighting, facial expression, and angle to show the anguish and torment in the souls of these twelve angry men. it flashes to the key juror #8 (henry fonda) from time to time at just the right moment for the full effect of his deep conviction that the eighteen year old should have a fair consideration of all the evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he is guilty of killing his father. the use of shade and shadow, especially when the thunder storm crackles outside is used to show the tempest that rages inside the jury room. the heat that eventually makes even juror #4 (e.g. marshall) sweat complements the heat of the arguments and debates that sizzle throughout the room. all this is simultaneous with a musical score by kenyon hopkins that matches mood to action in a perfect blend of all essential elements making this one of the best hollywood films ever.;27 January 2006;10;['much', 'magnificent', 'other', 'creative', 'outstanding', 'mediocre', 'hard', 'good', 'few', 'few', 'big', 'brilliant', 'concerned', 'right', 'facial', 'angry', 'key', 'right', 'full', 'deep', 'old', 'fair', 'reasonable', 'guilty', 'simultaneous', 'musical', 'perfect', 'essential', 'good'];0.1886446886446886

154;FilmOtaku;"it takes a particularly effective film to remain compelling even when one has seen the film multiple times, or at the very least, knows the outcome of the story. sidney lumet's 1957 film ""12 angry men"" fits this definition to a tee in that i have seen this movie literally dozens of times over the last twenty years of my life and yet, when i watched it again last night, i found myself in the same state of tension and awe as i did the first time i saw the film. the story is simple; 12 men are thrown together because they sit on the jury for a trial that involves an 18 year old boy from the slums of new york who is accused of murdering his father, who had beaten him all of his life. the boy pleads not guilty, but because of two eyewitnesses, the jury convenes to the deliberation room strongly convinced of his guilt; except for one man, played by henry fonda. at first, he is ridiculed for his stance, until he slowly is able to convince some of the others that perhaps there are some aspects of the case that cast some doubt on the certainty with which they all began. because, like most juries, there are many differences in background, social standing, etc. among them, tensions rise to a crescendo many times throughout the film, causing some of them to look introspectively at themselves and each other in order to truly deliberate the fate of this young man. the brilliance of ""12 angry men"" can be explained in three parts. first time director sidney lumet, at the time a television director, simply does everything right in this film. the setting is simple; most of the action takes place in the jury room, with the exception of some establishing shots telling the viewer where they are, and the plot is pretty straightforward. it is something that happens daily, multiple times, all across the united states. but there are some wonderful elements that he introduces into the scene to further the claustrophobia and tension: he makes it the hottest day of the summer, and for most of the film, the fan doesn't work, so you can literally see the sweat pouring off of these men and soaking through their shirts. he also uses some tight close-ups of the actors at times, particularly when they are giving dissenting opinions or are in a state of emotional discomfort. secondly, the film's script is absolutely first-rate. not only does the story come together like a thousand (very small) puzzle pieces, but also the clever way it does this never fails to astonish me. one would think that sitting and watching 12 guys talk about a court case while getting in each other's faces for an hour and a half wouldn't be compelling, but the intricacies of each juror, the way each of their backgrounds and prejudices are revealed is fantastic. there is nothing corny in the script, no placating moments where someone just suddenly ""sees the light"" every time one of the jurors changes his vote, it is because there have been solid questions, answers, etc. have been revealed. in other words, no one gets from point a to point b without sufficient effort. finally, ""12 angry men"" features what is probably one of the greatest casts ever assembled. henry fonda, who usually plays a pretty good guy (with a few exceptions) plays a quiet hero in this film. he doesn't preach, he just simply is the only man in the beginning to say ""i don't know."" his obvious relief nearly every time another juror is swayed is conveyed with a simple look that clearly shows admiration for said juror. the antithesis of fonda's character is lee j. cobb's juror. he is a loud, crass man who refuses to even consider that the defendant may be innocent, even when he is faced with facts and being in the position of the minority. i merely single those two out because they are probably the most central, but every single actor in the film did a brilliant job, and really managed to give their roles depth and character, something that is not easy when you're sharing screen time with 11 other great actors. there is really absolutely nothing bad to say about the film ""12 angry men"", a film that has been praised by critics and the public alike. it holds a very high place on the imdb top 250 list (i believe it was #20 the last time i looked), which is extremely encouraging to me. when the movie going public is rating films like the lord of the rings trilogy over films like ""seven samurai"" and ""citizen kane"", it is great to see that a ""small"" movie like this is met with such esteem and recognition. ""12 angry men"" definitely holds a place on my short list of ""films i think everyone should see"" because i think it really teaches the audience something about first impressions and the concept of justice, not from a lawmakers standpoint, but from the perspective of public in general. 9/10 --shelly";23 May 2005;9;['effective', 'compelling', 'multiple', 'least', 'angry', 'last', 'last', 'same', 'first', 'simple', 'old', 'guilty', 'convinced', 'able', 'most', 'many', 'social', 'many', 'other', 'young', 'angry', 'first', 'simple', 'most', 'straightforward', 'daily', 'multiple', 'wonderful', 'hot', 'most', 'tight', 'close', 'emotional', 'first', 'small', 'clever', 'other', 'compelling', 'fantastic', 'solid', 'other', 'sufficient', 'angry', 'great', 'good', 'few', 'quiet', 'only', 'obvious', 'simple', 'said', 'loud', 'crass', 'innocent', 'central', 'single', 'brilliant', 'easy', 'other', 'great', 'bad', 'angry', 'high', 'last', 'encouraging', 'public', 'great', 'small', 'such', 'angry', 'short', 'first', 'general'];0.1107213930348258

158;barryrd;"this classic movie has an excellent cast of well-known actors in a story that goes to the heart of the justice system. from the beginning, it is apparent that the young man on trial for a murder is saddled with a jury that is totally unfit to pass judgement on whether he should live or die. very few of these men should have passed a jury selection process; they were impulsive, lacking in compassion, ignorant of the law, and highly prejudiced against anyone not like themselves,except for two or three. this wedge enabled henry fonda, the lone dissenting voice at the start, to make a series of points that eventually blew away the arguments that the young man was guilty. during the process of passing judgement, the jury is subject to an intense self-examination of their own prejudices and opinions. as the movie goes along, the viewer is appalled at the mentality of the group, with no understanding of the scope of their responsibility. the foreman, martin balsam, takes his job very routinely and would have easily allowed the jury to pass judgement without any reflection. the movie was very effective in showing the men sweat and fly off the handle in the midst of a new york heatwave that made them eager to get away from the courtroom. at one point, one of the last holdouts, e.g. marshall, playing an unemotional and stone-faced juror, was forced to wipe his brow under a barrage of questioning from henry fonda that exposed the falsehood of his assumptions. we see similar cutaways to lee j. cobb, who eventually loses his grip as others take the opposite side in the argument. this is a tense and unvarnished look at human beings thrown together in a jury and it shows the forces at play that would deny that justice be done. i am sure that this movie and others gave rise to some of the changes to the american justice system over the last 60 years to prevent the miscarriages of justice that probably occurred in many cases. a great movie and a lesson in the due process of law.";16 January 2011;8;['classic', 'excellent', 'apparent', 'young', 'unfit', 'few', 'impulsive', 'ignorant', 'prejudiced', 'lone', 'young', 'guilty', 'subject', 'intense', 'own', 'effective', 'eager', 'last', 'unemotional', 'similar', 'opposite', 'tense', 'unvarnished', 'human', 'sure', 'last', 'many', 'great', 'due'];0.1567460317460317
159;zac-04879;it's absolutely amazing how entertaining it is to witness twelve men in a single room, arguing and specifying for 90 minutes straight. do not judge this movie by it's age, because it is an unforgettable and truthful black-and-white classic that's always worth checking into. martin balsam, john fiedler, lee j. cobb, e. g. marshall, jack klugman, edward binns, jack warden, henry fonda, joseph sweeney, ed begley, george voskovec and robert webber are phenomenal in the film. to call the cast excellent is quite common, but 12 angry men's cast manage to pull off a stunning jury system and keep us all engaged and impressed. so don't start the film with extremely low hopes. the first 10 minutes is just settling you into the story and once the conversation, arguing and yelling starts, it'll latch your attention and hold you until the end. it's pretty simple, but is a fast masterpiece to be classed as one of history's best films. although it's appropriate and clean from adult elements, it's honestly worth having the younger children wait until they're older kids. unless your young kids are genuinely interested, save this black-and-white masterpiece as a must-watch for when they're older. young children will likely find the film boring and old, but older kids may have more fascination. 12 angry men is a perfect example of just needing a simple script, a terrific crew, and a decent setting. don't focus on how old it is and definitely go and see it if you have not watched it. if you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.;23 June 2021;9;['amazing', 'entertaining', 'single', 'straight', 'unforgettable', 'truthful', 'black', 'white', 'worth', 'phenomenal', 'common', 'angry', 'stunning', 'impressed', 'low', 'first', 'simple', 'fast', 'good', 'appropriate', 'clean', 'worth', 'young', 'old', 'young', 'interested', 'black', 'white', 'old', 'young', 'boring', 'old', 'old', 'more', 'angry', 'perfect', 'simple', 'terrific', 'decent', 'old', 'full', 'other'];0.1774659863945577

164;elvircorhodzic;"12 angry men is a courtroom drama. the power of human emotions, convincing and tense dialogues and almost perfect characterization are the biggest advantages of this film. the entire film takes place in a jury room. it is the hottest day of the year. the boy is accused for killing his own father. jurors casually, cracking jokes, enter the hot and stuffy room. the case is crystal clear. the capital punishment is the only logical option. however, juror number 8 does not think so... i think that the most important detail in the film is face of the defendant. the boy is distraught, desperate and scared. viewers are confronted with the terrifying truth in the next moment. the life of a boy was placed in the hands of passionate people who are prejudiced. the story is honest. i think the point is not to prove innocence or guilt in this movie. the theme of this film is the jury. jurors are people. people of different profiles, personal problems and strange initiatives. juror number 8 (henry fonda) is calm and rational man who wants to examine every possible ""reasonable suspicion"" before a final decision. he is not the voice of reason. he is a man who does not want someone's death on his hands, if there is still room for a review of the evidence. juror number 3 (lee j. cobb) is probably the most complex character in this film. a businessman who hardly hides his passion and partiality. i can not describe his character as a negative. he is a man who is lost in his own drama. juror number 4 (e.g. marshall) is a man full of self-confidence and arrogance. the insensitivity is visible in his character. the logic and intelligence are his advantages. juror number 7 (jack warden) is a man who does not have an opinion on this case. baseball, heat and ventilator, that does not work, are more important than the boy's life. it is important to be part of the majority. juror number 9 (joseph sweeney) is a wise old man who has a lot of life experience and a keen sense for perception on seemingly trivial things. juror number 11 (george voskovec) is careful and methodical man. he is ready to consider and accept everyone's opinion. juror number 12 (robert webber) was a young businessman who has probably formed an opinion on the case, but he is afraid to publicly express it, because his intelligence could become questionable. juror number 2 (john fiedler) is an eloquent accountant, but apparently not loud enough. juror number 5 (jack klugman) comes from the same environment as the accused boy. there is a reasonable possibility that he had a similar experience in his youth. he approaches the case on an ironic way, but quickly recognized his mistake. juror number 1 (martin balsam) is an athlete, who heads the jury, although he did not realize the complexity of the situations in which they find themselves. juror number 6 (edward binns) is a house painter. he is a simple man who respects his associates. however, he has a very strong sense of justice that he wants to see in this case. juror number 10 (ed begley) is a real loudmouth who is eager to impose his views to others. this attitude awakened extremely ill intent in one man. all the actors were up to the task. mr. fonda is the central figure, but all the other characters are getting their 5 minutes. body language, sharp dialogue and hot atmosphere are the initiators of the enormous tension in this film. i do not think that this film is a masterpiece of realism. mr. lumet showed emotions, prejudices and feelings through the conflict of opinions in a raw and a somewhat realistic way. despite the scorching heat, sweating, nervousness, yelling, scheming and frustrations angry people arguing in a small room. they discuss the life of a young person. however, i am pleased with the sincere dialogue, tense atmosphere and provocative drama.";8 January 2017;9;['angry', 'human', 'convincing', 'tense', 'perfect', 'big', 'entire', 'hot', 'own', 'hot', 'stuffy', 'clear', 'capital', 'only', 'logical', 'important', 'distraught', 'desperate', 'scared', 'terrifying', 'next', 'passionate', 'honest', 'different', 'personal', 'strange', 'calm', 'rational', 'possible', 'reasonable', 'final', 'complex', 'own', 'full', 'visible', 'important', 'important', 'wise', 'old', 'keen', 'trivial', 'careful', 'methodical', 'ready', 'young', 'afraid', 'questionable', 'eloquent', 'loud', 'same', 'reasonable', 'similar', 'ironic', 'simple', 'strong', 'real', 'eager', 'ill', 'central', 'other', 'sharp', 'hot', 'enormous', 'raw', 'realistic', 'angry', 'small', 'young', 'pleased', 'sincere', 'tense', 'provocative'];0.0533207229928541

181;oOoBarracuda;i wonder what it must have been like for sidney lumet to direct a perfect film for his feature film debut. lumet had worked on television shows before directing his 1957 film 12 angry men, a debut film examining justice and the motivation behind people's actions and the motivation behind their decisions when a group of jurors decides whether to convict a young man of a murder that would result in his being sentenced to death. first developed for a cbs studio one anthology television series, reginald rose wrote 12 angry men and developed it into a teleplay in 1954. lumet's version is still thought of by many as a perfect film 60 years after its release. with an all-star cast including henry fonda, martin balsam, lee j. cobb, and jack klugman among others, 12 angry men is my personal favorite film to watch when i want to see a collection of the best acting talent. what i wouldn't give to have been in the theatres during the first run of 12 angry men. i can only imagine the audience reaction to such a powerful yet understated film. alas, i was born in the wrong time and instead of being able to head to the cinema and see 12 angry men, i'm here buying tickets for the emoji movie. a desperate teenager is seen staring longingly at the men who just heard his case exiting the jury stall. he knows they will be the ones deciding his fate. the young man is on trial for the murder of his father, and if convicted, will face the death penalty. from the outside, his case looks open and shut. he had an argument with his father that was overheard by neighbors, he owned a knife which was the same weapon used to kill his father, and he had previous grievances with the law. most of the jurors file into their sequestered room assuming they won't be in long, as the verdict seems clear. one juror, however, has doubts and refuses to cast a vote for guilty without at least discussing the case as they've been assigned to do. begrudgingly the jurors begin to discuss the case sure that their minds won't be changed. one by one, however. further examination of the evidence and the factors involved in the case reveal the motivations each man had used to inform their decision was less based on evidence and more so on their own biases. an exploration of the human psyche and what motivates our thought processes, 12 angry men has more than earned its place as one of american cinema's best. the opening credit sequence of 12 angry men was a divine long shot, achieved at a high-angle through a fan, that would provide a source of tension throughout the film, of each of the jurors filing into the room preparing to see to the matters of the case. after their opening vote reveals only one holdout, mob mentality takes over as a few vocal members of the majority intend on proving to henry fonda's juror #8 why their view on the matter is more accurate than his. in doing so, they also reveal their biases and the different factors driving their decision. whether it's the lonely brokenness of a severed relationship or attempting to assert dominance to shield one's own powerlessness, each man is operating with far more than the facts of the case driving them. the lengths lumet went to conceal the names of the jurors was one of the best decisions he made to drive home the universality of the film's message. at one point, a court worker asks one of the jurors his name and he points to it on the clip board held by the court worker. in a typical situation, one would have just said their name out loud, but lumet's stroke of brilliance avoided names being used through the entire runtime of the film allowing audiences the chance to see themselves in the characters depicted on screen. whether we are aware or not, and whether we act on them or not, we are all driven by personal biases. we learn the set of biases that drive us as we mature, first from our immediate familial surroundings, then from the people we surround ourselves with and the circumstances we endure. if those biases are negative, it is our responsibility to analyze them and see that we eradicate them. as a character study, 12 angry men is top- notch with no small thanks owed to the exceptional cast. every single name on the credits list is that of a well-established actor of the time. martin balsam, lee j. cobb, e.g. marshall, jack klugman, ed begley, and henry fonda are only half the cast and each known by an extensive body of work. one exceptional aspect, which also points to lumet's directorial prowess he possessed even from his feature film debut is how improbable it is that this film would be such a success. one-setting films with small casts and rich in dialogue are not the easiest films to pull off, yet you'd be hard- pressed to find someone who won't give accolades to 12 angry men. not once through the runtime is the film static nor does it lose the engagement of the audience. lumet ends the film in a sensational way, as well. when fonda helps cobb with his coat after the two were the fiercest of adversaries during deliberations, lumet communicated to the audience that we are all capable of seeing past what initially drives our motives and can possibly overcome them and come together on the other side. then, just before the film ends, we learn fonda's name and see he and another juror uncomfortably stand on the courthouse steps not knowing what to say to one another. despite having gone through an emotional afternoon together, they don't know each other and don't have much to say to one another.;3 August

182;johnnymonsarrat;"i've seen plenty of classics, and i have to tell you, a lot of them have aged. but 12 angry men stands the test of time. i saw this film for a class in business school, believe it or not, as an example of communication and negotiation. throughout the film, the main character uses various ways of building rapport, convincing people, and debate. it's really astonishing. the film does a good job of setting up personalities quickly, using generic characterizations that make it easy to follow all of the 12 characters. unlike runaway jury there isn't a lot of action, but there's plenty of tension and this action film junkie found it to be accessible and very engaging. who should see this film: -- everyone who has an interest in classics. -- people who are curious about classics but want to avoid the boring ones. take a chance on this film. 12 angry men still packs a punch; i'll give it a perfect 10 out of 10.";19 April 2004;10;['angry', 'main', 'various', 'astonishing', 'good', 'generic', 'easy', 'runaway', 'accessible', 'engaging', 'curious', 'boring', 'angry', 'perfect'];0.1134615384615384
183;TaylorYee94;however, collective intelligence and laborious pursuit of the truth itself sometimes take people near the truth. twelve jurors are simplified integration of almost all types of people you can see in real life. emotional one, smart one, reasonable one, wise one, rambling one, indecisive one, coward one, quiet one, loud one, and etc. i have never seen a movie with such a limited story and the setting. the whole move takes place in one setting: jurors' room and has one simple narrative: deciding defendant's guilt or innocence. however, it contains the whole society: how one's conviction can work in right or wrong way, what it takes to change others' opinions, what percentage of proportion is perfect between conviction and possibility, and how an individual deems 'the life'. one thing i have particularly noticed is the temperature in the room and the weather outside. because the room is stuffed, and all jurors are sweating, stress, pressure and unpleasantness in decision making process is thoroughly conveyed to the audience. the level of griminess peaks when the vote reaches six to six. then, it rains, and a fan starts to work, forecasting pleasant momentum toward resolution or settlement. i also want to praise the camera work. it intensifies the sense of confined space without disturbing actors' delivery of emotion. when it is the vital moment of discovery of evidence, the camera closes up the actor with the line. however, other times, scenes are shot across the room vertically, emphasizing the narrowness with many people overlapping some parts of their body. i will not deny '12 angry men' is philosophical art. however, it does not do enough to overcome the weakness this movie is born with, no dynamics and too linear because of finite story and setting. it misses out on most of what 'motion pictures' can offer.;20 November 2021;7;['collective', 'laborious', 'real', 'emotional', 'smart', 'reasonable', 'wise', 'indecisive', 'quiet', 'loud', 'limited', 'whole', 'simple', 'whole', 'right', 'wrong', 'perfect', 'individual', 'pleasant', 'vital', 'other', 'many', 'angry', 'philosophical', 'enough', 'linear', 'most'];0.1607683982683982

185;ronakkotian;this is regarded as one of the best films ever made and i see why. 12 angry men is about a jury of twelve men who decide whether a boy is guilty of a murder or not. everyone finds him guilty except for juror 8 who believes there's reasonable doubt leading the rest of the jury to question their decisions. by the end of its 96 minute runtime, i was completely blown away. for a film so limited in scale, i couldn't believe how suspenseful and incredible this film was. the majority of this film takes place in one room and it's masterful how well made it is. as the opening credits roll, sidney lumet tracks the camera in one single take, introducing us to every character and helping us get a first impression of what they're like. it's an outstanding beginning that establishes lumet's talent. lumet makes use of the one location to its full potential. the way some scenes are shot and edited make for some extremely tension filled moments that managed to surprise me in every way. there is not a single dull moment. as it progresses, the suspense goes up a notch leaving my eyes glued to the screen for its entirety. it's especially impressive considering this was lumet's feature film debut. could you get a better debut than this?! for a film taking place in one room, a lot of dialogue is thrown around in what i consider to be one of the best scripts to ever be written. reginald rose's script astounds me. not only am i dazzled by the way rose unfolds this case but also how much it revealed certain details about the characters. he's very smart in framing the opinions of each of the men and why they have that opinion, leading to some emotionally powerful scenes that disclose reasons as to why some members think the boy is guilty excluding the evidence presented. this is a script that writers will dream of writing and i have to praise reginald rose for achieving this feat. aside from the script and direction, the performances is the icing on the cake. every single person puts their best foot forward and delivers incredible performances. henry fonda stands out as juror 8 and is extremely compelling to watch. lee j. cobb is another standout who gets better and better as the film continues. bit by bit, we learn how troubled of a person he is and cobb steals the show during those intense scenes. i now see why 12 angry men is loved so much. this is a film and ensemble piece that has it all. it's outstanding on every single level whether it's the performances, the script or the direction. this is a work of art that should be watched by everyone!;27 March 2021;10;['good', 'angry', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'reasonable', 'limited', 'suspenseful', 'incredible', 'masterful', 'single', 'first', 'outstanding', 'full', 'extremely', 'single', 'dull', 'impressive', 'well', 'good', 'certain', 'smart', 'powerful', 'guilty', 'single', 'good', 'incredible', 'compelling', 'well', 'well', 'troubled', 'intense', 'angry', 'ensemble', 'outstanding', 'single'];0.1759920634920635
186;PIST-OFF;"when reviewing on imdb, the window pops up a selection between spoiler or no spoiler for your review. can one spoil a movie this flat? this predictable? maybe in 1957 the characters in this movie seemed thick and nuanced but having seen this recently for the first time i was struck by how one dimensional each seemed. from the first few minutes of the movie you can easily decipher who's going to be a ""bad"" guy and who's going to be a bastion of choirboy-like fairness and innocence. maybe given the self contained nature of the plot there is much room for character development but perhaps something a little less like caricatures.... the other thing that bothered me about the movie that pays so much attention to method of reason is the fact that early on in the movie it is stated that the knife had been wiped clean before the police got there. but according to witnesses the boy allegedly fled right a way. this seems a bit incongruent and yet no one in the movie has brought it up and no critical review of the movie seems to have brought it up. it would seem to be a major factor in the case and i can't believe it is overlooked. instead it's omission from discussion only makes the whole plot look as thin as the characters......... and upon further review each ""explanation"" or alternative given to explain away the facts in the case seems far-fetched.... but taken all together seems a full on miscarriage of justice. a nuanced director might have ended in a hung jury. nope. this one dimensional movie has to either be 1 or 0 or in the case of the jury all for or all against. even at a paltry ninety minutes it still greatly overstays it's welcome. 1/10";1 November 2005;1;['flat', 'predictable', 'thick', 'nuanced', 'first', 'dimensional', 'first', 'few', 'bad', 'like', 'much', 'little', 'less', 'other', 'much', 'clean', 'incongruent', 'critical', 'major', 'whole', 'thin', 'further', 'alternative', 'fetched', 'full', 'nuanced', 'hung', 'dimensional', 'welcome'];-0.0013888888888888
187;braddugg;life is not something to be decided in five minutes. let's talk about it. well, the most important movie in terms of format and and in fact the best movie it terms of dialogue. this movie is completely unconventional in format and it's setting. 12 men discuss a case in a room, weird for a movie isn't it. how long can you sustain drama with a case, that's the point. extremely well written and well acted, this is in fact a testimony of writing. all films have to be driven by writing more than anything else. simply shot, the dialogue makes up for everything here. there are many things that could have been shown like it happens in other courtroom dramas, that is i mean the whole trial, the evidences, the arguments. but here, the trial is over only the judgment of the jury is pending which is 11-1 from the word go and in all expectation should have been 12-0 in favor of guilty. now, that does not make a good character of the man who stood out. that 1 man has to influence all the 11 others to become an outstanding man from a mere standing out person. and that is what exactly happens. good, in every which way you consider. if you see it once, and i am sure if you watched it once, you will mostly be convinced by my argument it's the most simply made movie that is great in all aspects. henry fonda, must be appreciated a lot for producing this and giving the job of direction to sidney lumet as his first movie. greatly written by reginald rose as a play and then for the movie. all the greatness pertaining to this movie should be credited to the mentioned three names. thanks for everyone who was a part of this film and made it what it is today. this is one of the most important films of my life as it triggered a thought of why don't i make a movie set in a room and that's just live talk. oh yes, i waited for the longest time to get a blu ray of this, and was very happy again with the quality., blu-ray just rocks and thanks for the transformation. it's 5/5 for a movie that has stood the test of time and will be as great as ever even many years later.;20 September 2014;10;['important', 'good', 'unconventional', 'weird', 'more', 'many', 'other', 'whole', 'pending', 'guilty', 'good', 'outstanding', 'mere', 'good', 'sure', 'great', 'first', 'important', 'live', 'long', 'happy', 'great', 'many'];0.3195887445887446

193;MattBrady099;the power of movie dialogue really makes this movie a true classic. the story to 12 angry men is one man on a jury stands alone in a case in which most are initially convinced one way but one by one may be convinced another way. 12 men in one room just talking about one murder case and them sharing they opinions if the person that may have committed murder is guilty or not, now many things here could have went wrong, you got to have the best writer, the best director and the best actors to make this movie work and it payed off so well and i think this is cinema's greatest risk of doing something new with the story, giving it a twist and a edge and 12 angry men paid off brilliantly. the acting from every singe actor in this movie all do realistic, believable, funny and serious performance's and they all add a lot of weight and drama to their character's. i wish i can bring up every single actors name in this cast but i'm not since these 12 of them and it's going to take up the all page and i can't talk about every singe actor and go into detail about them one at a time, but i can say that everyone in the movie did a flawless work of acting that's pure oscar worthy and the kind of drama acting they should show kids in drama school. nicely done fellas. sidney lumet directed this movie and this has to be some of the best directing i've seen from this guy. he really added a lot to this movie when it came to story and characters and the back and forward they have with each other and it worked by his direction. the characters in the movie (the twelve angry men) don't really like each that much as in every scene they at each other's throat trying to confidence the other men in the room that the man is guilty for murder while that person and the other's bring up some really solid points that this man is guilty or not guilty for murder. as a viewer myself i got really interested in the case and trying to think if he's guilty or not, so this movie does a fantastic job of giving the viewer a opinion on the case and see if you think he did it or not. for problems with the movie: i don't have any. overall 12 angry men is such a classic movie with excellent performances from everyone, the writing outstanding and the directing was some of the best. you haven't seen 12 angry men then i say go see it, it's worth your time.;22 May 2015;10;['true', 'angry', 'most', 'guilty', 'many', 'wrong', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'great', 'new', 'angry', 'realistic', 'believable', 'funny', 'serious', 'single', 'flawless', 'pure', 'worthy', 'good', 'other', 'angry', 'other', 'other', 'guilty', 'other', 'solid', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'interested', 'guilty', 'fantastic', 'overall', 'angry', 'classic', 'excellent', 'outstanding', 'good', 'angry', 'worth'];0.1088427832330271

199;lagudafuad;this courtroom drama is rated second in afi's 10 top 10 courtroom drama, behind the classic to kill a mockingbird. although the movie is not as great as to kill amockingbird, it does boast of excellent acting skills and a nice view of how the human mind works. most of the entire movie took place in the jury room. the total time spent outside of the jury room was three minutes out of the full 96 minutes of the movie and the time in the jury room exposes you to how judgemental the world is. this drama film was adapted from a teleplay of the same name by reginald rose, whose screenplay for 12 angry men was initially produced for the cbs program studio one in 1954. the film tells the story of a jury made up of 12 men as they deliberate the guilt or acquittal of a defendant on the basis of reasonable doubt that was brought up by one of the jurors. juror 8 (henry fonda) was the juror that brought up the basis of reasonable doubt. he was the movie's protagonist. juror 8 had the herculean task of proving to the others that his reasonable doubt was valid since in the united states (both then and now), a verdict in most criminal trials by jury must be unanimous. as the movie went on, you will see how some of the jurors were seeing things from the view of juror 8 and how some remained adamant. the movie's main antagonist was juror 3 a stubborn disrespectful man, who no matter what some of the others were able to prove stood his ground, by doing so he kept some of the jurors at his side of the defendant being guilty. '12 angry men' was remade for television in 1997. directed by william friedkin, the remake starred jack lemmon as one of the jurors. most of the action and dialogue of the film are identical to the original. although there was no smoking in the jury room and concentration shifted to income and pop culture. 12 angry men's teleplay has been adapted to many tv series over the years some of these include hancock's half hour, picket fences, perfect strangers, family matters, the dead zone, early edition, the odd couple, king of the hill, matlock, 7th heaven, veronica mars, monk, hey arnold!, peep show (tv series), my wife and kids, robot chicken, and the simpsons. the movie is exceptionally captivating and you will not regret the time you spent watching this movie. www.lagsreviews.com;13 October 2012;7;['second', 'top', 'great', 'excellent', 'nice', 'human', 'most', 'entire', 'total', 'full', 'judgemental', 'same', 'angry', 'reasonable', 'reasonable', 'herculean', 'reasonable', 'valid', 'most', 'criminal', 'unanimous', 'adamant', 'main', 'stubborn', 'disrespectful', 'able', 'guilty', 'angry', 'most', 'identical', 'original', 'angry', 'many', 'half', 'perfect', 'dead', 'early', 'odd', 'matlock'];0.1663978494623655
200;willcundallreview;"12 angry men, a classic movie that is truly one that can be enjoyed by anyone no matter what genre of film you might prefer. the film is one of thrills but done in a way where it is all in the dialogue and the body language of the 12 men set up to decide the fate of a young man who is on trial for the murder of his father. the movie also explores the 12 men's lives and also any prejudices they hold against the young man on trial, different perspectives are had throughout the movie not just on the murder itself but also on the man's back story as a child and how his father brought him up. a masterpiece simply in the way that it entices the viewer so that your focus is never lost and draws you in as you explore the case in one room with one table and 12 chairs. it can't be easy to create something so astounding from 90 odd minutes of people sat in a room talking, but this achieves it and achieves it pretty fast too, it doesn't take long before you're drawn in yourself and want to know more. sidney lumet directs and does a fine job, he is the person really responsible for making this feel so damn well exciting i guess and combined with reginald rose's story and script it makes it so much more of a classic. lumet gets the very best out of his actors and really pulls the strings, even little things like when the men move around the room; it makes what they are saying that little bit better. henry fonda as juror number 8 really leads the cast, after all his character is the one who at first wants to talk about the case and debate it when everyone else thinks the kid should fry. fonda is absolutely brilliant in his role; his calm demeanour mixed with his impassioned speeches on the case make his character one of the true good guys of cinema. lee j. cobb's character stands out a lot because of his overall anger at the boy involved in the case, juror number 3 who cobb plays is one of the stand outs because of his behaviour during the debating being done. each juror is different, from the angry to the very meek, the guy who wants to get out of the place for a baseball game to the guy who grew up in a slum just like the young man on trial did. they each bring not only different personalities but back stories too with some loud mouths and some quiet and really indifferent to the case and that together is another reason why this is flawless cinema. 12 angry men deserves its place in the classics of cinema, not just for its acting or its directing etc but mostly because it's a story that all can enjoy and i think most who watch this can say they at least wanted to see how it ends. as said before it cannot be easy to create something like this, all in the same room and not make the audience bored by it all, but it has enough great things in it to make it more than just a good or great film, it's pretty much perfect. another thing that this film does which is fantastic is you start to visualize the case at hand, i mean sure you listen to the jurors talk but sometimes it makes you start imagining all the things going on that the case entails, from the murder, the train and to the old man's story, the film never fails to bring new things up and shake the case about a little.";5 December 2015;10;['angry', 'classic', 'young', 'young', 'different', 'back', 'easy', 'astounding', 'odd', 'more', 'fine', 'responsible', 'exciting', 'more', 'good', 'little', 'little', 'brilliant', 'calm', 'mixed', 'impassioned', 'true', 'good', 'overall', 'different', 'angry', 'very', 'young', 'different', 'back', 'loud', 'quiet', 'indifferent', 'flawless', 'angry', 'most', 'least', 'easy', 'same', 'enough', 'great', 'more', 'good', 'great', 'perfect', 'fantastic', 'sure', 'old', 'new', 'little'];0.2305786589297227
201;rdoyle29;there's some interesting alchemy going on in this film. while it's extremely realistic in it's look and attention to detail, it's a highly stylized and somewhat mechanical film. all the characters are clearly defined by the single aspect they bring to the scenario and they interact more like types than real people. the story doesn't show you what's on it's mind, it flat out tells you by putting the parts of it's thesis into the mouths of the characters. none of this really matters though because between it's exceptional cast and lumet's masterful direction. what you get is a finely tuned machine of a film that's the best film ever made of it's kind. fonda specialized in playing the voice of middle-class intellectual liberalism in the early 60's and it's largely because of his performance here.;9 September 2017;10;['interesting', 'realistic', 'mechanical', 'single', 'real', 'flat', 'exceptional', 'masterful', 'good', 'kind', 'middle', 'intellectual', 'early'];0.3567640692640692

204;alicecbr;"12 men in a jury room: no women in 1957, of course. fonda played it great, as did the screenwriter: no pressure, just let them come to their own conclusions. put enough pressure on the bastards, so they show their asses and then the nice guys will see the light and change their verdict. loved that they showed the equivocator and the one who wanted to get to the ball game, so he voted not guilty .....but were also shown up for what they were. the prejudiced guy making his bigoted pitch, with all the folks standing up and turning their backs: obviously, this was not birmingham jury. when you look at the lynchers who were acquitted by all-white juries, you know that henry fonda couldn't have made a damn with them. when i was attacked on the boston red line by a drunken thug who took my peace sign and jammed me in the stomach with it, then ignored by the mbta police on the platform, i knew how it must feel to be a black man in 1950s alabama and try to get justice. when we went to quincy court, the cops all circled round the guy and read his girlfriend's testimony to the clerk. it wasn't even carried over to the d.a. when i objected that the testimony presented wasn't even mine, the clerk said, ""it doesn't have to be. you may be the victim but you're only a witness as far as the state is concerned. and the cop could use anyone's testimony."" but the impression was that it was my testimony, not the thug's girlfriend's. so this was an idealization of justice moving along toward the correct verdict. . the jury foreman was key: if he had been dictatorial, it would never have gotten to the point of free exchange. because he was passive, fonda was able to take over. i doubt that this was at all realistic. that's why they choose jurors without college educations: so the ignorant can be swayed by the lawyers. these jurors were evenly divided, with the less well educated being the more ethical, interestingly enough. lee j cobb, as the father of the estranged son, and the last holdout, did a magnificent job as a bitter angry man, who would have liked to send the kid to the chair out of his own anger. fonda was great as the jesus figure. too bad he couldn't have brought a little more of that to his daughter, jane. the weather also starred in this movie: the heat added to the pressure. when fonda helps the various jurors open or shut the windows, he also subconsciously makes them his allies in his fight for truth. the screenwriter did well to keep him neutral. he doesn't know if the kid did it: he just wants them to discuss the situation before they kill him. in the course of the discussion, the jurors actually create a trial that didn't exist. interesting legal question: can you judge a man by the inferences you draw from what may or may not have been said at the trial? in other words, is it 'legal' to use means other than what the defense did to acquit the defendant? a trick that wasn't used: no body died. i thought for sure the old guy or the angry guy would have a heart attack in the heat, and they would have to bring in one of the alternates, adding to the character study. great movie. i""m sure when i see it again, i'll find even more in it. but i did love how the casper milquetoasts were empowered to find their own voices. easy to see why this is one of the greatest movies of all time. the writer was magnificent and i don't even remember his name.!!!!! fonda without a good script would be paris hilton.";17 June 2006;10;['great', 'own', 'enough', 'nice', 'guilty', 'prejudiced', 'bigoted', 'white', 'red', 'drunken', 'black', 'correct', 'key', 'dictatorial', 'free', 'passive', 'able', 'realistic', 'ignorant', 'ethical', 'estranged', 'last', 'magnificent', 'bitter', 'angry', 'own', 'great', 'bad', 'little', 'more', 'various', 'open', 'neutral', 'interesting', 'legal', 'other', 'legal', 'other', 'old', 'angry', 'great', 'sure', 'more', 'own', 'easy', 'great', 'magnificent', 'good'];0.2460470085470085

207;TheHonestCritic;"""12 angry men"" (1957), i have heard people go nuts over this ""film"", time and time again. the hype was insane between everyone i've heard who mentioned anything about it or anything related to it. so, i finally gave in and put it on. what a major disappointment! it is, without a shadow of a doubt, one of the top 10 most boring films i've ever seen in my life. i've seen a lot of dull and boring movies, but this ""film"" excels at both of those aspects. this ""movie"" has a boring story, standard to horrible acting and a generic dull soundtrack. as far as the story goes, it's one of the most uninteresting, boring, unnecessary and unbearable i've ever seen. it's only 96 minutes, but it felt like i was watching it for days! the storyline is, 12 jurors argue on whether a person is guilty or not guilty. seriously, that's the whole movie, just 12 boring characters sitting in a boring room talking. how riveting! right? you might as well hide a couple of video cameras in a jury room and press record, same thing! now, i have seen movies before that take place in a single setting from beginning to end. some were good, some were bad. ""12 angry men"" is probably one of the worst examples of how not to make a film taking place in the same location. it was so dull, that i could barely fight to keep my eyes open! another big issue is lack of character development. the main characters are cast as: juror 1, juror 2, etc. yes, we do find out their names at the end when they introduce themselves. that's one of the biggest cardinal rules when making a movie or tv show, character development. this ""movie"" has virtually none of that. the only positive about this ""film"" is that it somehow inspired a lot of tributes and parodies on tv shows. those were so much more entertaining than this pile of filth! before you guys tell me, ""it's realistic, this movie is supposed to be as close to a real-life scenario as possible."" i'm all for movies with realism. when done right, it can be very effective! ""12 angry men"" is a little bit too real. wow, i never thought i'd hear myself say that! overall, the plot of this ""movie"" is so bad, that describing my feelings toward it as angry is an understatement. that's one of the two worst things a film can do; anger me, or bore me. ""12 angry men"" does both! as far as the acting goes, it's just as bad, unfortunately. from the whole entire cast! the only ones who actually seem to be trying are henry fonda, e.g. marshall, martin balsam and jack warden. all of the rest of the performances were either bad or just plain boring. it's a real pity, because all of these actors are great in other movies and tv shows. what happened here? finally, the soundtrack in this ""movie"" is overall very generic and not memorable in the least. there are a couple of parts of the film score that aren't too bad. the opening theme during the opening credits and the ending theme. as for the rest of the soundtrack, it's just a failing pile of trash. now, let's get to the positive elements in this ""film"". yes, surprisingly, this ""movie"" has some good things in it. all of the sets/locations and the special effects are good. the only thing that almost cost the sets/locations star is that it is in black and white. that just accentuates the boredom of the environment. but, it suits the story, or lack thereof, in this ""movie"". so, i still give it a pass at the end of the day. finally, the special effects are good and still hold up to this day. my only nitpick is that all of the words in the opening and closing credits are all lower case. did a kid write the titles and credits? or, did someone forget to capitalize? ""12 angry men"" has found a place on my most disappointing films list and most boring films list. it's a real shame, because i really tried so hard to like it. but, it did next to nothing for me. i'm struggling to rate this ""film"" 2 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 imdb stars. just stay away from ""12 angry men"", it sucks, plain and simple. the sad thing is, that there are schmucks out there who like it, and some even consider it to be their favorite movie! why? what are you all drinking? god forbid any of you watch an exciting movie, you may have a heart attack!

210;roghache;this is surely the most famous film jury drama, quite riveting in its dialogue, its claustrophobic jury deliberation room setting, its brilliantly depicted characters, its atmosphere of oppressive heat and tension between these jurors. the twelve angry men are admittedly largely one dimensional stereotypes but they are brought vividly to life by a star studded cast including henry fonda, e.g. marshall, leo j. cobb, and jack klugman. the jurors include an arrogant stockbroker, a stressed out man from a poor social background, a wise and endearing old gentleman, a quiet and respectful immigrant, an extreme bigot, a loud and pushy businessman with son issues, an advertising executive who sees everything in terms of sales, and a sports fan interested only in getting out in time to see his ballgame. the jury foreman tries to keep the group organized but isn't a particularly bright or thoughtful man himself and seems in over his depth. the (supposed at least) hero of the piece is the intelligent juror number 8, an architect, who appears to take his responsibilities seriously. he encourages full discussion of the evidence when others seem happy to return an immediate guilty verdict for a young hispanic defendant accused of fatally stabbing his abusive father. as a result of this juror's persuasive powers, the vote changes from 11-1 for guilty to a unanimous final not guilty verdict. no one would be interested in watching a movie about twelve calm jurors politely and rationally debating the evidence. thus we have this drama which makes for compelling viewing but isn't for those preferring some degree of subtlety. the case itself is ultra dramatic 'all or nothing', acquittal or the death penalty with no possibility of life imprisonment. juror 8 has illegally purchased a duplicate knife to the murder weapon and slams it dramatically on the table. these jurors are constantly bickering. one juror threatens to kill another. eventually the other jurors all turn their backs one by one on the bigot. surely this must be a textbook example of everything a jury should not be! while real life jurors do bring their prejudices and life experiences into the jury room, some of these jurors were simply too unbelievable. for example, 'the bigot' seemed to flaunt his bigotry at every turn rather than, as would be much more realistic, making some effort to conceal it. i believe one would need to look far and wide to find a juror with so little regard for human life that he would happily send a possibly innocent kid off to the electric chair rather than miss his ballgame. as for juror number 8, at first i admired his sense of responsibility and calm, reasoned questioning. however, by the end of the movie, after he had raised doubts (whether reasonable or not is up to individual interpretation) about every single piece of evidence and testimony, i no longer saw him as the heroic champion of justice we're manipulated into believing, but almost felt as though he had some agenda of his own to acquit and would never convict anyone of any crime, whatever the evidence! this jury didn't rationally debate the case at all but as juror 8 would raise some 'doubt', one or other juror would suddenly change his vote, ignoring all the other evidence. a good case could be made that this jury let a murderer go free because they lost sight of the cumulative nature of the evidence as a whole. while this movie is often classed as a character study, a psychological drama, or a study in small group dynamics, it's also considered a commentary on the american jury system. as such, i feel that the writers should have 'done their homework' and had these jurors follow standard jury instructions rather than the gross jury misconduct they displayed -- juror 8 doing his own independent research by purchasing that knife, their questionable little experiment with the old man's rate of walking, their improper acceptance of one of their number as a switchblade 'expert' and taking his opinion of stabbing techniques as gospel. if all this had become known to court officials in real life, this grievous misconduct would almost certainly have resulted in a mistrial. i also felt the movie quite manipulative in casting a defendant who could hardly be more sympathetic, a young kid with poor social opportunities, the victim of bigotry and paternal abuse. what viewer would ever want this boy to receive the death penalty? this film would have packed a greater punch for me if the defendant had been a rather despicable character (or at least neutral in terms of sympathy factor), yet the jury been able to acquit him anyway due to finding reasonable doubt. therefore, while this film is a 'must see' classic, a thoroughly engaging way to spend an hour and a half, and a masterpiece by comparison with most modern movies, i don't consider it flawless. at least in my case, it hasn't held up well during subsequent viewings and further scrutiny. entertaining, yes, but i have a big problem with its clearly intended message that this jury, which i see as a lynch mob-turned-group of pushovers, has ultimately served the cause of justice.;24 April 2009;8;['famous', 'riveting', 'claustrophobic', 'oppressive', 'angry', 'dimensional', 'arrogant', 'poor', 'social', 'wise', 'endearing', 'old', 'quiet', 'respectful', 'extreme', 'loud', 'pushy', 'interested', 'bright', 'thoughtful', 'least', 'intelligent', 'full', 'happy', 'immediate', 'guilty', 'young', 'hispanic', 'abusive', 'persuasive', 'guilty', 'unanimous', 'final', 'guilty', 'interested', 'calm', 'compelling', 'ultra', 'dramatic', 'duplicate', 'other', 'real', 'unbelievable', 'realistic', 'wide', 'little', 'human', 'innocent', 'electric', 'reasonable', 'individual', 'single', 'heroic', 'own', 'other', 'other', 'good', 'free', 'cumulative', 'psychological', 'small', 'american', 'such', 'standard', 'gross', 'own', 'independent', 'questionable', 'little', 'old', 'improper', 'real', 'grievous', 'manipulative', 'sympathetic', 'young', 'poor', 'social', 'paternal', 'great', 'despicable', 'least', 'neutral', 'able', 'reasonable', 'engaging', 'most', 'modern', 'flawless', 'least', 'subsequent', 'further', 'entertaining', 'big'];0.1057915057915058

217;Danny_G13;"deceptively complex courtroom drama enthrals for the duration as one man opposes eleven others in a battle of argument, reason, and logic. starring henry fonda as juror #8, 12 angry men is a very claustrophobic drama which conveys the deliberation room of a trial where the defendant is accused of first-degree murder. on the surface the case seems open and shut, with 11 of the 12 jurors entirely convinced by the prosecution's case. only one dissenter remains, and that is henry fonda's juror #8. specifically he is not certain that the boy is definitely innocent, just that he doesn't know, and that for him is enough to qualify as reasonable doubt. 12 angry men certainly is a moralistic tale, of the right to a fair trial and trying to give someone every chance, but it has many more strings to its bow than just this. indeed, above all else it prides itself in endeavouring to portray a true sense of reasoned and rational argument which tries to overcome steadfast beliefs as possessed by the seemingly unshakable. initially it may seem that fonda's juror is simply playing devil's advocate, but it becomes clear that it is more about standing up for what you believe despite what the facts seem to tell you. the more you scrutinise so-called unshakable evidence, the more you find holes in it, and the more that logical analysis seems to provide the real answers. obviously, juror #8 has to persuade those others who seem to have their own agenda, and pre-conceived notions of what truth equals, but nevertheless it is absolutely fascinating seeing how simply he probes the case and reveals the flaws. the whole movie's pace is absolutely perfect, and given its almost exclusive setting of inside the deliberation room it is a testament to the genius of the script and the brilliance of the acting that the duration of the film seems so short. the cinematography is also surprisingly excellent given the lack of scope necessary, with sharp imagery and clever camera-work which gives the whole picture a real amount of life. to detail the jurors themselves; juror #1 reluctantly appoints himself foreman. he appears to lack esteem, and the chance to boss the table by being the 'leader' perversely appeals greatly to him as he lacks significant contribution to make about the case. he does not want to be useless, so is forced to take charge. juror #2 is a slight man who is clearly used to being wrapped in his own cocoon, never deviating, so when he ends up as a juror in a murder trial, he is actually thrilled at his fish out of water status. he does not really have much to say about the case, taking it at face value. juror #3 is the enduring messenger service owner. may have an ulterior motive for being so steadfastly sure the accused is guilty, given his first scene depicts ambivalence over the courtroom procedure given to him it is 'open and shut'. as time goes on, and evidence starts to suggest more than meets the eye, he begins to show emotional stress as his hardwired opinion looks flimsier. but he refuses to cave. juror #4 has more emotional attachment to the trial than most, as he shares the same kind of background to the defendant and takes criticism of 'that kind of person' extremely personally. experiences inner conflict between head and heart. juror #5 is a cold and methodical thinker who has an elevated opinion of himself. emerges more as the deliberations wear on, he is convinced by the evidence that the boy is guilty, and systematically sets about conveying this to the others. juror #6 is the common working man with very little input, and whose two significant moments are to defend another juror who is being harassed, and to suggest another juror is badly wrong about his opinion. juror #7 is more interested in the ball game at 8pm than the case. doesn't want to be there, and while he details a little about the boy's background to start off with, his regular sarcastic quips throughout the story suggest he is simply desperate to be out of there as quickly as possible, with no care about the wheels of justice. juror #8 is the only juror who does not immediately join the others with their guilty verdict. he has a lot of thought about the case eating at him, and wishes to explore it. he meets much opposition. juror #9 is a wise, wiley old man who is sharper than anyone else and observed events in the courtroom closer than the others. makes some smart observations which unearth vital truths. juror #10 is an old school racist whose opinion is based on prejudice and not facts. a vile and odious creature, he has no interest in 'people like that' roaming the streets, and is offended at having to live in the same city as them. juror #11 is an intelligent and interested spectator who listens to the facts and analyses them before reaching a conclusion. his european accent draws derision from some others, as does his general nationality, but he rises above it and provides some sensible comments, rarely saying anything which lacks thought. juror #12 is a good-natured man but not a terribly strong thinker. he does not have much of an independent opinion on the case, often following others, and is often more interested in playing naughts and crosses or boring fellow jurors about his job. overall, 12 angry men is simply as good as cinema can get. incredible script, amazing performances, and captivating direction. highly recommended.";28 May 2007;10;['complex', 'angry', 'claustrophobic', 'first', 'open', 'certain', 'innocent', 'enough', 'reasonable', 'angry', 'moralistic', 'fair', 'many', 'more', 'true', 'reasoned', 'rational', 'steadfast', 'unshakable', 'clear', 'unshakable', 'more', 'logical', 'real', 'own', 'pre', 'conceived', 'fascinating', 'whole', 'perfect', 'exclusive', 'short', 'excellent', 'necessary', 'sharp', 'clever', 'whole', 'real', 'significant', 'useless', 'slight', 'own', 'much', 'ulterior', 'sure', 'guilty', 'first', 'open', 'more', 'emotional', 'hardwired', 'flimsy', 'emotional', 'most', 'same', 'inner', 'cold', 'methodical', 'elevated', 'more', 'guilty', 'common', 'little', 'significant', 'wrong', 'interested', 'little', 'regular', 'sarcastic', 'desperate', 'possible', 'only', 'guilty', 'much', 'wise', 'wiley', 'old', 'sharp', 'observed', 'smart', 'vital', 'old', 'vile', 'odious', 'same', 'intelligent', 'interested', 'general', 'sensible', 'good', 'natured', 'strong', 'much', 'independent', 'interested', 'boring', 'fellow', 'angry', 'good', 'incredible', 'amazing'];0.1366805813234384
218;mmallon4;"i don't think i can bestow a higher statement of praise on a film than to call it a life-changing experience. 12 angry men influenced me not to believe everything i hear, instead to question things and ultimately turning me into a more skeptical person; there is more to life than meets the eye (or ear). it's one of few films which helped shape who i am as a person. when watching it i constantly visualise the details in my head of the events and locations of the murder case being described. at the beginning of the film, all the jurors bar one believe the boy in question is guilty of murdering his father. by the end of the film, they all change their vote to not guilty. how is this possible? why just the most incredible 90-minute exhibition of human psychology and argumentation. i enjoy never knowing what really happened; did the kid commit murder or not? - it's up for the viewer to decide. 12 angry men is a movie that is hard to write a review for; i wouldn't be surprised if i come back to add more since i find myself watching 12 angry men at least once a year. with layer upon layer upon layer, this is a movie i could talk about hours, and always finding new aspects to discuss on each viewing. as the exposition reveals more details of the case i am left saying in the words of milhouse van houten, ""tell me more!"". - ah the pure joy of an engrossing, wordy, civil debate. on every viewing of 12 angry men i find myself focusing on a different character. i'd have to watch the 12 times in order to fully explore every character, all representative of personalities we're likely to encounter in real life'; i'm sure i've encountered each one at some point in my life. this is a movie that needed a cast comprised of character actors (aside from henry fonda) in order to create such distinct personalities - the characters are believable without being two-dimensional stereotypes. not all of them leave prejudice at the door; it's more obvious with some than others. not all of them really take much interest in the case or have much pride being part of a jury and even treating it as a bit of a joke at times; even the judge at the beginning doesn't to be very enthusiastic about the case at hand. they even display different levels of confidence and surety in their opinions - when every juror announces they have changed their mind you can see on their faces how difficult that admission is. 12 angry men provides possibly the best cinematic insight into group conflict and argumentation. like with a jury or a classroom full of people, this large variety of personalities are unlikely to converge elsewhere in a small space for a period of time in which they have to communicate with each other, such as what john hughes would explore with his teen detention drama in 1985 with the breakfast club. you really get a sense of who likes who and who doesn't as the heat beats down in that claustrophobic space. director sidney lumet made the cast spend time with each other before filming and it certainly helped. i don't feel like i'm watching actors, i feel like i'm watching a group of everyday people in a jury. as not all us states at the time opened their doors to having women present within juires; the film is not 12 angry men and women. i imagine the feminine point of few would have influenced the examination of the proceedings; just think of grace kelly's female instincts from rear window. the cast: juror #1 (martin balsam): the jury foreman. he doesn't express any opinion or reasons for changing his vote, taking a neutral stance and moderates the proceedings. juror #2 (john fiedler): nerdy and socially awkward; reminds me of rick moranis. i find it interesting that he is placed sitting beside lee j. cobb's juror #3 as the two are polar opposites. he finds it difficult to articulate an opinion at first but grows confidence and later stands up to the other jurors. juror #3 (lee j. cobb): lee j. cobb is my favourite of the cast, in my view being the most interesting and complex character with the biggest ark as the opinionated and brash antagonist, juror #3; ultimately stealing the show. he seems fair and rational at first until we gradually discover he wants to boy on trial found guilty for personal reasons. he is by far the most confrontational juror as he contests every single rebuttal thrown his way and never concedes a good point. this is a strategy that even leads him to shoot himself in the foot when he destroys his own argument by frantically stating ""he was an old man, half the time he was confused, how could be positive about anything?"" juror #3's breakdown at the end is a highlight in a film full of awe-inspiring performances. his angry outburst to fonda that he'll kill him followed by fonda's response of ""you don't really mean you'll kill me, do you?"", is surely one of the greatest zingers in cinema history. juror #4 (e. g. marshall): a cold-hearted individual which is reflected by his wearing of a jacket throughout the whole 90 minutes despite the heat. he is a metaphorical representation of cold, hard facts. he is arguably the most competent and restrained debater and also a bit of a 'know it all' which makes it all the more interesting and satisfying when he changes his vote. likewise, the movies and stars mentioned during his cross-examination by juror #8 are not real (yes i looked them up). juror #5 (jack klugman): comes from a slum background although his appearance doesn't suggest this. he even votes guilty on two occasions despite the boy on trail coming from his same background. his decision to change his vote could have been influenced by the accusation from juror #3 (both still being a member of the guilty party at this point) that he had changed his vote due to sharing the same background the boy on trial, when in fact he hadn't changed his vote. juror #6 (edward binns): the most normal juror, doesn't stand out - a very regular john doe. he even states he's not a ""supposing man"" and that his boss does all the supposing. he doesn't have anything to add when asked for his opinion, just repeating points that have already been made in an unsure manner. juror #7 (jack warden): clearly doesn't want to be there, doesn't care about the case and even bullies and tries to intimidate other jurors. he has no respect for the grounds with his gum-chewing and litter throwing and although he never outright says he wants to leave and go to the ball game which he has tickets for, it's painfully obvious from the beginning what his true intent is. juror #8/davis (henry fonda): the film's protagonist and the outsider of the jury. a soft-spoken and rarely confrontational man who is brave enough to stand up to the collective and going against popular opinion, even when the rest of them get frustrated with him. fonda like in many of his movies is a beacon of truth and justice here, but he doesn't come off as unbelievable saintly - even with his wearing of a white suit. the scene in which he puts his knife in the table is a gasping moment if there ever was one. juror #9/mccardle (joseph sweeney): the most elderly member of the jury. juror #1 states he should be respected because of that, and i believe this is deserved because of his knowledge as well as his confidence in juror #8. juror #10 (ed begley): the most obviously bigoted member of the jury and thus ultimately doesn't prove to be a huge help to the proceedings with talking out of turn multiple tie, his prejudiced rants or his hypocrisy in defending the woman's statement despite her also being ""one of them too"". at one point he even suggests telling a funny story he heard rather than discussing the case and eventually gets expelled from the table when his bigotry is denied an audience juror #11 (george voskovec): an eastern european immigrant (possibly from behind the iron curtain) who takes more pride in the american justice system as well as democracy than any of the american members of the jury, even defending it such as when juror #10 demands that juror #5 reveals his voting choice. likewise, i love his statement to juror #2 in response to what side he is on: ""i don't believe i have to be loyal to one side or the other, i'm simply asking questions"". juror #11 is a watchmaker who regularly points out the time. ah, i see what you did there movie! juror #12 (robert webber): a huckster in the advertising business which makes sense as he himself has a very manufactured look. i get the impression he represents 1950's conformity with his appearance, looking like a character from a rock hudson/doris day comedy with his very 50's glasses and hair. he goes along with the crowd, even changing his vote more than once. is jury duty really this incredible in the real world? at the end of 12 angry men i wonder if the jurors are aware that they've just experienced probably the most incredible 90 minutes of their lives.";24 March 2018;10;['high', 'angry', 'skeptical', 'more', 'few', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'possible', 'incredible', 'human', 'angry', 'hard', 'surprised', 'more', 'angry', 'least', 'new', 'more', 'more', 'pure', 'wordy', 'civil', 'angry', 'different', 'likely', 'real', 'sure', 'such', 'distinct', 'believable', 'dimensional', 'obvious', 'much', 'much', 'enthusiastic', 'different', 'difficult', 'angry', 'cinematic', 'full', 'large', 'unlikely', 'small', 'other', 'such', 'claustrophobic', 'other', 'everyday', 'present', 'angry', 'feminine', 'few', 'female', 'rear', 'neutral', 'nerdy', 'awkward', 'interesting', 'polar', 'difficult', 'other', 'interesting', 'complex', 'big', 'opinionated', 'brash', 'fair', 'rational', 'guilty', 'personal', 'confrontational', 'single', 'good', 'own', 'old', 'positive', 'full', 'angry', 'great', 'cold', 'hearted', 'whole', 'metaphorical', 'cold', 'hard', 'competent', 'restrained', 'interesting', 'real', 'guilty', 'same', 'guilty', 'same', 'normal', 'regular', 'supposing', 'other', 'obvious', 'true', 'soft', 'spoken', 'confrontational', 'brave', 'popular', 'many', 'unbelievable', 'white', 'elderly', 'huge', 'multiple', 'prejudiced', 'funny', 'eastern', 'european', 'more', 'american', 'such', 'loyal', 'other', 'manufactured', 'very', 'incredible', 'real', 'angry', 'aware', 'incredible'];0.0319054048261969

221;Rockwell_Cronenberg;"what is there to be said that hasn't already been said? it's earned it's status as a classic for a reason. while i wouldn't go so far as to call it one of the greatest of all time, it is a vastly entertaining take on a brilliant premise that has been used throughout the decades sense. the dialogue is sharp, the character turns are believable and interesting and the whole thing flows along at a swift pace. when it was over i couldn't believe that so much time had gone by. i'm always fascinated by films that take place entirely in one location (or almost entirely) and this was one of the early precedents for the kind of greatness one can accomplish when that is utilized properly. the ominous surroundings like the heat and the storm add nice bits of tension to the rising tempers of the men in the room and the confrontations between the soft henry fonda and the explosive lee j. cobb were intense. sidney lumet is a man who earned his reputation as an ""actor's director"" and made his career out of mostly setting up the stage and aiding his actors in doing what they do best, but i think his stylistic choices here deserve to be commended. the way that he slowly brings the camera down over the course of the film, bringing us more intimately into the heart of this room, it adds that sense of claustrophobia that makes the tension even more gripping as we proceed into the later stages of it all. practically everyone in the cast shines at one point or another, my favorites being the commanding fonda who is able to be the voice of reason without being annoying, the pensive e.g. marshall, the racist and volatile ed begley and the wise, determined joseph sweeney. the film had plenty of great twists, like the knife reveal, but my favorite scene had to be begley going off on his offensive monologue while one-by-one the jurors turned away from him until he realized that his ignorance had caused him to lose any voice he once had; a powerfully real moment. i also loved the added touch of putting fonda in an all white suit while everyone else was in shades of black or grey.";21 February 2012;7;['great', 'entertaining', 'brilliant', 'sharp', 'believable', 'interesting', 'whole', 'swift', 'much', 'early', 'ominous', 'nice', 'soft', 'explosive', 'intense', 'stylistic', 'gripping', 'later', 'able', 'annoying', 'pensive', 'volatile', 'wise', 'great', 'favorite', 'offensive', 'real', 'white', 'black'];0.3154166666666667

224;jcbutthead86;12 angry men is one of the greatest films ever made and an excellent and unforgettable classic from sidney lumet that combines amazing direction,a terrific cast,a wonderful script and a fantastic score making 12 angry men one of my favorite films,sidney lumet at his best and cinema at it's best. set in new york city,12 angry men tells the story of 12 jurors who have to decide the fate of a young boy who's been accused of murdering his father. while the 11 other jurors think the boy's guilty and the case is open and shut,one juror,juror#8(henry fonda)isn't so sure and think they should discuss the case and change the other jurors including juror#3(lee j. cobb)verdicts and convince the jurors that the boy is not guilty. 12 angry men is a brilliant classic that marked the directorial debut of director sidney lumet and also gave viewers one of the finest courtroom dramas ever made. what separates 12 angry men from other courtroom dramas is the setting because where other courtroom dramas take place in and out of the courtroom,12 angry en takes place mostly inside of a jury room. right from the moment when the characters enter the jury room viewers are given an riveting and powerful film that has no gunfights,explosions,fist fights or car chases but is one of the most intense and emotionally charged films of all time. when you watch 12 angry men you are in the minds of the 12 jurors who are making a choice about a persons life whether they decide that the young boy is guilty or not testing our thoughts and what would we do if we were in a situation like that. 12 angry men not only succeeds as a court room drama but as a character study as well because as we watch the film and see all 12 of the jurors we see who they really are outside of the jury room bringing their personal feelings about who they are whether it's about the case or how they feel about each other and the characters are well-developed and interesting. the film also deals with themes such as racism and prejudice in a intelligent and thoughtful way that is still powerful and relevant. another thing i love about 12 angry men is the visually stunning photography and atmosphere. boris kaufman's black and white photography is beautiful and haunting adding to the movie's intensity and as emotions run high the photography becomes more dreary and dark. i also love the fact that most of the movie takes place in one room which gives the movie a claustrophobic feel and as 12 angry men keeps going the room becomes more enclosed and isolated where you feel like the characters will never get out. also,the fact that 12 angry men takes place on a hot and humid day adds to the tension of the main characters because the jurors are not angry just because of the decision they have to make as jurors but also the heat. when you watch this film you will feel the heat coming of the screen. all the jurors are great characters but the two who are the most fascinating are jurors number#8 and #3 because both pretty much represent the voices of the film. juror #8 isn't convinced that the boy is guilty wanting to talk to the other jurors and convince them by asking questions and making a case. you will root and relate to juror#8 because of his determination and persistence that never stops. where as juror#8 thinks the boy isn't guilty,juror#3 is convinced right away that the boy is guilty from the start not just because of the facts presented in the case but because of the things going on in his personal life that affects his decision and when the other jurors are talking about the case juror #3 explodes with anger and rage not understanding why would they continue with this case. juror#8 and #3 are classic and unforgettable characters who anchor the film and have a complexity that adds to the film. the screenplay by reginald rose is terrific,with rose giving the characters memorable dialog as well as scenes that are amazing and will stick with viewers. the ending of 12 angry men is fantastic and in my opinion one of the best endings in movie history with non-stop greatness and intensity that you will never forget. a powerful and outstanding conclusion. the whole cast is amazing in their roles. henry fonda is excellent and at his best as juror#8,with fonda bringing depth and a heroic quality to the role. lee j. cobb is brilliant and fiery in one of my favorite performances in film history as juror#3,with cobb bringing intensity,anger and complexity to the role and having great scenes with fonda. e.g marshall is terrific as juror#4,an intelligent stockbroker. joseph sweeney is wonderful as juror#9,an observant and elderly juror. ed begley is riveting as juror#10,a man full of racism,hate and prejudice. jack warden is outstanding as juror#7,with warden bringing humor to the film. jack klugman is fantastic as juror#12,a man with a slum background. george voskovic is sensational as juror#11,a european juror. john fiedler(juror#2),martin balsam(juror#1,the foreman),robert webber(juror#12)and edward binns(juror#6)give great performances as well. the direction by sidney lumet is amazing and stylish,with lumet constantly moving the camera and showing close-ups,over head shots keeping the film moving at an incredible pace with a wonderful visual style. terrific direction,lumet. the score kenyon hopkins is great,memorable and intense and matches the film's tone. amazing score,hopkins. in final word,if you love sidney lumet,henry fonda,courtroom dramas or cinema,i highly suggest you see 12 angry men,an excellent and unforgettable classic that you will watch again and again. highly recommended. 10/10.;18 January 2014;10;['angry', 'great', 'excellent', 'unforgettable', 'amazing',

226;gpeevers;"an incredible film that is even more incredible for the fact that it was filmed almost entirely in one small room and was made on a surprisingly small budget. the film did have a top hollywood star in henry fonda but while director sidney lumet would go on to an amazing career this was his first work outside of television. the film earned 3 important oscar nominations for best film, best direction and best writing but would lose all three categories to bridge on the river kwai and was not successful at the box office. despite all this more than 50 years later this film currently sits at #5 on the imdb top 250 films of all time, a position that i believe is justified. the film is essentially the story of a jury deliberation of a murder case involving a hispanic youth that initially appears to be clear cut until one man raises questions mostly to ensure that everyone has given the case their full consideration, when doubts arise the tempers flare and the prejudices of some jury member's surface. now instead of an exercise in fair play we have the juror's undertaking a decision that will determine the fate of a young man whose innocence becomes more and more likely. the most effective aspects of lumet's direction are making a film that is almost entirely dialogue in one room incredibly compelling and making that single set dramatic and effective. the tension mounts through out the film as the deliberation nears it conclusion and lumet adjusts the cameras and the lenses to build a feeling of claustrophobia in the small extremely hot jury room. the other major contributor was reginald rose who wrote the screenplay and co-produced the film with fonda. in addition to fonda in what i believe is his best career performance we have host of recognizable faces including; martin balsam, lee j cobb, e.g. marshall, jack warden, ed begley and one very recognizable voice is john fiedler who better known as the voice of piglet in winnie the pooh.";1 April 2019;10;['incredible', 'incredible', 'small', 'small', 'top', 'amazing', 'first', 'important', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'successful', 'more', 'hispanic', 'full', 'fair', 'young', 'likely', 'effective', 'compelling', 'single', 'dramatic', 'effective', 'lumet', 'small', 'hot', 'other', 'major', 'good', 'recognizable', 'recognizable'];0.3338875205254515

235;thespeos;"i don't agree with the lavish praises and rating for this excellent film. yes, the acting is on point, but largely by imposing characterizations on predisposed personalities. here's my breakdown: story: the story takes the common courtroom drama and moves into the jury room, where the real trial occurs. this was a bold move to essentially do a one-room film, and it was done so successfully. but i don't see the story itself as exceptional. did it push the bounds of the civil rights movement? perhaps. but remember, these actors (as all do) returned to their opulent lives, e.g. fonda, and continued on. so trying to convey fonda, or his ""quiet strength,"" as some moral high ground is a veneer. this story is not any great testament to democracy or civil rights. a far, far more telling story would be ""to kill a mockingbird,"" or ""in the heat of the night."" these are far more sweeping stories as to racism, injustice, and the mountainous strain it places on oppressed peoples. acting: yes, it's an all-star cast. but i don't see any of them moving outside their normal personalities. this is why i say these were easy characterizations wrapped around existing personalities, e.g. cobb, fonda, et al. tempo: the pace is perfect for the subject, but younger viewers might get bored cinematography: not much to say - it's a room directing / writing: lumet was not the hero that many tout him as. this film and ""fail safe"" are excellent films, but aside from these he directed almost entirely tv crap. ditto on the writer as well ... not much depth and near pure tv hack. i'll grant them this was an excellent work together, but otherwise i don't see great talent. is it a very good film? yes. should you watch this once? yes. rating 7.7.";25 February 2022;8;['lavish', 'excellent', 'common', 'real', 'bold', 'exceptional', 'civil', 'opulent', 'quiet', 'moral', 'high', 'great', 'civil', 'sweeping', 'mountainous', 'normal', 'easy', 'perfect', 'young', 'bored', 'much', 'many', 'safe', 'excellent', 'much', 'pure', 'excellent', 'great', 'good'];0.4362142857142856

246;brianberta;this debut feature is a gripping and engaging courtroom drama which is very effective. after i watched it once, i wanted to watch it again. a boy is accused of murdering his father. the twelve jurors retire to the jury room to determine whether he's innocent or guilty. only 1 of them thinks he's not guilty and he has to persuade the other men why he thinks so. i personally found this to be extremely amazing. the movie was able to keep my attention for the whole way through. it was interesting seeing the men say counter arguments back and forth. also, 1 of the jurors appears to be a sadist who just wants the boy to be put to death regardless of what evidence he's presented with. in my opinion, he is the best character in the movie because his acting performance makes him a very convincing character. speaking of the acting, it was strong on all parts. as i said, juror #3 (lee j. cobb) gave the best performance in the movie. however, there are several more actors who did a great job as well. jurors #8 (henry fonda) and #9 (joseph sweeney) gave exceptional performances and the other 9 jurors gave convincing performances also. i don't think that they could've given a much better performance. also, i found the movie to be very easy to follow. it gives a brief explanation of its plot at the beginning so everyone knows what's going on right before the 12 jurors meet. also, the movie was very well-written. the fictional murder case set up was well and it contained a lot of elaborate plot points to it which were brought up during the movie. i can see why this movie has gotten as much praise as it has now. it is one of the most engaging and tense movies i've ever seen. the tension doesn't really come from action like many other movies do. the tension comes from the arguments brought up and how the jurors behave. i just watched this movie yesterday and i already want to watch it again. so far, this is one of my favorite movies of all time and it might even had the ability to become my #1 favorite. i'll just wait and see.;28 September 2015;9;['gripping', 'effective', 'innocent', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'other', 'amazing', 'able', 'whole', 'interesting', 'good', 'convincing', 'strong', 'good', 'several', 'more', 'great', 'exceptional', 'other', 'convincing', 'well', 'easy', 'brief', 'fictional', 'elaborate', 'much', 'engaging', 'tense', 'many', 'other', 'favorite'];0.3043103448275862

248;KissEnglishPasto;this film is my submission as the greatest ensemble cast performance in the history of cinema! as it was released when i was only 9 years old.... i have viewed it on multiple occasions... but to be honest, i cannot remember exactly when i saw it for the first time! i must admit that the intricacies of jury duty selection in the new york area in the 1950's is something of which i know absolutely nothing about.... but i have often wondered if women, for some reason, were exempt from jury duty in new york 65 years ago!?!?!? leaving that issue aside, let's focus on the film itself. some of the actors in the cast, like henry fonda, lee j. cobb and ed begley, were already well known when it was released in 1957. for most of the others, their participation in this classic certainly augmented their stature greatly! although 12 angry men was nominated for best picture, best director and best adapted screenplay, this number 6 highest rated movie of all-time, sadly, struck out at the oscars... winning nary a single golden statuette! i invite any and all of you reading my review to focus on each and every astounding characterization rendered in this movie. with each viewing, i have come to appreciate and savor every detail, of every performance, all the more! as someone who has seen thousands of movies, 12 angry men lets you totally get into the head of each and every character... as almost no other film, before or since! 12, layer by layer, methodically peels away the facade that is part and parcel of our subconcious self-protection and insulation from letting ourselves become too vulnerable and over-exposed to scrutiny by others! if you have never seen 12 angry men... for whatever reason... or reasons... you must place it at the very top of your watch list! if perhaps, you saw it once, twice...or even three time, many years ago... i beseech you to revisit it! i am absolutely certain that you will thank yourself handsomely for doing so!;25 February 2022;10;['great', 'ensemble', 'old', 'multiple', 'honest', 'first', 'exempt', 'known', 'most', 'angry', 'good', 'good', 'high', 'single', 'golden', 'astounding', 'more', 'angry', 'other', 'subconcious', 'vulnerable', 'angry', 'very', 'many', 'certain'];0.1938928571428571
249;illbebackreviews;let me start off by saying that i've actually never seen a black and white film! yes, its hard to believe that. but, i decided to watch this film as it was obviously one of the highest rated films and certainly the title sounded quite interesting. without knowing anything about the movie, i went in to watch it and was stunned! the first ten to fifteen minutes just introduces you to each of the juries in the most interesting way possible. you aren't introduced to them by their names, but you are to remember them by their faces and different personalities. it started off very quietly, and i'll admit...pretty boring. however, as soon as the murder issue was brought into the movie, i felt this sudden urge to watch the movie immediately from start to finish. at this point, i was in. from here on in, its all filled with tension, friendship, loyalty, justice, truth and hatred. its the best drama film i've ever seen, and certainly remains the greatest of the mystery films. what really makes this film stand out as an alone success? its pretty much the way each character is introduced. '12 angry men' is the only film in history, that can give you whole bunches of characters and not give out their names and yet love the characters and the story. the plot is extremely simple and not too much happens, but its the way the film is executed that really stands out. if you think about it, at the end of the film not too many events happen. its just different juries laying out their evidence to jury 3 (mainly) about why the boy could be innocent of the crime of murdering his father. its not a story that shows it from the boys perspective, nor any sort of action. in fact, the whole film takes place in this jury room. wow! other strengths about this film are the incredible dialogue sequences and the masterful acting by each and every single one of the actors. at no point did any actor slack off, not even the old man. speaking of the old man, he, apart from jury 8 (the main jury) is the character i liked most. i also absolutely loved jury 3, the one who detested the boy being innocent. the acting was masterful and his performance is also extremely powerful. i also enjoyed the man who looked a lot like peter cushing, the one who was 'believed' to be the first to say not guilty. he seemed great, as did the foreign jury. pretty much every character was brilliant. '12 angry men', overall, is a clear example that a film does not need to contain extensive amounts of special effects but its the dialogue, the plot, the characters and the acting that makes a film a success. also, the better executed, the better the film and this film has such strength in every one of those aspects. directors like george lucas, should watch movies like '12 angry men' as well as his original star wars trilogy and understand what makes a good film. its not cgi battles (not that they could've done it back then), not the action, not the stupid love story (anakin and padme) and definitely not stupid slapstick humor. '12 angry men' is definitely the greatest black and white film i've seen and its definitely a must see for everyone and deserves a high spot in my top 20;23 November 2012;10;['black', 'white', 'hard', 'high', 'interesting', 'first', 'interesting', 'possible', 'different', 'boring', 'sudden', 'good', 'great', 'alone', 'angry', 'only', 'whole', 'simple', 'much', 'many', 'different', 'innocent', 'whole', 'other', 'incredible', 'masterful', 'single', 'old', 'old', 'main', 'innocent', 'masterful', 'powerful', 'first', 'guilty', 'great', 'foreign', 'brilliant', 'angry', 'clear', 'extensive', 'special', 'well', 'such', 'angry', 'original', 'good', 'not', 'stupid', 'stupid', 'slapstick', 'angry', 'great', 'black', 'white', 'high', 'top'];0.1629304029304029

252;MovieGuy109;12 angry men-****- a masterpiece- directed by: sidney lumet. written by: reginald rose (from his own teleplay), starring: henry fonda, lee j. cobb, e.g marshall, martin balsam, jack warden, john fiedler, jack klugman, edward binns, joseph sweeney, ed begley, george voskovec, robert webber. sidney lumet's first film explores a murder trial from the jury room based off the teleplay of the same name by reginald rose. twelve men debate the fate of a puerto rican teenager on trial for the murder of his father. eleven jurors think he is guilty and one (fonda) thinks he is innocent. the amazing thing about the film is how the film pulls out emotion as well as logic in the trial. the two do not way each other out however. lumet balances the racism and laziness of the eleven jurors with the unbiased nature of fonda's character. reginald rose creates a perfect juror and an ideal protagonist while allowing lumet to add claustrophobia and conflict to add to the film's relatively limited cinematic approach which adds to the experience of the play. lumet's career was not always as successful as his first film and sometimes it was more powerful, but this is certainly not mediocre in any way. it makes better use of cinematic techniques in a theatrical narrative than most films like this. this also serves as one of the many high points in the career of henry fonda and a starting place for a number of character actors such as e.g marshall, ed begley, and jack warden. the impact this film had on lumet and hollywood in general is as great as any film based off a play.;25 November 2011;10;['angry', 'own', 'first', 'same', 'puerto', 'rican', 'guilty', 'innocent', 'amazing', 'other', 'unbiased', 'perfect', 'ideal', 'limited', 'cinematic', 'successful', 'first', 'powerful', 'mediocre', 'well', 'cinematic', 'theatrical', 'most', 'many', 'high', 'such', 'general', 'great'];0.2276488095238095
253;pkzeewiz;i knew this was a popular film, but as i came here to review it tonight i noticed it is currently #7 on imdb's top 250 and with good reason. it has so much to offer and has twelve very unique individuals, they all exploded with personality. i had always wanted to see this movie, but had no idea really what it was going to be about. the title tells me its about a jury obviously, but i didn't know if it would be a trial and then a jury or what. i love how it turned out, i found no flaws in this film. i would give it a perfect 10 but that is reserved for my all-time faves. it quickly goes from the courtroom to the jury room, only showing the young defendant for a brief moment. we never hear the trial but 11 of the men come in and start off about how it is an easy verdict and the kid is guilty case closed! one man (fonda) is not that definite, he is not saying the kid is innocent, he isn't saying he's guilty, he just thinks they should talk about it. they all get mad at fonda but they start talking it out, we then get to hear the case via their discussions. as time passes more and more facts surface and they start to change their votes one by one. i personally was on the edge of my seat the entire time so eager for more. it really starts to show these men as individuals and we get an insight in the minds of men, not just the jurors but each man there is representing people as a whole and thats the beauty of the film. by the end of it all they are all on the not guilty side and the journey to get there is some of the best time you will ever have watching a movie. each actor was amazing, all stand alone as separate visions of man, some younger, some older, some angry, some sad, some bitter, those who seek reason and those who place blame. the directing was great and to spend all but 3 minutes of this film in one room and keep it alive must've been a real challenge for the director. the room is somewhat big, but he had to get up close and personal with the men, and also show the viewer a sense of claustrophobia that one must feel. a fan that didn't work on a hot day and rain forcing them to close windows were beautiful touches. the large wall of windows with a tease of the outside world and most of the men bluntly stating they have some where else they need to be. it was just a beautiful film. 100 percent drama, all dialog, but simply amazing to sit thru, as nice to watch as it is to listen to the arguments and reason. i can't say anything that hasn't been said about this film, i am no critic, i just love movies and few touch me and move me and entertain me as this one has.;10 January 2010;9;['popular', 'good', 'much', 'unique', 'perfect', 'young', 'brief', 'easy', 'guilty', 'definite', 'innocent', 'guilty', 'mad', 'more', 'more', 'entire', 'eager', 'more', 'guilty', 'good', 'amazing', 'alone', 'separate', 'young', 'old', 'angry', 'sad', 'bitter', 'great', 'alive', 'real', 'big', 'close', 'personal', 'hot', 'beautiful', 'large', 'outside', 'most', 'beautiful', 'amazing', 'nice', 'few'];0.2175032175032174

255;Sonatine97;a very good film that seems more suited to the stage. the story is simple yet concise and thought-provoking. a teenager with a history of crime behind him is charged with murdering his own father. most of the jury, the dis-interested judge and several witnesses are all of the same mind - guilty!! its left to one man, number 8, (henry fonda) to use his liberal sense of justice & circumstance in defending the boy against impossible odds - especially when faced with one of the biggest cynics of the jury, lee j cobb(his best performance by far) lumet directs with great aplomb, the routine story is given extra life by the wonderful characters who really give a tour-de-force performance, and perhaps makes us feel guilty when we decide individuals in modern society are instantly guilty based purely on their ethnicity, social standing and other inner prejudices but what i admired most was the camerawork. 90% of the film takes places in the juryroom where the 12 men (no women, no blacks - this was 1957!) deliberate. with a clever combination of lighting & tight camera angles you feel as if you can smell the clamminess & claustrophic atmosphere of that intense little room. a weak point could be directed at fonda for playing the whiter-than-white liberal rising above the savage right-wingers, and to be frank i didn't rate his performance much above mediocre - for me, his best role apart from on golden pond would be once upon a time in the west! the true acting honours really go to cobb and especially, ed begley, playing the racist redneck to a tee. ***/*****;20 June 2000;9;['good', 'suited', 'simple', 'concise', 'own', 'most', 'interested', 'several', 'same', 'guilty', 'liberal', 'impossible', 'big', 'good', 'great', 'routine', 'extra', 'wonderful', 'de', 'guilty', 'modern', 'guilty', 'social', 'other', 'inner', 'deliberate', 'clever', 'tight', 'claustrophic', 'intense', 'little', 'weak', 'white', 'liberal', 'savage', 'right', 'frank', 'good', 'golden', 'true', 'racist'];0.12428955453149

262;guskeller;12 angry men is a hall-of-fame film. its greatest strength is its renowned script. 12 angry men is the quintessential bottle film and still influential today. because the plot is so contained, it is completely driven by sharp dialogue and precise character development. meanwhile, small blocking choices (like someone standing up or taking a step) are magnified by the confined location. this might sound off-putting to some viewers, but 12 angry men is a masterclass in storytelling. add in some of the best actors of that era (fonda, cobb, and balsam) and we have a perfect storm. almost no movie has done more with less. furthermore, 12 angry men is fundamental filmmaking. the intentional camera framing and movements deepen the production by subtly suggesting internal character struggles. the expert editing uses minimal cuts to build intimacy and increase potency. the limited music creates a realistic atmosphere. lastly, the direction is excellent because every aspect is unified to construct an iconic experience. the delicate tone is consistent, the style is concretely mannered, and the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. all in all, 12 angry men is a must see for every cinephile and anyone interested in skillful entertainment. writing: 10/10 direction: 10/10 cinematography: 9/10 acting: 10/10 editing: 10/10 sound: 8/10 score/soundtrack: 9/10 production design: 9/10 casting: 10/10 effects: 7/10 overall score: 9.2/10.;3 December 2021;9;['angry', 'great', 'renowned', 'angry', 'quintessential', 'influential', 'sharp', 'precise', 'small', 'angry', 'good', 'perfect', 'more', 'less', 'angry', 'fundamental', 'intentional', 'internal', 'minimal', 'limited', 'realistic', 'excellent', 'unified', 'iconic', 'delicate', 'consistent', 'great', 'angry', 'interested', 'skillful', 'overall'];0.1188988095238095

265;faraaj-1;12 angry men is excellent! its probably the best film in the careers of all concerned. yes, its better than lumet's dog day afternoon, just as good as fonda's ox-bow incident, and almost equals lee j. cobb's the man who loved cat dancing (just kidding about cobb!!!). this is not a court-room drama but instead concentrates on the jury deliberation process. we have 12 angry men - all familiar faces giving ace performances - stuck in a hot courthouse room with an out of order fan on the hottest day of the year. the humidity is killing them and they have to decide whether or not a hispanic teen from the slums is guilty of a murder. the vote has to be unanimous or its a hung jury. juror #8, henry fonda, is the only member of the jury who wants to question the evidence before sending the boy to the gallows. for the rest, including the audience. its a cut-and-dry case. in his western classic the ox-bow incident, fonda is a bad man who over the duration of the night learns to shed his prejudice. the audiences knows he is wrong and feels relief when he makes the right choice in the end. what is interesting when comparing 12 angry men to ox-bow is how roles are reversed. fonda is the only truly good and decent man in the jury and does not have a prejudices to shed. in fact, i as an audience member made the journey from someone convinced that the teen was guilty - based on the overwhelming evidence against him and my own hidden biases - to a person who realizes he has pigeon-holed someone into a mold which may not be accurate. the way this taut drama engrosses the viewer while raising awareness on important social issues is nowhere more evident than in the final scene at the steps of the courthouse where you really feel revitalizes after having spent a few hours in a small claustrophobic room. one of the best examples of films that can truly be said to elevate cinema to an art form, 12 angry men is unmissable!;10 January 2007;10;['angry', 'excellent', 'good', 'concerned', 'well', 'good', 'ox', 'angry', 'familiar', 'stuck', 'hot', 'hot', 'hispanic', 'guilty', 'unanimous', 'hung', 'only', 'dry', 'western', 'ox', 'bad', 'wrong', 'right', 'interesting', 'angry', 'only', 'good', 'decent', 'guilty', 'overwhelming', 'own', 'hidden', 'accurate', 'important', 'social', 'evident', 'final', 'few', 'small', 'claustrophobic', 'good', 'angry', 'unmissable'];0.0640406162464986

267;Artimidor;"one room, twelve men and talk, talk, talk. ninety minutes of film. sounds like a bore, but turns out to be quite the opposite. the back room of a courthouse where a jury of ordinary men has to decide upon life and death becomes the place of first rate drama, where a seemingly insignificant shadow of a doubt makes people talk at least once more about what at first appeared to be a clear cut case. henry fonda with his understated play is in the lead of the doubters, supported by strong character actors like lee j. cobb, e.g. marshall, jack klugman, jack warden or martin balsam. the reluctant, some even clearly prejudiced members of the motley jury all look at the case from very different angles, but they are made real by distinguished acting and screenwriter reginald rose's crispy dialog, which never misses the mark. also remarkable is the fact that the battle of the jurors is embedded in a highly believable environment - a hot day, people sweating, emotions getting the better of them, then a downpour outside, there are casual conversations about what's on people's minds in the breaks, restroom scenes which serve further character elaboration. director sidney lumet on his part focuses on making the film as claustrophobic as he possibly can. he uses subtle camera tricks to gradually make the confined space even seem closer to the actors as the film progresses to add to the mounting intensity and the final shots are made from below eye level to reflect the change that has taken place. ""12 angry men"" above all is a captivating character study. it is not about solving a crime, but characters confronted with decision making and how they approach it. exceptional film-making. side note: ""12 angry men"" was remade in 1997 with another outstanding ensemble cast headed by jack lemmon. a decent film, but no reason to miss the original.";25 May 2012;10;['back', 'ordinary', 'first', 'insignificant', 'least', 'more', 'clear', 'understated', 'strong', 'motley', 'different', 'real', 'distinguished', 'remarkable', 'believable', 'hot', 'well', 'casual', 'further', 'claustrophobic', 'subtle', 'final', 'angry', 'exceptional', 'angry', 'outstanding', 'ensemble', 'decent', 'original'];0.0899305555555555

271;RhapsodyReviews;"'12 angry men' is a drama film directed by sidney lumet. the film tells the story of a jury of 12 men as they deliberate the conviction or acquittal of a defendant based on reasonable doubt, forcing the jurors to question their morals and values. in the united states, a verdict in most criminal trials by jury must be unanimous. the defendant is an 18-year-old male. there are two witnesses: a lady from across the street and an old man who lives below the defendant. this is hands down my favorite film of all time. i could watch it repeatedly and never get sick of it. it's so well crafted and damn perfect in every way. it's a classic and when they attempted to remake it in 1997 it just didn't hold up to the beauty and standard that this film laid out. it's master craft filmmaking at it's finest. henry fonda is a standout in this movie, he is great! being made in the 1950's i was very impressed with all of the acting involved with this movie, but henry fonda was my favorite. that is in part with the dialogue that this movie has for his character. it's so realistic and believable, and it is executed brilliantly. every actor did a great job bringing their character to life, especially since none of them are given a name and we just know them as jury member 1, 2, 3 and so on. i have nothing negative to say about this movie, which is crazy because every movie is said to have some flaws; i see none here. the acting is great, the story is entertaining and real, and the cinematography is breathtaking. the way they use long shots and move the camera steadily around the room to capture different conversation in the beginning was fantastic. also, there is one other long take that is worth mention. it involves this older gentleman, and he is getting tired and angry that this situation is taking so long. he starts to talk about the suspects ethnicity and saying he is guilty because his kind is always guilty, and they should all be put away. he keeps talking for the course of about 3 minutes and we slowly see every other jury member stand up from the table and walk away silently and ignoring him. this scene was so powerful, one because of the dialogue, but another is because it is one long scene and you feel what the other jurors are feeling the more the man speaks, anger. overall, this is still my favorite movie of all time. i have never seen a movie that made me feel the way i feel every time i see it. i think this movie has something for everybody, even if you're not a fan of black and white films, i beg you to give this film a chance.";2 September 2019;10;['angry', 'reasonable', 'most', 'criminal', 'unanimous', 'old', 'old', 'favorite', 'sick', 'perfect', 'fine', 'great', 'impressed', 'favorite', 'realistic', 'believable', 'great', 'negative', 'crazy', 'great', 'entertaining', 'real', 'long', 'different', 'fantastic', 'other', 'long', 'worth', 'old', 'tired', 'angry', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'other', 'powerful', 'long', 'other', 'favorite', 'black', 'white'];0.1145363408521303

280;Semisonic;no matter how prejudiced, preoccupied or plain angry you are, there's always a reason to slow down, step back and take a second look at things that seem obvious on the surface. that's basically the message of 12 angry men. it's been more than 50 years since this film was released, and obviously the rules of cinematography have changed since then. now such theatrical films may feel somewhat odd or staged, and, indeed, 12 angry men is more of a play than a film. however, it's a rare occasion when the pure idea professed by a film becomes a manifesto that goes beyond a particular epoch or style, acquiring that kind of topicality that lives forever as long as there is a mankind. there's no point describing the events of the film, for they only serve as a means of delivering the film's message and call to our conscience, waking it up from the heavy dreams of our compromise-ridden lives. but it's the actors' work that turns the slow-paced narrative into a vivid showcase of emotions and characters. and even though henry fonda is the only big star of the cast, i can't say that the job is done by him alone. on the contrary, it's the men his characters confronts that really give the stage enough diversity and naturalness to feel real and true. the expected happy ending of the film doesn't really chime in with the gloomy cinema trends of the modern cinema. however, the hope that it brings has a deep symbolic meaning. 12 angry men isn't about opposing good and evil people. it doesn't divide us, instead, it tries telling us that, despite how we look and act right now, there's something good and honest and kind in all of us, and the future of this world, represented in this film by the life of a young boy tried for murder, depends on our ability to stay true to those sides of ours and find them within, however muddied they might be. each of those twelve jurors had certain principles that he was ready to put above his personal fancy. and i can only hope that in the world of today our own anger, vanity or indifference are still not strong enough to make us lose our light completely.;6 August 2016;9;['prejudiced', 'angry', 'second', 'obvious', 'angry', 'more', 'such', 'theatrical', 'odd', 'angry', 'more', 'rare', 'pure', 'particular', 'heavy', 'vivid', 'only', 'big', 'enough', 'real', 'true', 'happy', 'gloomy', 'modern', 'deep', 'symbolic', 'angry', 'good', 'evil', 'good', 'honest', 'young', 'true', 'certain', 'ready', 'personal', 'own', 'strong'];0.1135854341736694

286;sandnair87;"from a distance, 12 angry men might look like your customary courtroom drama that hollywood churns out every couple of years. look closer and you will find that sidney lumet's debut turn as a director is an exemplary study in characterization and a crash course in pure filmmaking. most of the action takes place within the confines of a single room on what is supposedly ""the hottest day of the year"". a jury made up of 12 men has to decide the fate of a teenage boy who is accused of a gruesome murder. the defendant has everything going against him - a couple of witnesses, a murder weapon, a sloppy public attorney and the fact that he is from a less privileged class of the society. over the next 95 minutes, 12 angry man watches as 11 jurors, first convinced of the suspect's guilt overcome their less than democratic prejudices and are slowly won over to the side of reasonable doubt by one man's doubts about the accused's guilt. sidney lumet creates energy and movement through quick editing and varying camera angles, which makes the film pulse with power and emotion despite its one set location. operating within the constrictions of a limited budget, lumet tightens the noose by accentuating the excruciating pulse of the ceiling fan and slowly narrowing his shots on his characters as the film approaches its climax. a special mention should be made here of ace cameraman boris kaufman, who ratchets up the claustrophobia with every close-up and ably heightens the drama, despite the confining setting. the actors all 12 of them are top notch as the '12 angry men' in what is to date one of the best ensemble casts to have graced the silver screen. the drama plays out at an engaging pace making this brilliant war of words an entrancing cinematic experience. lumet gives us an incisive and gripping film that is as relevant today as it was almost 60 years back. if you love movies, you owe it to yourself to see this one!";18 March 2015;10;['angry', 'customary', 'exemplary', 'pure', 'most', 'single', 'hot', 'teenage', 'gruesome', 'sloppy', 'public', 'privileged', 'next', 'angry', 'less', 'democratic', 'reasonable', 'quick', 'limited', 'excruciating', 'special', 'ace', 'close', 'top', 'angry', 'good', 'ensemble', 'silver', 'brilliant', 'entrancing', 'cinematic', 'incisive', 'gripping', 'relevant'];0.070807453416149
287;mohit_sinsniwal;"an excellent courtroom drama with a unique twist. instead of following the trial itself, the viewer has a unique chance to observe the events behind the closed doors of a jury room. the film begins with the end of the trial. the jurors retire to deliberate the case. a preliminary vote is taken and the result is 11:1 in favour of the guilty verdict. eleven jurors have raised their hands to convict a young man of killing his father. only juror #8 has doubts. at first even he does not truly believe the young man to be innocent but notes (rightfully) that the case for the defence might have been presented in a more convincing manner and that the boy might be given the benefit of a doubt. since the boy is to be executed if found guilty his life is now in the hands of the jury and juror #8 reasons that the least they could do is talk about the case a bit. as time goes on some of the jurors change their minds and find that there is perhaps enough reasonable doubt not to convict the young man after all. but not everyone is easy to convince. although the plot of the film is excellent and it is fascinating to see what little things can influence which way a verdict goes, where this film really succeeds is in presenting the characters of the 12 jurors. the character of each of the jurors emerges through a wonderful mix of perfect casting, excellent dialogue and near-flawless acting. juror #1 - a simple man who clearly does not understand the full complexity of the task that lies before him but is trying to do everything not to let anyone else find this out. he appears at ease only once during the film - when he talks about football. he has the misfortune to be selected foreman of the jury - a task he clearly does not relish. juror #2 - a small, quite man, clearly unaccustomed to giving his own opinion much less to expecting his views to be of any importance. apparently he finds solace in his job - he is an accountant. juror #3 - probably the most complex personality in the film. starts off like a pleasant self-made successful businessman, he analyses the case impartially, explains his arguments well and is reasonably self assured. as time goes on he becomes more and more passionate and seems to be somehow personally involved with the case. he also starts to show some signs of slight mental instability. wonderfully played by lee j. cobb - this is the character you remember after the film is over. juror #4 - self assured, slightly arrogant stockbroker. obviously considers himself more intelligent than anyone else in the room, he approaches the case with cool heartless logic but (as one of the jurors says - ""this is not an exact science"") he does not take into account the feelings, the passions, the characters of the people involved in the case. he is conspicuous by the fact that he is the only juror that does not take his jacket off (it is a very hot day). juror #5 - here is a man under great emotional stress. he comes from the same social background as the accused boy - with who he almost unwillingly seems to identify with. paradoxically this appears one of the main reasons for him voting guilty - he does not want compassion to influence him - so ironically it does. juror #6 - a simple man, quite readily admitting that everyone in the room is better qualified than he is to make decisions and offer explanations. but he really wants to see justice done and it worries him that he might make a mistake. juror #7 - the only one that really has no opinion on this case. literally throughout the film his thoughts are never on the case - he talks of baseball, of the heat, of fixing the fan but the only reason he has for voting this way or that is to speed things up a bit so he might be out of the jury room as soon as possible. not an evil man he just has no sense of morality whatsoever - he can tell right from wrong but does not seem to think it's worth the bother. juror #8- a caring man, has put more thought into the case than any of the other jurors. he tries to do his best even in the face of seemingly impossible odds. juror #9 - a wise old man with his great life experience has quite a unique way of looking at the case. juror #10 - the most horrifying character in the film. votes guilty and does not even try to hide the fact that he does so only because of the boy's social background. the tragedy comes from the fact that his own social position is only a cut above the boy's - which makes him all the more eager to accentuate the difference. juror #11 - an immigrant watchmaker, careful methodical man, well mannered and soft spoken. respects the right of people to have different opinion to his - and is willing to look at both sides of the problem. loses his temper only once - horrified by the complete indifference of juror #7. juror #12 - a young business type - perhaps he has his own opinions - but is careful to hide them. what he has learnt out of life seems to be that intelligence is equal with agreeing with what the majority of people think. the film succeeds in doing something very rare today - developing an intelligent plot while also developing 12 believable, memorable and distinct characters.";26 May 2019;9;['excellent', 'unique', 'unique', 'closed', 'preliminary', 'guilty', 'young', 'young', 'innocent', 'convincing', 'guilty', 'least', 'enough', 'reasonable', 'young', 'easy', 'excellent', 'fascinating', 'little', 'wonderful', 'perfect', 'excellent', 'simple', 'full', 'small', 'quite', 'unaccustomed', 'own', 'less', 'complex', 'pleasant', 'successful', 'passionate', 'slight', 'mental', 'arrogant', 'intelligent', 'cool', 'heartless', 'exact', 'conspicuous', 'only', 'hot', 'great', 'emotional', 'same', 'social', 'main', 'guilty', 'simple', 'qualified', 'only', 'only', 'possible', 'evil', 'worth', 'caring', 'more', 'other', 'good', 'impossible', 'wise', 'old', 'great', 'unique', 'horrifying', 'guilty', 'social', 'own', 'social', 'eager', 'immigrant', 'careful', 'methodical', 'mannered', 'soft', 'different', 'willing', 'complete', 'young', 'own', 'careful', 'equal', 'rare', 'intelligent', 'believable', 'memorable', 'distinct'];0.1927083333333333
288;dkncd;"""12 angry men"" is about a jury of 12 men voting on a death sentence case. eleven of the men see it as an open and shut case with a clear verdict of guilty. however, one of the men thinks there is reasonable doubt. the majority of the film takes place in the deliberation room with the 12 men discussing the case. even though the film takes place mostly in this single room and is singularly focused on the 12 men discussing the case, the film is never tedious. on the contrary, while a lot of films have slower moments, this one is gripping from start to finish. each of the 12 performances is strong and each of the 12 jurors' characters is well-developed and adds to the film. henry fonda is inspiring as the one man who believes there is cause for reasonable doubt.

291;StevenKeys;rose - lumet's high theater on attitudes that often bedevil jury deliberation: sloth (j7) and prejudice (10) are well-known, but also bias (fonda (8) acting as defense co-counsel in creating unreasonable doubts and effectively stopping his co-jurors from further reflection to push the group-think as cobb (3) had done earlier) and the struggle all jurors should engage by being objective while ultimately forming a conviction. the men first appear, eleven, anyway, too quick to convict, then fall like dominos, too easy to acquit, running hot or cold, acceding to whichever advocate (j3 or 8) has his air-of-authority turned on high. it's a trying watch in grade below lumet's 1982 gem, the-verdict (wtih jurors warden & binns), that opens with a mawkish camera pan to beg our sympathy for a defendant of whom we know nothing, and ends by leaving the impartial viewer feeling that maybe justice was not done after-all. but there's plenty of passion with the power to make us think, and that's always a plus. and it's worth keeping this in mind when watching and being moved to-and-fro by the passions at play: it's fair to judge the personalities of the 12 jurors, to a point, and the workings of their deliberations, but their value as such and any vote they render either early or late in the process is completely within their own purview as they in the story sat through the trial and we the viewers did not, excepting the judge's flat closing instruction. it might then be wise to not vest heavily on the guilt question (2.5/4).;30 April 2020;5;['high', 'unreasonable', 'further', 'objective', 'quick', 'easy', 'hot', 'cold', 'high', 'mawkish', 'impartial', 'worth', 'fair', 'such', 'early', 'own', 'flat', 'wise'];0.2074444444444445

294;cosmorados;this is one of those great films that, at the time it is made, tackles a difficult subject, but does so in such a way that it becomes that subject's definitive movie reference point. the story focuses on a young boy who is charged with murdering his father. given a public defender as he cannot afford legal counsel, the case seems to be open and shut. he didn't know the films he saw on the night he was supposed to be at the pictures, he had bought the knife that was similar to the one that killed his father, he was experienced in using a knife and 2 witnesses saw him kill his father and flee the scene. chances of mistakes, well, let's face it none. he'll be found guilty and as it is murder he will go to the electric chair. in sidney lumet's supreme drama 12 men hold the fate of this boy in their hands and within a claustrophobic room on a hot summers day the discussions that take place are more gripping than a hell of a lot of bland action films who rely on special effects rather then script, storytelling or performance. the acting within this drama is superb and henry fonda is magic as juror number 8 who has some doubt as to the guilt of the accused. everyone in the room is superb in their role, with a special nod to jack klugman as the guy from a poor background who knows the kind of area the kid comes from, joseph sweeney as the shrewd eyed juror number 9 is also fantastic, but for me e.g.marshall and lee j. cobb (arguably the most underrated american character actor) are magnificent in their roles as juror's 4 and 3, the clever juror who takes careful consideration of the evidence and lee j, consumed by anger over his own child's independence and taking that out in the jury room. it is a fine film that has stayed the test of time that, although some of our current generation may find stagy and un-dynamic, is still as appealing as ever for a generation who enjoy having the cinema do some thinking with them about our world, and not necessarily for them.;17 June 2008;9;['great', 'difficult', 'definitive', 'young', 'public', 'legal', 'open', 'similar', 'guilty', 'electric', 'supreme', 'claustrophobic', 'hot', 'gripping', 'bland', 'special', 'magic', 'superb', 'special', 'poor', 'shrewd', 'fantastic', 'underrated', 'magnificent', 'clever', 'careful', 'own', 'fine', 'current', 'dynamic', 'appealing'];0.1819597069597069

303;Lucabrasisleeps;12 angry men must be one of the most unpretentious classics ever. the reason i say this is because most classics either have a reputation for being long epics about war and love (ala gone with the wind) or for being slow moving movies which may not be accessible to all (ala citizen kane). but this one was different. it is a movie about 12 jurors who meet to decide a young man's fate. the whole movie is shot in the same building and mostly in one room. and it deals with human nature and how people behave when in a group. these are universal themes that anybody can relate to. the style is also very simple with no unnecessary complications or flashy camera-work. 12 jurors are now required to take a tough decision - to decide about the guilt of a young 18 year old boy. if found guilty, he would be put to death. at the beginning, most jurors are in agreement over his guilt except for one of them. that is juror no.8 (played by henry fonda). one of the jurors then gives an opinion that the rest of the jurors should try to justify their decision to juror no.8. the arguments go back and forth till the end. these exchanges are very interesting because of the emotional nature of the discussions. most of the jurors have set opinions on social issues and these are exposed during the discussions. objectivity is in short supply and juror no.4, a stockbroker is notable in his objective analysis. juror no.11 (played by george voskovec) is also notable for his detailed analysis and opinions on the case. juror no.7 is noticeably disinterested in discussing the case as he has already made up his mind over the guilt of the accused. he, in fact, is more interested in the baseball game in the same night and in cracking jokes when serious discussions are in progress. i did laugh at most of them. one of them, about a hair-splitters convention, was especially hilarious! juror no.3 is one of the jurors who are convinced about the boy's guilt. he becomes too emotionally involved with the case and details and at one time even moves to punch juror no.8 before he is held back by others. juror no.2 is usually timid but gives valid arguments when asked for his opinion. his exchanges are also sometimes quite funny! juror no.5 is another person whose opinions are clouded because of his past perceptions and opinions. juror no.1 is a man who tries to direct the group and he does his best to break up unnecessary arguments. juror no.12 is an advertising executive who is quite self assured and confident at the beginning but then becomes doubtful about his opinions on the case. he sways back and forth based on the evidence presented and the arguments laid on the table. he tries to crack jokes and often the others don't find it very amusing. but once he makes an off the cuff remark and most of the jurors find it funny. it is scenes like these and the attention to detail that make the movie special. juror no.9 is an old man who has lots of life experiences and speaks on the basis of that regarding the case. he also brings up some very good points especially one towards the end. henry fonda is obviously the center of attention. with his kind eyes and his screen presence, he is definitely the pick of the actors. jack warden(juror no.7), with his great sense of humour and easy natural acting style, is one of my personal favourites. it is quite unusual for a fifties film. lee cobb's performance as juror no.3 was the most emotionally charged role in the whole movie and he has given a powerful performance that at times gave me goosebumps. this is one of the best acting performances on film. george voskovec as juror no.11, the immigrant watchmaker, is also quite good and he is especially good in the scene where he confronts jack warden about his decision. that scene is my favorite in the film. e g marshall as the stockbroker, juror no.4, gives an excellent performance as the impassive and objective man who gives his opinions in a detached manner without any emotional connection whatsoever. the others are also great in their respective roles. i didn't expect to like this movie based on the premise but instead i loved this movie and it has become one of my favourites. this movie has great replay value and this is because of the great performances and the smooth screenplay which doesn't have one unnecessary scene which might drag the movie. this is one of the classics that might appeal to a large majority of people unless they get turned off by the premise itself. this is sydney lumet's masterpiece and it is such an original idea that it deserves to be placed as one of the great classics of cinema. 10/10;27 November 2008;10;['angry', 'unpretentious', 'most', 'long', 'slow', 'accessible', 'different', 'young', 'whole', 'same', 'human', 'universal', 'simple', 'unnecessary', 'flashy', 'tough', 'young', 'old', 'guilty', 'most', 'interesting', 'emotional', 'most', 'social', 'short', 'notable', 'objective', 'notable', 'detailed', 'interested', 'same', 'serious', 'most', 'hilarious', 'convinced', 'timid', 'valid', 'funny', 'clouded', 'past', 'good', 'unnecessary', 'assured', 'confident', 'doubtful', 'amusing', 'most', 'funny', 'special', 'old', 'good', 'kind', 'great', 'easy', 'natural', 'personal', 'unusual', 'whole', 'powerful', 'good', 'immigrant', 'good', 'good', 'favorite', 'excellent', 'impassive', 'objective', 'detached', 'emotional', 'great', 'respective', 'great', 'great', 'smooth', 'unnecessary', 'large', 'original', 'great'];0.2102267573696145

315;K-Slicer;"i haven't seen too many classics in my time and i am particularly fond of this one. when it comes to the justice system and political jousting, this is probably the best movie ever made. jury deliberations are always held out of public view and it was interesting to see how they could possibly go. granted that this movie is a work of fiction, i found it to be one of the most realistic films of all time as well. this is a dramatic legal classic and i can see where scott turow and john grisham got some inspiration for their respective career choices maybe. here are my reasons (some spoilers may be revealed): (1) the performance of henry fonda anchored this rather extraordinary piece of celluloid. it was one of the first film roles that really preached political correctness and it was done with both levelheadedness and style. at the time, fonda took on the underdog character in a completely new and different way and that made it the best performance in the movie. (2) this was a movie filled with a lot of excellent performances and the next best one goes to e. g. marshall. to me, he was the actual conservative of the movie (sorry mr. cobb). his views were exactly opposite of fonda but he kept a sound mind. he logically challenged fonda at every turn but he never lost his cool. while ed begley and lee j. cobb played the ""conservative"" roles (more like fascist bigots in my opinion), marshall kept his emotions in check and kept with the cold logic (much like fonda) and that is why i found his performance to fit the bill of true conservative. (3) another great performance was done by joseph sweeney. he proved that old men know their stuff. he reminded me of my maternal grandfather who is a very learned and observant man himself. sweeney definitely stole a few scenes from both fonda and marshall. he definitely should have been nominated for a supporting actor oscar. (4) keeping with the same logic, i really liked george voskovec. he provided the outside perspective in the movie. the tense scene he had with jack warden was the most emotional moment in the film next to lee j. cobb's breakdown before the end of the film. granted the nationality of his character was unknown, it goes to show that people of all ethnicities share the liberal views on very tenuous issues. (5) the fifth best performance goes to the man who played quincy for seven seasons on the show of the same name. what made him stand out was the fact that he didn't vote not guilty right away even though he was a slum survivor like the defendant in the murder trial. that is a point that those of the same background will always feel sorry for one another. that role was put into the movie to reinforce the sense of reality that the movie was trying to portray. (6) even though i haven't seen a lot of his films, i found sidney lumet's direction of ""12 angry men"" to be oscar worthy. he definitely cared about this movie and it was maybe the best film he ever had the chance to helm. (7) this movie was spectacularly well-written. some of the scenarios couldn't have come about without a great writer to do it. reginald rose did a great job in coming up with an excellent screenplay and an excellent set of circumstances to play around with. his talent is evident with the fact that the old man pointed out the last fact and the leader of the non-guilty side didn't. (8) the cinematography made me feel the heated claustrophobia that the jurors were suffering through. throw in a few lighting switches and a small change in dramatic effects and you have an emotionally-charged picture. i was really intrigued by the close-ups on some of the actors. you could really sense the raw emotion all those men felt as they debated away on such a weighty decision. it was beyond words at some moments. (9) this truly was a summer movie. the heat coming into a confined space and the rain coming down at night signaled this thought. i am not a big fan of typical popcorn films and i believe this a needed reprieve from that. i watched this film during a summer thunderstorm and i had to smile at the poetry behind it. it will make anyone blink a couple of times. (10) not only is this a summer film, it is a time capsule film. nowadays, no one could get away with making a film about a jury filled with only white men. men and women from all standings would have to be thrown into the mix to satiate the public and the hounds of political correctness (aka most of hollywood anyway). i wasn't offended by this movie at all even though it lacked politcal correctness in terms of the times we currently live on. at that time, it was legally acceptable to do as such and the times eventually change. this film captures the late fifties' mentality on the legal system, political correctness, and class struggle perfectly. ten reasons give this movie a score of ten. overall, i found ""12 angry men"" to be a classic that everyone from all walks of life should watch. not only does hit hard on the times in which it took place, it makes a lot of good points on the unfairness of the legal system and fallability of mankind. all sorts of political opinions and logical paths were followed but it was easy to understand and it made ""12 angry men"" all the better. it should not be missed! here ends my rant!";31 July 2003;10;['many', 'fond', 'political', 'good', 'public', 'interesting', 'realistic', 'dramatic', 'legal', 'respective', 'extraordinary', 'first', 'political', 'new', 'different', 'good', 'excellent', 'next', 'good', 'actual', 'sorry', 'opposite', 'sound', 'conservative', 'fascist', 'cold', 'true', 'great', 'old', 'maternal', 'learned', 'observant', 'few', 'same', 'outside', 'tense', 'emotional', 'unknown', 'liberal', 'tenuous', 'fifth', 'good', 'same', 'guilty', 'same', 'sorry', 'angry', 'oscar', 'worthy', 'good', 'great', 'great', 'excellent', 'excellent', 'evident', 'old', 'last', 'non', 'guilty', 'heated', 'few', 'small', 'dramatic', 'close', 'raw', 'weighty', 'big', 'typical', 'needed', 'capsule', 'only', 'white', 'political', 'most', 'politcal', 'acceptable', 'such', 'late', 'legal', 'political', 'angry', 'good', 'legal', 'political', 'logical', 'easy', 'angry', 'well'];0.1167477450086146

319;Hawkensian;"the film examines prejudice and the sheer callousness of human behaviour, issues which will forever be relevant. at the beginning, 11 out of the 12 jurors are happy to see the accused, an 18-year-old latino from the slums, be executed by the state. initially this seems unremarkable, you assume that they all have good reasons for their verdict. however it's soon apparent that most of the jurors have just glossed over the facts, reaching their damning conclusion because they 'just think he's guilty' there's even one juror who can't wait to leave the room so he can go to a baseball game. only juror #8 (henry fonda) is disturbed by the hastiness of it all; he doesn't know whether the kid is guilty, he just wants to at least talk about it before the jury so swiftly condemns him to death. i've praised films such as 'killer joe' for their success in engrossing its audience despite much of its story occurring in very few locations. however, compared to '12 angry men', 'killer joe' is a veritable action adventure - this legal drama never leaves the jury room. its success in gripping its audience and fully involving them in the characters and plot is a masterful achievement of writer reginald rose. at the table sits a spectrum of personalities, all of whom you can identify and resonate with. some are measured, some are fickle, some are blinkered and one or two are downright pig-headed and obnoxious. the natural, timeless performances allow you to cross-examine them; they are all personalities one has come across before, and the viewer can probably draw parallels with people they know - this is one of the film's core strengths. sidney lumet's debut feature is to be lauded for its reserve and lack of sensationalism. there may be those who doubt the credibility of some of the case developments, but to my relief, i personally found few if no traces of hyperbole or implausibility.

329;kyle_c;"especially in our current state, the focus is more and more on special effects and visual appeal than on strong plots and good acting. while many great movies have told their stories through visuals, ""12 angry men"" takes the opposite approach, telling the story through its characters, creating the feel of a stage play. the premise is that a young minority boy is charged with murdering his father. every jury member except one (henry fonda), believes that the boy is guilty. fonda doesn't necessarily believe him to be innocent, but rather that he just isn't sure. he begins his attempt to point out how he feels and why he feels that way. through this, he reveals the insecurities and prejudices that are within everyone. the acting is first rate, from the angry, stubborn juror #3 to fonda, who creates a sense of integrity that he does so well. each man has a unique angle, and every actor portrays them well. the story and script are as close to perfect as can be. i don't mean that the movie is perfect, but rather that this is a premise that is difficult to execute. it would be easy to write this story so that it would not flow well, but it flows smoothly. perhaps one of the best screenplays of all time. the themes of this movie - it is more or less a character study - are beautifully written in. they never become heavy handed, but are still easily seen. every man on the jury has some reason to quickly decide guilty, whether it be indifference, their own personal struggles, or prejudices. this movie is not a masterpiece of visual achievement. it takes a rather unique approach to cinema, and makes itself a masterpiece in its own way.";31 May 2002;9;['current', 'more', 'special', 'visual', 'strong', 'good', 'many', 'great', 'angry', 'opposite', 'young', 'guilty', 'innocent', 'sure', 'first', 'angry', 'stubborn', 'unique', 'close', 'perfect', 'difficult', 'easy', 'good', 'less', 'handed', 'guilty', 'own', 'personal', 'visual', 'unique', 'own'];0.2163265306122448

334;jdhb-768-61234;"""12 angry men"" may be over 60 years old and may be in black and white, but it's nonetheless one of the greatest films ever made. virtually the entire film takes place in the claustrophic atmosphere of a jury room, with 12 men, no women, adjudicating on the guilt or otherwise of a friendless puerto rican boy accused of murdering his abusive father. there are no names, not even for the jurors whose only identification is by numbers while the key witnesse to the supposed murder are referred to only as 'the old man' and 'the woman'. apart from henry fonda, the cast is made up of actors who were never quite 'top names' and this adds to the tension as debate ensues. with only one true star, the rest of the jury are exactly what they should be - a disparate group with different backgrounds, experiences, prejudices and bigotries which quickly become apparent as fonda raises questions about the prosecution's seeemingly strong case. one by one, the questions cause doubts to arise in the minds of those initially certain of the boy's guilt. their own varied experiences contribute to the gradual realisation that perhaps the case against the boy is not so strong, then that it's debatable and, finally, that it's full of holes. close up shots of individual jurors as they make their cases for a guilty verdict or come to realise that there is more to the case than they thought show the true anguish of their situation.. the whole effect is to create a claustrophic yet magnificent spectacle. superb dialogue, brilliant performances and direction, this is a sensational film. after watching it for the umpteenth time, i still find it gripping and compelling, one of the few films that i really can watch over and over again. 10 out of 10 ? surely this is an 11.";21 November 2018;10;['angry', 'old', 'black', 'white', 'great', 'entire', 'claustrophic', 'puerto', 'rican', 'abusive', 'only', 'key', 'old', 'top', 'true', 'disparate', 'different', 'apparent', 'strong', 'certain', 'own', 'varied', 'gradual', 'strong', 'debatable', 'full', 'individual', 'guilty', 'more', 'true', 'whole', 'claustrophic', 'magnificent', 'brilliant', 'sensational', 'umpteenth', 'compelling', 'few'];0.2314625850340136

336;ccamp89;"12 angry men is a film that's so good and so powerful that, as the credits roll, you actually feel like you've gained a deeper understanding of humanity, our justice system, and life in general. i mean it. it's really that good. twelve jurors of varying ages, personalities, cultural backgrounds and social standings enter a deliberation room to determine the guilt or innocence of a troubled teenage boy accused of murdering his father. it's quite a simple premise a jury's deliberation one that occurs daily all over the united states. but the film manages to wring every last drop of tension, drama, and social commentary from this commonplace scenario that it's impossible not to viscerally experience the true weight and implications of such a task to search for the truth in a case of life and death. first things first: let's just appreciate how entertaining 12 angry men is. this is a film that takes place entirely in a single room, and tells its story completely through dialogue. and yet, it manages to be significantly more absorbing and enthralling than your average film with dozens of different locations and set pieces. the dialogue is so well-written and the characters so well-realized (and acted) that you become completely swept up in the proceedings. the pacing is also pitch perfect. the film rises naturally to a few emotional climaxes and confrontations, which are punctuated by quieter moments as the characters (and we as the audience) catch our breaths and process what has developed. and for a film that takes place entirely in such a confined space, there are a pretty incredible number of interestingly-composed sequences and long takes as the camera maneuvers from character to character and the drama unfolds. so yes, 12 angry men is a superbly entertaining film that absolutely flies by over the course of its brief hour-and-a-half running time. but it's also so much more than that. it's a film about ""truth"": its elusiveness, malleability, and vulnerability to the subjectivity of the human mind. yes, there is a single objective truth to this, and likewise any real-life case; but the jurors don't know it, and neither do we. the objective truth isn't the point. the point is the impressionability of the ""truth"" how it morphs in the minds of the characters (and in ours) over the course of the film, and how significantly it can be informed by our emotions, past experiences, memory (and its limitations), prejudices, and a myriad of other factors. the film is able to crystallize both the beauty and the folly of our judicial system. the beauty, as henry fonda's character points out, is that the scales are heavily tipped in favor of the innocent, that no man can be found guilty unless that guilt is beyond any reasonable doubt. the folly? the subjectivity of reasonable doubt, and the unavoidable reliance on a human jury who are influenced by all of the aforementioned factors. but ultimately, 12 angry man a film about us people. each juror in the film has a unique personality, temperament, and background which informs his opinion and motivates the role he plays in the story. every juror gets his time to shine and the result is an ensemble that feels both diverse and extremely well- balanced. the strength of the characters in the film and the way they play off of one another is key to perhaps its most important theme: the danger of assumption, and the ease and quickness with which we judge one another. we watch as the jurors expose their biases and prejudices through their assumptions and judgments of the defendant, as well as one another. but even beyond that, the true brilliance of the film is that it subtly provokes the exact same snap-judgments from us as we watch. it's extremely easy to start to view the more critical jurors as the ""good guys"" and the dissenting, guilty-proponent jurors as the ""bad guys."" to invoke a psychiatric concept, we engage in splitting seeing some of the jurors as ""all good"" and others as ""all bad."" we automatically begin to judge the seemingly more prejudiced and willful jurors, confining them to a box of our construction without knowing barely anything about them. but in its revealing final moments, the film snaps us back and urges us to look beneath the surface of those who we judge and ask an important question: why? why does one juror spew prejudice and anger while another sits silently? what drives them to act in the way that they do? no one is born prejudiced, bigoted or racist. these are things we learn and which become incorporated into our personalities often through no fault of our own. the angry, prejudiced juror isn't inherently ""all bad,"" but simply reacts in a way that is informed by his accumulated life experience (much of which is subconscious). of course, that doesn't mean that people can't and shouldn't be held accountable for their negative attributes and beliefs we can always introspect and take action to improve our worst qualities. but that isn't the point. the film simply asserts that we should strive to understand before we judge, as understanding and empathy fosters connection where judgment simply divides. as juror #3 who we've likely judged and grown to despise throughout the film weeps over the torn photograph of himself and his estranged son at the conclusion of the film, the message couldn't be clearer. 12 angry men is a masterpiece. it is a film that marvelously succeeds on all the facets that every great film should. it's fabulously entertaining and engrossing, fantastically shot and acted, perfectly paced, and extremely thought-provoking. an undeniable classic whose themes will never lose their relevance.";17 May 2016;10;['angry', 'good', 'powerful', 'deep', 'general', 'good', 'cultural', 'social', 'troubled', 'teenage', 'simple', 'last', 'social', 'impossible', 'true', 'first', 'entertaining', 'angry', 'single', 'absorbing', 'enthralling', 'average', 'different', 'perfect', 'few', 'emotional', 'incredible', 'long', 'angry', 'entertaining', 'brief', 'running', 'more', 'human', 'single', 'objective', 'real', 'objective', 'past', 'other', 'able', 'judicial', 'innocent', 'guilty', 'reasonable', 'reasonable', 'unavoidable', 'human', 'aforementioned', 'angry', 'unique', 'diverse', 'balanced', 'key', 'important', 'true', 'exact', 'same', 'easy', 'critical', 'good', 'guilty', 'proponent', 'bad', 'psychiatric', 'good', 'bad', 'prejudiced', 'willful', 'revealing', 'final', 'important', 'racist', 'own', 'angry', 'prejudiced', 'bad', 'much', 'subconscious', 'accountable', 'negative', 'bad', 'empathy', 'torn', 'estranged', 'clear', 'angry', 'great', 'entertaining', 'undeniable'];0.0562925170068027

341;TheNabOwnzz;as a directional debut, you could do worse than sidney lumet's excellent '12 angry men'. it would be the beginning of an illustrious career, even though perhaps the heights of his debut would never quite be reached again. 12 angry men is, apart from several opening shots, closing shots and a couple of scenes in a side room, filmed completely in one single room. to create a fascinating, character driven & tension filled picture can be quite difficult for some directors with this knowledge, but lumet's direction here is world class. he uses the single location to enhance the feeling of claustrophobia, which also enhances a feeling of tension as all characters grow angrier as the film progresses. much has been said about lumet's use of camera angles to enhance the mood in our characters, such as the fact that the camera is generally placed at higher angles during the first act of the film, and gradually seems to be placed lower and lower towards the end, as more people are convinced of the 'not guilty' vote, so the camera emphasizes their superiority over the 'guilty' voters. even though the film is largely in a single room, lumet also uses weather conditions as a mood setter, with the setting being in a heatwave of some kind, and when the tables start turning towards the end in terms of the votes, the weather switches to pouring rain, which is generally an even larger symbolism of 'chaos', and that is precisely what is going on during the final moments of this picture. 12 angry men is also undoubtedly one of the best acted films in cinematic history, with in particular lee j. cobb giving the performance of a lifetime. this is not just an angry character, thriving on nihilistic thoughts and hating on everything that happens, but a tragic character that is prejudiced due to his strained relationship with his own son. this brings forth another point, which are ofcourse all twelve characters. all of these characters have some kind of background, origin, and all of them behave very differently and according to their personal lives and experiences. an opening shot of the room featuring all of the jurors entering and bantering with eachother already gives the audience an idea as to what kind of people these jurors are. all the while lumet uses very long takes, switching between mid-shots & wide-shots in single takes to create the most immersive and personal experience possible. later in the film, when things start to heat up even more, he also induces a fantastic use of the close-up, which is ofcourse generally the most personal and direct of shot compositions. furthermore, the screenplay by reginald rose is also a phenomenal addition to this film, as every single line of dialogue, character building and general confrontations enhance the tension significantly. ofcourse, we do not get to witness extraordinary production design or scale due to the simplistic setting, but it is hard to imagine what lumet could have done even better considering the material he was given. due to lumet's technical expertise, visual mood setters, claustrophic atmosphere & the fantastic energetic acting, it feels as a 'thriller' in a drama setting. ofcourse the fact that the audience does not know anything about the case beforehand also helps, since the viewer will be even more compelled to follow the discussions used in this picture, because we do not know anything about the case yet. in the end, whether or not the kid is guilty is shown to be quite irrelevant, as this film is mainly a message about the interference of personal prejudice in terms of law. every character, however, is displayed as having some kind of humane reason as to why they think a certain way. even juror #3, who, as stated before, relates the kid in question to his own relationship with his son. as one of the best-acted films of all time, combined with a fantastic screenplay, impeccable direction, in depth character development and characterization, 12 angry men is no doubt one of the greatest directional debuts ever made.;9 December 2018;9;['directional', 'bad', 'excellent', 'angry', 'illustrious', 'angry', 'several', 'single', 'fascinating', 'difficult', 'single', 'angry', 'much', 'such', 'high', 'first', 'low', 'more', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'single', 'large', 'final', 'angry', 'good', 'cinematic', 'particular', 'angry', 'nihilistic', 'tragic', 'due', 'strained', 'own', 'ofcourse', 'personal', 'wide', 'single', 'immersive', 'personal', 'possible', 'fantastic', 'ofcourse', 'personal', 'direct', 'shot', 'phenomenal', 'single', 'general', 'extraordinary', 'simplistic', 'hard', 'technical', 'visual', 'claustrophic', 'fantastic', 'energetic', 'guilty', 'irrelevant', 'personal', 'humane', 'certain', 'own', 'fantastic', 'impeccable', 'angry', 'great', 'directional'];0.0184502164502164

345;SimonHeide;"overall i loved this movie. it shows the group-dynamics of 12 people, the jury, trying to decide if there is ""reasonable doubt"" concerning whether a young boy killed his father. the discussions are tense and little by little we learn from these what supposedly happened on that night the kids father died. we are therefore also drawn into the question of whether the boy did it or not ourselves and what at first seems like a clear cut case along the way becomes all of a sudden much more complicated. it is a film that dares to handle nuances and ambiguities (we are never certain of whether the boy did it or not) in a way we rarely see. its also a movie that lets us watch these 12 angry men discuss in the same room for a full 96 minutes without it ever getting boring, which i have to respect; you really have to thrust your material to let a whole movie consist of a discussion. the movie also tries to show how personal issues can cloud the judgments of the jurors. i am thinking about one specific juror, and although the idea, of showing us how his own personal story interferes with sound judgment, is splendid, i frankly didn't like the way it unfolded in the movie. that's why i only give this movie 8/10. if this movie in any way is supposed to represent how the legal system work i pray to god that i will never be put in a situation where a jury have to decide my guilt in any matter. regards simon ps. when you read reviews that gives max score check to see if the user has made more than one review. if not consider the possibility of a lobbyist. if you agree consider putting this post scriptum at the bottom at your own reviews.";2 January 2008;8;['reasonable', 'young', 'tense', 'little', 'little', 'clear', 'complicated', 'certain', 'angry', 'same', 'full', 'boring', 'whole', 'personal', 'specific', 'own', 'personal', 'sound', 'splendid', 'legal', 'more', 'own'];0.0722402597402597
346;The_Celluloid_Sage;"before nineteen fifty-seven, sidney lumet was an up and coming television series director with a number of different shows to his name. talented the man obviously was even at that early stage of his career. meanwhile (in fifty-six) fonda has seen the tv play by reginald rose of the same name and had contacted him to see if the script could be adapted to a feature-length version for the silver screen. subsequently they became co-producers and financed the film themselves, one of the greatest films ever made and put onto celluloid. when filming began (which unbelievably only took nineteen days and three hundred and fifty thousand dollars or around three million today), lumet would show the world just what an accomplished director he not only was, but would go on to be throughout the rest of his career. he truly belongs in the list of great american directors of all time, if not also the world. his vision, skill with the camera and obtaining the very best from his actors is second to none. 12 angry men shows all of his mastery and more (and was oscar nominated for it) as he draws you deeper and closer into a story with a surprising amount of complex layers. as just stated, while seemingly a rather simple story, 12 angry men does have numerous layers of complexity and social issues. these include bigotry, racial tensions, social standing, prejudices, personalities and morality. all of these issues can be seen within our twelve jurors throughout the course of the film while deciding the innocence of guilt of a boy on trial for murdering his father. at its most basic structure, this is a courtroom drama with a simple tale that is woven into an intricate, compelling and gritty drama piece. a wonderful show of how the judicial system should work. the fate of a young ethnic boy lies in the hands of a jury, mostly made up of middle-aged white men. the entire film (with the exception of a very brief setup and epilogue) takes place within one small, claustrophobic room on a very hot day. we see nor hear any of the trial, witnesses or prosecution and only have a brief charge from the judge. everything we learn about the boy, the case and all other matters we learn from our twelve jurors. as they file into this room we then quickly start to see which character is which personality and for what they stand and believe in. from this moment on you will be completely gripped. guilty until proven innocent and beyond all reasonable doubt are two importan phrases here and form the basis of the script and the conflict among our jurors. in life, far too many are quick to judge, along with also being judge, jury and executioner at times. lkewise some of our jurors share the same thoughts. one man alone stands true to his beliefs and morality that the boy cannot be convicted unless there the crime can be proven 'beyond all doubt', an act the prosecution or accuser has to prove, not the defense. something some people (along with our jury) sometimes struggle to grasp with the preconceptions. this one man who beholds the rights of the constitution is juror number eight (ford) who is the initial voice of reason within the group. unlike many other reviews i will not spoil who is which character and what personal and prejudicial traits they have so you can ejoy finding out for yourself. i will however praise every single cast member, each one is wonderfully portrayed by seasoned and professional television actors. we have the meek, the controlling, the bully, the racist, educated, reserved, indecisive and the impatient as well as other character traits. all are shown brilliantly but special mention must go to lee j. cobb for his acting. perfectly cast and intense in his performance that his character will stay with you long after the credits have rolled. likewise with the acting, the script is simply superb. tight, accurate and full of little twists and nuances, this is perhaps one of the best scripts you will ever hear spoken. denzil washington take note, this is how you write a dialogue heavy screenplay. no car crashes, explosions, fights, foul language, action scenes, just a taught expose of truths and half-truths spoken with conviction and heart from all those involved. you won't find many more films as utterly compulsive as this one. a real lesson to be learnt for any budding screen writer. as is the direction and cinematography which are both second to none and while simple in concept, are exucted to precise perfection. it is often said that the simplest things are life are the hardest to master. lumet and kaufman master them with ease and give the film its extra edge that it needed. kaufman who had previously worked on ""on the waterfront"" is amazing and shows off his skill along with lumet. in using techniques to make the room look smaller and to close in on the actors, make the room appear to be closing in on those twelve jurors the increasing tension between the men is really heightened at key moments. lumet also used different lenses and differing camera angles and heights to change or raise the mood as was needed. many do not notice (a testement to his skill and the absorbing acting) but lumet changes the height of the camera during the distinct thirds the film is broken into, slowly but surely ramping up the intensity and claustrophobia on us, the viewer while we see the same increase on the twelve jurors. masterfully done. a film that has an intelligent plot (with a couple of little inconsistencies), believable characters and one of the few to be accurately labelled as a 'classic' in every way imaginable. about as perfect as you will ever get. the sage's rating: 10/10";6 April 2020;10;['up', 'different', 'early', 'same', 'silver', 'great',

""it's not easy for me to send a young boy to the chair without talking about it first"" says fonda. as the film continues fonda slowly gets the other jurors to see the flaws in the case and raise their doubts if the boy really committed the crime. one man is left (lee j cobb) who wants to see the boy burn based not on the evidence but personal feelings of his son that ran away from home years before. in the end however cobb concedes and says the boy is not guilty. the boy may or may not have committed the crime but the point was that the case against him was weak and flawed. this film would never be accepted today for several reasons. first all the jurors where white men which would offend many people and i think it's crazy. today it would have to have these types of characters: angry black man or some other minority who has a problem with white people, bitter white feminist woman that hates men, a clueless white guy that everyone else on the jury would throw jabs at, single mother and anyone else that would fit the mtv politically correct nonsense. it would lack the power 12 angry men had because it would spend too much time preaching about the injustice of the bankrupt lives of the jurors and it would lose focus. i'm sure the name of the film would be something like, ""12 angry people."" in any case 12 angry men is a powerful film and goes down as one of the best in film history. if people get offended today by it only because of the actors used they should stick to watching michael bay movies.";18 July 2009;10;['talented', 'different', 'blue', 'young', 'electric', 'most', 'ready', 'hot', 'innocent', 'least', 'young', 'easy', 'young', 'other', 'personal', 'guilty', 'weak', 'flawed', 'several', 'white', 'many', 'crazy', 'angry', 'black', 'other', 'white', 'bitter', 'white', 'feminist', 'clueless', 'white', 'single', 'correct', 'angry', 'much', 'bankrupt', 'sure', 'like', 'angry', 'angry', 'powerful', 'good'];0.0061177248677248

351;Mr_PCM;"12 angry men could serve as a textbook for how films can be brilliant without any special effects or action sequences. all you need is a good idea, and 12 angry men certainly has that. the film's premise could not be simpler; 12 jurors discuss a case and attempt to determine a verdict. it's as simple as that. in the wrong hands this idea could be a disaster, or at least deathly dull. however, sidney lumet has created a riveting character study investigating motivation and prejudices in ordinary men. the twelve are all from a great variety of backgrounds with widely differing attitudes. however, the case seems clear cut and they are all convinced the defendant is guilty. except one. as the facts of the case are bandied back and forth, henry fonda, as the sole juror returning a not guilty verdict, must convince his eleven fellow jurors to think about the case more. it is hard to lavish enough praise on 12 angry men. it is also the first film i have reviewed where i simply cannot think of any criticisms whatsoever. the film is enthralling and extremely clever; it is impossible not to get caught up in the back and forth as the sole juror attempts to sway the opinions of the other eleven, gradually calling into question what seemed like a clear verdict. it is a fascinating insight into the unseen workings of the legal system, and how ordinary men really play a role in the system. further, the characters are never given names, there are virtually no supporting actors for the twelve, and the entire film takes place within one room, enabling all attention to be focused on the details of the case rather than identifying with the characters. it is this that makes the film so simple yet unbelievably effective. henry fonda is one of the finest actors of his generation, but no one is overshadowed or shamed by his terrific performance, and everyone holds their own. all twelve actors give outstanding performances. 12 angry men is a masterful film that should be compulsory viewing for any filmmaker. there was never a clearer display of what can be done without complicated plot lines, special effects, overblown action sequences or overbearing music. a great idea with a tight script and sound acting performances are all you need to make a timeless classic. faultless.";2 March 2006;10;['angry', 'brilliant', 'special', 'good', 'angry', 'simple', 'simple', 'wrong', 'least', 'dull', 'riveting', 'ordinary', 'great', 'clear', 'guilty', 'sole', 'guilty', 'fellow', 'more', 'hard', 'enough', 'angry', 'first', 'clever', 'impossible', 'sole', 'other', 'clear', 'fascinating', 'unseen', 'legal', 'ordinary', 'entire', 'simple', 'effective', 'fine', 'terrific', 'own', 'outstanding', 'angry', 'masterful', 'compulsory', 'clear', 'complicated', 'special', 'overblown', 'overbearing', 'great', 'tight', 'timeless', 'faultless'];0.0954232804232804

357;DVR_Brale;"i wanted to take a while before writing anything about 12 angry men. before i saw this movie i had been thinking about how can a black & white movie, made in the 50's and shot almost entirely in one room, be fifth on imdb? now, after seeing it, i'm thinking about why is it not rated even higher. in this review i'm going to try to explain what makes this movie so brilliant. first, have you noticed how this movie feels so natural? not even once was i feeling bored or exhausted. everything runs so smoothly, constantly making you more interested in what had really happened. one of the factors which makes this so is interrupting serious debate with brief and sometimes longer scenes which don't contribute to understanding the topic. nothing is omitted. this dynamic (which hollywood nowadays doesn't utilize) serves as a mean to present that humans don't operate as computers. we are intrinsically flawed and able to enjoy, be serious or disdain certain situation. recall, for example, scene in the bathroom, talking about sports, playing with fan, etc. this gives viewer some space and time to think about what had been said. you can make your own judgment and defragment all information. viewer thus becomes a sort of a ""13-th juror"" actively participating in a conversation. second, this movie raises serious questions about how can we know anything about historical events. how do you evaluate and interpret given evidence? there are two schools about the topic: first claims that one can never objectively construct sequence of events because of our subjective nature; second claims that we can objectively assert what really did happen. this two approaches make much sense in 12 angry men. some jurors are unable to objectively asses the evidence because they are very restrained by their own feelings or prejudices. the way they interpret the material is thus very biased (juror #8: ""it's always difficult to keep personal prejudice out of a thing like this. and wherever you run into it, prejudice always obscures the truth."") the point is that every one of jurors (including the viewer) is biased but they take different approaches to the problem. this leads us to third point. everything said above lead us naturally to the problem of jurisdictional decision making. the most important thing here is the term of reasonable doubt. some of the jurors don't actually understand what does that mean so they can't handle the problem well. it somewhat scary thinking about how can twelve men from different backgrounds, of which some don't event understand or care about the case, make a decision about someones' life. if the juror is not convinced beyond reasonable doubt (not any doubt!), than he's obliged not to accuse defendant guilty. reasonable doubt is the highest burden of proof one has to surmount if he's to accuse someone guilty. that's an important difference between exact sciences and law approach as one of the jurors notices (juror #12: ""oh, come on. nobody can know a thing like that. this isn't an exact science."") so we see jurors one by one changing their belief when their certainty drops below reasonable doubt. this takes us to the next point. let's take a closer look on the particular order each of the jurors voted not guilty. first you have a guy who just wanted to take a closer look at the evidence. he lit a spark. then you have an old man wanting to hear why others think the accused is guilty. one by one the change their minds. the last ones where a guy who had prejudices about ""street children"" and the juror who was shouting all the time. this was done intentionally. people who had personal problems with something or someone are always hardest to engage in objective discussion about the issue. forgiveness is a cure, not turning back on it. nobody convinced the last juror to change his mind; he convinced himself after seeing a picture of his son. it's like his heart (not mind as with others) couldn't take it anymore. juror before him had general prejudices. those people can have a hard heart but are more easy to engage than those with personal problems. he realized his mistake after everyone had started to ignore him. those with personal problems must confront them by themselves; those with prejudices must confront with others. so the conclusion is that it's harder to confront with someone whose problems lie in their heart than with those whose problems lie in their mind. closing remarks: table has always been an important component in our western culture. it's a place where all important decisions are made and where people get to eat and drink and know each other. that's why one the last shots is camera smoothly running over the table jurors where sitting at. someone was there and something happened. it's a contrast to the last scene where we see fonda leaving the building and disappearing into the crowd. twelve men, who had never seen each other previously and don't even know each others names, with completely different backgrounds and profiles, accidentally sat together and did something important. now they continue on, probably never seeing each other again. but table stands as a witness. there are many other elements left to be analyzed. it's better to speak about them sitting at the table discussing with other people than reading a review. i hope this general description of the movie mechanic helps someone understand what lies underneath the hood or makes her or him approach this movie with more scrutiny.";17 February 2017;10;['angry', 'black', 'fifth', 'high', 'brilliant', 'natural', 'bored', 'exhausted', 'interested', 'serious', 'brief', 'long', 'flawed', 'able', 'serious', 'certain', 'own', 'serious', 'historical', 'first', 'subjective', 'second', 'much', 'angry', 'unable', 'restrained', 'own', 'biased', 'difficult', 'personal', 'biased', 'different', 'third', 'jurisdictional', 'important', 'reasonable', 'scary', 'different', 'reasonable', 'guilty', 'reasonable', 'high', 'guilty', 'important', 'exact', 'exact', 'reasonable', 'next', 'close', 'particular', 'guilty', 'close', 'old', 'guilty', 'last', 'personal', 'hard', 'objective', 'last', 'general', 'hard', 'easy', 'personal', 'personal', 'hard', 'important', 'western', 'important', 'other', 'last', 'last', 'other', 'different', 'important', 'other', 'many', 'other', 'well', 'other', 'general', 'more'];0.0030650570087189

(did you see the news while we were in court? would you like my business card? this fan doesn't even work, so we should hurry.) this trial is nothing but a distraction from the jurors' lives, and the sooner resolved the better. but, one man holds out. the majesty and brilliance of the film is henry fonda's quest to convince the others to move beyond their personal prejudices and seek justice in light of the evidence. the terror of the film is that, in reality, most trials do not have a juror #8.;2 October 2020;10;['first', 'large', 'high', 'minded', 'countless', 'many', 'underway', 'bored', 'bored', 'most', 'more', 'eager', 'young', 'well', 'personal', 'most'];0.1436904761904762

362;cleary-joshua;"imagine a filmmaker walking into a boardroom today and trying to pitch the following movie: 12 men sit in a room for 90 minutes in real time and argue with each other. they're discussing a murder case, but the murder isn't actually shown, they just talk about it. it would be shot down today, because it's not the kind of movie that we're used to seeing in cinemas public tastes have changed. or so hollywood seems to think, but this movie is in imdb's 10 top rated movies of all time. this took me slightly by surprise before i saw ""12 angry men"". it's a movie made more than 50 years ago, and yet it's still more popular than any ""lord of the rings"" or ""star wars"" film. it's a testament to the public, i think, showing that old movies have not grown stale, and are still appreciated as much as new flicks. the film itself completely deserves its position on the imdb list. it's not one of the best movies ever made, but it is a skilfully crafted, well acted drama which is intellectually stimulating and actually quite thrilling throughout, despite the lack of action. it's far more than it says on the tin, since each one of its 12 characters is well written and of great importance to the story. henry fonda particularly shines in the film as the one juror trying to fight for a ""not guilty"" verdict on the grounds of reasonable doubt. he takes it upon himself to convince the other 11 to change their minds, and through this, changes the audience's view of the case as well. the progression of his arguments and logic is extremely clever and his unpicking of information that we've had throughout makes us admire him even more. the film covers so much ground in so little time and space. all of the jurors are unnamed for the majority of the film, and we're not dealing with specific characters most of the time, but members of the public from all parts of society. there's someone each of us can relate to, and we leave the film considering how we would deal with the case. lumet uses the single setting to his technical advantage, managing to create a disturbing sense of claustrophobia as the film progresses, and the use of real time is so important in making us feel like we're on the same level as the characters and not missing a single detail.

366;gaityr;"12 angry men is quite simply a film masterpiece. you might not know it from the description--12 jurors who are complete strangers to one another are collected in one room to decide a murder case. 11 believe the defendant, a young boy from the wrong side of the tracks and living in the slums, is guilty, beyond the shadow of a doubt. the last one, juror #8 (henry fonda), believes there is a reasonable doubt about the boy's guilt. how juror #8 eventually gets the other jurors on his side is the point of the entire film, and it almost entirely takes place in the one small room. hardly splashy, with no special effects--just 12 actors, a script, and the camera. sounds boring? this film is anything but. reginald rose writes a great story, and though you sometimes get the feeling that this film is meant to be a play, that's largely due to the slightly claustrophobic feel of having the entire proceedings of the film take place in one room. works for a play, but in a film, one expects cuts to other places, wider shots etc. still, even this counts in favour of 12 angry men, because it forces one to concentrate on the case, the dialogue, the actors, the characters. of course the film is talky. there's hardly any action. but it couldn't be more well-paced or timed. in fact, it's exciting, in its way. every time a new vote is called, every time a vote changes to 'not guilty', the audience feels the triumph of something, some 'je ne sais quoi'. director sidney lumet does an excellent job of manipulating the black and white medium he chose for this film, making the film timeless (even more so than the 1997 tv remake with jack lemmon in fonda's role--yes, the jury is no longer one of '12 angry white men', but colour still dates a film in a way black and white doesn't). the character study is really what makes the film: you'll recognise everyone in that jury room, from the non-strident nonconformist (henry fonda) through to the man who has such great difficulty separating his personal emotions from the facts of the case (a stunning lee j. cobb). there's the bigot (ed begley) who realises that his words will always fall on unsympathetic ears; the flighty guy who just wants to get to his baseball game (jack warden); the shrewd old man who shouldn't be discounted just because of his age (joseph sweeney); and the stuffy intellectual (e.g. marshall) who isn't too uptight to change when he realises he's wrong. that's only half the cast of characters in this film, and aside from the rather unfortunate foreman or juror #1 (martin balsam), every single character is well fleshed-out and a believable person. you can understand the reasons why they change their votes; it's all perfectly within character. quite an accomplishment, to bring to life 12 men in the space of one and a half hours. much credit, of course, must go to the writing of rose for real, credible characters and dialogue. one remains riveted to the film even though it's mostly talk and no action; that's surely an indication of how great the writing and acting in 12 angry men is. henry fonda does a fine job as the man who initially stands alone with his own reasonable doubt. as usual, he underplays his character rather than grandstanding it, thus allowing for his fellow actors to shine in the showier roles. all of them turn in brilliant performances, but of particular note would be cobbs, whose final impassioned stand as the odd man out (in a complete reversal of the beginning of the film) is simply stunning. marshall and sweeney are excellent in their roles as well. this is most certainly one of the best films ever made: understated, underplayed, but definitely not over-rated. you've heard about 12 angry men, i'm sure--so if you haven't seen it, why not? you're missing out on a great script, a great cast, and a great moral about the value of democracy in the american judicial system (one that isn't hammered into the audience--it's made with no self-congratulatory fanfare). watch this--it's worth it.";5 October 2002;9;['angry', 'complete', 'young', 'wrong', 'guilty', 'last', 'reasonable', 'other', 'entire', 'small', 'splashy', 'special', 'boring', 'great', 'due', 'claustrophobic', 'entire', 'other', 'wide', 'angry', 'talky', 'exciting', 'new', 'guilty', 'excellent', 'black', 'white', 'angry', 'white', 'black', 'white', 'non', 'strident', 'such', 'great', 'personal', 'stunning', 'unsympathetic', 'flighty', 'shrewd', 'old', 'stuffy', 'uptight', 'wrong', 'unfortunate', 'single', 'believable', 'much', 'real', 'credible', 'great', 'angry', 'fine', 'alone', 'own', 'reasonable', 'usual', 'fellow', 'brilliant', 'particular', 'final', 'impassioned', 'odd', 'complete', 'stunning', 'excellent', 'good', 'underplayed', 'angry', 'sure', 'great', 'great', 'great', 'moral', 'judicial', 'congratulatory', 'worth'];0.0963401875901875

374;varundelpiero;"the concept of 'reasonable doubt' is highly pervasive within the judicial system; it is the concept that eventually decides the fates of the accused, and is the concept that is one of the most controversial. it's controversy lies in the fact that it is purely subjective, and dependent on the individuals that comprise the jury. the notion of reasonable doubt has no one definition, yet it is almost universally known. in 12 angry men, sidney lumet successfully gives the viewer an idea of how this concept comes into play in a trial. it is worth noting that while this may be one of the best courtroom movies of all time, it doesn't in fact occur in the actual courtroom; all but 3 or 4 minutes of this motion picture is spent in the confines of a jury room, where the verdict is hotly debated. lumet does well to present the room as a sort of confinement from which there is no escape until a unanimous verdict is decided. as the film progresses, the sense of urgency and claustrophobia sets in, and the tension becomes increasingly high. the first technique lumet used was to employ the locked door. the second was to cue the rain, which gives the feeling that even the outdoors are 'inaccessible' and that only the room exists. the third technique may be missed by less astute viewers; lumet switches his scope from wide to narrow to close-up during the movie, which adds to the claustrophobic feeling mentioned earlier. the acting is top-notch, as required by any good character study. all 12 men have been developed to some appreciable extent, but the key players have been developed to a comprehensive level given the film's ~95 minute run-time. henry fonda is brilliant as the 'hesitant' juror, but to me lee j. cobb outshines him in almost every scene (save the opening scenes). another aspect of the film worth mentioning is the music (or lack thereof). this is another intentional ploy by lumet to give the viewer a 'feel' of the room. there is no music in the jury room, so why should there be in this film? i agree that while a musical background score serves to enhance or capture the mood of the scene, sometimes the absence of the music (silence) speaks volumes, by allowing the viewer to concentrate fully on the scene(s). one of my favourite movies lacking in music is no country for old men. another brilliant score-less motion picture is cast away, where no music is used for the entire length of time that tom hanks is stranded. the screenplay is solid and intelligently sound. in fact the only thing that stopped this film from winning best picture, best director, and best screenplay was the excellent the bridge on the river kwai. had the movie been made a year or two earlier, it may well have won the esteemed accolades. i can see why this film ranks in imdb's all-time top 10. it is simply a brilliant motion picture that has wide appeal, and can be enjoyed and appreciated by many. 4 stars (out of 4). 8/10. will appear in my top 200 at around 167 or so. strongly recommended.";27 October 2008;9;['reasonable', 'pervasive', 'judicial', 'controversial', 'subjective', 'dependent', 'reasonable', 'angry', 'worth', 'good', 'actual', 'unanimous', 'high', 'first', 'locked', 'inaccessible', 'third', 'less', 'astute', 'wide', 'claustrophobic', 'top', 'good', 'appreciable', 'key', 'comprehensive', 'minute', 'brilliant', 'hesitant', 'worth', 'intentional', 'musical', 'favourite', 'old', 'brilliant', 'less', 'entire', 'solid', 'sound', 'only', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'excellent', 'esteemed', 'brilliant', 'wide', 'many'];0.2772549019607843
375;MetalAngel;"sidney lumet's ultimate masterpiece ""12 angry men"" is a paramount in film history and is certainly the most memorable of courtroom dramas, a film that stands true to what intelligent, perfectly-made cinema ought to be. the plot is simple enough. it's about twelve men from different social backgrounds and jobs who make up the jury of a murder trial for an 18-year old kid who has allegedly stabbed his father in cold blood. they (the jury) must now retire to a private chamber and discuss the verdict before sentencing the murderer to either death or freedom. the entire film, then, takes place inside this chamber and follows the arguments and quite heated discussions between these twelve angry men, as they attempt to reach an unanimous vote. from the start, while the men accommodate themselves in the room, we're introduced to them and their personalities, their likes, and basically we gather enough information to discern the type of person each of them is like. also, they are never identified by their names, but are referred to according to how they were sitting in the trial, with a number from 1 to 12. it is in this setting of anonymity, of a locked room which is practically boiling in heat, that twelve different personalities clash, different points of view are alternately objectified and refuted, and the future or doom of a man is tactfully decided. it's a masterpiece, i tell you. the screenplay is sent from cinema heaven (reginald rose is a masterful screenwriter), for what begins as a discussion to eliminate all possible doubts becomes a passionate, gripping and utterly suspenseful probing into a different area of human bias. the ball is bounced back and forth among different subjects, and it's such a harrowing game they play that we watch transfixed through the entire duration of the film, uncertain of anything and equally unsure what to make of it. is the kid really guilty or is he innocent? no one knows, they merely speculate, and like one of them says, ""who knows what could be worse: sending an innocent kid to his death or letting a cold-blooded murderer free to do as he wishes?"" the theme is searingly vivisected and analyzed, and you'll find your own morals, ideas and reasonings both questioned and assured in a mind-blowing way. apart from the terrific screenplay (enhanced by rapid-fire, witty dialogue), sidney lumet has done wonders with space and cinematography. the fact that such delicate and controversial topics are being dealt in a stifling hot room by twelve men who are rapidly loosing their patience deals for an emotional powerhouse. nothing can be avoided. also, the camera angles, the focus of the camera itself, makes the room even seem smaller and more suffocating by the minute, with increases the heat of the arguments and the sharpness of the remarks. i read somewhere that the first shots in the movie are taken at a high angle and they slowly decrease to a point where, by the end of the movie, they're below the character's faces (i watched the film again and this fact is true). also, different lenses were used to give the impression that the walls were shrinking. i tell you, it's cinematic perfection. the acting is point-perfect. henry fonda delivers a searingly intelligent performance as one of the jury members who poses most of the troubling questions, and amongst the other twelve, lee j. cobb, ed begley, e.g. marshall and jack warden are equally powerful and entrancing. overall, the film lasts a little over an hour and a half. but it's an hour and a half of pure delight, of witnessing amazing cinema unlike any we've seen in recent times. i mean, the film was made in 1957, and it's still as fresh and as original as if it had been released yesterday, even with an unnatural quantity of courtroom dramas that hollywood spews out. i've seen my good share of courtroom dramas, and even in my young age i happily come to discover films like these that even having been done way before my time still manage to be more interesting than many. rating: 4 stars out of 4!!";8 September 2009;10;['ultimate', 'angry', 'memorable', 'true', 'intelligent', 'simple', 'different', 'social', 'old', 'cold', 'private', 'entire', 'heated', 'angry', 'unanimous', 'enough', 'like', 'locked', 'different', 'different', 'objectified', 'masterful', 'possible', 'suspenseful', 'different', 'human', 'different', 'harrowing', 'entire', 'uncertain', 'guilty', 'innocent', 'bad', 'innocent', 'cold', 'blooded', 'free', 'own', 'terrific', 'rapid', 'witty', 'such', 'delicate', 'controversial', 'hot', 'emotional', 'small', 'more', 'first', 'high', 'true', 'different', 'cinematic', 'perfect', 'intelligent', 'most', 'troubling', 'other', 'powerful', 'little', 'pure', 'amazing', 'recent', 'fresh', 'original', 'unnatural', 'good', 'young', 'interesting', 'many'];0.1520359160613398

380;Stefan_Loves_Movies;"12 angry men (1957) is a thrilling crime/drama, currently rated top 5 best movies on imdb. the film is relatively short 1h36m running time, with a beautifully acted, entertaining story. ""12 angry men"" has different ratings based on what you consider the movie being about: 1. if you consider it about the power of persuasion, then this movie is good. juror 8 managed to persuade everybody by providing an explanation for all their arguments. 2. but if you consider it about right and wrong then the movie is flawed. let me explain: if you follow juror 8's logic, then no matter the evidence presented, he will always find a very improbable explanation for it. *follow my narrative for a sec: ""let's try to come up with compelling evidence that would most likely incriminate the boy. let's say the boy was taped killing his own father and 100 eyewitnesses are confirming the scene. this is unquestionable evidence, but juror 8 could come up and say that the tape can be fake and that the eyewitnesses come from an organization and lied on purpose."" this is very improbable, but there is a 1 % chance this could happen. this theory might get him at best another trial, but this doesn't mean that the boy is not guilty. if courts would use juror 8's logic, no one would ever be found guilty! therefore i don't agree with the conclusion of the story. all in all, i think everybody should watch at least once 12 angry men (1957) and see for themselves where they stand.";8 November 2021;8;['angry', 'thrilling', 'top', 'good', 'short', 'entertaining', 'angry', 'different', 'good', 'right', 'improbable', 'compelling', 'own', 'unquestionable', 'fake', 'improbable', 'good', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'least', 'angry'];0.0686507936507936
381;michaelheiser-25099;good legal drama but the evidence brought to our attention by juror no. 8 (henry fonda) is often not especially convincing but seems to be taken very seriously by progressively more and more men in the room until inevitably we have a unanimous not guilty verdict. an example of this, is when fonda successfully gets the others to acknowledge that the old man witness is unreliable, yet then goes on to base a major part of his own evidence on the old fellows testimony that he took fifteen seconds to get to the door to witness the murderer fleeing. fonda clearly assumes that this man he has determined as unreliable would get his exact timings spot on in a moment of heightened emotion. it may seem like a minor point but there are just a little too many of these small inconsistent assumptions littering 12 angry men for me to feel it was an entirely successful exercise. i really couldn't help shake the notion that fonda's character had his own agenda and was simply unwilling to back down. perhaps he was the most persuasive man in the room and that was ultimately the reason that the decision was made. it's difficult to really say with any certainty that the accused was innocent at all. did they really make the correct decision?;3 December 2021;7;['good', 'legal', 'convincing', 'more', 'unanimous', 'guilty', 'old', 'unreliable', 'major', 'own', 'old', 'unreliable', 'exact', 'minor', 'little', 'many', 'small', 'inconsistent', 'angry', 'successful', 'own', 'unwilling', 'persuasive', 'difficult', 'innocent', 'correct'];0.1776315789473684

400;faroukgulsara;this is one of those films whose story started as a radio drama to make it to become a stage drama and later into films in many languages from english to german to russian to hindi to kannada and the story had been featured in many tv serials including 'happy days' where fonz did his jury duty. the movie starts with the judge instructing the 12 juries to be ushered to a room for deliberations before deciding on the guilt of a 18 year old hispanic boy from a broken home who have allegedly stabbed his father to death. at first look, it looks like a open and shut case to most jury members. the crime and the chronology of events is only made available to us as we listen to the discussion that goes on in the hot and stuffy room. the 12 members are all caucasian males of different professions. no names are made available to us, only their professions (car salesman, architect, ad man, architect, watch maker, painter, man who grew up in slum). the heat in the room also took the toll on the mood of the jury. most of them are eager to finish off their tour of duty as soon as possible and continue the usual lives. so, when the architect (henry fonda) suggests that he would like to discuss the case before deciding in the fate of the young man, they naturally get annoyed. they put their decision to a vote. the initially outcome was 11 to 1 for a guilty charge. as the decision was not unanimous, they started talking. they all agreed that the defence counsel, probably working pro bono, did not put his mind and soul to defend such a case as it was not rewarding and the boy was a delinquent anyway. they also realised that there were pitfalls in the witness' story. an eye witness alleged saw the act from a moving train and another, a hemiplegic neighbour supposed to have dashed at a quick pace to witness the event. as the discussion goes on, they put the verdict to a vote. as time goes on more and more people started having second thoughts on passing a guilty charge. more and more people get into each other's nerve. the story goes on with finally with the vote goes on 11-1 in favour of a not guilty charge when somebody realised that the lady witness could be wearing glasses, hence it was not possible for her to identify the assailant as she was lying in bed and people do not generally wear glasses when they are going to sleep. the last man standing soon realized that he was recalcitrant because of unresolved issues with his son with whom he was not in speaking terms. he finally gave a not-guilty charge making it an unanimous decision. this film is very cerebral in nature with all scenes happening in a room with no action, swashbuckling scenes or special effects. and on top of it, there is not a single female in the cast of actors. it gives good lessons in the art of persuasion and reasoning. jack klugman (quincy m.e.) and jack warden are the familiar faces in the movie together with henry fonda. the interesting thing about this story is that they stereotype class, not ethnicity. one has to remember it was made before the era of the black liberty and gender equality movements. hence, there were no african americans and women in the panel of jury. only a nationalised european (probably swiss) was there. just a thought... i am sure that in the bollywood version, the producers must have included some dance sequences and some masala as well! if not, it would have brought in any returns at all.;10 December 2019;9;['many', 'german', 'many', 'happy', 'old', 'hispanic', 'broken', 'first', 'open', 'shut', 'most', 'available', 'hot', 'stuffy', 'caucasian', 'different', 'available', 'most', 'eager', 'possible', 'usual', 'young', 'annoyed', 'guilty', 'unanimous', 'rewarding', 'hemiplegic', 'quick', 'more', 'more', 'second', 'guilty', 'more', 'more', 'other', 'guilty', 'possible', 'last', 'recalcitrant', 'unresolved', 'guilty', 'unanimous', 'cerebral', 'special', 'single', 'good', 'familiar', 'interesting', 'black', 'european', 'swiss', 'sure'];0.1538095238095238

403;asandor;12 angry men, directed by sidney lumet, is a taught and tense thriller without any guns, bombs or violence. i instead, it focuses on twelve men, locked into a room to decide the fate of a man on trial for murder. it is the hottest day on record outside, and tensions mount as the agendas of each man are exposed, analyzed and ultimately dealt with in one way or another. at the beginning of the film, eleven of the twelve men vote for a guilty verdict, but one man holds out, and upholds the principles of the system he is a part of. this film is pretty flawless. it is a dramatic look at the court systems that existed in the united states in the '50's. eleven men are willing to condemn another to death with little thought, but one needs to convince the others they are wrong. it is also well set, with the hot and humid environment and the booming thunder and pouring rain of a summer storm playing in the background outside, as the men inside struggle against there inner prejudice and demons. the film is wonderfully directed, shot and acted by an all star cast from the 1950's, including the great henry fonda. each character is unique, a real individual, with their own prejudices, flaws and quirks. each one tries to make the others see their way of thinking, or to speed up a conclusion. i could go on, but much more and much better reviews have been written already. suffice to say, 12 angry men is a classic american film. it is towering in its simplicity, and tense as anything else. truly one of the great films of the last century, and one that every film lover should see, and every film collector should own.;25 March 2016;9;['angry', 'tense', 'hot', 'guilty', 'flawless', 'dramatic', 'willing', 'little', 'wrong', 'hot', 'humid', 'inner', 'unique', 'real', 'own', 'more', 'well', 'angry', 'classic', 'american', 'tense', 'great', 'last'];0.0602083333333333

406;mitch-bulfin;12 angry men proves that a masterpiece is all in the details. this is, without a doubt, one of the best dramas ever created. nice short runtime, small cast, all filmed in one room.m, it's just so tight. the beauty of it is that just from dialogue alone we are thoroughly entertained and it maintains a sense of tension throughout. the crime is never re-enacted, it's from the descriptive dialogue that we picture it in our heads. writer reginald rose knew that the most powerful tool in film was words. the cast was high calibre, henry fonda leading the view of not guilty. it's pretty difficult to go against him when he is full of suaveness and so convincing. we get to know each juror as the film goes on and we soon start to explore the possibility that their personal lives are tainting their decision. that, was what made it so palpable. it was clouding their judgement, and their stubborn personalities made it all the more satisfying if they did change their mind. persuasion is a powerful tool, but add a hint of conviction and you can manipulate anyone's mind. several nice details were included, i like the fact it was set on the hottest day of the year. the heat evidently getting to the jurors, it made them more irritable and heightened the angry emotions within. director sidney lumet did so much in such a little space, technically. when the jurors enter the room, its a sublime long five minute shot and he manages to share the screen time with each juror equally. he was able to convey their personalities instantaneously just by their attire, then when the discussion commences we start to dig a little deeper. the screenplay really is the winner here, if anything it makes me want to work in law. dramas do not come better than this, 12 angry men easily gets the perfect rating. it sits in the inclusive list of masterpieces. <ul><li>mitchell bulfin</li></ul>;10 March 2020;10;['angry', 'good', 'nice', 'short', 'small', 'tight', 'descriptive', 'powerful', 'high', 'guilty', 'difficult', 'full', 'convincing', 'personal', 'palpable', 'stubborn', 'satisfying', 'powerful', 'several', 'nice', 'hot', 'irritable', 'angry', 'little', 'sublime', 'long', 'able', 'little', 'deep', 'angry', 'perfect', 'inclusive'];0.0891269841269841

""12 angry men"" was also another example of bringing yet another well-received teleplay to the big screen, as had been done very successfully with rod serling's ""patterns"" and paddy chayevsky's ""marty"". others here eloquently provide detail on the plot and characters. simply put, the movie is filmed almost entirely on a single set, the jury holding room of a courthouse, where a jury of 12 men are deliberating the fate of a young man accused of murder. many plays and musicals have been adapted for the screen and the list of failures is long. a notable recent example for me was ""rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead"". film viewers do not have the same expectations of a presentation as do theater viewers. in film, the expectation of greater variety and coloration is a prerequisite due to the viewer's previous experiences. therefore, the danger of becoming ""stagebound"" can ruin a film's reception. for a play such as ""12 angry men"" where the focus is declamatory, this is an unavoidable danger. happily, i found the film to be a resounding success. the strength of rose's adaptation is complemented by lumet's probing camera, which delineates the characters not only through impressive tight-focus shots, but through body language, gesture, and facial expression. the ensemble acting, underpinned by henry fonda's performance, is superb, as one would expect with such brilliant character actors as lee j. cobb, e. g. marshall, and ed begley sr. the storyline moves propulsively to a logical but powerful conclusion. i can't really think of any flaws. some confrontations involving prejudicial statements are a bit obvious, but are unfortunately as relevant today as then. i wouldn't rate this as #18 on my list - i found the aforementioned ""patterns"" to be a more engrossing film - but it's undoubtedly close to a classic. kudos to all - i give it a 9.";27 May 2006;9;['angry', 'promising', 'angry', 'big', 'single', 'young', 'many', 'long', 'notable', 'recent', 'guildenstern', 'dead', 'same', 'great', 'previous', 'stagebound', 'such', 'angry', 'declamatory', 'unavoidable', 'resounding', 'impressive', 'tight', 'facial', 'ensemble', 'superb', 'such', 'brilliant', 'logical', 'powerful', 'prejudicial', 'obvious', 'relevant', 'aforementioned', 'close'];0.1401234567901234
423;kikoydaba3;12 angry men is a timeless classic relevant in any time period. set exclusively in a jury room, the film exceeds the four corners of its setting presenting themes with great depth and handle about politics, interpersonal relationship, prejudice, bias and hope. in the age of social media and instant news, the film asks us to question our personal thoughts and belief. the film is a cinematic triumph of logic over emotion. a story about 12 men sitting as jurors faced with a decision to deliver a verdict on an accused teenager, the jurors are locked as a single hold out, juror 8, played by henry fonda votes not guilty. against overwhelming odds, juror 8 manages to convince another juror who proclaims it is not easy to stand alone from the ridicule of others. the film gradually reveals more questions as a guilty verdict beyond reasonable doubt is slowly eroded and each character's motivations is gradually revealed. every juror presents his arguments but these all fall when reasonable doubt exists attacking the testimony as more and more jurors vote not guilty. despite being confined to a single room, the film is nonetheless a thriller. the film slowly reveals that men are often dictated by emotion and not reason. juror 3, played by lee j. cobb, is the main antagonist but is also at heart and the opposite end of the film's struggle between guilty and not guilty. the subplot of his relationship with his estranged son finds resolution when he becomes the final juror to vote not guilty from guilty. with a cast to envy portraying every imaginable human emotion, 12 angry men flawlessly treads its themes with character growth in a cathartic ending. even its black and white color is a representation of the gray area people live in a prejudiced world. ultimately, the film speaks about our everyday politics but also as a redemption and heroic tale against odds. 12 angry men will continue to be appreciated for generations to come and deserves its place among cinema's masterpiece. 10/10;7 July 2019;10;['angry', 'relevant', 'great', 'interpersonal', 'social', 'personal', 'cinematic', 'single', 'guilty', 'overwhelming', 'easy', 'more', 'guilty', 'reasonable', 'reasonable', 'more', 'more', 'guilty', 'single', 'main', 'opposite', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'estranged', 'final', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'imaginable', 'human', 'angry', 'cathartic', 'black', 'white', 'gray', 'prejudiced', 'everyday', 'heroic', 'angry'];-0.0180059523809523

425;snsh;the film 12 angry men might have been very good cinema for 1957, but in the 21st century it doesn't make a whole lot of sense. the movie wears you down while characters spend more time bickering about bickering than actually going over testimony and evidence. it's like the blair witch project, where the characters act loud and annoying, beating the audience into exhaustion. the characters in 12 angry men mostly argue with each other, often screaming, making the resolution more gratifying to the audience. it's a common trick. *begin spoiler alert* maybe we've gotten spoiled watching too much monk and csi and law & order, but as a legal drama the movie is confusing anyway. there's no discussion of blood trails or spatters. the defendant claimed there was a hole in his pants, but no pants were reviewed as evidence. davis introduced a knife he bought as evidence in the jury room, which you can't do. the jury determined that the witness was nearsighted based on her nose. the jury decided a witness was incapable of running based on how he walked. the jury never discussed who else might have committed the murder. the thought-process behind the plot is so convoluted, it makes the whole movie frustrating to watch. *end spoiler alert* the movie is ok for 11 year olds so certainly carries a lot of nostalgic value 60 year olds, but it's flawed and doesn't hold up as a timeless film.;13 October 2008;7;['angry', 'good', 'whole', 'more', 'annoying', 'angry', 'other', 'gratifying', 'common', 'much', 'legal', 'incapable', 'convoluted', 'whole', 'frustrating', 'ok', 'nostalgic', 'flawed', 'timeless'];-0.0946428571428571

436;cmcastl;"there are, that i know of, two legal systems, the anglo-saxon adversarial system and the french system. the french system has judge and jury as paid legal officials. the idea behind that is that trained and experienced legal officials at all stages of the process can deliver a better verdict. but the weakness is that such a system is more open to political corruption. in the english system there is judge, jury - made up of ordinary people who are drafted - and barristers. with some tweaks, the american system follows the british system. which is the better? an un-answerable question but a fascinating one. i have always thought there is a moral ambiguity at the heart of this film. the number of genuinely decent, intelligent, educated and well-meaning jurors seems to be outweighed by the number of bigoted, prejudiced, mentally lazy and ill-educated ones. in the latter category, what psychologists today call those affected by 'motivated reasoning', made founding us father alexander hamilton distrustful of pure democracy and hence his electoral college to elect the president. so this film is a powerful disquisition on both the anglo-saxon jury system and democracy. actually, any legal system is intimately a reflection of the political system. the moral core of the film is henry fonda, of course, whom republicans today would call a 'bleeding-heart liberal'; certainly some of the characters in the film called him that more or less literally so that conservative pejorative labelling is not new. his willingness to give the young defendant, accused of killing his father, in what some of the jurors lazily called an 'open and shut' case, what you americans call a 'fair shake' is what drives the plot. then other jurors, better intentioned, rally to his standard and others less enlightened subsequently rally to his standard, as most people do to a true leader, one of his persuasive qualities and of his quality of character, if only to follow the tide of loyalty. one of the jurors calls henry fonda's character an exponent of the soft-sell. but that plain-joe juror doesn't understand the difference between selling marmalade, which is the latter's job, and intelligence allied to a genuine conscience, which are the hall-mark qualities of henry fonda's 'architect' persona. solon, the ancient greek lawgiver, was once asked what would it take for justice to come into this world. he replied that justice would only come into this world if enough people who did not suffer injustice would feel for those who did. we are not there yet. in any film, play or novel a successful one is one in which all the leading characters are well-rounded and you feel that if you met them on the street you would recognise them immediately. this the film amply fulfills. apart from anything else, the film is a master-class in top american actors of the late fifties. i would certainly like a henry fonda character on my jury if i ever faced murder in the first degree. but the curious thing is, the curious thing is, that on reviewing the evidence as it is presented in the film and despite the attempt at rebuttal which is the agenda of this film, i think the evidence stacked more against the defendant than for him! but i repeat, i would surely pray for a henry fonda character on my jury. one of the characters in the sidney lumet's excellent 'the verdict', (1982) a wise old black doctor, (i likee how it was so aptly described as a 'legal rocky') consoles paul newman's lawyer with the sentence that juries can sometimes surprise one in the rightness of their verdict. i guess for all its faults the anglo-saxon version of justice is the better.";1 March 2017;10;['legal', 'anglo', 'adversarial', 'french', 'french', 'legal', 'legal', 'well', 'open', 'political', 'english', 'ordinary', 'american', 'british', 'well', 'un', 'answerable', 'fascinating', 'moral', 'decent', 'intelligent', 'prejudiced', 'lazy', 'latter', 'motivated', 'distrustful', 'pure', 'electoral', 'powerful', 'anglo', 'legal', 'political', 'moral', 'conservative', 'pejorative', 'new', 'young', 'open', 'fair', 'other', 'most', 'true', 'persuasive', 'soft', 'plain', 'genuine', 'ancient', 'enough', 'successful', 'rounded', 'top', 'american', 'late', 'first', 'curious', 'curious', 'excellent', 'wise', 'old', 'black', 'legal', 'anglo', 'well'];0.1613636363636363

443;ThatAnimeSnob;"for a film that takes place almost entirely in one room and is mostly made up of dialogues, i must say it was a blast. although the premise may sound completely boring for most people, the context in it surpasses most of everything out there. in a way it is a detective story that takes place in a confined room and where all evidence are based solely on speculations and thin reasoning. through means of possibilities, deduction, and doubt, 12 men are supposed to decide the fate of a young man accused of killing his own father. although the case seems crystal clear at first, as all the evidence prove his guilt, a single shred of doubt is more than enough to begin a long line of second thoughts and complicating debates. anyone who loves intelligent disputes and exposed lines of thought behind anything will definitely be mesmerized by its attention to detail. what makes the movie even more enjoyable is how its characters are not emotionless orthologists or cynical businessmen. each one of them has a very distinctive personality and his judgment is usually affected by his life experiences and personal bias towards certain social issues. you will see hints of racism, hatred for youngsters, snobing of the poor, even some who don't care and just want to get over with it soon so they can go watch a baseball match. an extra element that adds to its magnificence is how it is using its laws of that time as well as various details of the society it takes place in. you are constantly given various information regarding law specifics, and cultural events, so you are really made to believe the story takes place in an american state of the 50's. something which is very important when it comes to any story regarding trials or detective work, since without them one would wonder why wouldn't they just use some fancy csi method to determine if he really did it (which was impossible at that time) or why are thy even using common people to determine if a man is guilty or not (which happens in very few parts in the world). the interesting thing is that we are never actually told if the accused man really did the crime or not; that is not the objective of the movie. it is more about following the logic behind the use of a jury to determine the lives of others, as well as how reasonable doubt is more than enough to let someone go free if you are not certain he did it. this would of course mean that lots of people are found not-guilty even when they really did it, but that is not what the movie is all about. it has more to do with upholding the laws of a state in their fullest and in this case they really were. there are still a few things that annoyed me in the movie, even if they are completely excused for their time and era. the whole film is made up of only white males. not a single woman or member of a different race. although the 60's were indeed like that, in a sense it feels kinda racist. that is why i like the 90's remake even more in overall. although it does not have superstars protagonist in it, it is with color, the characters are behaving in a more natural way (not that wooden feeling of the old movies), there are black members in the jury, the accused is a latino, and the judge is a woman. and despite the 30 year gap, the laws are still used in almost the same way (with only a few minor details presented differently just to adjust to the era) and thus the plot is presented in exactly the same way. not that it's feels like much of a problem; it s still an amazing piece of cinema and worthy to be part of most top 10 movie lists with similar categories.";19 March 2013;9;['boring', 'most', 'most', 'thin', 'doubt', 'young', 'own', 'clear', 'single', 'more', 'enough', 'long', 'second', 'intelligent', 'enjoyable', 'cynical', 'distinctive', 'personal', 'certain', 'social', 'poor', 'extra', 'various', 'various', 'cultural', 'american', 'important', 'fancy', 'impossible', 'thy', 'common', 'guilty', 'few', 'interesting', 'reasonable', 'more', 'enough', 'free', 'certain', 'guilty', 'more', 'full', 'few', 'whole', 'white', 'single', 'different', 'racist', 'overall', 'natural', 'wooden', 'old', 'black', 'latino', 'same', 'few', 'minor', 'same', 'much', 'amazing', 'worthy', 'most', 'top', 'similar'];0.0696324143692564

446;woinaroschy_1979;"this movie shows how you can make a film on the lowest budget possible, with only one or two scene sets and 12 good actors. basically the whole movie takes place in one room where a jury of 12 men discuss their verdict for a young man suspected of killing his father. reading the lines above you might think this is a boring movie, but the plot unfolds, as only one man of the jury is not convinced that the boy is guilty and slowly begins to convince the other members of the jury of his doubt. the story becomes at times a detective story, the jury trying to put together missing pieces of the murder puzzle. this movie shows in a marvelous simple way the mechanism of the justice system, how easily a man can be convicted to the death sentence based on prejudice, subjective declarations of witnesses and an unprofessional defense lawyer. it stresses out the importance of declaring someone ""not guilty"" if there is a reasonable doubt in your mind about his guilt. it shows that you should always ask questions and not accept everything on first hand. besides these simple, yet profound ideas, there is a solid acting from everyone of those 12 jury members. each is unique in his way, with his own personality,history and background. there is the typical immigrant, the wise guy cracking up jokes, the mediator, the wise old man, the educated man with stiff views of the world, the geek, the self-made man who did not forget where he came from, the choleric, the prejudiced man, the stupid guy who does not give a damn about this trial but only about getting to his football game in time. they don't have names, in fact there is no name mentioned until the very last scene in the movie, each jury member just has a number, yet you distinguish them very easily just by their personality. some are given more screen time, some less, but they all do some marvelous acting. last, but not least, the camera and directing! can i just say, for a movie taking place in one room, it's really amazing...stressing out gestures, faces of people, objects to give depth to the scenes. i'll never forget the scene where one jury member just tries to convince the others of the young boy's guilt, because ""these people (living in slums) are born this way and they do these things, they're violent, they're animals"" and one by one, the jury members leave the table, the place of dialog and go to other corners of the room, signaling that they do not wish to continue this conversation. or the scene where they do a re-enactment of an old man trudging along to reach his front door. truly, a masterpiece, i recommend it to anyone anytime! 10/10";9 November 2010;10;['low', 'possible', 'good', 'whole', 'young', 'boring', 'guilty', 'other', 'marvelous', 'simple', 'subjective', 'unprofessional', 'guilty', 'reasonable', 'first', 'simple', 'profound', 'solid', 'unique', 'own', 'typical', 'wise', 'wise', 'old', 'stiff', 'choleric', 'prejudiced', 'stupid', 'last', 'more', 'less', 'marvelous', 'last', 'least', 'amazing', 'young', 'violent', 'other', 'old', 'front'];0.0745918367346939

449;SanTropez_Couch;"the story of this film is famous: one man tries to convert the 11 other jurors in a jury room. superficially, that's all the film is. and it works magnificently on this level alone. but mixed in with that one notion (which is, i should say, remarkably carried out), we've got sprinklings of messages. what democracy really means, the notion of a fair and just trial, the stupidity of racism, etc. at the opening of the film, we're inside the courtroom (everything but the opening and closing -- maybe 120 seconds in total -- takes place within the jury room and its adjacent bathroom) and the judge seems blase about the jury. ""just go in and do your thing...whatever."" it's just another case with a fairly predictable outcome, he thinks (we assume). he reminds the jury that their conclusion must be unanimous and as they walk into the jury room, a few of them take a glance at the man on trial and the camera shows his face, looking at his only hope to save him from the chair (he's on trial for murder one). as the jurors file into the jury room, over the credits, we see juror #8 (henry fonda), who seems uninterested, looking out the window. the others are mostly talking about simply being in a jury room but fonda is actually thinking about the case. he's slow to move, contemplative. juror #7 (jack warden) is anxious to get out to his baseball game he's got tickets for. there has been talk, like roger ebert's, of how the camera starts out at an elevation and slowly comes down by the end of the film. i didn't notice that, but i did notice just how creative the camera does move about in a very constricted space. i don't think it's ever in exactly the same place, at the same angle. the first jury count, of course, has them at 11 to one, in favor of guilty. what makes this film great is that the lone man who says not guilty, fonda, isn't sure the young man on trial is innocent -- he's just not sure he's guilty. the straight racism of juror #10 (ed begley) is obvious and the film deals with it. i don't know what the times were like in 1957, but i would have assumed that the order of the day may be to bring racial issues up but not deal with them directly. this film does and it comes out on the right side. the film isn't dated at all in its politics. if it were made today (i haven't seen the tv remake, although with a cast that has george c. scott and jack lemmon, i'd like to), juror #10 may be less obvious a racist, but this is a minor, if even, a complaint. there are still people like him, who'd believe that murder is inborn to specific ethnicities. what's sort of funny is that i couldn't tell what the man on trial was. maybe italian or greek. we get a good sense of each of the jurors, and indeed by the end we could probably list them off by their number (they never really say names, it's usually, ""hey, you there""). part of this is due to that amazing camera. it really lets us know these people and it doesn't cut back to the ""overview shot"" or something so we can just get a good look at everyone together. when there is a wide shot that shows the entire room, some jurors are up walking, getting a drink, one may be in the bathroom. it's not a condescending camera that says, ""here's everyone. we'll give you some time to get all of them straight."" the entire film -- aside from those estimated 120 seconds -- is shot in real time, or as close to real time as you can come without making a film with one continuous, unbroken shot. within the jury room there are no edits for time lapses, just for cutting to a different angle or juror. the film acknowledges how evidence is all subjective (""there's a difference between a slap and a punch.""). each juror saw the same thing in the courtroom (we hear the evidence and the case only through the jurors recollections) but comes out with something different. that's part of what makes movies in themselves great: we all see the same movie and, when one is good, we all leave with something else, specific to us. fonda is the leader in the film, almost made into a holy figure. he's passive in the beginning and he's the one who presents the other jurors with his feelings as to why the young man may not be guilty. that's what fonda does, brilliantly. he talks out his feelings. he's not in possession of some scientific fact that he plans on systematically informing the jury of, he just needs to take some time to sort out the facts, as he heard them, in his mind. of course he's noticed things the others haven't and he's given the case more thought than maybe most would have. but it isn't a one-man mission. by being the one to stand up, he lets the others come out and say what they've seen. he gives them the chance to think and feel things over. while fonda is obviously the protagonist, the film doesn't shy away from fairly showing other considered theories of those who are against him. at first juror #3 (lee j. cobb) is the common sense antagonist, but later juror #4 (e.g. marshall) has intelligent deductions as to why fonda is wrong. all of the technicalities of the film are fine. the acting is first-rate -- i was especially interested in juror #9 (joseph sweeney), who's made into an almost goofy old man with a strange way of showing his untold wisdom. and i now understand why henry fonda appealed to so many. lee j. cobb is terrific as the easily angered brute who isn't quite that simple. the picture on the dvd was incredibly crisp. this is the type of movie they should show in american history classes. hell, show it in any country (like mine, canada) where democratic notions are held dear. in this room there is a microcosm of judicial, political, and human existence. a masterwork. ****";28 February 2003;10;['famous', 'other', 'fair', 'just', 'adjacent', 'blase',

450;Keyska2004;this is my 2nd review since signing on to imdb. i love movies and all types. 12 angry men should be watched by everyone over 20 years of age. the older you are the more you appreciate it. this black and white film lends to the effects like so many of the other great films from before 1960. henry fonda has always reminded me of my father, especially in his mannerisms throughout this film. i feel sorry for those under 20, because they probably have never heard of this movie, but for those who have, it will open them up to many others. every generation (including mine, hs class of '71)believes that their parents don't understand them. i was definitely no different. but, i was fortunate enough to watch these earlier films so i have developed a strong bond with them. if you have just seen this movie for the first time, may i suggest reviewing and watching some of the afi's top 100 films of all time. i have over 70 of those films in my dvd collection.;14 November 2010;10;['angry', 'old', 'more', 'black', 'white', 'many', 'other', 'great', 'sorry', 'many', 'different', 'fortunate', 'early', 'strong', 'first', 'top'];0.1744791666666666
451;RagingDraugr;'12 angry men' manages to accomplish what very few films manage to do: make a successful, engaging film that plays out almost entirely within one room. for the vast majority of the run-time, the film takes place entirely within four small walls. and the fact that it manages to accomplish so much with those walls should be praise in and of itself. firstly, the plot is exceptional - a murder trial. the defendant, a boy who is assumed to have killed his father in an emotional outburst. if he's found guilty by the 'angry men', he gets the electric chair. the details of this case are quickly thrown into suspicion by fonda, and from there, it's a snowball of confusion that casts a long shadow of doubt over the jury's proceedings - leading from an (almost) unanimous vote of 'guilty' to a completely unanimous vote of 'not guilty'. this flip feels completely natural and logical, due to the clever writing. in addition, due to the tightness of the plotting, the pacing of the film was consistently strong. the cleverness of the writing also applies in many other areas such as with lee j. cobb's character - a man who, at the film's climax, is revealed to have imposed his own furious and frustrated feelings towards his own son upon the defendant. in fact, the writing helps to distinguish each character effectively, giving each instantly recognisable character traits: henry fonda's character is calm but unsure, lee j. cobb's character is excitable and probably the most angry out of the 12, jack warden's character is lazy and a slouch (and so on and so on...). many of the characters' actions also highlighted particular social prejudices (e.g. suggesting that, because he grew up in a slum, he was given to violence), that hint at how much of an effect past experience has on a decision - and how no decision, especially one as important as deciding the life of a young man, is ever truly unbiased (as shown distinctly by lee j. cobb's character, as mentioned above). and of course, all the nuances of this writing are demonstrated and carried by fantastic performances across the board by all the actors. as stated previously, the film does indeed take place almost entirely within the jury room with only three short scenes outside of it: inside the courthouse, inside the courtroom and outside the courthouse. but what keeps the room from feeling stagnant is the cinematography, which is fantastic throughout with clever use of blocking (i.e. an actor's moves in relation to the camera) and interesting, varied angles and shot compositions - one moment, two actors are looking out a window discussing elements of the case and then, in one swift dolly move, we're now focused back on the table and the rest of the group. the blocking also further accentuated each character's movements and idiosyncrasies, which in combination with the writing, also elevated the characters more and more. considering the quality of the writing, the pacing, the acting, the cinematography and the blocking, there's very little to truly criticise '12 angry men' for - except for maybe one thing: the score was forgettable, but it wasn't used much anyway, so definitely more of a nitpick than a real criticism. if you're going to watch one great courtroom drama film in your lifetime, make it the one that helped to define the genre (and also make it the one that doesn't even unfold inside of a courtroom).;19 September 2018;10;['angry', 'few', 'successful', 'engaging', 'vast', 'small', 'exceptional', 'emotional', 'guilty', 'angry', 'electric', 'long', 'unanimous', 'guilty', 'unanimous', 'guilty', 'natural', 'logical', 'clever', 'strong', 'many', 'other', 'such', 'own', 'furious', 'frustrated', 'own', 'recognisable', 'calm', 'unsure', 'excitable', 'angry', 'lazy', 'many', 'particular', 'social', 'much', 'important', 'young', 'unbiased', 'fantastic', 'short', 'stagnant', 'fantastic', 'clever', 'interesting', 'varied', 'more', 'little', 'angry', 'forgettable', 'more', 'real', 'great'];0.0874007936507936

456;nitratestock35;"of course twelve angry men is about the legal system in the us. of course it is considered ""artsy"" in part since it is low budget and filmed in black and white. but above all it is cinema that has the three basic ingredients of what makes a great movie: a good screenplay, great actors and impeccable photography. cinema started as filmed theater and imho any film should be aware of its origins. as soon as a movie denies its origins totally and turnes into a computer generated roller coaster ride, i don't like it. i don't say all films should play in just one room. but the ""real time"" feel should be explored much more often in movies. hitchcock did it with ""rope"" and i think he did it excellently. twelve angry men is based upon a television play. these were transmitted live (!!!) back in the 1950s because the video tape didn't exist back then - so we can speak of theater. the movie itself has very much the same feel to it. i like the interactiveness between the actors and the ""modern theater performance"" used back then. in recent movies we can see all too often an actor caring about his/her facial expressions when filmed and caring about the voice at the studio dubbing stage. in this film everything what you see and what you hear looks 100% natural. i am especially overwhelmed by the values transmitted by the main characters. honest hank (henry fonda) is of course the most likeable character. e.g. marshall stands out as well. but it's the great, late lee j. cobb who runs away with the movie in his final scene. very powerful. watch it! one of the finest movies ever!";11 June 2003;10;['angry', 'legal', 'artsy', 'low', 'black', 'white', 'basic', 'great', 'good', 'great', 'impeccable', 'imho', 'aware', 'real', 'angry', 'same', 'modern', 'recent', 'facial', 'natural', 'main', 'likeable', 'great', 'final', 'powerful', 'fine'];0.1848484848484848

469;ProperCharlie;there are some films that are acknowledged classics of one degree or another. whether it be a technical aspect such as cinematography or something less tangible such as emotional content or a gripping narrative, some stand out. 'twelve angry men' is one such film, mostly noted for the amazing acting performances from a large cast in one room. they have few props and one main set. the stage for twelve actors to show their stuff. and show it they do. this film works as a pure stage play on the screen. all twelve actors step up to the plate. the writing is immaculate making the complex inter-relationships between the twelve work believably and never letting the pace slacken. it's tense and taut. the points being made aren't always subtle, but they're never hammered home. keeping twelve characters involved in a story while keeping it moving along is a tough task for a writer. all of them want to have their say so you don't forget them, all of them have to show what their character is, yet none of them must be allowed to dominate. reginald rose deserves immense plaudits for what he achieved here. there is a political message here. to some it may be obvious, to others it may be unpalatable. you may call it propaganda, yet unlike a lot of more modern propagandists, this doesn't solely preach to the converted. this is one to think on for everyone. it's important that even at the end, the viewer doesn't know what really happened the night of the crime. did they save an innocent from the chair or did they let a killer walk free? it asks questions, says where its loyalties lie but doesn't claim that the issues are black and white. a truly unusual standpoint and one i would welcome more of in film. perhaps one of the notable aspects that isn't much commented on about 'twelve angry men' is the oddly un-filmic qualities it has. as previously mentioned it moves like a stageplay rather than screenplay. the look is reminiscent of a tv production including the sans-serif credits underneath the actors faces, and the simple studio set. this hasn't prevented its strengths propelling it into a slot as one of the best and best loved movies of all time.;5 September 2005;8;['technical', 'such', 'tangible', 'such', 'emotional', 'angry', 'such', 'amazing', 'large', 'few', 'main', 'pure', 'immaculate', 'complex', 'inter', 'tense', 'taut', 'subtle', 'tough', 'immense', 'political', 'obvious', 'unpalatable', 'more', 'modern', 'converted', 'important', 'innocent', 'free', 'black', 'white', 'unusual', 'more', 'notable', 'angry', 'un', 'filmic', 'reminiscent', 'simple', 'good'];0.074156746031746

484;dlpburke;"12 angry men is entertaining, mostly well acted, and worth a watch. it could have been far better but, from the outset, the film was designed only to take a pot-shot at the right, and promote a left wing progressive viewpoint as the absolute truth. this story is hardcore propaganda and, judging by its score on imdb, has succeeded in fooling a great number of people. what is interesting to me is that the left-wing's brainwashing started this early. hollywood is still churning out the same bias today (go and read my dark knight review). the movie has a very interesting premise: an open-and-shut case is called in to question when one man on the twelve-man jury slowly convinces the others that the eighteen year old on trial for the murder of his father may, in fact, be innocent. that's got some real potential, hasn't it? sadly, the gone-in-the-head leftist who wrote this did what i feared he would: loaded the dice and peddled a leftist agenda - namely one that excuses criminals of their actions and seeks to end the death penalty. that's the film's overwhelming goal. it wants the audience to come away from the movie, not with a greater appreciation of the legal system, but with the view that the death penalty should be abolished and that anyone who objects to this is a deluded, little bigot. let's look at the facts we are given: -spoilers from here on- 1. an 18 year old is on trial for the murder of his father. he has no alibi. the alibi he gave to police (that he was in a theatre the whole time) fell apart when he could not recall anything about the movies that were showing - even their names. 2. there are two main witnesses: one saw the defendant leaving the scene of the crime (and heard the event); the other saw the murder take place through a window and identified the defendant. the defendant was also heard shouting in anger 'i'm gonna kill you', the same day as the murder. 3. the knife (with a very rare design) used in the murder is the same knife that the defendant had bought earlier and was carrying around. his friends testified to this effect. 4. the defendant is an habitual criminal who has had numerous run-ins with the law, including two arrests for knife fighting. he is said to be 'real handy with a knife'. 5. the defendant has a clear motive: his father was repeatedly violent and abusive towards him, and had beaten him regularly (with fists) since he was five years of age, including the day of the murder. i was intrigued. why does this one juror believe the defendant may not be guilty? how could he convince the rest that there is reasonable doubt? despite the fact i feared these questions would receive fob-offs, i was still hopeful an intelligent investigation would be crafted around them. but no. straight away, the film deliberately loads the dice by having certain jurors holding prejudiced or otherwise undesirable traits, while the dissenting voice is calm, collected, and supremely open-minded. that's cliche, and a very common leftist tactic (you'll see it a lot on shows like star trek). the film takes each of the facts above and finds an absurd alternate explanation for them, such as the knife could have fallen out of the defendants pocket and the true murderer used an identical knife (this is the fantastic explanation given by our leftist hero). the film has a moronic moment where the 'hero' pulls out a knife he has bought (illegally), which appears identical to the one in question. the idea being that it isn't so rare, after all. other silly moments include the jury discussing why the defendant would come home a few hours later if he had indeed done the crime. not one of them mentions that the defendant lives there and would have to come back home in order to allay fears that he was the murderer. it's part of an alibi. what else is he going to do, disappear and hope that the police don't find that a tad suspicious? nearly every explanation given in favour of the defendant is absurd or complete conjecture. when you string all the known facts together, the chances of them all being explained away in a fashion that exonerates the defendant is literally millions to one. it's so implausible that no sane jury would acquit. but the writer wants this to happen, so it does (and 12-0 in favour, just in case you missed the point). i love it when writers do that. don't you? at one point, the following dialogue takes place: ""no-one can know a thing like that; this isn't an exact science."" ""that's right, it isn't."" okay, then, let's just forget putting people on trial because we can hardly ever be 100% sure that they did the crime in question, can we? the number of victims created by having no deterrent, or by allowing dangerous criminals to go free, is far greater than the absolute minority case where an innocent person is found guilty. some people cannot be reasoned with and are far too broken to be rehabilitated. they are like a dangerous dog. we don't try to change the nature of a dangerous dog because we know it's futile, and we know that by ignoring it, we are just risking more innocent lives. this really isn't rocket science, it's just that the leftist types (who have a huge stranglehold on the media/tv) refuse to budge, and muddy the waters with their insane progressive agenda. people cheering this movie are cheering for a violent thug, who got away with first-degree murder. it's not hip, it's just dumb. wake up. my rating: 3/5";8 October 2015;1;['angry', 'entertaining', 'worth', 'well', 'left', 'progressive', 'absolute', 'hardcore', 'great', 'interesting', 'left', 'early', 'same', 'dark', 'interesting', 'shut', 'old', 'innocent', 'real', 'leftist', 'overwhelming', 'great', 'legal', 'little', 'old', 'whole', 'main', 'other', 'same', 'rare', 'same', 'habitual', 'numerous', 'handy', 'clear', 'violent', 'abusive', 'guilty', 'reasonable', 'hopeful', 'intelligent', 'certain', 'prejudiced', 'undesirable', 'calm', 'minded', 'common', 'leftist', 'absurd', 'alternate', 'such', 'true', 'identical', 'fantastic', 'leftist', 'moronic', 'identical', 'rare', 'other', 'silly', 'few', 'suspicious', 'absurd', 'complete', 'implausible', 'sane', 'exact', 'right', 'sure', 'dangerous', 'free', 'great', 'absolute', 'innocent', 'guilty', 'dangerous', 'dangerous', 'futile', 'innocent', 'leftist', 'huge', 'insane', 'progressive', 'violent', 'first', 'dumb'];0.0616293532338308

486;StoryCharts;12 angry men is about the idea that everyone giving an honest effort to civic duty is a matter of life or death. it sets out to prove this idea with two external plots: one plot chronicles the journey of finding reasonable doubt for a not guilty verdict, the other chronicles the jury gradually giving an honest effort to the deliberation process. the result of these two plots, both of which end in success, gives rise to the idea that without everyone giving an honest effort, the democratic process would be broken. the movie is a short, confined story tightly told. it is an important story since the idea at the heart of democracy is a delicate one: that all members of society are innocent until proved guilty and that they each have the right to be judged by their peers. that 12 random people from all walks of life are the ultimate arbiters of what are life and death judgement is scary and liberating at the same time. it's scary in that each of us is a bundle of individual prejudices and hardened views that can sway our judgement. it's liberating in that these 12 random people need to unanimously decide on a single judgement despite their inherent differences. the movie highlights the democratic process by showing 12 specific individuals who are too busy and prejudiced from the get go to give the judging process an honest go. when only one juror stands between a death verdict and a long uncomfortable debate, the democratic process is on the verge of breaking down. by the individual standing up against his peers to insist on an honest discussion, he starts the process towards due diligence and evidence review that ultimately results in an unanimous not guilty judgement. the idea that it only takes one individual out of twelve to have the resolve for giving an honest effort to civic duty is a powerful one. it is the idea that the foundation of democratic society can rest on a single individual taking their responsibilities seriously. in fact it is the only foundation democracy can rest on. so the movie is about an important idea. but the drama of the story gets slightly repetitive in the second half, as juror after juror deals with their own prejudice. the story tries to give each juror a backstory that reinforces their preconceived notions and views, but having to do this for 12 people dilutes their power and makes most of them seem stereotyped and caricatured. but thankfully the filmmakers keep the story moving in a tight 90 minutes and don't ruin a good thing. my story chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca;24 July 2013;5;['angry', 'honest', 'civic', 'external', 'reasonable', 'guilty', 'other', 'honest', 'honest', 'democratic', 'short', 'important', 'delicate', 'innocent', 'guilty', 'random', 'ultimate', 'scary', 'same', 'scary', 'individual', 'hardened', 'random', 'single', 'inherent', 'democratic', 'specific', 'busy', 'honest', 'long', 'uncomfortable', 'democratic', 'honest', 'due', 'unanimous', 'guilty', 'honest', 'civic', 'powerful', 'democratic', 'single', 'only', 'important', 'repetitive', 'second', 'own', 'preconceived', 'most', 'caricatured', 'tight', 'good'];0.0407142857142857

493;Freddy_Levit;"........films rarely get this uplifting and brilliant. i cannot think of the last time i was so intrigued by the flawless plot, dialogue and acting since 12 angry men. for such a simplistic story set in one jury room, it is surprising that sidney lumet can drain you of all your emotions and leave you on the edge of your seat with suspense, mystery, and some of the best acting your bound to ever see grace the silver screen! when a boy is on last day of trial for killing his father in the heat of domestic arguments, 12 jury men are forced to present a verdict in which if guilty, is the one way ticket to the electric chair for the boy. when the jury men decide to quickly end the discussion and raise their hands to find out who thinks the boy is guilty, only one jury man (henry fonda) doesn't put his hand up. trial and character revelations, doubts, and possibilities follow. so masterfully crafted is this film, that every time i watch it, only gets better. it includes some of the best character development i've ever seen. sidney lumet is an expert in this field and this is by far his greatest contribution to hollywood history - one of the most important contributions to world cinema. however it was henry fonda and lee j. cobb who really made this film legendary, with their incredibly realistic performances. casting was genius. and the dialogue was astoundingly riveting up until the brilliant finale. what really impressed me personally also was the camera angles and movements that made the film so suspenseful. black and white made the film all the more powerful. and the music was minimal, which gave the film a more atmospheric experience, like you were their in the jury room with them - and you just feel that tension really built up as the movie proceeds. this inexpensive film, with such a simple setting had the world talking, the academy awards nominations rolling and henry fonda at his complete best form. i have rarely been so hypnotized by a film - 'lawrence of arabia' and 'it's a wonderful life' are other ones that come to mind. this is a definitive viewing for anyone who loves film. it sums up everything i love about film. everything from a technical point of view to superb acting and a simple yet complex character driven story, it's platinum and is most definitely one of the greatest cinematic achievements of all time - bar none! a statue should be erected in sydney lumet's honor......

508;sherbetsaucers;this movie has been more influential than any other in the way i see the world. any person who watches it and is later called to jury service cannot help but have visions of themselves fighting for justice. a true ensemble piece, each actor has a chance to truly shine in what must be considered one of the finest courtroom dramas ever made. it is certainly the finest courtroom drama ever made where we only see the courtroom for a minute and a half. each of the jury members is almost a stereotype. each of them is an aspect of ourselves: juror number one. he seems to let his duties preoccupy him somewhat, and in fact puts more interest into them than in the actual reason he is there, blinded by the system. juror number two is mild mannered and good natured. however he is unlikely to ever make a stand himself. he is the everyman. juror number three is an emotionally damaged father. he has become a revenger, seeking to punish the defendant because of the anger he has towards his son. juror number four is rational and logical. however his devotion to logic is pointless, as he has not been passionate enough to discover all of the facts. rather than questioning, he accepts. juror number five comes from a violent background. a young man, he reminds us that just because a person lives in a certain neighbourhood that is no excuse for breaking the law or violent behaviour. juror number six is a working man. he is strong, but respectful and also highly principled. this character is the 'working joe', the people who just get on with their jobs and do them. juror number seven is ambivalence personified. one might almost call him the id. continually throughout the movie he makes jokes, at the beginning his wise-cracking nature is amusing but it soon begins to grate. he is more interested in satisfying his own petty desires than doing a good job. juror number eight is decency. the lone dissenter. the only person who initially questions all that they have been told. throughout the movie he pushes his fellow jurors to see past what has been so easily presented and to search for the deeper possible truth. juror number nine can be summoned up in one word: understanding. while number eight may be the first person who questions, without number nines support he would have failed. it is nine that, more than anybody else, truly empathises with the witnesses. it is his initial insight into the human condition that sways a number of jurors, including juror number four. juror number ten is blinded by his bigotry. unlike any other jury member he seems to have no real endearing qualities, having an annoying way of speaking, a rude manner, even an intrusive cough. juror number eleven is an immigrant. he has come to america because of all that it represents. because of this it is ironic that he is the one who seems to remind others of what it means to be part of a democracy. juror number twelve represents hesitant behaviour. he is the only jury member to change his mind more than once. within these twelve characters there is a lot of symbolism involved. juror number eight falters only once. when talking with six he is forced to question the full implications of allowing a guilty man to go free. despite all of the passion and and reasoned arguments given by other jurors, it is this simple man who is the only person who makes number eight question himself. juror number twelve, the unsure character, actually works in advertising. though he can tell others what to want he is unsure himself. juror number nine, who supports number eight more than any other, is also seated next to him. the most symbolic figure is, of course, number eight. unlike any other jury member he does not offer a single piece of personal information about himself throughout the entire movie. anything we do learn about his personal life or background we learn because other jury members have asked him. he is concerned only with finding out what is relevant to the case. he is an architect. he is a man who helps others realise their dreams, helps other build something great. of course he is also dressed in white, like a lone paladin, a night in shining armour slaying the evil dragon. fonda played wyatt earp in my darling clementine, a role he was deservedly famous for. who better than a mythological law man to fight for justice now? we know right is on his side. however it is not just the acting that shines. the direction is superb. initially lumet cleverly places the camera above eye level, using a wide angled lense. throughout the movie this gradually changes until we are finally seeing the action from low down with the focal length of the lens having been increased. this leads to a greater feeling of claustrophobia, with tight zoom-ins causing sweaty, angry faces to fill the screen. the most notable exception to this is the scene where all of the jury distance themselves from the racist views of number ten. here we see him isolated and alone, and indeed it is the one time we see the entire room on the screen, further enhancing the feeling of his loneliness. in the end only juror number three is left voting guilty. he is put in the same situation as number eight was earlier. however, unlike number eight he does not have the conviction of his beliefs and so quickly crumbles, unable to stand against the other eleven. 12 angry men remains an important, much beloved movie. it shows us many facets of humanity, the highs and lows, and also what one man can do if he truly believes he is right.;6 February 2007;10;['influential', 'other', 'true', 'ensemble', 'fine', 'fine', 'more', 'actual', 'mild', 'mannered', 'good', 'natured', 'unlikely', 'rational', 'logical', 'pointless', 'passionate', 'violent', 'young', 'certain', 'violent', 'strong', 'respectful', 'principled', 'wise', 'amusing', 'interested', 'own', 'petty', 'good', 'lone', 'only', 'fellow', 'deep', 'possible', 'first', 'more', 'initial', 'human', 'other', 'endearing', 'annoying', 'rude', 'intrusive', 'ironic', 'hesitant', 'only', 'full', 'guilty', 'free', 'other', 'simple', 'only', 'unsure', 'more', 'other', 'symbolic', 'other', 'single', 'personal', 'entire', 'personal', 'other', 'relevant', 'other', 'great', 'white', 'lone', 'evil', 'famous', 'well', 'mythological', 'right', 'superb', 'focal', 'great', 'tight', 'angry', 'notable', 'racist', 'isolated', 'entire', 'guilty', 'same', 'unable', 'other', 'angry', 'important', 'much', 'beloved', 'many', 'right'];0.1067460317460317

512;zhongzl-kelley2014;"i haven't watched a film like this in years, it feels like ice cubes constantly slipping down my back, and it still have its wonderful impact on me although i love commercial films and am all for new filming technologies. i feel obliged to praise it without conservation. this is a typical example of minority influence: a single person sticking to his point gradually change everyone's opinion. the process is more than intriguing. i initially feel like the guys that vote for guilty are the kind of guys that vote for donald trump: ignorant, single-minded, stubborn, indifferent, selfish, occupied by stereotypes and prejudices, and always ready to comply. but as the film proceed, i gradually feel the warmth and intelligence that they possess, and to watch this amazing glare of humanity gradually brought out by the architect is most pleasant. it is a grandiose fight between calmness and arbitrariness, indifference and mercy, critical thinking and groupthink, equality and prejudice, ""supposition"" and ""facts"". the most startling technique this film uses is the transformation from above eyesight wide-angle shots to at eyesight level close-up shots. this change of distance between the camera to the audience makes the tempo tenser, and attracts significantly more attention to their points. like many, i was not into the film in the first five minutes, but the longer i watched, the more my emotions were swayed by different points of view. yet i wasn't even aware of it before i read it here. it is a very startling invention indeed. my favorite shot in the movie is when the man talked about how ""they"" are born to be villains, or how ""they"" naturally have the violent tendencies, all the juries walked from their seats one by one to show quiet disagreement. the impact was like shoving a bottle of icy soda into my chest, i was so touched that i started clapping my hands. although racism might be a reason why all of them vote for guilty in the first place, the knowledge eventually dawned on them that this is wrong. my psychology teacher taught us that prejudices often occurs unconsciously. as soon as it is dragged from the shadow of unconsciousness to the level of reasonable judgment, its flaws immediately reveal themselves. the man remained silent for the rest of the film. although i wonder whether they caught the true murderer or not, it is fairly clear that the boy wasn't necessarily the murderer. he could be, but he didn't deserve to be sent to death sentence immediately. my friend said that she suspected the murderer to be the architect, i'd say is fairly reasonable, or why would he bought an identical knife in the neighborhood? but anyway, the architect successfully avoided murdering an innocent boy with silence, i will give him a round applause for that.";22 March 2016;9;['wonderful', 'commercial', 'new', 'filming', 'obliged', 'typical', 'single', 'more', 'intriguing', 'guilty', 'ignorant', 'single', 'minded', 'stubborn', 'indifferent', 'selfish', 'ready', 'amazing', 'pleasant', 'grandiose', 'critical', 'startling', 'eyesight', 'wide', 'eyesight', 'close', 'more', 'many', 'first', 'long', 'different', 'aware', 'startling', 'favorite', 'violent', 'quiet', 'icy', 'guilty', 'first', 'wrong', 'reasonable', 'silent', 'true', 'clear', 'reasonable', 'identical', 'innocent'];0.0752825877825877

514;thepsychocritic;"courtroom dramas don't work well with everyone. neither do movies in black and white, people find them dull, boring and lack-lustre. 12 angry men falls in both these categories. yet, it manages to astound you with its breathtaking brilliance and subtle perfection. a boy is convicted of murdering his father. witnesses, good lawyers, bad past record, motive; an open and shut case. three minutes into the movie and the twelve jury members are in their chamber. they have all got their priorities and schedules - one has a baseball match, another has his garages going to pot. everyone wants to leave; it is not their butt that is going to land on the electric chair anyway. prior to a discussion of any sort, an initial vote is held with the hopes of making a quick, clean job out of it. eleven are convinced he is guilty. one isn't quite so sure. and hence unfolds one of the greatest dramas hollywood has ever seen. the movie doesn't waste time in showing the lawyers fighting like shark. it doesn't show a depressed teenager sobbing his guts out in the box. the camera focuses on him but once, and that single look is enough to convey a farrago of emotions - fear, exhaustion, uncertainty and a certain innocence. instead, it does what it is meant to - focus on the twelve men that matter; in whose hands resides the fate of the accused. they are regular people from everyday spheres of life - a coach, architect, bank clerk - men who don't overanalyze when presented with facts. they naively, yet innocuously, take things at their face value which compels them to reach the guilty verdict; after all, the evidence is overwhelming. the lone man (henry fonda) who contradicts them, however, realizes the onus that has befallen them and refuses to reach a hasty conclusion, for he believes that there is the possibility of there being reasonable doubt and as the american constitution states, a man is innocent until proved guilty. initially, the others are merely taken aback at the trivial inconvenience due to this rebellion of sorts. but this soon turns to resentment, finally boiling to anger - something that beautifully justifies the title of the movie. henry fonda does a convincing job as juror number eight. he is brooding, intelligent, pragmatic and at the same time calm with a mild demeanour. his acting isn't artificial as he thoroughly indulges himself in his role. the performance is powerful and both the jury members and viewers find it hard to counter his arguments. he asserts that ratiocination is the best and only way to decide - for a man's life hangs in the balance. as the movie proceeds, you see him demolishing proofs one after the other, till they all collapse like a stack of cards. the others too play their part, however, there isn't a real standout among the remaining eleven; a shortcoming that the movie faces. the rest of the characters have been poorly portrayed and lack depth; there is nothing that stands out or is memorable about them. while the film had several chances to introduce more dimensions to its actors, it simply fails to do so, despite the fact that is it primarily a character-centric movie. fonda is staunch in the lead role, but the faceless others serve no purpose than contradict him, sticking to him like leeches, without creating an identity of their own. the tension has been skilfully built up - right from the weather (it is the hottest day of the year) to the claustrophobic environment where the entire episode takes place. the idiosyncrasies of men have been highlighted wonderfully; their feeble mindedness, their anxiety, dogmatism, their indecisiveness and their fury at being constantly opposed by men who change their votes like the flip of a coin. they reason out, fight, talk dirty and negotiate. their faces glisten with sweat. they smoke. a weapon is brandished and a man resorts to violence. men are prejudiced, for the accused comes from a poor society with a history of violence. some even cite personal reasons for convicting the boy. there is racism, bigotry and impatience; but juror number eight refuses to budge, for he believes that the life of a man is worth more than that. the director sidney lumet (network, dog day afternoon) knows that the movie isn't about the suspense and doesn't try to make it into one. it is about how the characters have been drawn out, each representing a dimension of human personality. though, like many great movies, 12 angry men was a commercial failure, it is considered as a benchmark in american cinema. it is touching, mesmerising and provocative, and it does so much in a mere ninety six minutes, which indisputably makes it one of the greatest cult classics of all times.";31 August 2011;10;['black', 'white', 'dull', 'boring', 'angry', 'subtle', 'good', 'bad', 'past', 'motive', 'open', 'shut', 'electric', 'initial', 'quick', 'clean', 'guilty', 'sure', 'great', 'depressed', 'single', 'enough', 'certain', 'regular', 'everyday', 'guilty', 'overwhelming', 'lone', 'hasty', 'reasonable', 'innocent', 'guilty', 'trivial', 'convincing', 'intelligent', 'pragmatic', 'same', 'calm', 'mild', 'artificial', 'powerful', 'hard', 'good', 'only', 'other', 'real', 'memorable', 'several', 'more', 'staunch', 'lead', 'own', 'hot', 'claustrophobic', 'entire', 'feeble', 'dirty', 'poor', 'personal', 'worth', 'more', 'human', 'many', 'great', 'angry', 'commercial', 'touching', 'provocative', 'mere', 'great'];0.0563423645320197
515;gingerrdriley;this is a pretty good example of why execution will always matter more than any kind of extravagant production or over inflated budget. anyone even remotely familiar with this film understands that it's just 12 guys in a room arguing over a trial. it's a concept so simple on a visual level that it could just as easily be a middle school stage production and you could probably still find much of the iconography which comprises the setting. again though, none of that takes away from this film. to begin with, this film couldn't have been shot better. sidney lumet's background in television allows him to take full advantage of shifting lenses and ensemble shots which give the film an escalating sense of tension that in indispensable in convincing the audience that the dialogue happening between these men is a) taking them a long time and b) is physically, mentally and emotionally taxing for them. it's pretty easy to imagine a more amateur director shooting this film in a more flat and repetitive way. thankfully lumet isn't an amateur. every shot and cut is so purposeful in this film. not a frame is wasted and the one room setting at no point becomes tiresome. this film really reaches it's greatest heights with it's characters, despite how wonderful the visual narrative is. all 12 men are unique characters. none of them fades in to the background and they all bring a unique perspective to the case in question. you get a really good sense of the lives they lead outside the confines of this room they're in. at a certain point you get to have such a good understanding of the different men that whenever a knew point of debate is brought up you can start to piece together how each one of them is going to process it and how it might affect their ultimate decision on the case. it's really a bit of a difficult balancing act. in the end there are certain members of the jury which naturally have to take a more dominant role in the story than the others, but at the same time you have to allot the others time to bring depth to their character. lumet and the actors put it all together flawlessly. one you thing you might notice when watching this film is the general lack of music. i think ultimately it's better that way. in all likelihood music would have been more of a distraction than a tool in enhancing the tone of a given scene. there is music of course, but the reservation with which it is used ends up giving it more relevance to the story than if it book-ended every scene in the film. this film is in the dialogue and character interaction, and really there isn't enough room for any kind of over the top score, but again, that doesn't detract from the experience in any way. check it out if you haven't. it's great. 9/10.;2 March 2017;9;['good', 'more', 'extravagant', 'inflated', 'familiar', 'simple', 'visual', 'middle', 'much', 'full', 'ensemble', 'indispensable', 'long', 'easy', 'more', 'amateur', 'flat', 'repetitive', 'purposeful', 'tiresome', 'great', 'wonderful', 'visual', 'unique', 'unique', 'good', 'certain', 'good', 'different', 'knew', 'ultimate', 'difficult', 'certain', 'dominant', 'same', 'general', 'well', 'more', 'more', 'enough', 'top', 'great'];0.2474089635854342

522;conono;this stagebound potboiler has a plot which is a matter of shooting fish in a barrel. racism, to use the prime example, is used as an instance of a rush to judgment and then it's used to excuse a rush to the opposite judgment. still it's important to realize that this is entertainment. the equivalent of advocacy journalism, i admit, but no one denies that the creators of this entertainment have agendas. to the extent that the film affected me, it emphasized again in my mind how fallible our system of justice is. one should steer clear of it at all costs (the justice system, not the film). and having said that, we've arrived at our system of justice through centuries of trial and error. and the advocacy system still seems superior to any previous arrangement. but back to the film: it's respected because it's tightly plotted and exhibits impressive characterizations on the parts of several actors. i'm sorry that several characters are stereotypes when stereotyping itself is the 'crime' the jury (as opposed to the accused) is so guilty of. but the fact is that stereotyping is how messages are conveyed through the mass media, and it's a matter of whose stereotypes are being retailed. rose & lumet have their own, and they indeed add up to shooting fish in a barrel. (immigrants=good, nativist americans=bad, etc.) there's also an implication that with enough consideration, no one would ever be considered guilty of anything, especially if we consider extenuating circumstances. separately, it's scary to consider that the lack of air conditioning in jury rooms led to a lot of hasty verdicts! finally, though, i can readily imagine how bracing this entertainment was in 1957. it was probably very much like a lightning bolt.;4 May 2012;7;['stagebound', 'prime', 'opposite', 'important', 'fallible', 'clear', 'superior', 'previous', 'impressive', 'several', 'sorry', 'several', 'guilty', 'mass', 'own', 'good', 'nativist', 'bad', 'enough', 'guilty', 'scary', 'hasty'];0.0395833333333333

534;kylebengel;"to begin with, let me state for the record that i think this is the finest film of the 1950's and one of the best films of all times. only the fact that so many other people share my opinion has prevented me from writing a glowing review on this site, as there were already so many to choose from. however, i saw the film again last night on turner classic movies (and stayed up until well after midnight to watch it, trading sleep for artistic sustenance) and i was struck be something that seemed so obvious, yet had always eluded me in past viewings. i was struck by the use of metaphor in the film. i guess that i had never seen it quite that way before as i was content to watch a simple, yet exciting play unfold. but last night was a revelation. the three metaphors that most jumped out at me are as follows: 1) the lighting. in order to simulate the growing darkness of the storm out the window, the lighting was slowly turned down through the film until it became obvious that the lights in the room would have to be turned on. when juror-1 turns the lights on, the whole room changes. as the darkness had crept in, the room had become more and more hostile. yet, when the light came on, most of the characters' attitudes change to more genial manor. the lights comes on after juror-8 has made most of his points and it seems the light is the symbolic turning of the jury. 2) the cinematography. the direct deliberately changed his lenses in the camera through the shoot to make the walls of the jury room seem to close in on the jurors. this is a nice physiological trick, but it seemed to me to be more. notice how, the closer they get to a hung jury, the closer they come to juror's #-3, -4, and -10 simply declaring themselves hung, the closer the walls get. but in the final scene in the room, when they are all leaving, the camera lens reverts back to the proportions used at the beginning of the film. the room is big and airy again. i like the symbolism of of the room, representing the weight of the defendant's life, closing in on them. 3) (my favorite) the rain. prior to the storm starting, all of the jurors have voted the way they do at the end except for #'s 3,4 & 10, all of whom are carrying ""baggage"" of their own. #-4 is a man possessed of intellect and sees himself as above the other's mentally. #-10 has years of racism blinding him. and #-3 has the memory of his failed relationship with his son. then it begins raining, hard. juror-10 has his great scene and simply self-destructs, in the process letting go of his racism, at least for the moment. juror-4 undergoes the ""eyeglasses"" scene and lets go of his self-assumed intellectual superiority. and juror-3 (lee j. cobb is the man!) launches into that most famous scene, finally letting go of his anger toward his own son. as soon as they release their own personal demons, the truth become evident to them, the rain, as it were, having washed their souls clean. no sooner is it has #-3 completed his transformation then it stops raining...and the sun begin to peak through the darkness. this is genius film making! in the end, maybe that is way i love this film so much: each time i watch it, there is something new to find. i hope you enjoy it as much as i did.";17 May 2005;10;['fine', 'good', 'many', 'other', 'many', 'last', 'classic', 'artistic', 'obvious', 'past', 'content', 'simple', 'exciting', 'last', 'obvious', 'whole', 'hostile', 'most', 'more', 'genial', 'most', 'symbolic', 'direct', 'nice', 'physiological', 'more', 'hung', 'final', 'big', 'own', 'other', 'hard', 'great', 'least', 'intellectual', 'famous', 'own', 'own', 'personal', 'evident', 'clean', 'much', 'new'];0.2466119528619528

544;mkfreeberg;"(spoilers) i really liked the message of the movie: a lot of times things that look crystal clear at first glance, upon deeper inspection, aren't so clear. the acting was top-notch all-around, especially with juror #9. the product ends up being not very preachy, which is a considerable achievement given that it's built entirely around a simple parable. with the benefit of hindsight, though, one can see a few things about this that i personally find really disturbing. the question that drives the movie is whether the jurors have properly awarded the defendant the benefit of any reasonable doubt, and as the climax approaches, the attention given to this reaches a fevered pitch. left behind in the dust, is the equally critical question of whether the defendant is really guilty. there's a scene early on when jack warden, the juror who just wants to get the voting over with so he can watch a ball game, meets henry fonda in the washroom. the last two lines in that scene discuss the possibility that the boy may be acquitted, even though he is guilty. fonda says something to the effect of ""that very well may be"" or some such, and to my recollection this is the last time this possibility is even considered. the jury may have released a murderer onto the streets. you can make the argument that with the presence of reasonable doubt, this was their job. i agree. but as henry fonda walks down the courthouse steps to resume his everyday life as an architect, would it really then be fitting to have the happy ""a wrong has been righted"" swelling-orchestra music, as our hero walks proudly among his fellow citizens with his head held high? doubt or no, conviction or no, this kind of peace-of-mind is not lying in wait for you after your last day on a real jury. there are jurors who want it anyway, and because of that, will not convict anyone. they have seen this movie, and want to be henry fonda. i've served with them. it's a pretty serious problem. there is a short speech given by fonda shortly after he is revealed to be the one juror who wants to acquit. several times in the speech he makes the point that the defendant is poor, has had a rough background, and has been beaten up a lot. it is not entirely clear where he is going with this, since the movie is supposed to be about what is reasonable doubt, and how the doubt applies regardless of economic class. there is at least one other juror who wants to convict because the defendant is poor; does fonda mean to say with a defendant who was wealthier, he himself would have voted to convict? that doesn't seem likely at all. but then why bring it up? it means something to other jurors, but it isn't supposed to mean anything to fonda. the only way it could support any of fonda's arguments, is if he was making decisions based on the way those decisions made him feel about himself, rather than based on the evidence. this is something jurors aren't supposed to do. four years after this movie was made, the supreme court defined the exclusionary rule in mapp v. ohio. so by this time, you weren't supposed to convict anyone unless you knew they were guilty beyond any reasonable doubt, and in addition to that, if you knew too much, then you still couldn't convict. during the sixties, conviction became such an unlikely goal even when the evidence seemed compelling, that a lot of district attorneys refused to make arrests even though they knew a suspect posed a significant danger to society. by the seventies, americans were so fed-up with the ""justice system failing us"" that they began turning politicians out of office in bulk, hoping against hope they could fix what was broken before their own children were murdered or their wives were raped. between vietnam and watergate, this was a third salvo against our fragile faith in government, and it was an erosion of our trust that we don't talk about too much today. what really concerns me is that a little while after this film was made, with the poorest americans being forced to live among violent people and thus becoming increasingly interested in vigilantism, suddenly we had a huge surge in movies about ""taking the law into your own hands."" dirty harry, death wish, and countless made-for-tv projects. in summary, the pendulum swung in one direction, then a few years later, the other. hollywood got to make money both times. i have trouble getting completely behind this film because it's a concentrated effort, ultimately a successful one, to get that pendulum swinging wildly. if we spent that relatively short amount of time, just fifteen years or so, leaving ""revolution"" out of it and reforming our justice system in baby steps, the mistakes of the past could have been avoided. i do not know if it was possible to fix what was broken back then, by doing this -- convictions weren't always carefully considered back in the 1950's & earlier. but a lot of innocent people would be alive today if all those violent felons, in subsequent years, were arrested like they should have been. i would say, if you're going to serve on a jury, by all means rent this because it's a very meticulous and passionate reminder of your civil duty, it makes some great points, and everything in this movie is highest-quality. but also on your required-viewing list would be primal fear, the richard gere movie. better yet, watch that one last, so the final scene really sticks in your mind. nobody should be serving on a jury, if they can't seriously consider the consequences of releasing people who are really guilty of violent crimes.";7 August 2005;8;['clear', 'first', 'deep', 'clear', 'top', 'preachy', 'considerable', 'simple', 'parable', 'few', 'disturbing', 'reasonable', 'critical', 'guilty', 'last', 'guilty', 'such', 'last', 'reasonable', 'everyday', 'fitting', 'happy', 'fellow', 'high', 'last', 'real', 'serious', 'short', 'several', 'poor', 'rough', 'clear', 'reasonable', 'economic', 'least', 'other', 'poor', 'wealthy', 'likely', 'other', 'only', 'exclusionary', 'guilty', 'reasonable', 'unlikely', 'compelling', 'significant', 'own', 'watergate', 'third', 'fragile', 'much', 'little', 'poor', 'violent', 'interested', 'huge', 'own', 'dirty', 'countless', 'few', 'other', 'concentrated', 'successful', 'short', 'possible', 'innocent', 'alive', 'violent', 'subsequent', 'meticulous', 'passionate', 'civil', 'great', 'high', 'primal', 'last', 'final', 'guilty', 'violent'];-0.0081071428571428

550;Minstrelman;can you believe that there is a successful movie that has none of the major hollywood tried and true methods to create a lasting memory? this film is a major triumph that still creates a stir in me every time i see it. it's power is not in the visual images created, (although much of the cinematography is imaginative, especially the last shot from the coat closet, even with the challenge of one major room), but in the drama created by the tension of men coming together from all walks of lives to judge another human being. they bring their prejudices, their fear, their life experiences, their lack of interest, and their anonymity into a room to make a decision--that's when the real story starts. we all think about the possibility of having to face that day--some relish the opportunity while others fear making a bad decision. it's one reason this film resonates with so many people. it's a common experience that brings out different emotions in different people. the remake, although not as effective because of the lack of originality, is also good and brings in other points of view, including racial issues. both lack one thing--a female's point of view! but that creates even more tension. after all, men don't want to deal with their emotions the same way women do. besides, we would have to change the title! :o);30 April 2004;10;['successful', 'major', 'true', 'major', 'visual', 'much', 'imaginative', 'last', 'major', 'human', 'real', 'bad', 'many', 'common', 'different', 'different', 'effective', 'good', 'other', 'racial', 'more', 'same'];0.1453947368421052

554;dominicpearson;"i watched this film for the first time about a year ago and rated it 8/10 then. having re-watched it today i have felt the need to knock another point off. i really enjoyed this film. i love the premise of having an entire film shot predominantly in a single location in real time. in a lot of ways it is more of a play than a film and this gives it a unique twist (although i am aware of plenty of other films that adopt the same technique). the positives points of the film are: character development - we get to know the characters at the same time and to the same depth as those in the room, no more, no less. we are given limited knowledge about them, their backgrounds, their prejudices and are encouraged to judge them in similar vain to how they are judging the defendant on the limited information they have about him. very clever and the mix of personalities from the shy, retiring to the clearly angry and racist rings true of the likely cross section of personalities that would be found in a real jury room. the message of the story - i think it rings true today just as much as it did in the 1950's. trial by jury is a flawed concept and people can be easily manipulated by fellow jurors and lawyers alike. i particularly like how juror 12 flits between guilty and not guilty and how they are all too eager to make a snap judgement without thinking in the first instance. this is a common problem - these people are not lawyers, they do not think like lawyers and will always struggle to set aside their personal feelings and prejudices to look at the facts in the cold, hard light of day taking account of the reasonable doubt issue. the manner in which this film uses its limited set/time frame to achieve the very real feeling of manipulation is impressive to say the least. the acting - all of the actors play their parts perfectly. you find yourself wanting to know more about them but realise the premise is that you are in the same shoes as the others. to be given such thinly created (in the best sense possible) characters and still want to know more about them (where did the racist undertones come from, what happened between juror 3 and his son, why is juror 8 so eager to prove the reasonable doubt?) is impressive, especially in such an ensemble piece. so where does it lose points? simply put i don't like the way that the ""innocence"" is proved. it flys in the face of the proper court process and is just a little unbelievable and all too conveniently pieced together (do you really think they would be paying such close attention to a witnesses nose??). i understand the need to create the reasonable doubt but feel that it was done too easily with each juror falling into place far too quickly. i was also disappointed that juror 3 gave up his convictions. it would have been a much greater triumph, in my eyes, if it had been a hung jury. i agreed with juror 3 and empathised with the choice he had to make and felt that the ""honorable"" juror 8 bullied his opinions on everyone else. the point of the jury is to consider the evidence put before them and to make a judgement on that basis. they should not bring in numerous assumptions (and that is what they did) which colour the evidence they have been given. doing so will always create sufficient doubt to acquit the defendant. there is too much danger in doing so and i do not believe that in a room of 12 strong characters no one would raise such an objection. or i may be missing the point entirely! maybe the manipulation by juror 8 is the whole point.... in conclusion, therefore, i can see why it is a classic but am at slight pains to understand its high position in the top 250 given the nature of the perceived flaws. having said this i suggest that if you enjoy thought provoking, well scripted and acted drama this film is a must see.";27 December 2009;7;['first', 'entire', 'single', 'real', 'more', 'unique', 'aware', 'other', 'same', 'same', 'same', 'more', 'less', 'limited', 'similar', 'limited', 'clever', 'shy', 'angry', 'racist', 'true', 'likely', 'real', 'true', 'flawed', 'fellow', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'eager', 'snap', 'first', 'common', 'personal', 'cold', 'hard', 'reasonable', 'limited', 'real', 'impressive', 'least', 'more', 'same', 'such', 'good', 'possible', 'more', 'racist', 'eager', 'reasonable', 'impressive', 'ensemble', 'proper', 'little', 'unbelievable', 'such', 'close', 'reasonable', 'disappointed', 'great', 'hung', 'honorable', 'numerous', 'sufficient', 'much', 'strong', 'whole', 'slight', 'high', 'top', 'scripted'];0.0719775132275132

559;pvilleguy;"this is a fine film with a terrific cast. its spartan set serves to draw the viewer into the intensity that churns throughout the deliberations of the twelve men constitute the jury in a criminal case. it is hard to imagine a simpler story line: the twelve person jury has retired to deliberate the fate of a young man charged with murdering his father. one of the number (henry fonda) votes ""not guilty"" in the first vote. the other 11 jurors, more or less convinced that they are discussing an ""open and shut"" case, immediately set out to prove him wrong. instead, one expresses doubts about the evidence and proceeds to convince the other jurors, one by one, of the flaws in the evidence and the existence of a reasonable doubt as to the guilt. nearly all of the action takes place in the jury room, or in the restroom adjacent to it. there is no recreation of the crime other than those portions of the evidence ""acted out"" by the jurors in the course of their deliberations. this film does not emphasize the police work, or the work of the lawyers in the trial, or of investigators, or forensic evidence. instead, the viewer is drawn into the drama of twelve jurors trying to decide what is the right thing to do in the case. each in turn reveals a bias or flaw in his logic that has caused him to view the evidence in a particular way. in the end, each is confronted to identify his blind spot and acknowledge that it is that blind spot that caused him to think the defendant guilty rather than a careful examination of the evidence. one just wants to get to the yankees game, one believes if an immigrant is charged with a crime he has to be guilty, and so forth. there are two dramatic moments that stand out above the rest. the first is the speech by ed begley in which he reveals that his determination of guilt is based on nothing other than blind prejudice. during his speech, the jurors leave the table and turn their backs on begley, who in the end acknowledges his bias. the second is when the final holdout juror, lee j. cobb, comes to grips with the fact that he hopes to punish the defendant as a means of vicariously punishing his own son, who has apparently rejected cobb. of course each of those instances are high melodrama -- would that racial or ethnic prejudice was as easily identified and eliminated as it was in the film -- but each is played out with sufficient intensity as not to seem hokey or contrived. the film does show its age in a couple of respects -- there are no women on this jury, and no people of color -- an all white male jury in late 1950's new york is pretty unlikely. nonetheless, this is a superb film with tremendous performances by the ensemble cast. on another level, ""twelve angry men"" betrays a kind of pre-vietnam, pre-jfk assassination innocence about the ability of american ideals to triumph over all sorts of biases if only people are made to confront those biases. that idea is of course harder to sustain post-vietnam, post-jfk murder, post-watergate, but it is worthy of noting that not too long ago, it was still believed that such a triumph of ideals was possible. in the polarized nation we live in now, where the more obvious people's biases become, the more tenaciously they cling to them, the underlying message of ""twelve angry men"" just might be one we need to hear.";26 April 2006;9;['fine', 'terrific', 'spartan', 'criminal', 'hard', 'simple', 'young', 'guilty', 'first', 'other', 'more', 'convinced', 'open', 'wrong', 'other', 'reasonable', 'adjacent', 'other', 'forensic', 'right', 'particular', 'blind', 'blind', 'guilty', 'careful', 'guilty', 'dramatic', 'first', 'other', 'blind', 'second', 'final', 'own', 'high', 'racial', 'ethnic', 'sufficient', 'white', 'male', 'late', 'unlikely', 'superb', 'tremendous', 'ensemble', 'angry', 'pre', 'jfk', 'american', 'hard', 'vietnam', 'post', 'jfk', 'post', 'watergate', 'worthy', 'possible', 'obvious', 'angry'];-0.0632779623477297

569;CouchReview;12 angry men is a courtroom drama displaying deliberations, as its name suggests, by 12 men who are part of a jury and have to make a consensual decision about an 18 year old boy who has allegedly stabbed his father to death and faces a death penalty. the boy does not come from a glorious background and with his violent past everyone quickly forms a judgment of him. initially seeming an open & shut case with all evidence pointing fingers to the boy, all jurors unhesitatingly vote guilty in a preliminary vote apart from one, juror 8 (henry fonda). while he too doesn't have very high regards for the boy, but believes the evidence collected can be questioned when thoroughly studied. with this he feels there is a reasonable doubt to the boy's involvement to the horrendous act. other jurors already having made a conclusion in their mind initially get agitated by juror 8 who is taking an opposite position to the general public & all the jurors. without all jurors agreeing a verdict cannot be declared so they need to continue their deliberation, this fact adds to all the other jurors' frustration. the movie till the end displays the whole deliberation among the 12 men and juror 8 trying to make the others realise that there is a faintest doubt if not a strong one. the movie may be made decades ago but still does not fail to capture the attention of any viewer be it of any generation. it is a brilliant production devising which would have required an exceptional mind. with only one location setting and majorly showing only the 12 men for almost the whole of the movie, might have initially caused ridicule in the ideation stage, but that concept of a single setting and just a little more than a handful of actors is what makes the film so amazing. the story/case is surely not the most expansive but with fonda and the other actors gives a different depth which no one could have anticipated. the dialogues fairly well written keeping it precise and very much to the point. some viewers may be discouraged with it being a black & white film, through the start that is a little uncomfortable but after a while you won't even realise it. having been made in the 1950's it is a rarity to see a film having a run time under 100 minutes. there are very few if any aspects that can be deemed disappointing. 12 angry men is a must watch for everyone, it may be an old classic but its content is relevant even today. acting- 8.5 casting- 8.5 cinematography- 8 dialogue- 9 directing- 9 editing & effects- n/a sound & music- n/a story- 8 storytelling- 9 rating- 9.5;15 January 2021;9;['angry', 'consensual', 'old', 'glorious', 'violent', 'open', 'shut', 'guilty', 'preliminary', 'high', 'reasonable', 'horrendous', 'other', 'opposite', 'general', 'other', 'whole', 'faint', 'strong', 'brilliant', 'exceptional', 'majorly', 'single', 'little', 'more', 'amazing', 'expansive', 'other', 'different', 'precise', 'black', 'white', 'little', 'uncomfortable', 'few', 'disappointing', 'angry', 'old', 'relevant'];-0.0118154761904761

572;Rosser94;"the concept of this film is incredibly simple, as are the sets throughout. however, this is why the fact that this film is over 50 years old, is completely irrelevant to how enjoyable it is today. despite of the fact that this is not an action film, it is engaging, exciting and tense from start to finish and manages to stay highly entertaining throughout in the most subtle, intelligent manner i've seen in cinema. this is achieved through absolutely fantastic characterisation; each of the 12 men the movie centres around are individuals who are void of any tedious stereotypes that most of the shallow characters we see in cinema today will fit into. every one of these characters are complex, controversial and interesting. this is contributed to hugely by the fact that each and every role taken in this film is acted tremendously; it would be unfair to highlight a single great performance as every member of the cast is just sensational. in addition to this, the script gives an authenticity and realism to the movie; we can relate to and believe every situation on-screen, which is what makes this such edge-of-seat stuff. furthermore, the film could not be paced any more perfectly; as a result, the running time flies by. although this is, undoubtedly, a necessary watch for anybody, i could not give it a 10/10 purely because i felt that the direction of the plot and the nature of some aspects of character changes were a bit too predictable; i had a pretty good idea what was going to be different from the beginning of the movie and the end. overall, i believe that the unrivalled characterisation and simplistic thrills of this incredibly authentic, intelligent movie, render it a must-watch.

573;fayremead;"""12 angry men"" is the antithesis of today's blockbusters and blockbuster-wannabes. the successful action movies trim their dialog in favor of chases, fights and stunts. many films which depend on dialog have a lot of empty chatter. the twelve actors in sidney lumet's jury room face no such emptiness. every line in the film either contributes to the case (deciding whether or not an accused murderer is guilty) or says something about the speaker. all of the actors make their characters live in verbal and silent moments. an early example of an actor silently projecting his character comes when e.g. marshall (juror #4) ignores a fellow's attempt to hand him a business card. #4 comes across as a person who feels infallible and superior to everyone else whether or not he speaks. his imperfections are sweated out (literally) over the debate that follows; he responds by using his listening and speaking skills better. meanwhile, #10 (ed begley in the difficult role of humanizing an unrepentant bigot) becomes the angriest juror for a while. he's sociable at first, and he did pay attention during the trial (as is evident when he points out facts to the dissenting #8, played by henry fonda). but he contributes little substance to the deliberations. his favorite phrase, ""know what i mean?"", always comes at the end of a complaint or a bigoted remark. finally he goes on a rant which antagonizes all of the other jurors (even lee j. cobb's seemingly similar #3). most of them react by leaving the table. jack klugman's slum dweller (#5) goes first. jack warden as the ""i couldn't care less about the case, let me go to the ball game"" #7 slouches in his chair. the only other juror who stays seated is #4, still in the ""guilty"" camp but already a changed man, and he utters a devastating counterpoint to the other jurors' silence. #10 retreats to a corner, too ashamed to return to the table. he may never express his bigotry so openly again, although he will always be closed-minded (books are at hand where he sits, but he doesn't touch them). when 12 actors talk in a room for an hour and a half without a moment of tedium, full marks go to all twelve along with writer reginald rose and director sidney lumet. -tony";16 September 2008;9;['angry', 'successful', 'many', 'empty', 'such', 'guilty', 'verbal', 'silent', 'early', 'infallible', 'superior', 'difficult', 'unrepentant', 'angry', 'sociable', 'evident', 'little', 'favorite', 'bigoted', 'other', 'similar', 'most', 'less', 'only', 'other', 'guilty', 'devastating', 'other', 'ashamed', 'minded', 'full'];-0.0282986111111111

586;Misterhustler;this movie proves that a good story and a tight script are more important than any other thing for a movie to succeed. sidney lumet was already experienced when he directed this movie but still 12 angry men is an amazing first film. henry fonda is the main dissenter from the jury who tries to convince others that the case is not as simple as it appears. joseph sweeney who plays the role of the old man also does a remarkable job. the movie proves that a defendant has the right to a fair trial regardless of his social or economic status. i wish this movie could be shown in every law school so that lawyers and judges can understand the gravity and importance of their decisions. the movie is more than 50 years old but still feels fresh and is also a must watch for anyone who loves good cinema and for people interested in film making. this is also a perfect example of a simple yet powerful movie that will stay in the minds of the audiences. i can bet that anyone who has seen this movie will not be able to forget it easily.;13 November 2010;8;['good', 'tight', 'important', 'other', 'angry', 'amazing', 'first', 'main', 'simple', 'old', 'remarkable', 'fair', 'social', 'economic', 'more', 'old', 'fresh', 'good', 'interested', 'perfect', 'simple', 'powerful', 'able'];0.2933229813664596

588;Alexandar;"12 angry men (1957)**** in 1957. following five films were in the competition for the best picture academy award: david lean's ""bridge on the river kwai"", joshua lagan's ""sayonara"", mark robson's ""peyton place"", sidney lumet's ""12 angry men"" and billy wilder's ""witness for the prosecution"". pretty impressive list. not surprisingly, oscar went to bridge the last two (12 angry men and witness for the prosecution) were both exciting and intense courtroom dramas. 12 angry men, written by reginald rose, was about 12 jurors with not an easy task to decide whether a young man is guilty or innocent on the charge of murder. their decision must be unanimous. witness for the prosecution was a complex, unpredictable and full-of-surprises mystery from the novel written by famous agatha christie. both excellent movies. somewhere i read that agatha christie once said something like:12 angry men is an awfully stupid movie because it is not operating with the facts but only with the jurors' presumptions. i don't know whether she really said that (she'll excuse me if not) but this is rather pseudo-argument. although it is true that the jurors are operating rather with ""ideas"" than ""facts"" in this film this is certainly not a flaw or weakness. almost everything seems clear after the trial and jurors vote 11:1 for ""guilty"". only, juror #8 (henry fonda) votes ""innocent"" not because he think he is but because he think that the boy deserves some discussion. slowly, toward the end, one by one, all judges change their votes as a result of a long, intense discussions and quarrels. these discussions are the battle of nerves, personal observations, prejudices, moralities in a word characters. because there is a little fact, jurors are forced to project their own perspectives. this is very significant, since it is happening in all courts and among all judges. while all the judges, one by one, reveal their thoughts, there is absolutely brilliant, detailed and consistent character development in this film. also, since the judges are from the various backgrounds there's a superb representation of american society. in addition with the great directorial effort from lumet (in his debut!), who made great atmosphere using special lenses, long cadres and extracting the maximum from the actors, we have a truly unforgettable film. agatha christie maybe created the great plot (also clever dialog) in witness for the prosecution, but ""12 angry men"" is digging much deeper.";1 March 2006;10;['angry', 'good', 'peyton', 'angry', 'impressive', 'last', 'angry', 'exciting', 'intense', 'angry', 'easy', 'young', 'guilty', 'innocent', 'unanimous', 'complex', 'unpredictable', 'full', 'famous', 'excellent', 'angry', 'stupid', 'true', 'clear', 'guilty', 'innocent', 'long', 'intense', 'personal', 'little', 'own', 'significant', 'brilliant', 'detailed', 'consistent', 'various', 'superb', 'american', 'great', 'directorial', 'great', 'special', 'long', 'unforgettable', 'great', 'clever', 'angry', 'deep'];0.1761772486772486

620;harfordamanda;"simplicity can be complex if you work at it and 12 angry men is a perfect example of just that. the first time i saw it was in my civics class my freshman year of high school and unlike my other classmates who saw it boring and dull i was for lack of a better word riveted and here's why: the beginning of the film brings you into the tail end of a trial about a teenage boy who's accused of murdering his father. the evidence is a switchblade knife and the testimony of a old man and woman who heard and allegedly witnessed the crime. the judge sets the tone for the film explaining that the ""jury"" (you included) have to decide whether the boy is guilty or not guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. the jurors descend into the confines of the jury room and are locked in until the verdict is made. most of the men automatically deem the defendant guilty just because they want to leave and a few because of the evidence which consisted of the eye witness testimony. when the first vote is taken henry fonda (juror #8) is the only one who says not guilty but not because he thinks he not guilty or guilty but because he isn't sure. the film then progresses into fonda breaking the case down to the others and slowly but surely guiding the others into a verdict of not guilty all except juror 10 and 7. after some heated prejudicial and racial words eventually all become convinced of the kid's innocence. the very end of the film concludes that men go their separate way revealing only 2 of the men's names and the picture ends. the great thing about the 12.a.m is that you really need no information on the case, the trial, or the testimony you solely rely on the jurors showing that a little usually means a lot. i think it's a wonderful movie with a brilliant classic cast including the man behind the voice of winnie the pooh's piglet (you'll know it when you hear him) and of course the incomparable henry fonda. truly a film although simple was way ahead of it's time.";15 February 2010;10;['complex', 'angry', 'perfect', 'first', 'high', 'other', 'boring', 'dull', 'well', 'teenage', 'old', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'reasonable', 'most', 'guilty', 'few', 'first', 'only', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'sure', 'you', 'prejudicial', 'racial', 'convinced', 'very', 'separate', 'great', 'little', 'wonderful', 'brilliant', 'classic', 'incomparable', 'simple'];0.0274166666666666

630;teacherlogan;"you wouldn't think that 12 men in a tiny room would produce so much drama, so much passion and such a compelling film. but 12 angry men is a unique film. it's a roller-coaster ride that never leaves the jury room. 12 angry men presents us with a jury that has been given a murder case. a man has been stabbed to death and his son is the prime suspect. as these strangers take an initial vote to see where they stand, a lone juror stands between them and a quick conviction. deliberations begin; sometimes civil, sometimes heated as the 12 men attempt to reach a unanimous decision. i truly admire this film for what henry fonda's character represents. he is an idealist. he has convictions (no pun intended). a lone juror standing between eleven men and an easy guilty verdict. he believes in a jury system where they discuss the verdict, not just vote. it would have been so easy to simply agree with the room. the boy is probably guilty. everyone seems to know it. but he wants to talk. discuss the case for an hour. the collection of jurors is perfect because they are so 'imperfect'. a collection of businessmen, laborers and immigrants that makes this jury what juries should be; a representation of society. every character has his own perceptions, his own biases; and those opinions are brought out through magnificent dialog that is under-appreciated in today's cinema. we know very little about the jurors, in many cases we don't even know their names. but we know many of their occupations and, more importantly, we know their beliefs, manifested in the stance that each character takes, or doesn't take, as they discus the trial. as excellent as the casting is, i credit the writing for instilling the drama. every sentence is constructed flawlessly. the flow of this movie is brilliant, again considering that virtually every passionate scene is delivered within a confined space. this film is simple and real. the jurors get emotional, tired and frustrated; as would be expected locked in a room for hours on end. we understand the stress these men are under. we understand the anger each character is feeling, justified or not. we feel uncomfortable during a racial tirade, as though we were in the jury room unable to escape his bigotry. i think movies that make us feel uncomfortable have succeeded admirably. in a world where special effects, explosions and profanity are commonplace, excellent writing and flawless delivery is missing; or extraordinary when displayed. a movie where 12 men never leave one room would probably never hold today's audiences. that is a shame. movies that stand the test of time, as this one has, do so through the emotion that is expressed by the characters and empathized with the audience. i will leave the bulk of the plot of this film for your enjoyment, although the logic with which henry fonda's character reviews the prosecution's case is deliberate and fascinating. the characters are the plot. they drive the story by their actions and words. that is the focus of this film; action and words. brilliant words.";15 February 2007;10;['tiny', 'much', 'much', 'compelling', 'angry', 'unique', 'angry', 'prime', 'initial', 'lone', 'quick', 'civil', 'unanimous', 'lone', 'easy', 'guilty', 'easy', 'guilty', 'perfect', 'imperfect', 'own', 'own', 'magnificent', 'appreciated', 'little', 'many', 'many', 'brilliant', 'passionate', 'simple', 'real', 'emotional', 'tired', 'frustrated', 'under', 'justified', 'uncomfortable', 'racial', 'unable', 'uncomfortable', 'special', 'commonplace', 'excellent', 'flawless', 'extraordinary', 'deliberate', 'fascinating', 'brilliant'];0.2007993197278912

672;juho69;"'12 angry men' is an outstanding film. it is proof that, for a film to be great, it does not need extensive scenery, elaborate costumes or expensive special effects - just superlative acting. the twelve angry men are the twelve jurors of a murder case. an eighteen-year-old boy from a slum background is accused of stabbing his father to death and faces the electric chair if convicted. eleven of the men believe the boy to be guilty; only one (henry fonda) has doubts. can he manage to convince the others? the court case provides only a framework, however. the film's greatness lies in its bringing-together of twelve different men who have never met each other before and the interaction of their characters as each man brings his own background and life experiences into the case. thus, we have the hesitant football coach (martin balsam), the shy, uncertain bank clerk (john fiedler), the aggressive call company director (lee j. cobb), the authoritative broker (e.g. marshall), the self-conscious slum dweller (jack klugman), the solid, dependable painter (edward binns), the selfish salesman (jack warden), the calm, collected architect (fonda), the thoughtful, observant older man (joseph sweeney), the racially bigoted garage owner (ed begley), the east european watchmaker (george voskovec) and the beefcake advertising agent (robert webber) who has plenty of chat and little else. almost the entire film takes place in just one room, the jury room, where the men have retired to consider their verdict. the viewer finds him or herself sweating it out with the jury as the heat rises, literally and metaphorically, among the men as they make their way towards their final verdict. interestingly, the jurors (apart from two at the end) are never named. they do not need to be. their characters speak for them. henry fonda is eminently suitable and excellently believable as the dissenter who brings home the importance of a jury's duty to examine evidence thoroughly and without prejudice. joseph sweeney is delightful as juror no. 9, the quiet but shrewd old man who misses nothing, whilst e.g. marshall brings his usual firmness and authority to the role of juror no. 4. all the actors shine but perhaps the best performance is that of lee j. cobb as juror no. 3, the hard, stubborn, aggressive, vindictive avenger who is reduced to breaking down when forced to confront the failure of his relationship with his own son. several of the stars of '12 angry men' became household names. henry fonda continued his distinguished career until his death in 1982, as well as fathering jane and peter. lee j. cobb landed the major role of judge henry garth in 'the virginian'. e.g. marshall enjoyed a long, reputable career on film and t.v., including playing joseph p. kennedy in the 'kennedy' mini-series. jack klugman was 'quincy' whilst john fiedler voiced piglet in the 'winnie the pooh' films and cartoons. of the twelve, only john fiedler, jack klugman and jack warden* are still alive. although around the eighty mark, they are all still acting. the film was still available on video last year and it is shown on t.v. fairly frequently. i cannot recommend it too highly!

676;MaccyXpert;"standing as arguably one of the greatest courtroom dramas ever created, 12 angry men tells the story of one juror who attempts to convince his fellow jurors to question the guilt of a boy accused of murdering his father; as the pressure rises in the jury room, the natures of some of the men - with their deeply ingrained biases and prejudices - are laid bare for the others to see and judge, as they ultimately but onerously come to a verdict of not guilty. the conflicts between this one juror - juror #8 - and the others represent conflicts between dichotomous forces such as individualism, collectivism, certainty, doubt, and more; these themes and motifs are both explored and judged by the film through the medium of its characters, the twelve jurors. the introduction of the jurors expertly foreshadows their eventual attitude towards the verdict, as seen in the depictions of juror #8, juror #3 and juror #10, with the latter two coming to be the primary antagonists of this film. while the jurors are sitting in the courtroom and having their duties as jurors outlined to them by the judge, juror #8's expression implies deep thought and a sincere belief in the gravity of this case, in which a guilty verdict would result in the accused boy being put to death. meanwhile, juror #3 is the first man to stand up after the jury is told to begin their deliberations, hinting at a let's-get-this-over-with attitude that is underscored by an almost unshakeable belief in the boy's guilt, a belief that drives him to become fervently defensive as the other jurors begin to side with juror #8 throughout their time in the jury room. once the deliberations begin, juror #3 begins to reveal a personal bias that comes to fuel his emotional instability - his own fractured relationship with his son. he details this relationship briefly in front of juror #8 before concluding with the phrase, ""work your heart out,"" and trailing off as he realises that he has said too much. here - along with when juror #3 told juror #2 that he would like to ""slap those tough kids down before they start any trouble"" - we see that juror #3 is projecting the blame for the failure of his relationship with his son onto the accused boy, for an admission that the boy's father may have contributed to his murderous state of mind would constitute an implicit admission of juror #3's own guilt in estranging his son from him. juror #8 also begins to make his arguments as to why he cannot be certain of the boy's guilt by listing the unjust circumstances with which the boy had to cope during his childhood, displaying an empathy that is nowhere to be seen in juror #10's comment that members of the boy's ethnic group are, ""born liars,"" and thus that the boy on trial is no different from the rest of them. the first dichotomy presented in this interaction - to use the technical terminology - is one of sociological positivism versus innatism; either responsibility for the individual's actions lies partially with the circumstances and partially with the individual, or it lies entirely with the individual, in whom the tendency towards criminality is permanently ingrained due to an accident of birth. the second dichotomy, however, is the one that is more relevant to the carriage of justice, that of individualism versus collectivism - is the boy to be judged according to his own actions in the past and the present, or is he to be judged deterministically according to his ethnicity and socioeconomic class? the former positions in these dichotomies - both of which are taken by juror #8 - constitute a more compassionate and fair judgement of the boy's actions, while juror #10's positions make leniency impossible; in this way, juror #8 stands out as the film's primarily humanistic and individualistic character, as a man who is both personal yet impersonal - given his lack of bias - in his approach to the case. as the tension begins to rise among the jurors, each man's nature begins to reveal itself in further detail. when juror #6 suggests to juror #8 that he may be letting a guilty boy get away with murder, juror #8 is left looking doubtful, likely considering juror #6's suggestion as a genuine possibility; after all, juror #8's approach has not been to insist that the boy is definitively innocent, but instead to question the assertion that the boy is definitively guilty. here, we see yet another of the film's dichotomies - the insistence on absolute certainty that juror #3 and juror #10 bring to the table contrasted with the room for reasonable doubt that juror #8 creates in the other jurors' minds. juror #8 is a force of chaos who has the potential to destabilise the rigid and unyielding order upheld by juror #3 and juror #10, and the latter two's hostility towards inquisitiveness is merely driven by a desire to protect that order. juror #3 reveals his own dogmatism after juror #11 questions why the boy would return to his apartment after allegedly killing his father, which prompts the former to ask the latter, ""look, you voted guilty. whose side are you on?"" in juror #3's mind, there is no room for reasonable doubt, because doubting the boy's guilt is inherently unreasonable, and anybody who is on the side of 'guilty' who dares to show any kind of hesitancy must instead be on the side of 'not guilty', as if the jurors are at war rather than mutually attempting to come to a consensus on the guilt of the accused. the insecurity and fragility of the primary villains also begins to surface in the final third of the film; after juror #8 argues that juror #3 would take pleasure in executing the accused boy himself, juror #3's reply of, ""for this kid, you bet i would,"" reeks of resentment, the kind that juror #3 cannot stand to have revealed in front of others as he unsuccessfully attempts to strike juror #8, who calmly replies to juror #3's threat of death with, ""you don't really mean you'll kill me, do you?"" such a reply further lowers the credibility of juror #3 in the eyes of the other jurors, an outcome highlighted by the camera shot of all the jurors gathering around juror #8 and staring at juror #3 in disapproval of his inability to control himself. shortly after this, juror #10 experiences his downfall after he explodes into a racist tirade about the allegedly inherent incapability of members of the boy's ethnic group to care about, ""human life,"" or to obey the law; the other jurors respond by staying silent and refusing to listen to and validate his words, which leaves him feebly repeating the phrase, ""listen to me,"" to juror #4, who responds by ordering him to sit down and be quiet. all juror #10 is able to do is let his beliefs crumble under the weight of the deafening silence of condemnation provided by the other jurors, as the embodiment of the kind of right-wing ethnic collectivism against which the united states of america fought during ww2 fades into a state of powerlessness and irrelevancy. after juror #4 is swayed by juror #8 and juror #9's questioning of the credibility of the female witness who claimed to have seen the murder herself, juror #3 is left alone in the jury room as the only man who still argues that the boy is guilty. he begins to fly into a rage in response to this, claiming that all the evidence has been, ""twisted and turned,"" only to be met - just as juror #10 was - with both silence and stares of judgement from the other jurors, made all the more intimidating by the closeups of the jurors' faces that create a distinct sense of claustrophobia. juror #3's defensiveness here almost seems to be his last attempt at preventing the other jurors from staring right into his soul, and their continued silence is reminiscent of the napoleonic notion that one should not interrupt his enemy when he is making a mistake; the power of the film's minimalist design also becomes evident here, as this silence arguably carries a greater dramatic weight in this moment than any score could have. during his final stand, juror #3 consistently carries himself with the air of one being victimised; his conflict with juror #8 over the soundness of the evidence presented in court represents the psychodrama that has likely played out in his mind many times before, with his rationalisations and his conscience standing as sworn enemies. if juror #3 can successfully blame this accused boy for allegedly murdering his father, then he can continue to blame his own son for symbolically doing the same; the silence from the other jurors, however, lets him know that this will not be an option. eventually, juror #3 breaks down, furiously tears his photo of him and his son into pieces, and tearfully concedes. as the jurors leave the jury room and the courthouse, juror #8 decides to show the utmost respect for his adversary by helping juror #3 put on his jacket - being unwilling to, as the saying goes, kick a man when he's down - and it is this interaction that reveals the fourth dichotomy that is presented by this film to its audience, the dichotomy outlined by viktor frankl in man's search for meaning between the, ""races of men in this world,"" of the, ""decent,"" men and the, ""indecent,"" men (page 108) or, if you will, the good men and the evil men. frankl argues that no group of people, ""consists entirely,"" (page 108) of either the decent or the indecent, and thus that you can find members of these two races in every group of people, a sentiment with which juror #3 would have disagreed prior to his time in this jury room. juror #8 does not believe juror #3 to be an irredeemably stubborn or immoral man, and he is willing to be as empathetic to juror #3 as he was to the accused boy, likely believing that both are struggling to cope with the impact of forces not entirely within their control.";13 March 2021;9;['great', 'angry', 'fellow', 'ingrained', 'bare', 'guilty', 'dichotomous', 'such', 'more', 'eventual', 'latter', 'primary', 'deep', 'sincere', 'guilty', 'first', 'unshakeable', 'defensive', 'other', 'personal', 'emotional', 'own', 'fractured', 'much', 'tough', 'murderous', 'implicit', 'own', 'certain', 'unjust', 'ethnic', 'different', 'first', 'technical', 'sociological', 'second', 'relevant', 'own', 'socioeconomic', 'former', 'compassionate', 'fair', 'impossible', 'humanistic', 'individualistic', 'personal', 'impersonal', 'further', 'guilty', 'doubtful', 'genuine', 'innocent', 'guilty', 'absolute', 'reasonable', 'other', 'rigid', 'unyielding', 'latter', 'own', 'former', 'latter', 'guilty', 'reasonable', 'unreasonable', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'primary', 'final', 'other', 'racist', 'inherent', 'ethnic', 'human', 'other', 'silent', 'quiet', 'able', 'other', 'right', 'ethnic', 'female', 'alone', 'only', 'guilty', 'twisted', 'other', 'intimidating', 'distinct', 'last', 'other', 'reminiscent', 'napoleonic', 'minimalist', 'evident', 'great', 'dramatic', 'final', 'many', 'own', 'same', 'other', 'utmost', 'unwilling', 'fourth', 'frankl', 'decent', 'good', 'evil', 'decent', 'stubborn', 'immoral', 'willing', 'empathetic'];0.0454992967651195
677;MaccyXpert;"note - read pt. 1 of this review before you read this part (i wrote one long essay that i had to split into two parts when posting it on imdb). the hero of this film - juror #8 - consistently embodies the classically american individualism and opposition to tyranny that defined the nation during the war of independence against britain, its ww2 efforts against the nazis, the cold war with the soviets, and many more such conflicts. he does not conduct himself either dishonestly or arrogantly as he takes the necessary responsibility to ensure that justice is meted out fairly for the accused boy. juror #8 does his civic duty, and he does not use coercion to achieve this goal; instead, he persuades the other jurors to reasonably doubt their belief in the boy's guilt, and both he and the other jurors let juror #3 and juror #10 instigate their own downfalls. the anonymity of these jurors - we only know their numbers (except when juror #8 and juror #9 reveal their names to each other outside the courthouse) - also implies that their characteristics are not only specific to them, and thus that a juror #3 or a juror #10 - in other words, a parochial man who cares more about validating his own bias, prejudice and resentment than facing the truth, however uncomfortable it may be - can be found anywhere; juror #8's responsibilities are also not only his responsibilities, but they are those of anybody who encounters these kinds of barriers to the carriage of justice. archetypally speaking, juror #8 ventures into the underworld by daring to confront the hostile and almost violent sides of juror #10 and juror #3 and by managing to leave this underworld as a better man, one who has meaningfully put his principles of fairness and scepticism into practice. juror #3 and juror #10 both undergo a journey through their own version of the underworld, one characterised by a realisation of the flawed nature of their previous beliefs, beliefs which they come to abandon by the time of the film's conclusion.";13 March 2021;9;['long', 'american', 'cold', 'many', 'more', 'such', 'necessary', 'civic', 'other', 'other', 'own', 'other', 'specific', 'other', 'parochial', 'own', 'uncomfortable', 'hostile', 'violent', 'well', 'own', 'flawed', 'previous'];-0.0166666666666666

687;jayanthanr;my friend, tejas, recommended the movie '12 angry men' to me. frankly, till then i had never heard about such a movie. he then said that it is an old b&w movie made in late 1950s. but the reason i really got interested in this recommendation was because, he mentioned that the whole movie was shot in a single room in a single setting. the movie takes off brilliantly from the start. the characters and their personalities are gradually disclosed to the viewer as and when required. the cast of actors have done their part remarkably well, though at times it seems that henry fond does steal his moments (henry fonda was also the co-producer of the movie). apart from the unique situation, that of a jury in a criminal case with a split verdict, in which the movie is set, it is also the dialogues (or the arguments of the case) that keeps us hooked to the screen. there is no moment where there is a distraction or a chance for the viewer to yawn. the brilliant pace, the heated debates, the moments of short surprises keeps us interested till the very end. it's a masterpiece and i would recommend this as a 'must watch'! i am keeping this review short without even giving the synopsis of the film, so as to let you enjoy the film. happy viewing .;10 December 2013;10;['angry', 'old', 'late', 'interested', 'whole', 'single', 'single', 'unique', 'criminal', 'split', 'hooked', 'brilliant', 'heated', 'short', 'interested', 'very', 'short', 'happy'];0.109438775510204

691;simon-harris20;"the plot of this film unfolds entirely in a claustrophobic and uncomfortably hot jury room. the twelve angry men of the title are jurors and must decide the fate of a young man accused of killing his father. it does not help his case that he is poor and hispanic, and not even the tone of voice of the judge in the case seems to hold out any hope when giving instructions to the jury about their forthcoming deliberations. the evidence to convict, and thus send the man to the electric chair is overwhelming, and the first vote taken by the jurors is 11:1 to convict. then juror no 8 (fonda) starts dissecting the evidence piece by piece in an almost forensic analysis of the facts. is everything as it seems ? of course not. the whole film is built around the concept of reasonable doubt and whether our individual prejudices will allow us to see it. the film offers no safe answer, as even the juror who was completely dispassionate about the whole affair turns out to be mistaken. a tour de force performance by fonda as the liberal everyman we all wish we could be, but with excellent performances all round, particularly from e g marshall as the composed and evidence-led juror no 4, and a scene stealer from lee j cobb as juror no 3. this film is an object lesson in film making. the tension, which ratchets up nicely throughout the film as each successive vote is taken, is created entirely by the friction between the twelve protagonists. we are presented with a cross section of american society in the sixties, and undoubtedly we will agree with some of their perspectives and disagree with others, although in fairness to lumet the unsympathetic characters are not difficult to spot and there are some powerful moments as their true characters are revealed. there is a valid question raised in the middle of the movie by fonda's character: there is a man's life at stake: shouldn't they take some time to talk about it ? after all, supposing they get it wrong ? i think that whether you come away from this movie as a champion of the jury system will depend on whether you believe that your peers are indeed ""twelve good men and true"" as the one point this movie does make is that while the jury system is all we have, it is far from foolproof, an can easily be derailed by ignorance and prejudice. in this case, however it doesn't and this leads me to suggest an interesting aside. i believe that if this film was made again for a modern audience, and here i am also discounting the 1997 remake, so let's say a 2012+ audience, the director might wish to provide an ending where the fonda character does not win through in the end, and the petty arguments and prejudices of the majority of the jury are too powerful to be overturned. however, for it's time and place, this is an almost perfect film, filled with excellent performances, and a hollywood morality tale ending where goodness and common sense win through in the end. no wonder fonda allows himself a mona lisa smile as he walks away from the court house at the end of the movie. brilliant.";20 October 2012;8;['claustrophobic', 'hot', 'angry', 'young', 'poor', 'hispanic', 'forthcoming', 'electric', 'overwhelming', 'first', 'forensic', 'whole', 'reasonable', 'individual', 'safe', 'dispassionate', 'whole', 'liberal', 'excellent', 'composed', 'successive', 'cross', 'american', 'unsympathetic', 'difficult', 'powerful', 'true', 'valid', 'wrong', 'good', 'true', 'foolproof', 'interesting', 'modern', 'petty', 'powerful', 'perfect', 'excellent', 'common', 'brilliant'];0.2089285714285714

703;withloveandviol;the premise for this film is fairly straightforward. twelve men are elected to sit on a jury of a murder trial for a young boy who is accused of killing his father. almost the entire film is centred in one room, where the men, if they unanimously vote that the young boy is guilty then he is sentenced to death. initially, the vote is guilty, 11-1 reasonable doubt is called into question and the men must discuss their reasons for their votes. i particularly liked this film as the situation is something that is very believable. one of the first reasons that the men give is 'he just looked guilty' due to the boy being from the slum areas, another is a man has his own personal reasons for his vote. i've always had a personal belief that jury duty is an odd premise. it seems strange that a number of complete strangers are able to determine the fate of another human without their own personal background being known. for example, someone gets accused of domestic abuse. several of the jurors are unfortunate enough to have also had a history of domestic abuse in their life, either on the giving or receiving end - their judgement is going to be clouded by their own experiences and they are not going to be impartial to the accused. i suppose the issue is, what is the alternative then to strangers on a jury in these cases? it also doesn't seem right that one judge should be responsible for making this decision. the acting in this film isn't the best i've ever seen. some of the characters over emphasise their lines and their character portrayal, but the 'main' juror, henry fonda, is wonderful. his character is deep, sympathetic and a real interest to watch on the screen. this is the first film i've ever seen with him in it, but it hopefully won't be the last as i go delving for more. lee j. cobb is another one of the main characters, and plays a very different part to henry fonda. his character is unlikeable, loud, brash and rude - and you're meant to hate him, and you truly do! the ending is slightly predictable, but you're not sure how they're going to get there which continues to make the movie enjoyable.;25 August 2016;9;['straightforward', 'young', 'entire', 'young', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'reasonable', 'believable', 'first', 'guilty', 'own', 'personal', 'personal', 'odd', 'strange', 'complete', 'able', 'own', 'personal', 'domestic', 'several', 'unfortunate', 'domestic', 'own', 'impartial', 'right', 'responsible', 'good', 'main', 'wonderful', 'deep', 'sympathetic', 'real', 'first', 'last', 'more', 'main', 'different', 'unlikeable', 'loud', 'rude', 'predictable', 'sure', 'enjoyable'];0.1512775842044134

722;Philippe277;"there are very few movies that challenge the very essence of humanity, but twelve angry men is among them, likely at the forefront. just a bit of inquiry by juror #8 (henry fonda) is enough to turn all of convention onto its head, and what ensues is a manifesto of the human thought process. first he is treated as the village idiot -- ""there's always one....."", then through common reasoning and questioning he gains some momentum among the jury until he has eventually won the vote of all eleven of his peers. the characters in that room represent a microcosm of greater society: you've got the righteous yet somewhat humble speaker of truth, the socially cold yet honorable logical thinker, the wise old man, the baseball-loving hedonist, the jaded self-proclaimed sadist, the cynical old man, the earnest hard-working foreigner, and the unimposing supposed leader (the foreman) who is among the quieter individuals who form the background audience to the great debate that carries the story. this portrayal of society makes twelve angry men suitable for all viewers, and it may as well be mandatory for all people to watch this movie as its adventurous trek through morality has been and forever will be relevant to human relations. twelve angry men is a longstanding testament to the spirit of originality and inquiry -- questioning the judgment of another rather than weakly conforming to it. this theme is again and again visited within the dialogue of the movie, as juror #8 is bashed by a couple of his fellow jurors for trusting his gut, or forming unconfirmed yet sensible hypotheses. but it's this pioneering spirit which achieves basically all the great feats that we reach -- it's how the judicial system and greater democracy was set into place in this country, for example. the gradual conversion of each juror from a ""guilty"" vote to a ""not guilty"" vote shows you the potential for the realization of truth that lies in each man in this world, as well as their varying methods of reaching it. for some it was reached by plain logic (juror #4), for others it was through direct empathy. some men leapt aboard the bandwagon only once it had gained some might, and some only came over after having held onto their original view until the bitter end.....having been blinded from common sense by their own distorted emotions (juror #3). regardless, every juror lands somewhere on the spectrum and is entitled to their own unique view, just as ordinary people are in society. there are almost too many unforgettable moments/lines in twelve angry men to count all of them.....from the hullabaloo that ensues when the jury first learns of the lone ""not guilty"" vote at the beginning, to the re-enactment of the old man limping down his hallway, to the convincing of juror #4 through the ""glasses"" ordeal, to the final stand and glare of the eleven jurors at juror #3. there's the final exchange of the movie, when jurors #8 and #9 exchange names and ""meet"" for the first time (telling you something about how dehumanizing and tense things got in that small room). oh and speaking of that small jurors' room -- virtually the entire movie takes place in there! on paper that idea seems somewhat ludicrous for a movie, but the compelling nature of the plot somehow made me forget how physically stationary the story is. cinematographer boris kaufman used a brilliant tactic over the duration of the film: he lowered the cameras as the plot continued. at the start we're able to appreciate the size of the long room, and we look down upon the jurors, but by the end each man looms over our view, large than life, as we see him speak, and the walls appear to have closed in on us to create a very cramped and tense atmosphere. very well done. ultimately, this is one of my favorite films, touching the soul of humanity and leading its audience through an entire range of emotions, and all while in a very commonplace setting. sometimes the simplest premise makes for the most enthralling story, and through superb acting, a terrific screenplay, and innovative cinematography, twelve angry men accomplishes this and lays claim to being one of the greatest films ever made.";20 May 2011;10;['few', 'very', 'angry', 'likely', 'enough', 'human', 'common', 'great', 'righteous', 'humble', 'cold', 'honorable', 'logical', 'wise', 'old', 'jaded', 'cynical', 'old', 'earnest', 'great', 'angry', 'suitable', 'mandatory', 'adventurous', 'relevant', 'human', 'angry', 'longstanding', 'fellow', 'unconfirmed', 'sensible', 'pioneering', 'great', 'judicial', 'great', 'gradual', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'plain', 'direct', 'original', 'bitter', 'common', 'own', 'distorted', 'own', 'unique', 'ordinary', 'many', 'unforgettable', 'angry', 'lone', 'guilty', 'old', 'final', 'final', 'first', 'dehumanizing', 'tense', 'small', 'small', 'entire', 'ludicrous', 'compelling', 'stationary', 'brilliant', 'able', 'long', 'large', 'tense', 'favorite', 'entire', 'commonplace', 'simple', 'enthralling', 'terrific', 'innovative', 'angry', 'great'];0.0861581920903954

743;Thelightbulb;"i watched this film for the first time, when it was shown at about 1 o'clock in the morning. i made an effort to see it as it is rated as one of the best movies ever made, however i must admit that i watched it with a sense of reluctance as i'm not a great one for old ""classics"". this film blew me away however; how ignorant can i be about old films? how many other pre-1960s gems are there out there that i haven't seen? what strikes me most about this film is how progressive it is for its day. indeed the issues this film makes about american society of the 1950s, still ring true for western society today. this film concerns twelve jurors debating the sentence of an 18 year old puerto rican boy who on the face of it, has no real alibi. however one man, played brilliantly by henry fonda, is ill-at ease putting a young boy to death without even debating his case, much to the despair of the other jurors. what follows is a brilliant piece of film making, slowly revealing many of the juror's complex characters to the audience as they react to fonda's concerns with their own mix of metal scars, prejudices and insecurities. what especially struck me about this film is how ordinary most of the characters are, none of the jurors are shown to be especially bad men, indeed most are portrayed as honest everyman type people. the use of ordinary characters is the films master-stroke because as one by one they begin to question their initial instincts, the flaws of society that have let this puerto rican boy down are presented to the audience. tragically it appears that many of the issues that were beginning to be discussed in the 1950s have only got worse. for me there is one immortal comment in this film: one of the jurors, a man in his 50s says that the youths of today have no respect and have changed so much for the worse since his day. how ironic is it that some grumpy old men of today who may not even of have been born when this films was made, still say exactly the same thing? finally a quick look at the cast shows that fonda aside many of the cast were only moderately successful after this film. i think that's a shame as everyone of these actors is excellent and plays their part in making it one of the best films of all time. however within the cast there are a couple of treats; look out for jack klugman (quincy) and john fieldler who is the voice of many of disney's characters such as piglet. i urge you all, if you have not yet seen this film, please do so now.";22 September 2005;10;['first', 'good', 'great', 'old', 'ignorant', 'old', 'many', 'other', 'progressive', 'american', 'true', 'western', 'old', 'puerto', 'rican', 'real', 'ill', 'young', 'other', 'brilliant', 'many', 'complex', 'own', 'ordinary', 'most', 'bad', 'most', 'honest', 'ordinary', 'initial', 'puerto', 'rican', 'many', 'bad', 'immortal', 'bad', 'ironic', 'grumpy', 'old', 'same', 'quick', 'many', 'successful', 'excellent', 'good', 'many', 'such'];0.1916666666666667

752;poweller;forty three years since the release of sidney lumet's debut, in a current cinematic age where films seem increasingly judged on the strength of their special effects or cgi, how refreshing it is that 12 angry men can still be considered a masterpiece. on the face of it selling the premise of 12 angry men is no easy feat. the film focuses on the jury in the case of a young man facing the death penalty for the murder of his father. however, what's different is that 12 angry men is set almost entirely within a single, unremarkable room, as the twelve jurors try to reach a unanimous verdict. featuring such cinematic greats as joseph walden, lee j. cobb and the superb henry fonda the film relies purely on an excellent screenplay, fantastic dialogue and consistently excellent character development as the various prejudices of the twelve jurors are revealed. because of unspectacular setting there is a fantastic feeling of claustrophobic suspense that dominates throughout beginning with 11 jurors convinced the man is guilty, only henry fonda's character expresses any doubts. as the film plays out various ballots are taken where the characters give their verdict and increasingly fonda's character places doubt in your mind that the other juror's opinions are clouded. in the history of film there are very few directors who could capture the suspense that lumet generates from such a shabby, sparse setting, for instance each time the men take a ballot and it is revealed more and more of the jury have their doubts. compared to the stunt filled, special effects marathons that seem to dominate our screens today, 12 angry men still stands out as a ray of light that proves beyond doubt that excellent dialogue, screenplay and acting talent wins out on cgi any day.;20 September 2010;9;['current', 'cinematic', 'special', 'refreshing', 'angry', 'angry', 'easy', 'young', 'different', 'angry', 'single', 'unremarkable', 'unanimous', 'such', 'cinematic', 'excellent', 'fantastic', 'excellent', 'various', 'unspectacular', 'fantastic', 'claustrophobic', 'guilty', 'various', 'other', 'few', 'shabby', 'sparse', 'more', 'special', 'angry', 'excellent'];0.0889329805996472

761;rsimard;"director sidney lumet has passed on. may he rest in peace. twelve angry men exhausts one in the search for superlatives. all but a few minutes at the beginning are set in a single, nondescript jury room, consisting of, essentially, the table and twelve chairs, a closet for hanging coats and hats, a water cooler, a fan that only works for half of the movie, restrooms and windows overlooking a generic view of a city which happens to be new york but which could as well be any other metropolis. within this sparse environment, director lumet crafts a riveting drama from reginald rose's original story. twelve angry men does employ some major elements of dramatic license, and some criticize it for them. a few are: juror #8's walk through the defendant's neighborhood and purchase of a switchblade knife constitute jury research, a no-no, not to mention the implausibility of a juror getting away with bringing one into a jury room. the test of the time for a witness to walk a certain distance is a jury experiment, also disallowed. either would be grounds for a mistrial. i do not consider these flaws. first, this is not like a modern courtroom drama, trying to realistically dramatize our system of justice. it is a drama about people, their passions and prejudices and the tension that rises high when twelve people are faced with the need to find unanimous agreement on a subject as emotionally charged as murder, with so much at stake, forced to subjugate their freedom to think, feel and speak independently and unchallenged under pressure from eleven others trying to do the same in that search for universal agreement. jury deliberation is the vehicle for creating this environment. some limited bending the reality in ways that are implausible only because of the rules of the real world is no crime. a movie trying to be faithful to the process of jury deliberation would consist almost entirely of people sitting around a table talking. it's hard to imagine making a decent drama out of that. dramatic license, when properly chosen and limited, is no detriment. the characters and the superbly cast performers characterizing them are wonderfully diverse and defined, from hesitant and mild-mannered to brash and arrogant, stiff and cerebral to low and bigoted, idealistic and forthright to weak and manipulable, simple and quiet to vengeful and enraged. there is a distinct dynamic to every combination and interaction, and the human condition and spirit are uniquely explored in each of them. each is a drama in itself and at the same time one piece of a whole seamlessly joined with all of the others. this movie also contradicts the cynical view that society is hopeless. despite the differences of intelligence, personality, integrity, values and ethics among these people, ultimately a basic desire to do the right thing surfaces in each one. a black-and-white cinematic masterpiece, this film is not for those numbed by dazzling effects and wall-to-wall ""action."" for those moved by a brilliant view into the core of what it means to be human, this will ring true for a long time.";9 April 2011;10;['angry', 'few', 'single', 'nondescript', 'generic', 'other', 'sparse', 'riveting', 'original', 'angry', 'major', 'dramatic', 'few', 'certain', 'modern', 'high', 'unanimous', 'much', 'unchallenged', 'same', 'universal', 'limited', 'implausible', 'real', 'faithful', 'hard', 'decent', 'dramatic', 'limited', 'diverse', 'hesitant', 'mild', 'mannered', 'arrogant', 'stiff', 'cerebral', 'low', 'idealistic', 'forthright', 'weak', 'manipulable', 'simple', 'quiet', 'vengeful', 'enraged', 'distinct', 'dynamic', 'human', 'same', 'cynical', 'hopeless', 'basic', 'right', 'black', 'white', 'cinematic', 'brilliant', 'human', 'true', 'long'];-0.0013039867109634

763;dseliber;"looking at the lists from over the years of the american film institute (best movies, comedies, thrillers, and passions), i've come to the conclusion that they know what they're talking about. however, they did make one mistake: the failure to recognize '12 angry men' as one of the best motion pictures ever made. quite simply, '12 angry men' is perfect, or very close. it's the story of a court case, in which an 18-year old hispanic kid is accused of killing his father. what's very interesting is that, with the exception of the first two minutes and the last 30 seconds, the entire movie takes place in the jury room. the twelve jurors are discussing the case, and the bottom line is that every single solitary shred of evidence points to the direction that the kid is guilty. at the preliminary vote, eleven of the men vote guilty, and the twelfth man (played by henry fonda) votes not guilty. and then the fun starts. the film progresses with the eleven men convincing henry fonda that the boy is guilty (""they proved it a dozen different ways in court. would you like me to list them for you?""), and meanwhile, henry fonda tries to convince them that there is enough reasonable doubt to consider that maybe the boy didn't commit the murder after all. there are several things that make this movie so good, and perhaps the most impressive is the fact that the acting performances are perfect; all twelve of them; a feat almost unthinkable in today's cinema. each of the twelve men have a different personality, and you'll remember every one of them. the one that really stands out is lee j. cobb, because his character is very complex. he starts off polite and pleasant, and as the film progresses, starts to become 'excitable', as one of the characters calls it, and seems to suddenly be personally involved in the case.

764;wjkelly-2;"eleven jurors in a murder trial feel an 18 year-old is guilty for killing his father and should receive the death penalty. henry fonda's character is the lone juror, who feels that the boy is innocent. the brilliance of this movie is how close to ""real life"" it is - full of adult material, which was unusual in those days. how many of us, who have served on jury duty, have faced these types of people? i know that i have. the room is humid and hot and you know that it is going to be even more hotter during the ninety minutes of deliberation. fonda is wonderful in how he is capable of presenting the ""what if"" arguments and his own investigative speculation into the case, which is also a drawback to the film in that such speculation is not permissible under current legal proceedings. none of these jurors know each other and they come from different backgrounds - one is an architect (fonda), while another is a calm, observant older man (joseph sweeney). these two are capable of dissecting the facts of this case better than their fellow jurors. the other ten jurors are either unconcerned, unwilling, inpatient, bored, selfish, prejudiced, or sadistic, or they simply don't care. each character brings with them different backgrounds and education. obviously, those who are better educated, or older and wiser, (fonda and sweeney), tend to be more careful and analytical in their decisions than the sadistic businessman (lee j. cobb), the prejudiced garage owner (ed begley), or the selfish salesman (jack warden) - the worst types of jurors that one could ask for in a legal case. the football coach, (juror # 1 - martin balsam), who is the overseer of the jury proceedings, is likable, but would prefer to be elsewhere. they are anxious to come to a conclusion and be on their merry way, especially warden, who has to be at the ball game on time. the shy, uncertain bank clerk (john fiedler) is willing to go with the flow of the others. the advertising agent (robert webber) is the same way. these are also poor qualities for a member of the jury. the confident broker (e.g. marshall) is certain the boy is guilty based on the facts of the case. his argument would be more relevant in a true legal proceeding. the self-conscious common man (jack klugman), the dependable painter (edward binns), and the careful, east european watchmaker (george voskovec) are more willing to compromise with fonda. how will it play out? it depends on those jurors who are uncooperative and uncontrollable, especially the sadistic cobb.

774;asajb2000;why make another version of this movie? i just finished watching the 1957 version and i admit it seems like a play (and probably was developed originally as a play since it basically takes place in one room) and it was also broadcast live during the heyday of the golden years of television. we'll never see the talent of the actors in the room who have since passed-away. in fact, only jack klugman (at age 85) is still with us. other movies seem tailor-made for plays, such as glengarry glen ross. i'm not sure if the casting was simply dead-on or the actors happened to nail the roles they had or a combination, but each person seems very well-suited to his role and it's hard not to get wrapped up in the dialogue and the general pace of the movie (as though you were peering into the jury room through a peephole). in fact, as i watched each actor, i identified with people i knew who had the same characteristics, such as jack warden's wise-ass, or ed begley, sr.'s angry racist or lee j. cobb's uptight, high-strung yelling man or any of the other people. i do think that jack klugman's role may have been miscast. i didn't necessarily identify with him as a product of the slums. they could have cast a minority for his role but i guess in 1957 all-white, male juries were what was the norm.;10 June 2007;10;['golden', 'other', 'such', 'sure', 'dead', 'suited', 'hard', 'general', 'same', 'such', 'wise', 'angry', 'uptight', 'other', 'miscast', 'white', 'male'];0.0220238095238095

782;dragicakosir;"the prerequisite for a death sentence is an unanimous decision of the jurors: guilty/ not guilty. here, we see an extraordinary proof of the fact how much stronger the good is than the evil. the actors play their roles very well indeed. the (verbal) struggle lasts an hour and a half - of each individual against himself or against all others. in the beginnig there is only one man advocating reasonable doubt. and that one as a broom sweeps away the compulsive ""opinions"" of his - at first, antagonistic - co-speakers. he doesn't encroach upon anybody else's truth, nor does he try to manipulate them, and yet... he smoothly leads the other members of the jury to a path of consideration and reflection, where they come to new findings by themselves. i experience the end of the film as a phenomenal display of a redemption/atonement, of restoring a peace with oneself - moment when a man becomes aware of his own dark side, finally accepting it. the two diametrally opposed roles are symbolically presented as if they were father and son, who finally surmount all distances in order to come nearer to one another in the end. out of the unexplored depths a hatred towards the ones who think differently evaporates, spreading to this group of people and to people outside this room, very much the same as the steam evaporates from the depths of thermal springs. who is better, who is good and who is bad? the questions and answers that arise in the winnetou-movies or in the competitive games also in the modern time.

784;vukodlak;"an excellent courtroom drama with a unique twist. instead of following the trial itself, the viewer has a unique chance to observe the events behind the closed doors of a jury room. the film begins with the end of the trial. the jurors retire to deliberate the case. a preliminary vote is taken and the result is 11:1 in favour of the guilty verdict. eleven jurors have raised their hands to convict a young man of killing his father. only juror #8 has doubts. at first even he does not truly believe the young man to be innocent but notes (rightfully) that the case for the defence might have been presented in a more convincing manner and that the boy might be given the benefit of a doubt. since the boy is to be executed if found guilty his life is now in the hands of the jury and juror #8 reasons that the least they could do is talk about the case a bit. as time goes on some of the jurors change their minds and find that there is perhaps enough reasonable doubt not to convict the young man after all. but not everyone is easy to convince. although the plot of the film is excellent and it is fascinating to see what little things can influence which way a verdict goes, where this film really succeeds is in presenting the characters of the 12 jurors. the character of each of the jurors emerges through a wonderful mix of perfect casting, excellent dialogue and near-flawless acting. juror #1 - a simple man who clearly does not understand the full complexity of the task that lies before him but is trying to do everything not to let anyone else find this out. he appears at ease only once during the film - when he talks about football. he has the misfortune to be selected foreman of the jury - a task he clearly does not relish. juror #2 - a small, quite man, clearly unaccustomed to giving his own opinion much less to expecting his views to be of any importance. apparently he finds solace in his job - he is an accountant. juror #3 - probably the most complex personality in the film. starts off like a pleasant self-made successful businessman, he analyses the case impartially, explains his arguments well and is reasonably self assured. as time goes on he becomes more and more passionate and seems to be somehow personally involved with the case. he also starts to show some signs of slight mental instability. wonderfully played by lee j. cobb - this is the character you remember after the film is over. juror #4 - self assured, slightly arrogant stockbroker. obviously considers himself more intelligent than anyone else in the room, he approaches the case with cool heartless logic but (as one of the jurors says - ""this is not an exact science"") he does not take into account the feelings, the passions, the characters of the people involved in the case. he is conspicuous by the fact that he is the only juror that does not take his jacket off (it is a very hot day). juror #5 - here is a man under great emotional stress. he comes from the same social background as the accused boy - with who he almost unwillingly seems to identify with. paradoxically this appears one of the main reasons for him voting guilty - he does not want compassion to influence him - so ironically it does. juror #6 - a simple man, quite readily admitting that everyone in the room is better qualified than he is to make decisions and offer explanations. but he really wants to see justice done and it worries him that he might make a mistake. juror #7 - the only one that really has no opinion on this case. literally throughout the film his thoughts are never on the case - he talks of baseball, of the heat, of fixing the fan but the only reason he has for voting this way or that is to speed things up a bit so he might be out of the jury room as soon as possible. not an evil man he just has no sense of morality whatsoever - he can tell right from wrong but does not seem to think it's worth the bother. juror #8- a caring man, has put more thought into the case than any of the other jurors. he tries to do his best even in the face of seemingly impossible odds. juror #9 - a wise old man with his great life experience has quite a unique way of looking at the case. juror #10 - the most horrifying character in the film. votes guilty and does not even try to hide the fact that he does so only because of the boy's social background. the tragedy comes from the fact that his own social position is only a cut above the boy's - which makes him all the more eager to accentuate the difference. juror #11 - an immigrant watchmaker, careful methodical man, well mannered and soft spoken. respects the right of people to have different opinion to his - and is willing to look at both sides of the problem. loses his temper only once - horrified by the complete indifference of juror #7. juror #12 - a young business type - perhaps he has his own opinions - but is careful to hide them. what he has learnt out of life seems to be that intelligence is equal with agreeing with what the majority of people think. the film succeeds in doing something very rare today -

794;C_pa_cool;12 angry men is just brilliant. it is a classic of course, but time goes by and many of us, young people, pass on smart movies like that, and that's a shame. but fortunately, i am here to talk about it. 12 angry men came out in 1957, it was made by sydney lumet and stars henry fonda, to name only one of the fantastic actors that made this movie so real. 99% of the action takes place in the jury room. 12 jurors are debating on a murder trial. a men, played by henry fonda, will try to convince his fellow juror of the innocence of the boy accused in this trial. 12 angry men is such a smart movie and evoke so many different themes through this one trial. it mainly shows how powerful is one man's speech. all of the beliefs about the case, the ones that seemed so obvious to the 11 other men, are refuting one after the other by the character of henry fonda, leading to heavy doubts in the jurors mind. the life of a boy depends on how will this man try to convince 11 others, of what he truly believes is the truth or at least the not certainty of it. through the movie, you feel the pain, the claustrophobia of being in this room, you just feel like you are the 13th member of the jury. all in all, of course it's an old movie, it's in black & white but please, don't pass on this movie, it has a strong message, and is the typical type of movie, precise, smart, deep, relevant..., that are strongly missing these days.;23 June 2014;9;['angry', 'brilliant', 'many', 'young', 'smart', 'angry', 'fantastic', 'real', 'fellow', 'angry', 'smart', 'many', 'different', 'powerful', 'obvious', 'other', 'other', 'heavy', 'least', 'old', 'black', 'white', 'strong', 'typical', 'precise', 'smart', 'deep', 'relevant'];0.0849206349206349

798;farfromperfection;"12 angry men; the simplicity of this film, i believe, prevents it from being named in lists of best ever movies. i was surprised but equally glad to see it ranks #17 here, but have also seen it unfairly omitted from several other polls of modern times. what really strikes you about this film is that the entire sequence is shot in one room. the moment the court attendant locks the doors, you can feel the tension of twelve individuals merging under the surface. the film isn't about spending vast sums of money on creating a blockbuster, nor does it feel the need to explain every last detail about each of the characters portrayed. perhaps these key differences are exactly the reasons ""12 angry men"" strikes one as so effortlessly brilliant. one of only two shots outside of the room is at the beginning, with the exasperated judge calling for the adjourned verdict from the jury. you have a closing shot of the young boy on trial before the twelve men assemble themselves into the sticky, humid room to consider their decision. the movie doesn't take a long time to get started. questions are raised instantly and answers are given. juror #8 (played by henry fonda) instead glares in a moments reflection onto the street below as the other eleven men give their first impressions willingly. it is clear from the conversation that the majority who have spoken are convinced of the boy's guilt, with many of them keen to come to a final verdict as soon as possible. instead, upon the first vote, juror #8 goes against the grain of everyone else and decides to pitch his verdict of not guilty to the astonishment of his fellow jurors. what happens next is 80 minutes of passion, pain, conflict, and conclusion. what i find remarkable about the character of henry fonda is although he is not convinced of the boy's guilt, he is also equally not sure about his innocence. as he poses questions and figures out answers, it is clear that he is realising these facts at the same time as everyone else. in the depths of his mind, he has ideas surrounding why the boy might be innocent but needs to formulate them, and he is able to do that via the other jurors, even the ones that put up a fight. as he finds more reasons to doubt a guilty verdict, his reflection allows the other eleven men to do the same. with each revelation, and the testimonies brought into question, you can feel the passion of twelve individual opinions. whilst some of the jurors were not so outspoken, they still played a part in peeling apart the layers of badly constructed trial. whether it was a personal experience (such as living by the el track, or wearing glasses) or just an view of one man, they all fitted together in a jigsaw that eventually, couldn't be disputed. as the film reached the climax, so did the heat, finally erupting into a violent storm that reflected the tension in the verdict room. in particular, it was parallel with the clash between juror #3 (played fantastically by lee j. cobb) and juror #8 (henry fonda) - 8 being the stand alone verdict of not guilty to begin with, and by the end, 3 being alone in his verdict of guilty, before breaking down. the film was beautifully directed, shots of the intense weather, the cigarette smoke drifting away and the passion of the twelve men in deciding their verdict reflected in their perspiration collaborated effortlessly with the script. there was no need to delve any deeper into the characters, build exaggerated story lines or become unnecessarily violent. all it needed was twelve men, with different backgrounds, to explain themselves.";4 June 2006;9;['angry', 'good', 'ever', 'surprised', 'glad', 'several', 'other', 'modern', 'entire', 'vast', 'last', 'key', 'angry', 'brilliant', 'exasperated', 'young', 'sticky', 'humid', 'long', 'other', 'first', 'clear', 'many', 'keen', 'final', 'possible', 'first', 'guilty', 'fellow', 'remarkable', 'sure', 'clear', 'same', 'innocent', 'able', 'other', 'more', 'guilty', 'other', 'same', 'individual', 'outspoken', 'personal', 'such', 'violent', 'particular', 'parallel', 'alone', 'guilty', 'alone', 'guilty', 'intense', 'deep', 'exaggerated', 'violent', 'different'];0.024822695035461
799;chrisq28;"ostensibly, 12 angry men is a chamber piece about twelve motley jurors who are stuck with deciding the guilt or innocence of an eighteen-year-old kid who is charged with the murder of his father. it's actually more than just that, though. it's an examination into the unknowability of the truth, and a character film that cross-examines the lives of men from all walks of life. when the film begins, the men take a preliminary vote. the results show that there are eleven men who think he is very obviously guilty, and only one man (peter fonda) who thinks that there is a reasonable doubt of his guilt. of course, most of the other men think he's crazy for even suggesting innocence--half of them are already out the door and ready to send the boy to the chair. ""how do you know?"" fonda is consistently asked. his response is the same every time. ""i don't know anything, i'm just saying we should ask some questions, that's all."" the story unfolds magnificently and cleverly, a smorgasbord of personalities clashing and interacting with each other--all within the confines of a stiflingly hot sixteen by twenty-four foot jury room. the performances in this film are amazing. each juror comes across as a man who has his own reasons for deciding the guilt or innocence of the alleged murderer, and the method with which each man ultimately decides are all unique to his person. 12 angry men comes across as a bit of a tribute to the american justice system as well. careful not to claim perfection for it, director sidney lumet simply portrays it as the best system we have available. ""what if you convince us all and we set a murderer free?"" one of the jurors asks fonda. fonda doesn't answer. a friend noted that she felt that the motivations for some of the juror's final conclusions came on a little strong, most notably in the case of the biggest advocate of the accused's guilt, who is played by lee j. cobb. cobb seems to have some inner demons with his son, who he reveals he hasn't spoken to in years, and it's clear that at least several of the jurors begin to suspect cobb's feelings aren't due to the facts but are the result of personal issues towards youth as a whole. i disagree with my friend. when critiquing a film, it's certainly important to gauge your feelings on the subtleties brought forth by it--in this particular scenario though, i feel that the complaint is a reach. i never found the scenarios that were brought forth by any of the characters was too heavy-handed or polemic. quite the opposite--i viewed the story as the simple unfolding of a murder case that was to be decided by twelve very different individuals, each with his own background and story to contribute. 12 angry men is a straight-forward and fascinating story that is well-directed, well-acted, and makes a valuable point. i can easily add this to the list of my favorite films.";15 March 2005;9;['angry', 'motley', 'old', 'more', 'preliminary', 'guilty', 'reasonable', 'most', 'other', 'crazy', 'ready', 'same', 'other', 'hot', 'amazing', 'own', 'unique', 'angry', 'careful', 'good', 'available', 'free', 'final', 'little', 'strong', 'big', 'inner', 'clear', 'least', 'several', 'due', 'personal', 'important', 'particular', 'heavy', 'handed', 'simple', 'different', 'own', 'angry', 'straight', 'fascinating', 'valuable', 'favorite'];0.1161585365853658

806;obro;this film provides audiences with a white knuckle thrill ride that they can't turn away from. but there are no car chases and punch ups, in fact the entire movie takes place in one room, and the narrative simply follows a discussion between 12 angry men. so how could it be so enthralling to watch? well, unsurprisingly, it's really the dialogue. the writing in this film is genius. every time i watch this movie i am gripped by every word, even when i already know what is about to be said. it is some of the most provocative dialogue ever put to film. i literally get goosebumps at certain parts of this film because it is so intelligent and it gives you pleasure as a viewer that you can just relish in the brilliant and thought provoking debate that is being presented to you. the fact that the film seems like an adrenaline ride is a real testament to the screenplay that reginald rose created. as i said earlier this movie takes place in one room, the audience is given one environment and it never changes. the writing is so clever and so thought through that despite the never changing surroundings of the room the audiences never loses focus, never loses interest. it is simply delicious writing. the performances are of course fantastic as well. each of the 12 men have their own personalities and their own personal thoughts on the case at hand. each actor really captures their character to the extent that the audience can start to put together a picture of what kind of man each of the men really is, despite the fact that we never even learn such basic information as their names. henry fonda however does stand out as being especially powerful as juror #8. i'd like to just quickly say that juror #8 is probably the most underrated movie hero of all time. fonda brings a degree of charm to his role which makes him extremely likable for audiences and so you find yourself strongly rooting for him, just another element that takes the audience deeper into the world of the film. frankly this is one of the best films i have ever seen. it is such a simple concept and because of that it was possible for all of the aspects of this film to be executed to very a high standard. this is one of those films that everyone has to watch at some point in their lives, and despite the fact that it was made in 1957 i promise it won't seem dated when you watch it if that's something you might be cautious of going into this movie. the fact that it was made such a long time ago shows it stands the test of time. simple. genius. immortal.;29 May 2015;10;['white', 'entire', 'angry', 'enthralling', 'about', 'provocative', 'certain', 'intelligent', 'real', 'clever', 'delicious', 'fantastic', 'own', 'own', 'personal', 'such', 'basic', 'powerful', 'underrated', 'likable', 'good', 'simple', 'possible', 'high', 'cautious', 'long', 'simple', 'immortal'];0.2368707482993197

829;nandue0929;"12 angry men is the utmost in entertainment as a character study, but only that, not as jury reality. it is fascinating due to the magnificent actors who portrayed the jurors. the viewer becomes increasingly engrossed in the dialog by their superb acting, which transcends the drab setting of the jury deliberating room. however, as a lawyer myself, the movie contains an instance of jury impropriety, which ruins the film from a legal standpoint. during jury deliberations, one of the jurors brought in an item identical to one that was introduced at the trial and showed it to the other jurors. this is a classic case of improper jury behavior! jurors may only consider the facts, witnesses, and evidence presented at trial and what may or may not be inferred from them; not outside items that were introduced in the deliberating room, such as this ""second"" item. reasonable doubt in a criminal case must exist itself, not be deliberately manufactured by a juror. additionally, the movie takes a considerable ""stretch of the imagination"" to conclude that not one of the other jurors reported this behavior to the judge at the time it happened. the juror who mentioned that it was against the law was ignored. despite the excellent acting, 12 angry men is disturbing even if it is ""only a movie"" because the legal content is pure fiction. the movie gives a distortion about permissible jury conduct and would never have ended the way it did. if the case had been real, there would have been either a mistrial or this juror would have been dismissed and replaced with an alternate juror who heard the trial and the deliberations started over again. also, the juror would probably have received a stern rebuke from the judge when he was dismissed, mistrial or not. this juror (the late henry fonda) was not some kind of ""hero"" as the viewer is led to believe, indeed, he was quite the contrary. 12 angry men is not a movie for someone who may be called for jury duty for the first time, despite how it may seem to those untrained in the legal system. i have read that this is the only movie mr. fonda ever produced (as well as acted) and, perhaps, he let his personal feelings of justice interfere with reality.";21 February 2011;5;['angry', 'utmost', 'fascinating', 'magnificent', 'drab', 'legal', 'identical', 'other', 'classic', 'improper', 'such', 'second', 'reasonable', 'criminal', 'considerable', 'other', 'excellent', 'angry', 'legal', 'pure', 'permissible', 'real', 'alternate', 'stern', 'mistrial', 'late', 'angry', 'first', 'untrained', 'legal', 'only', 'personal', 'interfere'];0.0774327122153209
830;narnia4;"12 angry men is a film that wasn't hailed as revolutionary at the time. in fact, it didn't make afi's first ""100 films"" list and was only ranked #87 after the revision. it wasn't even a box office success when it was released. despite all that, its with good reason that this film is ranked so highly on imdb's top 250 list. 12 angry men is one of the few films ever made that is excellent in every regard, in some regards it feels almost flawless. the acting is top-notch from every actor involved, with lee j. cobb in particular standing out with one of the best performances i've seen in a film (in particular his speech near the end). the directing is wonderful, the plot is interesting, and the pacing throughout is spectacular. this is one of those films that is very hard to dislike, in my experience even younger audiences with lower attention spans or those who dislike black and white films have, with very few exceptions, really enjoyed this film. one aspect that i want to single out is the editing and pacing, which stands out as some of the best i've ever experienced. all but a very few scenes take place in the jury room, and yet the film is ""edge of your seat"" material throughout. more than that, every single time i watch it i feel as the jurors feel. it starts out slow, like there's nothing to deliberate. when the jurors begins speaking a little more seriously, a little more angrily, you can feel your heart beating faster. then the tension builds even more and just when i feel like i can't handle any more, the jurors take a break and walk around the room and cool off and wipe sweat off their brows just as i do while watching. the pacing is absolutely perfect, the fact that so many films are filled with gratuitous sex and constant violence and yet fail to enthrall me like this film, it speaks volumes as far as the quality and greatness of the film in all areas. the most criticized element of the film is the ending (which i won't spoil) and really the entire process that is begun by juror #8 (henry fonda), which is kind of out of bounds as far as how a jury is supposed to work. in real life, yes, what happened in the jury room, would probably have been enough for the whole situation to have led to a mistrial. but this criticism really misses the point of what is something of a ""message movie"", although not in an obnoxious way. its a look at the justice system, the fact that a life is being put in the hands of twelve individuals with their own stories and, necessarily, their own biases. and indeed, a human life is worth enough to at least ""talk about"". the film takes a good hard look at the legal system, and its worthwhile and personally has led to many good discussions with others who have seen the film. 12 angry men isn't a film that was the first of its kinds, its ideas aren't necessarily unique. its excellence in every category and the tremendous direction and pacing (and lee j. cobb) is enough to make this a favorite of mine and a film that will be enjoyed by almost anyone who watches it.";22 March 2012;10;['angry', 'revolutionary', 'first', 'good', 'top', 'angry', 'few', 'excellent', 'flawless', 'top', 'particular', 'good', 'particular', 'wonderful', 'interesting', 'spectacular', 'hard', 'young', 'low', 'black', 'white', 'few', 'good', 'few', 'more', 'single', 'little', 'little', 'more', 'perfect', 'many', 'gratuitous', 'constant', 'entire', 'real', 'enough', 'whole', 'obnoxious', 'own', 'own', 'human', 'worth', 'least', 'good', 'hard', 'legal', 'many', 'good', 'angry', 'first', 'unique', 'tremendous', 'enough'];0.2209047619047618

841;MarSco;"sometimes, unfortunately not very frequently, there are movies that are as close to perfection as possible. ""12 angry men"" is one of these. the basic idea is as simple as brilliant: director sidney lumet puts in his debut film 12 men together in one (resp. two rooms) and then during the whole film they stay in this place and discuss whether the accused boy is guilty or not, and in the same time they decide on his life. this last point is actually the critical aspect lumet brings into this play-like movie. but no matter how simple the idea is, it is certainly not easy to realize it and to make out of this a good film. lumet has made a fine work. it is just incredible and amazing how well he has managed to create such an intense and involving drama. one possible reason why he has succeeded so well is probably because he was supported by such an excellent cast, above all and of course, henry fonda, who gives here one of the best performances of his long career. but lets not forget the other actors like martin balsam or jack klugman. all in all this film is (and will always remain) one of the greatest directorial achievements in film history, with only one scene that somehow disturbs (but not very much): the very last sequence outside the building where juror #8 (henry fonda) reveals his real name. in fact, he should just have been number 8 and the whole action should only have taken place in these one or two rooms. apart from this detail, ""12 angry men"" is a film you must have seen and it is even today very underrated. rating: 97 marsco";3 May 2005;10;['close', 'possible', 'angry', 'basic', 'simple', 'brilliant', 'whole', 'guilty', 'same', 'last', 'critical', 'like', 'simple', 'easy', 'good', 'fine', 'incredible', 'amazing', 'intense', 'possible', 'excellent', 'good', 'long', 'other', 'great', 'directorial', 'last', 'real', 'whole', 'angry', 'underrated'];0.2105769230769231

844;ErikPedersen1;12 angry men is a masterpiece. i don't think it would be an exaggeration to say it's as close a film can get to being flawless. the premise is simple: twelve men on a jury have to decide whether a young man is guilty of committing a murder or not. the film is all-dialogue and virtually the entire runtime takes place in a single room. what makes the film truly special is how its individual aspects fit together so well. the writing is immediately gripping and does not waste a single moment of screentime - every piece of dialogue in the film has a purpose to serve in the tightly-woven story. things that are alluded to or spoken about previously are brought up again in later dialogue. not only does this help build the characters, but it also plays an important role in the story when a character contradicts their own argument or proves another's point unintentionally, for example. adding to this, all of the characters are unique and distinct from one another. you quickly get a sense of each character's personality and who they are through their dialogue, appearance, body language, and how they speak. this is made all the more vital due to the fact that the audience is not even told the names of the jurors - we end up knowing them purely by their personalities. needless to say, the acting required to pull this off is incredibly impressive. also, i love the camerawork in this. many parts of the film are comprised of long takes where the camera is panning around the room or from character to character. other times, the camera will cut to a close-up of a character's face or slowly zoom in. it works incredibly well in the telling of the story and accentuates the brilliant acting. i honestly do not have a single complaint about this film. it is immensely impressive in every way and i find it thoroughly interesting every time i watch it. as far as i'm concerned, it is an essential viewing and i can not recommend it highly enough.;13 June 2019;10;['angry', 'close', 'flawless', 'simple', 'young', 'guilty', 'entire', 'single', 'special', 'individual', 'single', 'later', 'important', 'own', 'unique', 'distinct', 'vital', 'needless', 'impressive', 'many', 'long', 'other', 'brilliant', 'single', 'impressive', 'interesting', 'essential'];0.2016483516483516

852;scottduffus;growing up in the 60's my first experience with courtroom drama was watching perry mason defending the innocent by uncovering all the hidden facts. the first courtroom movie that i remember was the classic '12 angry men' made in 1957, the same year as the first series of perry mason, the film tells the story of a jury that has to consider the innocence or guilt of an 18-year-old boy accused of killing his father. if found guilty the boy would face a mandatory death sentence. 95% of the film is shot in the one room to which the jury has retired to consider their verdict. in considering the age of the movie, the first thing you notice is that to be judged by your 'equals' in the 1950's meant to sit before 12 white males. as the jurors enter the room, their flippant remarks and labelling of the male defendant, who comes from the slums, shows a wide range of bias, bigotry and lack of concern for the outcome they are to make a judgement on. what appears to be a simple decision of all voting guilty is thrown into disarray when juror 7, henry fonda, goes against the grain and votes not guilty. so begins a journey that requires each man present to consider their own status in life and whether there may be a reasonable doubt that the boy is guilty. there is no doubt that the movie has aged but the exploration of each jurors motivation helps each character develop. the decision to only identify each man by their juror number and with no background provided the viewer is free to identify with one or more characters based on their own views of morality and ethics. the room has no cooling and as the heat of the day grows and the men become more visibly uncomfortable the claustrophobic atmosphere helps build the tension. the use of close-ups as characters make statements also gives you a sense of how small the room is as tempers fray. while the movie has aged the premise is not much different to a number of documentaries shown recently that ask people to face their own intolerances such as refugees or indigenous communities. if the defendant was not an abused boy from the new york slums but an aboriginal or muslim youth from the western suburbs of sydney, melbourne or brisbane i believe we would see 'our peers' struggle with a similar dilemma as the cast of this movie. one by one each character has to question their initial conclusion and determine whether the verdict of guilty should stand. while henry fonda is the star of the movie, the cast many of the respected male actors of the period with lee j cobb, martin balsam, jack warden, e.g marshall and a young jack klugman of quincy and the odd couple fame. to watch the movie now the acting is certainly over dramatic in parts but the idea of giving everyone a fair go, doing what is right when the numbers are against you and facing your own bias when judging others are still important concepts today. if you are into your older movies and haven't seen 12 angry men take the time to watch it on netflix;8 February 2018;8;['first', 'innocent', 'first', 'classic', 'angry', 'same', 'first', 'old', 'guilty', 'mandatory', 'first', 'white', 'flippant', 'male', 'wide', 'simple', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'present', 'own', 'reasonable', 'guilty', 'free', 'more', 'own', 'uncomfortable', 'claustrophobic', 'close', 'small', 'different', 'own', 'such', 'indigenous', 'abused', 'aboriginal', 'muslim', 'western', 'similar', 'initial', 'guilty', 'many', 'respected', 'male', 'young', 'odd', 'dramatic', 'fair', 'right', 'own', 'important', 'old', 'angry'];0.0456084656084656

877;Sebastian_Conrad;"12 angry men is a 1957 american drama film with elements of film noir, adapted from a teleplay of the same name by reginald rose. written and co-produced by rose himself and directed by sidney lumet, this trial film tells the story of a jury made up of 12 men as they deliberate the guilt or acquittal of a defendant on the basis of reasonable doubt. in the united states, a verdict in most criminal trials by jury must be unanimous. the film is notable for its almost exclusive use of one set: with the exception of the film's opening, which begins outside on the steps of the courthouse followed by the judge's final instructions to the jury before retiring, two short scenes in an adjoining washroom, and a brief final scene on the courthouse steps, the entire film takes place in the jury room. the total time spent outside the jury room is three minutes out of the full 96 minutes of the film. 12 angry men explores many techniques of consensus-building, and the difficulties encountered in the process, among a group of men whose range of personalities adds intensity and conflict. no names are used in the film: the jury members are identified by number until two of them exchange names at the very end, the defendant is referred to as ""the boy"", and the witnesses as ""the old man"" and ""the lady across the street"". in 2007, 12 angry men was selected for preservation in the united states national film registry by the library of congress as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"" and is often seen as one of the greatest films ever made.";15 May 2016;9;['angry', 'american', 'same', 'reasonable', 'most', 'criminal', 'unanimous', 'notable', 'exclusive', 'final', 'short', 'adjoining', 'brief', 'final', 'entire', 'total', 'full', 'angry', 'many', 'very', 'old', 'angry', 'national', 'significant', 'great'];0.07275

901;aironneil;the concept of a movie that is nothing but a jury of a bunch of white men figuring out the guilt or non-guilt of a defendant sounds like it'd be boring or at least very slow moving. but 12 angry men is intresting and gripping realitively early in the movie. everyone in the jury is convinced of the young defendant's guilt except for 1 man. the whole movie is the process of this man, and others who eventually join him, slowly finding flaws in prosecution's arguments before eventually getting everyone to agree that there's reasonable doubt. for this concept to work, the movie had to have excellent writing and acting, the whole plot is completely carried by it and it miraculously delivered. all the different jurors had very distinct personalities and mannerisms that affected how they saw the case. while some had very logical reasons for beliving in the boy's guilt, others belived it out of some sort of personal bias or just laziness. the acting was also very well done, just maybe a little melodramatic at times but this was more common at the time the movie came out. really, the only thing that dates the movie other than the obvious like it being black and white is its obliviousness on the bias in the legal system. it was clear the defendant had a bad lawyer and the procescutor was counting on the jury's personal biases to sway the jury. this is brought up, but it doesn't use that to comment on the system that allowed that to happen, but instead the movie seems to just say the onus is completely on the jury doing their utmost to arrive at a fair conclusion. though the movie probably wouldn't have been recieved as well at the time if it laid criticism at the system itself since that wasn't the prevailing thought at the time. i fully admit this is looking at the movie through a modern lense when that probably isn't a fair thing to do, so i don't put that against it. the movie is still amazing and can still teach us about human psychology and the process of changing minds.;27 February 2022;9;['white', 'non', 'boring', 'least', 'slow', 'angry', 'young', 'whole', 'reasonable', 'excellent', 'whole', 'different', 'distinct', 'logical', 'personal', 'laziness', 'little', 'melodramatic', 'common', 'only', 'other', 'obvious', 'black', 'white', 'legal', 'clear', 'bad', 'personal', 'utmost', 'fair', 'modern', 'fair', 'amazing', 'human'];0.0390277777777777

he simply isn't sure of his guilt. alone, ridiculed and under intense pressure to conform, he must persuade his fellow jurors one by one that all is not as it seems. the scene is set for a fascinating cinematic study of the human condition and, arguably, the most gripping film ever made. i meant to review 12 angry men for my university paper two years ago, but never got around to it. now, having recently completed my first stint of jury service, i believe the time couldn't be more apt for me to right this small injustice. for sidney lumet's directorial debut, with its perfect acting, intriguing plot and technical mastery, symbolises for me all that is good about hollywood cinema, but which we rarely get to see. based on reginald rose's teleplay of the same name, 12 angry men takes place almost entirely within a drab and claustrophobic deliberation room. there are no set changes and little in the way of action; only gorgeous, clinical dialogue. in a genuine feat for 1957, however, lumet's camera glides effortlessly around this room, making it appear far bigger than it truly is; indeed making it seem as if you yourself are walking around it, like the jurors tasked with deciding a man's fate. for the classicists reading this, the film adheres to the unities of time, space and action, with film-time closely mirroring audience-time, a detail that yet again transports us against our will inside that room. lumet also presents a moby-dick-esque 'self-enclosed universe', in that each juryman represents a specific human trait: anger, meekness, indifference, compassion - the best of humanity and the worst. it is a film replete with close-ups of human faces, as if the director is constantly trying to see what lies behind them. what at first appears to be a simple story of revenge is gradually and ingeniously deconstructed by fonda's character until the audience doesn't quite know what to believe by the end. every time we think we've reached the bottom of the mystery before us, new depths reveal themselves, until all we're left with is multiple pictures of the truth taken from confusing angles, rather than a single definitive image. fonda is imperious as the white-suited knight of justice, fighting bigotry (the defendant's ethnicity is left ambiguous) and ignorance at every turn on his quest to discover the truth. what might entertain you even more than his rhetoric, however, is the detailed characterisation on show throughout - twelve men who are utterly believable and who all have their own unique motivations for voting ""guilty"" or ""not guilty"". aside from fonda, notable performances come from lee j. cobb (the exorcist), who plays the antagonistic juror #3, and joseph sweeney, an actor whose imdb profile page doesn't even include a photograph, but who is sublime as the elderly yet highly observant juror #8. perhaps the biggest compliment i can pay to this film is to say that there isn't a single average performance in it. good as the actors are, however, they are helped massively by rose's acidic script, memorable monologues, and one-liners that are so incisive they'll leave you stunned to silence. on that note, i can't think of a film that has as many genuinely surprising moments as 12 angry men. 12 angry men is not devoid of humour - indeed it contains several amusing characters who provide much comic relief - but it is first and foremost an intellectual, psychological and, dare i say it, philosophical film that has been teaching us about ourselves for over 50 years now. it really belongs in a time capsule; it certainly deserves a place in your movie collection.";28 September 2012;10;['old', 'prime', 'first', 'clear', 'identical', 'sheer', 'own', 'personal', 'innocent', 'sure', 'intense', 'fellow', 'fascinating', 'cinematic', 'human', 'gripping', 'angry', 'first', 'apt', 'small', 'directorial', 'perfect', 'technical', 'good', 'same', 'angry', 'drab', 'claustrophobic', 'little', 'gorgeous', 'clinical', 'genuine', 'big', 'specific', 'human', 'meekness', 'good', 'bad', 'replete', 'close', 'human', 'simple', 'new', 'multiple', 'confusing', 'single', 'definitive', 'imperious', 'suited', 'ambiguous', 'detailed', 'believable', 'own', 'unique', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'notable', 'antagonistic', 'sublime', 'elderly', 'observant', 'big', 'single', 'average', 'good', 'acidic', 'memorable', 'incisive', 'stunned', 'many', 'surprising', 'angry', 'angry', 'devoid', 'several', 'amusing', 'much', 'comic', 'first', 'intellectual', 'psychological', 'philosophical'];0.1398525654673196
916;Im_Stuff;"putting my review as spoilers because i always enjoy talking about plot elements. so take it as more of a possibility rather than a certainty. 12 angry men is a show that can't possibly be copied. in a time where every debate seems to be emotionally charged, this movie older than my father is a good reminder to always keep one's head cold and look at every angle. the setup, while very basic, some may even say dull introduce a very unique way to create tension in a story. by offering all of the information about the crime and the victim through the words of our jury, the movie makes a great effort to avoid making us sympathize with any side of the problem and have us, the viewer, look at the discussion with an objective look, which i believe is a very powerful idea. to add more to it, the cast is very diverse in thought, and our main character, who in this case is juror number 8 isn't the most clever man in the room, or the most experienced, hell, he isn't even hard stuck on his position and has conceded his point several time throughout the movie's run time, which both kept the conflict meaningful and made it feel like a back and forth instead of ""protagonist faces a problem, after recruiting friends and getting stronger, eventually the problem is gone"". plus, the cast doesn't have 2 people who have the same mindset, you will have the hot heads, the ones who doubt, the ones who don't really care, the ones who are emotionally involved, the ones who prefer to look at the problem from a factual angle and so on. and even the few times where something seemed far-fetched, it was never something that could be entirely ruled out, but more like something that would happen, albeit very rarely. one last thing, that was very powerful to me is how after this trial, nothing really changed, in this day and age, movies love continuity, gotta make you spit the sequel money. but not here, in 12 angry men, the cast started as strangers, and ended as strangers, as shown in the last scene of the movie where juror n8 and n9 asked each other's name before leaving on a handshake. everything that happened in this movie wasn't meaningful, or rather, everything that happened wasn't part of a greater narrative. the movie could have ended in 3 minutes and the outcome would have barely changed. and that to me, is not only unique, but also refreshing in a rather odd way.";4 October 2021;10;['more', 'angry', 'old', 'good', 'cold', 'basic', 'dull', 'unique', 'great', 'objective', 'powerful', 'more', 'diverse', 'main', 'clever', 'experienced', 'stuck', 'several', 'meaningful', 'strong', 'same', 'hot', 'factual', 'few', 'fetched', 'last', 'powerful', 'sequel', 'angry', 'last', 'other', 'meaningful', 'great', 'unique', 'odd'];0.1727777777777777

919;Ateg;this is a true undeniable american masterpiece. courtroom dramas rarely match sidney lumet's film. the story is about 12 jurors on a murder trial that turns out to be much more complicated than first thought, all thanks to the persistence of juror 8 played wonderfully by henry fonda. this is an hour and a half of gripping, engrossing drama. prejudice, society classes are just some of the themes that run through the movie from start to finish. these characters are so well written that by the end of this movie you will feel as you must have encountered them at some point in your life. this realness makes 12 angry men even the more powerful and thought-provoking. when this film came out in 1957, sidney lumet main input was limited to tv shows and series. working on 12 angry men was not that much different, sidney lumet did not use any sophisticated material or expensive locations, he relies here on the power of the screenplay and dialogue and the strength of an all star cast headed by the great henry fonda. limitations that only add to the sheer power of 12 angry men. 12 angry men is a must-see masterpiece, it is one of the best films of its time and genre, it will capture your attention and make you sit down and think long after you finish watching, it also rewards multiple viewing. now if those qualities don't make a good movie, i don't know what does.;4 February 2010;8;['true', 'undeniable', 'american', 'complicated', 'first', 'angry', 'powerful', 'main', 'angry', 'different', 'sophisticated', 'expensive', 'sheer', 'angry', 'angry', 'good', 'multiple', 'good'];-0.0019607843137254

925;sheenawhite;aside from being extremely predictable, this was a pretty good film. a murder has taken place and a young boy's life is on trial. the film focuses on the twelve men that make up the jury. in the beginning, they are fairly certain that the boy is guilty of the crime. in fact, eleven of the twelve men believe he is guilty. one man, for no particular reason except for a hunch, feels that the boy is innocent. this, of course, causes a lot of turmoil amongst the other men. they must stay cooped up in that hot, cramped little room until they can all agree on the same verdict. the lone man slowly begins to question the facts. pieces of the puzzle begin to fall into place and one by one, the other men begin to see the light. they too start to believe that the boy is innocent of the crime. in the end, all of the men end up changing their minds and an innocent boy's life is spared all because one man put a little more thought into the details. from the very beginning of the film, it is quite evident that all the men will change their minds in the end. the interesting thing is seeing what it is that actually convinces them to change their minds. the fact that almost the entire film was shot in the same room was quite effective. it allowed the viewer to feel as though they were actually a jury member taking part in the trial. the viewer never really gets to see all the details of the murder. when the members of the jury try to envision how long it would take an old man to hobble down a hallway, or what a person with poor eyesight would see through the windows of a moving city train, the viewer must try just as hard to envision such things as well. throughout the film, the director used a technique where he kept changing the depth of field. although subtle, it was also very effective in creating an ever increasing sense of discomfort and aggravation. all in all, this film was very well written and i quite enjoyed it.

927;misha-wilkin;the plot of12 angry men revolves around the murder trail of a latino boy who is accused of killing his father. the conviction of the boy would mean a death sentence and the destiny of the boy's life is in the hands of twelve male jurors of ranging personalities. the case seems open and shut with a murder weapon and several witnesses to place the boy at the scene of the crime. for eleven of the jurors the decision is apparent that the boy is guilty but for one juror, mr. davis (henry fonda), the boy's life should entail some discussion to eliminate any reasonable doubt the jurors may have. as the film progresses the personalities of the jurors become apparent and many underlying issues influence the guilty decision chosen by the majority of the jurors. the underlying issues are the complexity of the personalities of the jurors and the reasons why they have the motivation to feel and act the way they do. as the case unfolds further, more is learned about each juror individually. the personalities range from being a short-tempered loud mouth to a straight- laced accountant who never breaks a sweat. as the movie progresses much more is learned of the characters that exposes the intricacy of human nature and people's different personality traits. this film is an excellent example of movie making that does not require elaborate sets to entertain the viewer. the majority of the film takes place in a jury room with the men never leaving the room from their deliberation responsibilities. the cast and dialogue make this film memorable and the film has some clear moral issues that are addressed. the main issue is that not everything is as it seems. with further analysis the understanding of a situation becomes more concrete enabling the men to make a solid decision that affects a young man's life. 12 angry men is a classic film that should not be missed.;17 March 2003;8;['angry', 'latino', 'male', 'open', 'several', 'apparent', 'guilty', 'reasonable', 'apparent', 'many', 'underlying', 'guilty', 'loud', 'more', 'human', 'different', 'excellent', 'elaborate', 'memorable', 'clear', 'moral', 'main', 'further', 'solid', 'young', 'angry', 'classic'];0.0773333333333333

929;sbjwgrubb;to me one of the things that makes a film a good one is how much it makes you think and how much you find yourself discussing it afterwards. my wife and i spent a great deal of time following the film discussing it. what makes this film so good is that it reveals so much of what we are as individuals and the prejudices that we carry. what else it shows is how much passion that can be expressed during arguments. think about a big argument you had with someone. remember how you passionately tried to persuade them how wrong they were and how right you were. in passionate argument logic can sometimes get thrown to the wayside. this film has that and you can see yourself in these characters. you get to see how rediculous it can get when you argue a point without solid reasoning. again, that is what made this film so good for me. you can analyze it so many ways. this is definitely worth the investment of time to see. for provacative thought and excellent acting i give this film 8 of 10 stars.;16 February 2003;8;['good', 'much', 'much', 'great', 'good', 'much', 'much', 'big', 'wrong', 'passionate', 'rediculous', 'solid', 'good', 'many', 'worth', 'provacative', 'excellent'];0.3772727272727273

931;motownmaniax;"i echo every comment i've read up to now on why this is such a great film. here's mine. classic films need to have everything going for them: superior acting, compelling story, amazing direction. notice i left out special effects or genre-specific idiosyncrasies like dramatic chase sequences in action films or singing and dancing in musicals. depending on the type of film, these elements are definitely needed, of course, but what propels any film into classic status is the absolute necessity of the basics i first mentioned. any deficiency in one category automatically downgrades my rating to just a very good movie, no matter how big the explosions or realistic the gore (i love horror movies, too). as any film buff knows, most movies are adequate to downright terrible. however, even the bad ones can be entertaining in a fast food, disposable kind of way (we all have our guilty pleasures, and i know my list is rather long...lol). it's when we come across a movie that fires on all cylinders that truly inspires joy, and reveals why great film-making moves us. 12 angry men is one of those rare movies for me. it's almost disarmingly simple and straightforward. it's drama frighteningly intense. i understand why some may view the film as dated, or have a problem with the era from which it was made. i take into account all the cultural differences between then and now (the all-white male jury, the american slang, the one-dimensional setting) but none of it matters because the story, direction, and acting are so good. the morality of the story is the focus, not the backdrop. i don't see this movie being irrelevant 100 years from now. in fact, if present social trends continue, it may be even more important, considering how we seem to be careening to a less moral, instant gratification society where personal responsibility is secondary to selfish needs. movies like this may become a beacon for thoughtfulness and sanity. but i digress; apologies for soap boxing. as much as i hate lists, i would easily place this movie in my top ten of all-time.";17 March 2005;10;['great', 'classic', 'superior', 'compelling', 'amazing', 'special', 'specific', 'dramatic', 'classic', 'absolute', 'good', 'big', 'realistic', 'most', 'adequate', 'terrible', 'bad', 'entertaining', 'fast', 'disposable', 'guilty', 'long', 'great', 'angry', 'rare', 'simple', 'straightforward', 'intense', 'cultural', 'white', 'male', 'dimensional', 'good', 'irrelevant', 'present', 'social', 'important', 'moral', 'instant', 'personal', 'secondary', 'selfish', 'top'];0.1125725900116144

948;DanielArberry99;"jury duty is a service in which different people take in different manners and approach it with different minds. some who have never experienced it feel obliged to express a close interest while other regular jurors show less empathy towards the accused. these 12 men were expecting the usual court case of assault, robbery or another petty crime. however, the 18 year old suspect was accused of murdering his father by sticking a switchblade 4 inches into the center of his chest. the trial went on for several days until it was time for the 12 men to go off into a small, muggy room and agree on one life changing decision, guilty or not guilty. a verdict was made rapidly as most of the jurors accused the boy of being guilty; exempt from this one man who stood by his vote of not guilty. from here on out, the tale is thrilling. most of the jurors believed the boy was guilty but weren't 100% sure, and the one exempt juror stood by his vote of not guilty as he believed the life of an 18 year old boy deserved a little more debate and thought. unlike others, such as one man who had baseball game tickets for that night and the owner of a business who has work to do, this man was willing and brave enough to stand against 11 others and fight his case. for the first 20 minutes of the film, this fierce man stood alone against 11 angry men as he wasn't completely convinced that the boy was guilty. that is an incredibly brave and caring thing to do. as the jurors spent the evening tracing back over evidence and alibis and small details of the witnesses, one by one, this unique man managed to persuade each juror to change their verdict to save an innocent boy from the electric chair. this film gripped me from the beginning as it touched on the jurors' backstories and camera angles slowly got closer as the film edged to its final verdict. it depicts that one man can change the world. through close analysis of evidence and exceptional charisma, one man succeeded in changing the minds of 11 other stubborn men who all stood against him to begin with. this film was set in the 1950's which was a time of high discrimination against many races. the writers cleverly left the suspect's race and ethnicity unknown to show the jurors could be talking about anyone. it is revealed that the suspect grew up in a slum however, which caused prejudice from some jurors. the fact that a man can stand for an unfortunate boy and empathize for his background inspires me. it shows what humans can do, inspire a generation, and what humans have done. the work of people such as martin luther king, rosa parks and nelson mandela is truly incredible. inspiration and persuasion are powerful tools in this world and we must use them in the right way to create a better future for ourselves and our descendants. the themes of this film were fantastic despite the majority of the screen time being spent in one room. it had justice, family, honor, death and many more deeper meanings and teachings about life. it shows that you don't need a high budget or special effects to make a great film; all you need is a thrilling tale, incredible acting and hidden morals. i have scored this film 8/10. if i watch it again, it may go up to 9.";24 October 2016;10;['different', 'different', 'different', 'obliged', 'close', 'other', 'regular', 'less', 'usual', 'petty', 'old', 'several', 'small', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'most', 'guilty', 'exempt', 'guilty', 'most', 'guilty', 'sure', 'exempt', 'guilty', 'old', 'more', 'such', 'willing', 'brave', 'first', 'fierce', 'alone', 'angry', 'guilty', 'brave', 'caring', 'small', 'unique', 'innocent', 'electric', 'close', 'final', 'close', 'exceptional', 'other', 'stubborn', 'high', 'many', 'unknown', 'unfortunate', 'such', 'incredible', 'powerful', 'right', 'well', 'fantastic', 'many', 'deep', 'high', 'special', 'great', 'thrilling', 'incredible', 'hidden'];0.106297852474323

(some people may have picked this up earlier though). also the superb final shot where the old man asks henry fonda's juror his name. another interesting point that i only realised after finishing the film for the first time was that there were no female jurors. on particular historical interest is the original theatrical trailer, complete with studio hyped commentary such as 'twelve men turned into twelve clawing animals', and a surprising injection of a james bond / mission impossible like tune midway through. . i've only brushed the surface of some of the film's great aspects, there are so many impressive things it would take many pages more to discuss all of them. whether you're in the mood for a comedy, a drama, a thriller, or even a light philosophical view on justice this film fits the bill. <ul><li>enjoy.</li></ul>";22 February 2002;9;['perfect', 'rare', 'perfect', 'angry', 'top', 'rapid', 'large', 'fast', 'close', 'low', 'high', 'dynamic', 'enough', 'small', 'large', 'many', 'great', 'frankenheim', 'kieslowski', 'few', 'core', 'different', 'lonely', 'wide', 'magnificent', 'enjoyable', 'other', 'perennial', 'superhuman', 'great', 'modesty', 'wrong', 'reasonable', 'other', 'old', 'few', 'minor', 'minor', 'racist', 'little', 'other', 'last', 'stubborn', 'superb', 'final', 'old', 'interesting', 'first', 'female', 'particular', 'historical', 'original', 'theatrical', 'complete', 'such', 'twelve', 'surprising', 'impossible', 'great', 'many', 'impressive', 'many', 'more', 'light', 'philosophical'];0.2074272486772486

1020;rmyers7;"i've always have had problems with this movie. seeing it listed so highly made me re-watch it and give it another assessment. it has never struck me as a ""movie"". it's a closed set drama of twelve men talking in a closed room. that presents a pretty high bar to get over to turn it into a movie. unfortunately it doesn't even seem to try to get over it. this movie is a turd sitting there. a highly polished sincere turd, but a turd nonetheless. first the setup. a young man is on trial for murdering his father, stabbing him with a switchblade, apparently as a result of an argument. from statements in the movie, it seems that he is a member of a despised, slum-dwelling minority. the boy is shown to be dark but 'white'. the actor who plays the juror that is his compatriot is jack klugman, of russian jewish heritage. was an audience meant to take seriously, even in the '50s that assimilated jews were on such a low social rung? were they meant to be some other swarthy european? italian, greek, perhaps? to me the only folks likely to be identified that way in '50s ny would be blacks or puerto ricans. i know that hollywood at the time had a real problem casting actors of color, but this whitewashing takes me out of any willing suspension of disbelief. then the jurors themselves. they almost all seem one dimensional tropes. let's go in order: 1) the foreman, a high school football coach. just trying to keep the process rolling, without a high degree of insight into the issues. 2) the mousy accountant. not assertive or expecting to be listened to if he did assert himself. 3) likely the most interesting, a self-made business man, who has issues with a man needing to be 'manly'; assertive to the point of bullying. he has a failed relationship with his own son that is the key to his behavior on the jury. 4) a stockbroker. a bland technocrat who never sweats. he seems almost the post-war nazi stereotype of 'only following orders'. 5) the representative of the under-class. so scared of appearing to favor 'one of his own kind', that he compensates by going with the prevailing social order. 6) the common man. at passover he'd be the son that 'knows not how to ask'. 7) the salesman. approaches this as a sales pitch, and wants to get it over with to be able to get to tonight's yankees game. 8) our beloved identification figure. wants to avoid the rush to judgment. an architect he (possibly along with his antithesis the stockbroker) is the best educated and well spoken of the bunch. literally 'the man in the white suit'. congratulations to you mr. audience member for smugly identifying with him. 9) the old man. given to pearls of insight that derive from his experience and wisdom. 10) the racist. even if the kid isn't guilty, his kind are troublemakers and deserve what they get. 11) the good immigrant. a watchmaker, quiet, polite, well spoken. 12) the ad man. got to have one of these in any '50s ny set story. send his gray flannel suit up the flag pole and see if anyone salutes it. are any of these, with the possible exception of #3, real human beings? the argument. the bulk of this exercise is the destruction, point by point of the prosecution's case. a highlight is when #8 presents the jury with a duplicate of the supposedly unique murder weapon, a similar one which was purchased by the by the young man. i'm not a student of the law, but i can't believe that such a introduction of such evidence into jury deliberations is acceptable procedure. also, although the prosecution's case is sufficiently demolished to introduce the reasonable doubt necessary for an acquittal, never is a plausible alternate scenario is never offered. why did some intruder enter the murdered man's apartment and kill him? robbery? never suggested. another gang-banger looking for the son? why was the man stabbed in a non-experienced way? why is the murder weapon clean of fingerprints? so, well acted, competently shot, but to my mind a failed drama, and still a non-movie. finally, with over 900 member reviews i expect that this will be buried. and, why do we need a spoiler tag on a nearly sixty year old movie?";17 October 2016;6;['closed', 'closed', 'high', 'polished', 'sincere', 'young', 'dark', 'white', 'russian', 'jewish', 'low', 'social', 'other', 'swarthy', 'european', 'italian', 'only', 'likely', 'real', 'willing', 'dimensional', 'high', 'high', 'mousy', 'assertive', 'interesting', 'manly', 'assertive', 'own', 'bland', 'post', 'war', 'scared', 'own', 'social', 'common', 'able', 'beloved', 'old', 'guilty', 'good', 'quiet', 'polite', 'spoken', 'gray', 'possible', 'real', 'human', 'unique', 'similar', 'young', 'such', 'acceptable', 'reasonable', 'necessary', 'plausible', 'alternate', 'non', 'experienced', 'clean', 'non', 'old'];0.1414015151515151
1021;kosmalag;"12 angry men is an undeniably great film, whose simplistic directing and predictable plot ultimately take it away from a 10/10. the story focuses on one man's struggle to convince a jury of 12, 11 of whom disagree with him on the verdict, to acquit a young man of his father's murder. instead of spending this review describing how important this movie is, how well-thought out the script is, or how impressive the individual acting of most jurors is, i shall attempt to pinpoint the movies very significant weaknesses. first, and most importantly, the movie has some of the most disgustingly heavy-handed, and cheesy moments i have ever seen in a film of this caliber. 1. the scene where the german corrects the racists' english. 2. the scene where juror 8 calls juror 3 out on his exclamation of ""i'm going to kill him!"" 3. the scene where everybody gradually stands up to show their backs to the speaking juror 10. juror 10 then goes down to sit in the corner, like a naughty kid, never to speak again for the remaining duration of the movie. 4. the sweating juror 4 as juror 8 proves him wrong, despite him apparently ""never sweating."" 5. juror 3 finally giving up after a long tirade at the end of the movie. secondly, the movie is extraordinarily caricatural in its portrayal of some of the characters (in order of submission to juror 8): jurors 7, 10, and 3. they were all under developed and largely portrayed as either bigoted, stubborn beyond reasonable doubt (pun intended), or frivolously disinterested beyond belief. finally, the extraordinarily simplistic camera work was useful for setting the tone. however, the fact that no characters outside the shot in any specific scenes were allowed to butt in on conversations made the entire movie seem very preachy with only the characters being convinced to change their votes one by one involved in any one scene at a time, along with juror 8, and occasionally juror 9. furthermore, the focus on certain characters led to unbearably long monologues that were hardly believably in a 12-man jury debate. (renoir in ""rules of the game,"" in 1939, had already innovated far beyond this type of constrictive and simplistic camera work and directing.) the anarchy that would have been undeniable in a similar situation therefore end up having to be portrayed through unbearably loud and plainly stupid caricatures listed above^. in conclusion, the movie is a great one, but it has undeniable weaknesses that are so strong, they take it away from a 10/10.";3 March 2015;9;['angry', 'great', 'simplistic', 'predictable', 'young', 'important', 'impressive', 'individual', 'most', 'significant', 'handed', 'german', 'naughty', 'wrong', 'long', 'caricatural', 'stubborn', 'reasonable', 'simplistic', 'useful', 'specific', 'entire', 'preachy', 'certain', 'long', 'constrictive', 'simplistic', 'undeniable', 'similar', 'loud', 'stupid', 'great', 'undeniable', 'strong'];0.0454506802721088

1023;tdibug;superb camera work, dialogue, and acting. cinematically, the film is top notch. certainly a film that would not or could not be duplicated today. a sweat-shop of emotions, ideas and interactions and a personal favorite of mine (i purchased the dvd). all the positive points have been covered here so i won't repeat them. but the film does have a problem or two, which have become more evident to me with each subsequent viewing. firstly, it is awash with political correctness and character stereo-typing. the 'hold-outs' for a guilty verdict are depicted as bigots, authoritarians or dumb sports nuts (e.g. marshall is the lone exception). the film, bordering on greatness, cannot seem to shake the 'liberal' (good) vs. 'conservative' (bad) overtones, which is truly unfortunate. as a result, the movie becomes more 'preachy' than introspective or instructive. it is also predictable. a second problem is the actual arguments made that sway the jury. real juries do not (hopefully) reason in such a manner. for example, fonda takes testimony from an eyewitness to the killing and calls it into question because of some vague assumptions: 1) the witness (a woman) had marks on her nose that resemble those made by eyeglasses - so the assumption is she wore glasses. 2) people normally don't wear glasses to bed - the assumption is she mustn't have either, therefore 3) she couldn't have identified the killer as she rose from her bed and looked out the window! as lee j. cobb correctly pointed out, perhaps the marks were made from sun glasses or reading glasses..who knows, she may have had her glasses on when she saw the killing (of course none of this is brought up in court). but because of this convoluted logic, another 2 or 3 jurors are swayed to the 'not guilty' side. there are other examples equally as egregious. finally, the scene where ed begley spouts his bigoted nonsense and the jurors leave the table one by one is absolutely horrific and non-believable. it is these 'chinks in the armor' that again, hold the movie back from it's full potential. criticisms aside, the acting is wonderful. lee j. cobb should have won an oscar. e.g. marshall is excellent. jack klugman and martin balsam are also very good. fonda is adequate, but not at his best. jack warden and john fielder play their 'character roles' well as one would expect.

1038;nikolas-grigoriou;the movie is a pure masterpiece. filmed in a room with no extensive set design, costume design etc, yet it makes the viewer get attached by the acting and the dialogues of the actors. it is a proof that a great idea can easily lead to a masterpiece. as the title of the movie suggests, there are twelve men that have been randomly selected as jurors and they are responsible for making an important decision for the court, if a man is guilty or not. eleven of them believe that the man is guilty while one is not sure. he tries to make them express their personal view on the case and explain why the do actually stick on their initial decision by making a contradiction on the facts and by presenting his personal opinion. each of the characters and his background is revealed to the viewer, as well as why they have chosen to believe that the man is guilty. as the discussion proceeds and the contrast between them gets to a peak, each of them starts to revise the initial decision.;10 August 2018;10;['pure', 'extensive', 'great', 'responsible', 'important', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'sure', 'personal', 'initial', 'personal', 'guilty', 'initial'];0.0472527472527472
1039;Xkinhe;"lumet's staggering courtroom drama 12 angry men mostly takes place in the cramped jury room where a dozen ""men with ties"" decide the fate of puerto rican teenager accused of murdering his abusive father. yet the prologue to their civic imprisonment, which takes place beyond these confined walls, sets the stage for lumet's overarching concerns about the contradictions of the democratic process. after a few short establishing shots where men, women, and children traverse the plaza steps and interior hallways of the court building, lumet and director of photography boris kaufman focus on a particular door, where one of many cases currently in motion is just about to reach critical mass. the legal arguments have subsided, leaving the courtroom mostly silent and the fate of the accused in the hands of the aforementioned 12 white men. before their dismissal, the judge looks down at the group and bequeaths them to ""separate the fact from the fancy."" despite his harsh tone, we quickly realize only one of them takes this statement seriously. that man is juror 8 (henry fonda), the lone dissenting voice during the jury's disturbingly jovial initial vote to convict the boy of first- degree murder, which would send him to the electric chair. juror 8 has questions, a lot of them that he wants to discuss further, much to the chagrin of his fellow jurors. ""there's always one,"" yells sarcastic juror 10 (ed begley), who, like many of his fellow deliberators, desires a quick conviction so that they can all get back to their regular lives. in the minds of the other 11 men, the evidence is overwhelming in favor of the prosecution, so why even bother with debate. but juror 8's resistance to such mob mentality and manipulation helps erode the devastating moral righteousness of men like juror 3 (lee j. cobb), whose certainty about the boy's guilt is just one of the many red flags to surface during the proceedings. slowly but surely, juror 8 forces each man to look beyond their own prejudicesto question the evidence at hand and to become active participants in the judicial process. what's most interesting about the intense deliberations that ensue, specifically when a piece of seemingly indisputable evidence is brought back into question, is how a fresh angle and perspective, usually born from juror 8's critical thinking, can permanently alter the tone of the discussion. as this trend becomes more of a factor, each character begins to show their true colors in relation to the case. whether it's a bit of blatant racism from juror 10, extreme hatred from juror 3, or a sobering plea of humanity from juror 8, lumet shoots the most important lines of dialogue in close-up, lingering on the characters' faces for extended moments, establishing the importance of proximity and duration when it comes to dramatic shifts in the story. it's almost as if fonda's character, and lumet for that matter, believes these men are smart enough to make the correct decision if given the context and time to carefully consider the ramifications of their actions. despite some crippling character flaws, laziness and apathy are the only real villains here. aesthetically, 12 angry men is a master class in refurbished cinematic space. it takes a confined, almost completely banal real- world location and makes it completely dynamic, using incredibly nimble camera movements to establish character motivation and theme. kaufman's fluid long takes track each character as they leave the table in anger and frustration, the men departing for sporadic moments of personal reflection before returning to the heated discussion. seemingly simple conversations lead to damning assumptions about ideology and purpose, and each man brings their own set of moral baggage to the table. this allows the location to grow in depth as the characters become more fully developed. in turn, the smooth visuals have a strange effect on the narrative itself; they juxtapose a narrative seamlessness of cause and effect with the building uneasiness in each man, creating a volatile and unpredictable feel that rivals the extreme shifts in weather (from sweltering heat to torrential downpour) beyond the juror room windows. incredibly, 12 angry men was lumet's feature directorial debut, a fact that remains massively impressive considering the film's meticulous craft and pacing. harboring just as much compulsive energy and momentum as most modern hollywood action films, 12 angry men makes every shot and line of dialogue count. it's a film immersed in the organic relationship between facade and perspective, how each character tries to hide their own weaknesses by lashing out at others. ""prejudice always obscures the truth,"" one juror finally says at the end of the film. as the unnamed men depart and walk down the courthouse steps, it's finally clear that some of them understand how that particularly true statement relates to their own conflicted, ambiguous, and flawed life experience.";3 September 2016;10;['staggering', 'angry', 'puerto', 'rican', 'abusive', 'civic', 'overarching', 'democratic', 'few', 'short', 'interior', 'particular', 'many', 'about', 'critical', 'legal', 'silent', 'aforementioned', 'white', 'harsh', 'lone', 'jovial', 'initial', 'electric', 'fellow', 'sarcastic', 'many', 'fellow', 'quick', 'regular', 'other', 'overwhelming', 'such', 'devastating', 'moral', 'many', 'red', 'own', 'active', 'judicial', 'interesting', 'intense', 'indisputable', 'fresh', 'critical', 'more', 'true', 'blatant', 'extreme', 'lumet', 'important', 'close', 'extended', 'dramatic', 'smart', 'correct', 'crippling', 'only', 'real', 'angry', 'cinematic', 'banal', 'dynamic', 'nimble', 'fluid', 'long', 'sporadic', 'personal', 'heated', 'simple', 'own', 'moral', 'smooth', 'strange', 'narrative', 'volatile', 'unpredictable', 'extreme', 'torrential', 'angry', 'lumet', 'directorial', 'impressive', 'meticulous', 'much', 'compulsive', 'most', 'modern', 'angry', 'organic', 'own', 'unnamed', 'clear', 'true', 'own', 'ambiguous'];0.0779664324746292
1040;bviktor98;this is a subjective review, so it shows only my opinion about this movie. this is a very exciting story about 12 jurors quarreling over the fate of the accused, but it's more profound than that. the main character (played by henry fonda) is the only one, who believes that the accused guy is not guilty. he tries to convince the other jurors to agree with his opinion. the brilliant thing in this is that the actual happenings are not known for them(nor the viewer), so even we can't be sure, if they make the right or the wrong choice. as the story progresses, the viewer himself is to be convinced by either side. all of the jurors have personalities, not one of them is trite. it's a great achievement for the movie to build up such characters in very little time. the atmosphere is great as it draws in the viewer, and the talent of the actors are shown clearly, because the film doesn't have corny action, or gore like many of them nowadays, it's just pure acting, and directing. i can not mention a mistake, not even by today's standards. there have been so many attempts to make something perfect, but this is one of the few ones in my opinion, which really is. it was made by little money, in b&w and it only adds to its charm. i give this movie a 10/10, one of my personal favourites.;22 July 2015;10;['subjective', 'exciting', 'profound', 'main', 'only', 'guilty', 'other', 'brilliant', 'actual', 'sure', 'wrong', 'trite', 'great', 'such', 'little', 'great', 'many', 'pure', 'many', 'perfect', 'few', 'little', 'personal'];0.1935374149659864

1066;notmypresident-74886;12 angry men is not an extravagant movie. most of the film takes place inside a small jury room - no extravagant sets in this movie. this gives us incentive to focus on the three strengths of the film - the acting, the dialogue (written by reginald rose) and the direction (by first-time director sidney lumet). the acting is outstanding. there is a long shot that takes place before any talk of the case, and simply based off this shot, we can tell so much about these characters - which way they will vote, whether they can relate to the boy on trial, and which of them will collide in the future. special mentions of course go to lee j. cobb and henry fonda, the two opposites whose conversations are some of the most interesting in the whole movie. lee j, cobb's revelation scene at the end of the movie alone shows how multilayered he can play his characters. the dialogue is spectacular, and i am of the opinion it is one of the best scripts ever written for the movie screen - possibly the best. every character speaks based on their motivations: juror 5 speaks based on his experience as a kid from the poorer areas, juror 3 speaks based on his own son, and juror 7 speaks based on his desire to get to a baseball game. these motivations color their arguments and distinguish each of them from their peers, and ths is exemplified in the script. this film also contains the single greatest line in film history, delivered by juror no. 8 to juror no. 3 after no. 3 threatens his life. when you watch the scene, you'll know the line. and finally, the directing is masterful. the film's limited set means that the director, sidney lumet, had to come up with creative ways to frame shots to aid the film's storytelling. he does this by shooting in wide shots at the start of the movie, and slowly bringing the camera closer to the actor's faces, putting more emphasis on their reactions and reinforcing the claustrophobic size of the room. the scene where the men walk into the outside at the end is basically catharsis. 12 angry men is a smart and engaging movie, and feels like it was made with every element completely fine-tuned to make one of the greatest movies of all time. i think this movie needs to be seen by everyone, not just to enjoy it, but to see how dialogue can be used masterfully to enhance a story.;2 November 2018;10;['angry', 'extravagant', 'most', 'small', 'extravagant', 'first', 'outstanding', 'long', 'much', 'special', 'interesting', 'whole', 'spectacular', 'good', 'good', 'poor', 'own', 'single', 'great', 'masterful', 'limited', 'creative', 'wide', 'more', 'claustrophobic', 'angry', 'smart', 'engaging', 'great'];0.2472527472527473

1077;ryanctj;with the evolution of dvd people like me are getting the chance to watch films they would otherwise never be able to see. 12 angry men is one such film, and i rented it purely on the basis that it sits so highly in the imdb top 250. i'm glad that i did, as it is one of the best movies i've seen in a long time. the basic plot revolves around a jury deliberating on a murder case that will send the accused to the electric chair, if he is found guilty. a preliminary vote is taken, and all but one of the jurors vote for guilty. over the course of the movie the one juror who votes not guilty (henry fonda) makes his case, and the other jurors being to realise that the verdict is not as clear cut as they first thought. one of the interesting things about this movie is that each juror has their own reasons for their opinion, be it the facts of the case, or personal prejudices, and over the course of the movie these are confronted and explored. despite being set in a single room, this movie is constantly entertaining, due to the acting and direction. the film feels incredibly tense and claustrophobic as a result of this. it was only afterwards i found out that sidney lumet also directed dog day afternoon, another great movie that is based entirely in one setting. in an age of special effects and the constant high budget dross being pumped out of hollywood, it's refreshing to see a movie based purely on dialogue and acting ability. there have been too few of these in recent years, although a few do come to mind- glengarry glen ross, swimming with sharks, usual suspects, memento. many people today may see the date this movie was made or the fact that it is in black and white and not bother watching it. if they do they are missing out on a classic. i'm actually surprised this film hasn't been remade over the years, but maybe it's for the best that it hasn't. well worth watching.;23 November 2002;9;['able', 'angry', 'such', 'glad', 'good', 'long', 'basic', 'electric', 'guilty', 'preliminary', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'other', 'clear', 'interesting', 'own', 'personal', 'single', 'entertaining', 'tense', 'claustrophobic', 'great', 'special', 'constant', 'high', 'refreshing', 'few', 'recent', 'few', 'usual', 'many', 'black', 'white', 'surprised', 'good', 'worth'];0.0785504201680672

1113;Whttendog;this is my first movie review on imdb. today i am reviewing 12 angry men. this film is directed by sidney lumet. he is a really famous director. this is his first and best reviewed film. people may think this movie is slow because it is old and black and white. it is not. the film takes place in one room. i saw this movie when i was 12 and liked it. this movie is about an 18 year old boy who is on trial because people thought he murdered his dad. it is the hottest day of the summer. the main character played by henry fonda is the only character so far who says the boy is not guilty. this is a short review because there isn't a lot going on. henry fonda plays the least angriest person out of all the jurors. the second main character played by lee j cobb is the angriest person in the movie. let's talk about the switch knife which people thought was the knife used by the boy that killed his father. the guy played by henry fonda shows he found one himself. that was my favorite scene in the movie. when henry fonda's character convinced everybody to say not guilty, lee j cobb was the last one to say not guilty. my favorite thing about the movie was lee j cobb's relationship with his kid. the movie ends with henry fonda walking out the door and saving a kid's life. a really good ending.;17 September 2021;10;['first', 'angry', 'famous', 'first', 'slow', 'old', 'black', 'white', 'old', 'hot', 'main', 'only', 'guilty', 'short', 'angry', 'second', 'main', 'angry', 'favorite', 'guilty', 'last', 'guilty', 'favorite', 'good'];0.0006944444444444

1139;geber1;"with 12 angry men, director sidney lumet makes so much out of so little. all of the men are wearing white shirts and ties, and when we first see them they all appear to be as simple as their clothes; they make small talk before casting the first vote, and we make the mistake of feeling like we understand them. but as henry challenges their decisions, we learn that they each have a complex set of beliefs and motivations. we soon learn that evidence is not the only thing that's influencing many of the juror's decisions. some vote guilty because they don't trust teenagers, some do it because they don't trust the young man's ethnicity, which is never made clear (but racial stereotyping certainly is), some do it because it just ""feels"" right, and some do it to escape the boredom or oppressive heat. these factors, together with the evidence, make it seem obvious that the man truly did murder his father, but juror no. 8 (henry fonda) refuses to let him die without being absolutely certain that he is in fact guilty. fonda's character reminds the men of two very important things that they either forgot or didn't take into consideration. the first is that a young man's life is in their hands, and whatever conclusion they come to is going to profoundly affect him. although this is never discussed, it's possible that none of the jurors have ever had to make such an important decision and are not used to taking the kind of precaution such a situation requires (in fact, juror no. 12 appears to treat it like a routine board meeting). fonda is fully cognizant of the severity and tries to get the others to feel the same way. he also reminds them that a guilt verdict must be made free of any doubt. according to american law, a man is innocent until proved guilty, but the men consider it to be the other way around. it is through close examination of the evidence that the men are able to reach a verdict clear of any doubt or outside influences. of course, the road from small talk to their final verdict is not a smooth one, and never has there been so much drama in one single room. although lumet keeps them in the same room, which has no interesting features, for the great majority of the film, he manages to pull of some subtle yet incredible cinematic effects. in the beginning, the camera is placed towards the ceiling and we are looking down at the jurors, a visual metaphor for our mistaken feeling that they are simple men. later, it is placed toward the floor and we now look up at them and perhaps even marvel at their complexity. lumet has challenged our conception of the average man, showing us through camera and dialogue that he or she can indeed be very intricate. lumet also uses different lenses to great effect. as the film progresses, he uses lenses with longer focal lengths to make the room seem smaller. the tension is greatly increased as the walls seem to close in on the men, and this can be seen as different metaphor: as juror 8 dismisses the stereotypes and prejudices, the only thing left is the evidence. 12 angry men is a masterpiece and can be the subject of endless analysis. it can be viewed from a political and a sociological perspective, and would be great for a prospective cinematographer to study. if nothing else, the acting and dialogue are superb and make for an entertaining experience.";18 December 2008;10;['angry', 'little', 'white', 'simple', 'small', 'first', 'complex', 'only', 'many', 'guilty', 'young', 'clear', 'racial', 'right', 'oppressive', 'obvious', 'certain', 'guilty', 'important', 'first', 'young', 'possible', 'important', 'such', 'routine', 'cognizant', 'same', 'free', 'american', 'innocent', 'guilty', 'other', 'close', 'able', 'clear', 'outside', 'small', 'final', 'smooth', 'much', 'single', 'same', 'interesting', 'great', 'subtle', 'incredible', 'cinematic', 'visual', 'mistaken', 'simple', 'average', 'intricate', 'different', 'great', 'long', 'focal', 'small', 'different', 'only', 'angry', 'endless', 'political', 'sociological', 'great', 'prospective', 'superb', 'entertaining'];0.0929953231292517

1141;kothawade-amol;"""12 angry men"" is an awe inspiring movie resembling a play where 12 jury members are asked to determine a young man's fate. the condition that the young man must either be convicted guilty or not guilty is too harsh and made me dislike the plot. however, this movie, at least for me, is not about the decision or the trial but about the 12 unique male characters. all the 12 men have personalities we can relate to in our daily lives making this movie realistic. for the sake of classification, let's say there are 3 kinds of men - ""so called real men"" , ""polite, theoretical/ intellectual but timid"" and ""cool, fun loving but careless."" the so called real men are arrogant. they are not at all flexible. they have fixed views and they don't want to change their views. they prefer going with their preconceived notions. they have special ways of behaviour. they represent style - the way they walk n talk. they have personalities which easily make any timid guy to follow them. such dictatorial people may not make the best leaders but gets most attention for sure. they represent a very high male ego. it is interesting to see juror no 10 disliked by other jury for his preconceived notions in one scene. his male ego gets hurt when juror no 4 says ""now sit down and don't open your mouth again."" his emotional break up is worth watching and so is juror no. 3's. difference between juror no. 10 and 3 is juror no 10 does not care for anyone's support when he expresses his views but juror no. 3 accepts juror no. 4's leadership. such kind of men can influence by their personalities but are perceived as vain people. ""cool, fun loving but careless"" men may be the most appreciated by women but for this plot they are the ones who are least admired. such self centered people are best for themselves but should have maturity to keep personal life separate from work. juror no 7 belong to this category. juror no. 12 also appear to be more n less carefree types. ""polite, theoretical/ intellectual but timid"" men are the products of our education system. they are taught to behave with manners, follow social rules and think in certain intellectual ways. they are the pillars for the well being of the society. if they are not there, the system wouldn't even work. they follow discipline. however, they appear weak and boring. most of the men from the jury belong to this category. however, there are many shades. the timid but intellectual men (juror no. 1,2,5,6,9,11 )are the ones who are necessary both to keep the best man appear best in relative terms and run the system smoothly. however, when it comes to intellectual, confident men, we have very few options left. juror no. 8 is the most important character in the plot. however, as movie goes on, he appears manipulative. his guts are appreciable, but taking a stand, which appears neutral at the first instance but using it for self-glory later is not appreciable. such men can only make winners in the society. however, i personally would not prefer to become such a manipulative winner. (putting personal prejudices apart: p) juror no 4 is an interesting character. he is combination of both characters - real man and intellectual man. he is definitely better than all other personalities but the most important thing is he does not seem to be interested in attracting attention for the sake of attaining it. he is not in the competition. guess, that makes him the best one however (his apathy towards becoming best) making this search look pathetic. the whole discussion and the clashes among all these men are worth watching; making this movie a worth watching treat.";10 August 2010;9;['angry', 'young', 'young', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'harsh', 'least', 'unique', 'male', 'daily', 'realistic', 'real', 'polite', 'intellectual', 'timid', 'cool', 'careless', 'real', 'arrogant', 'flexible', 'preconceived', 'special', 'timid', 'such', 'dictatorial', 'good', 'most', 'sure', 'high', 'male', 'interesting', 'other', 'preconceived', 'male', 'emotional', 'worth', 'such', 'vain', 'cool', 'careless', 'such', 'good', 'personal', 'separate', 'carefree', 'polite', 'intellectual', 'timid', 'social', 'certain', 'intellectual', 'weak', 'boring', 'most', 'many', 'timid', 'intellectual', 'necessary', 'good', 'relative', 'intellectual', 'confident', 'few', 'important', 'manipulative', 'appreciable', 'neutral', 'first', 'appreciable', 'such', 'manipulative', 'personal', 'interesting', 'real', 'intellectual', 'well', 'other', 'important', 'interested', 'good', 'good', 'pathetic', 'whole', 'worth', 'worth'];0.1270535714285714

1147;kod502;i saw this film for the first time a few months ago and i was automatically annoyed with myself for having not done so long before. to put short, this film is one of the best ever made and rightfully deserves its position on imdbs top 250 list. to be honest, there's not a lot that one can comment about the film. there are no special effects, dramatic monologues or defining scenes to discuss and really that's what makes this film the phenomenon that it is. it is quite easy to see where the film is going to go and how it is going to end early on but none of that really matters because excuse the sugary metaphor but it is the journey you embark on with the jurors, in particular henry fonda, that defines the film. the way in which each different aspect of the court case is re-evaluated is film heaven but also a hard hitter when reflecting on the seriousness that the film makes about judicial systems and the responsibility of juries to make thorough rational decisions. if you had told me before the film that it was as near as makes no difference one scene with 12 men conversing for 100 minutes (or whatever), i would have kindly asked you if we could watch die hard instead, but oh what an ignorant error that would have been. 12 angry men is magnificent.;11 February 2011;10;['first', 'few', 'annoyed', 'short', 'good', 'imdbs', 'top', 'honest', 'special', 'dramatic', 'easy', 'sugary', 'particular', 'different', 'hard', 'judicial', 'thorough', 'rational', 'ignorant', 'angry', 'magnificent'];0.1454761904761904

1170;tommybone17;"sidney lumet's ""12 angry men"" is a film that would never appeal to me because of its old age and its black and white film, but once i started watching this, i couldn't help but get sucked in with everything unraveling in the jury room. there are no small characterization among the 12 jurors, with each one having a lot of resonance and importance to the story, something i found very well done thanks to reginald rose's script. even though i think each of the 12 jurors are very well-characterized, the two that stood out in my mind are juror #8 (played by henry fonda) and juror #3 (played by lee j. cobb). juror #8 is the main protagonist out of the 12, simply because he's the one who stood for the 18 year old hispanic kid, who's convicted of murdering his father, from the very beginning. his determination and graceness carries throughout the film, and henry fonda played wonderfully in this role. lee j. cobb's juror #3, the main antagonist of the film, is the definition of arrogance and ignorance. this is the film that should make lee j. cobb as one of the biggest defining actors in hollywood history, and his performance as juror #3 is very, very memorable. one of the big reasons why i didn't really enjoy watching ""black and white"" movies are that they feel too slow and have too much reliance on talking, but this one is an exception. even though the movie is all talk, i found that the script is very, very well written and kept the tension going among the 12 jurors and its final outcome. each character is distinctly different, with some similarities but also some differentiation, which makes each of the characters believable and relatable in one way or the other. the story, although strictly a courtroom drama, really gives a rather worldly aura within the interaction between the different jurors, since each juror has their own story to tell in relations to the conviction of the 18 year old hispanic boy. even though this is the only film i saw from sidney lumet, i can tell that if this is one of the movies considered classic, then i've missed out on others as well. he has done a very good job with keeping the story flowing and doesn't direct any jarring moments within the only place the jurors are in throughout the whole movie (the jury room). he kept the jury process interesting and engaging, something other courtroom drama didn't really do right. all in all, this should be the film that set the standard of courtroom drama. i don't think any film surpass ""12 angry men"" in that regard, so i think this should be on any serious film collector's collection. sidney lumet's masterpiece garners a 10/10 and is in my opinion the best courtroom drama ever filmed (unless i've missed out on others).";7 June 2006;10;['angry', 'old', 'black', 'white', 'small', 'characterized', 'main', 'old', 'hispanic', 'very', 'main', 'big', 'defining', 'memorable', 'big', 'black', 'white', 'slow', 'much', 'final', 'different', 'believable', 'relatable', 'other', 'different', 'own', 'old', 'hispanic', 'only', 'classic', 'good', 'jarring', 'only', 'whole', 'interesting', 'engaging', 'other', 'angry', 'serious', 'good'];0.0776041666666666

1209;suhaib_clastrz;without any doubt, this is one of the greatest movies of all time, it's one of those movies that you should watch more than one time, and more important, it is a movie that you can recommend to anyone. it is just so simple, no complicated techniques, no visual effects, simple yet great soundtracks, no content, and absolutely amazing acting, characters, and plot. focus at the first few minutes and you can realize how each character thinks, or how each one makes his judge. for example, juror number 3 who wants the kid to be guilty just because he is emotionally affected by what his son done to him, juror number 7 who just agrees with the majority because he doesn't care and want to leave early, or juror number 9 who insists that the old man lied when he gave his witness just because he want to be known, to feel that he is something, it is the same thing that he feels, that no one knows him, they were going to start while he was in toilet because no one realize that he wasn't there, and in the last scene he asked juror number 8 about his name, and told him his name too, so at least 1 person will know him. the most important thing is the idea this movie is trying to tell us, that we must do what is right, whether we are alone or we have everyone with us, we just have to do the right thing no matter what will happen, even if we will be humiliated, or even if we will be attacked by everyone, we must stuck to the right thing. another thing must be mentioned, lee j.cobb is a just amazing, whenever the camera is on him he steals the whole scene. only one thing i don't like about this movie, the arguments of those who thought the kid was guilty are not strong enough, i wish they were better, that would surely have made this movie more amazing.;23 March 2020;8;['great', 'more', 'important', 'simple', 'complicated', 'visual', 'simple', 'great', 'amazing', 'first', 'few', 'guilty', 'early', 'old', 'same', 'last', 'least', 'important', 'right', 'alone', 'right', 'right', 'amazing', 'whole', 'guilty', 'strong', 'well', 'amazing'];0.1784798534798534

1211;alisarmadi;"in this movie, it is flawlessly shown that when big deals are involved, no matter how uncanny the evidence may appear at first, there should be some time allocated to think about others' conclusion and look at it from an angle that questions its truth value. but a man mustn't deny the truthfulness of a matter just for the sake of unity with others, or to put it better, to fit in. this is clearly seen at approximately 1:46 in the movie when juror 11 talks to juror 3 that i will type the exact conversation for better influence down below: juror 11: he's right, that's not an answer. what kind of a man are you? you have sat here and voted guilty with everyone else because there are some baseball tickets burning a hole in your pocket. and now you've changed your vote because you say you are sick of all the talking here? juror 3: ah listen, buddy... juror 11: who tells you that you have the right to play like this with a man's life? don't you care... juror 3: now wait a minute. you can't talk like that to me! juror 11: i can talk like that to you. if you want to vote ""not guilty"" then do it because you are convinced the man is not guilty not because you've had enough. and if you think he is guilty then vote that way. don't you have the guts to do what you think is right? another lesson from this movie is always to put yourself in the shoes of someone you are trying to judge. which i believe is shown at roughly 1:12 in the movie when juror 8 talks to juror 4 about his weekly schedule and asks about a few nights back when he had seen a movie and that he can't remember the plot or even the name of that movie. and the sound of something breaking inside juror 4 is heard when a bead of cold sweat runs down his forehead. another thing that was worthy of attention in this film was the fan that didn't work. while most of the men in the jury room were hot and complaining about the warmth of the room and one of them saying this is gonna be the hottest day of the year (and not likely to change). and when it gets dark and they have to turn on the lights, they discover that now the fan actually works. i think these two change of situations are two main ways to look at the whole shape of the movie. the change in the weather (which no one, not even the weather bureau, could predict) symbolizes the whole change in the overall vote of the jurors. and the whole ""fan situation"" is trying to tell that some light shed on a problem, can change everything.";23 May 2017;10;['big', 'uncanny', 'exact', 'well', 'right', 'guilty', 'sick', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'right', 'weekly', 'few', 'cold', 'worthy', 'most', 'hot', 'hot', 'likely', 'dark', 'main', 'whole', 'whole', 'overall', 'whole'];-0.0337662337662337

1262;faithmunme;"12 angry men is a courtroom drama premised on twelve jurors who have to reach a unanimous decision on a murder case: if the suspect is guilty or not guilty. this premise and its plot resolution was set to be simple and straightforward from the very start. however, lumet was able to dive into such detail and themes with so little to start with. one of the film's merits is how the jurors progress from argument to argument seamlessly. the techniques in negotiation presented drove the argument and plot. as juror 8 negotiated for alternative perspectives, they took another look at the evidence. they revealed the ambiguity in the evidence, leading to reasonable doubt in the decision to be guilty. one such technique of negotiation is the use of objective criteria which involves pulling the criteria away from each individual's opinions, setting the negotiation to be objective and logically sound. this was especially suitable as the negotiation was targeted at juror 4 who had established himself as a logical man. his vote for guilty was on the basis that the female witness's testimony was ""unshakeable"", in which other jurors agreed as well. this set the foundation for the objective criteria: the woman saw the crime happen, and there was no doubt about the testimony's accuracy. eventually, juror 9 noticed the marks on her nose made only by eye-glasses, pointing out that the woman had questionable eyesight. this was an undeniable situation as juror 4 himself wore glasses, and acknowledged this fact as well. the woman's eyesight proved to be reasonably doubtful, making her testimony inaccurate. consequently, he was negotiated into voting for acquittal. this also proved to be an important technique, as it increased the votes for acquittal, eleven to one. the principle revealed crucial details, as it was not a fight for dominance, but rather a joint search to find proof based on the objective criteria.";4 April 2019;10;['angry', 'unanimous', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'simple', 'straightforward', 'very', 'able', 'such', 'little', 'alternative', 'reasonable', 'guilty', 'such', 'objective', 'objective', 'suitable', 'logical', 'guilty', 'female', 'unshakeable', 'other', 'objective', 'questionable', 'undeniable', 'doubtful', 'inaccurate', 'important', 'crucial', 'joint', 'objective'];-0.0703125

1285;simonjiajun;"in the 1954 film, 12 angry men, twelve jurors are tasked to decide the conviction or acquittal of an 18-year-old boy on trial for murdering his father. they are instructed to discuss the case on the basis of reasonable doubt and arrive at a unanimous verdict. while all but one juror - juror 8 - are convinced that the boy is guilty at the beginning of the film, they eventually reach a consentient decision of ""not guilty"" at the end after an extensive deliberative process. in this movie review, i will be discussing the insights on negotiation that i have gained from the movie, with reference to the book getting to yes: negotiating an agreement without giving in by fisher, ury, and patton (2012). the jury quickly runs into the folly of locking themselves into their initial positions on the case when they echo juror 7's call for a vote to be taken at the outset of their meeting. the situation took a turn for the worse when the foreman decides to implement an open ballot where the jurors indicate their votes by a show of hands - a voting method that has been shown to trigger the ""show-of-hands syndrome"" and discourage honest and equitable voting (robbins, 2007). the phenomenon is a likely explanation behind juror 2 and 6's inability to justify their vote, which seems to suggest that they might have merely conformed to the majority without much consideration for the rationale behind their decisions. this sets the stage for their arguing over positions, which fisher identifies as one of the most common mistakes in negotiation (p. 4). arguing over positions does not satisfy the fundamental criteria of bringing about a wise agreement in an efficient and amicable manner (ibid.) since the more clearly people define their positions, the more they commit to it and the harder it is for them to change their position (p. 4 - 5) - due in part to their newfound interest in ""saving face"" by ensuring the consistency of their subsequent actions with their initial positions (p. 8). this obstinate insistence on one's position is embodied in juror 7's melodramatic response to a position that is opposed to his own: ""you couldn't change my mind if you talked for a hundred years"". in order to arrive at a wise solution, the jury should instead focus on interests, and not positions (p. 23). sebenius defines positions as ""one party's stands on the issue"" while interests are ""underlying concerns that would be affected by the resolution"" (p. 91, 2001). hence, instead of digging themselves into their positions, the jurors should look past the superficiality of their positional differences and examine their underlying interests by focusing on reconciling different interests and advancing their shared interest (p. 11), which is to bring justice to the case. an interesting aspect of the negotiation is that while all jurors share the same best alternatives to a negotiated agreement (batna) - concluding with a hung jury - the implications of a failed negotiation are vastly different between those for and against a guilty verdict. research has shown that approximately half of the hung jury cases result in an acquittal of the defendant (kalven & zeisel, 1966). however, with all the eyewitness testimonies and physical evidence against him, it is most likely that the boy would be convicted by the subsequent jury in the event of a hung jury. thus, at the start of the negotiation, the jurors who firmly believes that the boy was guilty - such as jurors 3 and 9 - have a good batna, while juror 8, who believes that the boy may be innocent, has a bad batna. consequently, the jurors who were in favour of a guilty verdict had a stronger negotiating power than juror 8, as the relative negotiating power of two parties is predominantly determined by how attractive to each is the option of walking away from the negotiation (p. 52). this advantage in negotiating power is manifested in juror 3's exclamation of his readiness to declare a hung jury. however, juror 8 cleverly develops his batna throughout the discussion, which is the most effective way to deal with a negotiator who is apparently more powerful than himself (p. 54). at the very end of the discussion, juror 8 even manages to erode juror 3's confidence in his own batna (p. 53) by invoking his conscience and appealing to his underlying interest in doing what is just. a handful of the jurors also fail to separate the people from the problem, such as when juror 3 baselessly accuses juror 5, who has lived in a slum all his life, of changing his vote out of personal sympathy for the teenage boy, who had similarly grown up in a slum. at one point, even the usually clear-headed and composed juror 8 let his righteous indignation get the better of him and falls prey to the ad hominem fallacy (yap, 2013) when he momentarily diverges from the discussion, condemns juror 3 for being a sadist, and questions his motive for wanting to see the boy executed. these exemplify fisher's claim that people tend to draw speculative inferences about the intentions and attitudes of others in an almost reflexive manner (p. 22), which causes them to be ""defensive and reactive"" while overlooking the legitimacy of the others' interests (p. 40). interestingly, both confrontations are successfully mediated by juror 10, who brings the discussion back to the substantive issue by highlighting that they should not make the discussion ""a personal thing"", as it is precisely the fact that they have ""nothing to gain or lose by the verdict"" which makes them competent jurors. by disentangling the substantive problem from the ""people problem"", the jury is better able to target the problem instead of the people (ibid.), making it easier for them to see one another as partners working side-by-side to satisfy their collective interest (p. 41). a large part of juror 8's success in convincing the other jurors may be attributed to his use of objective criteria that are independent of either side's will, which facilitated the exploration of possible standards and solutions (p. 46). juror 4 sets the scene for negotiating with objective criteria by proposing that they should ""discuss the facts"", effectively bringing the group to agree on truth and rationality as the appropriate standards on which to base their decision. throughout the discussion, juror 8 plays his part by remaining ""open to reason but closed to threats"" (p. 43). he is receptive to reasoned persuasion by objective facts (p. 59) as he is aware of the possible lapses in his knowledge and the potential shortcomings of his arguments. thus, he routinely invites the other jurors to participate in re-enacting the crime scene and in evaluating the reliability of the evidence (p. 18), which is useful in turning criticism from his opponents into a key ingredient of convincing the others of his views (p. 56). he is also able to remain unphased and steadfast in the face of threats and personal attacks from the more aggressive jurors and never succumbs to pressure. for instance, when juror 10 and 3 lash out juror 8, he calmly diffuses the tension by asking questions and employing strategic pauses (ibid.). juror 8's masterful application of negotiation jujitsu, which revolves around skilful sidestepping one's opponent's attack while deflecting it against the problem (p. 55), is also key to his success. towards the end of the discussion, juror 3 persists in his refusal to negotiate based on principle and confronts juror 8 with the threat: ""i will kill you!"" instead of defending himself or responding in kind through physical retaliation or counterthreats, juror 8 comes back with a rhetorical question: ""you don't actually mean you'll kill me, do you?"" this enables juror 8 to successfully recast the threat as an attack on the problem (p. 56) by turning it into ammunition for his earlier assertion that the phrase has largely been considered inane due to its repeated use in everyday conversations as a common expression of anger. not only does this manoeuvre give vent to juror 3's frustration (ibid.) while simultaneously taking the power out of his threat, it also increases the persuasiveness of juror 8's argument and gets the others to reconsider the relevance of the eyewitness testimony. juror 8 also demonstrates his strategic use of questions, instead of statements, to challenge his opponents and lead them to confront the problem (ibid.) when he exposes an incongruity between juror 10's choice to believe the testimony of a non-white witness and his self-professed distrust towards people of colour with the question: ""how come you believe her? she is just one of them too, isn't she?"" in conclusion, i consider 12 angry men to be one of the greatest cinematic exhibitions of group psychology within a deliberative assembly and a textbook example of principled negotiation. the movie is also perfectly complemented by the book getting to yes: negotiating an agreement without giving in (fisher et al., 2012). being able to watch the negotiation techniques play out in the movie has greatly enhanced my understanding of the theories expounded in the book and helped me realise the usefulness and importance of good negotiation skills.";25 October 2019;10;['angry', 'old', 'reasonable', 'unanimous', 'guilty', 'guilty',

1290;czixuan;the jurors who failed to be good listeners are portrayed as unreasonable and illogical in the film. from a third person perspective, it is easy for us to see that some of the jurors are clearly affected by their own personal emotions in the film. juror 3, who still voted for guilty in the last round, had a rebellious son, and he could not help but to relate to his son as the case was about a son murdering his own father. due to the strong disappointment he had on his son, juror 3 was very firm about the fact that the son was guilty as he adapted the case to his personal experience. personal experience could be useful when it comes to logical thinking, but should not be referred to if personal emotions were to be brought in as well. by taking the matter too personal, it prevents the negotiators from looking at the matter objectively, which is crucial during a negotiation. furthermore, negotiators who are affected by personal emotions tend to feel uncomfortable when facing doubts from the opposite position. negotiators need to be clear that questioning any claim that anyone has made is vital for purely clarification purposes.;12 November 2019;8;['good', 'unreasonable', 'illogical', 'third', 'easy', 'own', 'personal', 'guilty', 'last', 'rebellious', 'own', 'strong', 'firm', 'guilty', 'personal', 'personal', 'useful', 'logical', 'personal', 'personal', 'crucial', 'personal', 'uncomfortable', 'opposite', 'clear', 'vital'];0.0789855072463768
1291;flamehawk-40572;"12 angry men is a 1957 courtroom drama film telling the story of 12 jurors deliberating over the guilt of the 18-year-old defendant, based on the context of reasonable doubt. the film itself serves as an excellent testament to the power of negotiation, exploring a plethora of techniques in building consensus and how they can be used to overcome the difficulties that arise in this process of discussion. the setting is the perfect stage for negotiation, as by virtue of them being in a jury, none of them know each other and none of them have personal stakes in the discussion, making the ensuing discussion a battle of logic, wit and delivery. the film intentionally sets itself up in a manner to elicit introspective thought from its audience by not revealing the names of any of the characters until the exchange of dialogue at the end of the film, pushing the audience towards self-evaluation with regard to the traits displayed on screen. the premise of the film places the fate of the defendant in the hands of the jury, a death sentence hanging over his head. the jury has been instructed to deliver a unanimous verdict, denying them the luxury of agreeing to disagree. while initially there is a near complete vote in favour of the defendant's guilt, by the end there is a consensus of the inverse, following discussions that span the length of the film. this begins with juror 8 being the only one arguing for the defendant's innocence, setting in motion events that lead to a unanimous vote to acquit the defendant. juror 8 is framed as our protagonist, with juror 3 as our antagonist, and the major learning points lie in the differences between the two. at face value, one might imagine that juror 3 is the superior negotiator between the two. he's confident of his points, quick to refute counter-arguments and does not back down even in the face of a strong point made against him. this is in stark contrast to the far meeker juror 8, who appears to not only seldom refute the points of the other jurors, but even comes across uncertain of his own position. his foil, juror 3, utilizes what fisher and ury define in their book ""getting to yes"" as hard positional bargaining. his ultimate goal at the end of the discussion is victory, his is distrustful of others and treats them as adversaries and is both rooted in his position and demanding in this battle of wills. with this frame set up, it would be easy to determine that juror 8 uses the opposite approach with his gentler personality, a soft positional bargaining, seeking agreement, trusting others and treating the other negotiator as friends. but this is not quite what he is actually doing, and therein lies the first hidden strength of juror 8. what he does over the course of the film falls is change the rules of the negotiation. from the beginning, he avoids coming across as confrontational by conceding that he might not be sure if the boy is truly guilty or not. in a regular setting this might seem like argumentative suicide, but in the jury setting, this is an excellent framing tool. all jurors have the civic responsibility to ensure to the best of their ability that the verdict carried out is just. when the negotiations began, all of them were defensive against the disagreement and prepared to refute him, but in expressing that ""i don't know whether i believe it or not, maybe i don't."", he changes the game such that it invites further deliberation from all parties, rather than drawing battle lines between two opposing positions. this is made possible as it is necessary to convince others that your mind can change in order to change their minds. by pushing away from the idea of bargaining for positions, he not only drives the other jurors to be more open to discussion, but also to make a wiser, less hasty decision over the life of another. juror 8 is also careful in his discussions not to yield to pressure. it would have been easy at the start for someone to give in to peer pressure simply due to an overwhelming majority against him, but he chooses not to. holding fast to his interests, or in this case the interest of fairness and justice, was the first step in swaying the minds of the other jurors. he utilizes the pressure to his advantage as ""under the pressure of a forthcoming negotiation, your critical sense is likely to be sharper."" (fisher & ury, 32) and ensures that his points are all rooted in logic. this is unlike figures such as juror 7, who succumbed both to personal interest and pressure of time when he switched his stance due to his urgency to attend the baseball game. any insistence he puts forward in this setting was unconvincing and he additional managed to earn the disdain of the other jurors for his lack of dedication to the topic. juror 7 reveals in his actions a lack of objectivity which costs him his credibility, a trait which we will later see repeated with juror 3. on the inverse, juror 8 constantly takes action to make sure that not only he, but every other juror is as objective as possible, reminding them that their role in the jury might cause an innocent boy his life. once again he changes the rules of the game, bringing them not to some other form of discussion, but rather realigning a discussion that initiated on a note influenced by personal factors with its intended execution. doing so reinforces his credibility, as the other jurors see his points not as baseless argument, but spoken and driven by his responsibility to fulfilling his civic role to its upmost. this then pushes them to approach the discussion with the same attitude, one that in driven by justice and resolution rather than positions and confrontation. by the end of the negotiations, juror 3 reveals a fatal flaw in his argument, and that is his skewed vision towards the subject matter of the discussion. as he began to lose ground, his arguments became increasingly desperate and unconvincing. he ultimately reveals that his desperation to see the defendant be found guilty is driven by his strained relationship with his son, something that had been alluded to throughout the film. this reflects that his arguments while largely logical, were not driven by objective criteria. this introduction of personal stakes is an immediately penalizable point in the jury setting, and suggests that from the start he had already made up his mind without likely having truly considered all the facts. he was obsessed with what james sebenius describes as ""believing your own line"", or rather, placing all his focus upon defending his position that he would disregard otherwise convincing points and arguments. his arguments thus took a form more akin to stating what he would and would not accept. such an approach is costly in an argument as it inclines you against even the most logical statements. refusal to acknowledge a reasonable argument makes an individual come across as unreasonable and juror 3 is guilty of that time and time again. the success of juror 8 in convincing the others of his beliefs was fundamentally to acknowledge that he could not change their minds at all. rather, the only person who can change a person's mind is themselves and he reframed the rules of the game to facilitate that. he had the upmost of respect for the views of the other jurors, readily conceding when to them good points of arguments they had made, seeing them as part of the thought process. he displayed great awareness that simply because you disagree with a conclusion does not necessarily mean that you disagree with every thought that brought them there. while juror 3 actively tried to pull the others to his side, juror 8 pushed the others to re-evaluate the facts and then pick a side of their own. this is in no way implying that he does not make arguments to support his case, but rather he presents it as perspective and evidence to be considered as opposed to an undeniable truth. even without a direct, relentless adversary like juror 3, juror 8 would have quite possibly brought the others to the same conclusion and in this context juror 3 lost the war of attrition to juror 8 by his own hand, gradually destroying his own credibility and ultimately dissuading the others of his cause. these points, among many others, are among the reasons why 12 angry men is regarded as one of the most acclaimed courtroom dramas of all time, being seen by even the library of congress as worth of the national film registry for being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"". it was and continues to be a paragon of the principles of good negotiation from which we can all learn.";12 November 2019;8;['angry', 'old', 'reasonable', 'excellent', 'perfect',

1292;m_rabiul;12 angry men is a deeply engrossing crime drama shot almost entirely in a claustrophobic utilitarian jury room which shows how one person with a conscience and critical thinking ability can make a difference to this society while also criticises how we are often biased by prejudice, bigotry, and conceit in making our decisions. this powerful film is a deep examination of human psychology which explains how we often judge an incident based on our own perceptual biases, close mindedness and own experience rather than the facts produced from that incident. a hispanic teenage boy, born and raised in a slum, was accused of killing his father and was in trial. there were two concrete pieces of evidences which were enough to put the boy in the electric chair. but the final decision has to come from the juries and so they retired to the jury room after the judge asked them to come up with their verdict. it looked like an open and shut case until one juror (juror 8) vetoed and wanted to go through the facts again. eleven members of the jury did not think otherwise and tried to convince him that he was wrong. juror 8 did not have any concrete proof of otherwise but he raised his concern about the authenticity of the facts and incidents that has been produced during the case. slowly, through his power of logic, patience and negotiation, he inspired the other juries to look into the facts from a fresh and different perspective. in fact he leaded them with some insights which seemed impossible to comprehend to the others. inspired by his insights some of them started to delve into the facts, came out of their stereotypical mentalities, started to ask the right questions and finally came out with some startling perspectives which made their own earlier statements doubtful. the colour and pace of this black & white film came from the cohesive storyline and the arguments and counter arguments presented by the juries. this is a drama where the characters flourished in their respective roles to their fullest extent and likewise this is a thriller where the excitement came through sharp arguments. the film never shows whether the accused is guilty or innocent, neither does it draw its curtains on finding the murderer. it does not show any arguments between lawyers, it does not even give away the names of all the juries. even though the plot is centred around a murder, the concept is centred around unravelling the psychology of human decision making. perhaps, these are the reasons why this film is so different from any other court room dramas i have ever seen. a perfect classic!;10 September 2015;10;['angry', 'claustrophobic', 'utilitarian', 'critical', 'powerful', 'deep', 'human', 'own', 'perceptual', 'close', 'own', 'hispanic', 'teenage', 'concrete', 'enough', 'electric', 'final', 'open', 'shut', 'wrong', 'concrete', 'other', 'fresh', 'different', 'impossible', 'stereotypical', 'right', 'startling', 'own', 'early', 'doubtful', 'black', 'white', 'cohesive', 'counter', 'respective', 'full', 'sharp', 'guilty', 'innocent', 'human', 'different', 'other', 'perfect'];-0.0089616402116402

1316;drogueriadelavilla;yep this movie is so great. the tension of the characters draws the audience in from the start. we imagine that the case is open and shut, 11 me saying guilty and 1 not. we feel the discomfort of henry fonda as the other characters belittle and mock how he can see any reasonable doubt in the case. but we also share his victories and the enthusiasm as he proceeds to refute or add doubt to the arguments for guilty and are captivated and draw in as other jurors begin to see doubt in the proceedings. the audience can also see the arguments for guilty and wonder if fonda's character is correct in saying that he doubts. yet they also feel the shame of the characters as he disproves that a previously sound theory is iron tight, joining his side as members of the jury do. on top of this they are wonderfully woven in human elements such as the misconceptions that influence people and the growing tension between different characters. this is brought to life even more by the amazing performances, fonda, lee j cobb and joseph sweeney are of particular note. i started watching this film on a bored relaxed laying about day but by the end i was on the edge of the seat with my hands on my knees feeling more tense than a politician on results day. how a film should be made. modern directors take note(thats ur telling off for the day) 10/10;23 May 2020;10;['great', 'open', 'guilty', 'other', 'reasonable', 'guilty', 'other', 'guilty', 'correct', 'sound', 'human', 'such', 'different', 'amazing', 'particular', 'bored', 'relaxed', 'tense', 'modern'];-0.0127450980392156

1335;isaacmilhousetan;"1. introduction twelve angry men written by reginald rose depicts a story about twelve men with different backgrounds and characteristics coming together to form a jury, for a murder trial. the film takes place within a jury room where the twelve man takes a side and debate on the verdict of finding the defendant guilty or not guilty. with reference to ""getting to yes"" written by roger fisher, we will explore the different techniques employed and mistakes the twelve jurors made throughout the film. 2. arguing over opening positions produces unwise outcomes in the movie, we can easily identify two sides to the argument, the guilty verdict side and the non-guilty verdict side. the jurors in the guilty verdict side tend to anchor themselves into their positions, they were constantly defending against attacks, rebutting every single point made by the opposing side. the more they defended it against attack, the more committed they became to it. during the initial portion of the debate after the first poll conducted by the jury foremen, juror 8 did not take a hard stand on his non-guilty verdict when questioned by the others. instead, he admits that he was unsure if the defendant was guilty or not. he expressed that he merely wanted to explore the possibilities of the case. by not taking a hard stand at the beginning of the argument, it encouraged discussion with the other jurors rather than confrontation. immediately after he said that, the jurors started to show interest in his train of thought, and they made the effort to reason with him rather than confront him. in the getting to yes book, it mentions that when arguing over positions, the more you try to convince the other side of the impossibility of you changing your stand, the more their minds won't change. for them to change their minds, they must believe that they can change yours. if juror 8 had made his stand with absolute certainty at the beginning of the argument, nobody would have wanted to make an effort to reason with him amicably. effectively shutting down any hope of a discussion. rather than focusing on positions, juror 8 wanted to create a discourse of the facts, compared to the other jurors who were quick to convict. when the other eleven jurors made a hard stand during their opening positions, their egos became identified with their position of guilty. if juror 8 had cling firmly onto his stance of not guilty, it would give the impression that he was stubborn and extreme, triggering the exact same behaviour from the opposing side. which would have reduced the chances of reaching a constructive agreement greatly. 3. listening to the other side throughout the film, juror 8 portrayed a non-aggressive demeanour, he doesn't give a rebuttal to every single point made against his, he even agrees with some of the points made by the opposing side. he understood that it is better to concede to a good point made by the opposition than to contest every point made. not only does it make him seem less petty, but it also allows the opposing side to feel like their views have been heard. he listens actively and acknowledges what was being said by them. compared to juror 3 who contested every single point made against his side, and never once acknowledge any of the good points brought up by them. according to fisher, this behaviour would only give the impression that juror 3 has not understood the opposing side's points, which would cause them to constantly repeat the same points. while they are formulating a way to represent the same points being made, they would not be actually listening to juror 3's points. 4. hostility against one another juror 8 understood that this was a negotiation, not a debate. the purpose was not for both sides to try to persuade a third party, they were trying to persuade each other. in that sense, it is unproductivity to blame and belittle the opposing members, to engage in name-calling or raising their voices at each other. one bad example was when juror 10 made derogatory remakes about juror 5's upbringing in a slum. in response, juror 5 not only switched to the opposing side but also made a continuous effort to undermine juror 10's points throughout the remainder of the debate. juror 10 made the mistake of attacking with his own personal prejudice against the defendant. throughout the film, we can see both sides and especially juror 3 shouting their points over at each other. according to fisher, anger and resentment often leaves one side feeling belittled and that their legitimate concerns have gone unheard as they accept the rigid will of the other side. even juror 8 was guilty of such an infraction. during one scene, he broke his non-aggressive demeanour and called juror 3 a sadist, resulting in juror 3 lunging forward to attack juror 8. if it weren't for the other jurors holding him back, almost certainly a fight would have started. if that fight had started, the entire possibility for an amicable debate would have gone right out the window. according to fisher, building a working relationship is key to making negotiations easier. the importance of establishing a good relationship with not only the opposing side but within your team is shown throughout the film. 5. when to concede versus when to contest when negotiating with other parties, it's natural to take a hard stand, to make the discussion go the way you want. two sides, each pushing hard for their interests, will often stimulate each other's creativity. in the case of the jurors, we can identify when is it best to concede an argument versus when do we contest it. whenever juror 8 is faced with an argument from the opposing side, he would decide if the point made was strong or not. juror 8 demonstrates the time to concede an argument is when the point made by the opposing side is deemed valid, and if any counter made was personal in nature would tend to be viewed as immature. we only contest when the opposing point made was not a strong argument, either the facts were wrong or neglected, this is when you should contest. one example was when juror 3 mixed up the time taken by the witness to reach the door from his bed and was promptly corrected by the rest of the jurors. instead of accepting it, he brushed it aside and implied that the whole argument was invalid in the first place. not only did this stunt prove counterintuitive for his argument, but it also showed the rest that he was not able to accept any criticism, and possibly unable to be convinced of any other perspective. 6. using an objective criteria and format for discussion the first part of the negotiations was when it already started to go wrong. the jury foremen made the first mistake. before establishing any sort of objective criteria or framework to approach the discussion ahead, he asked for a show of hands on who thought the defendant was guilty. in doing so, it forced everyone to make a stand before any productive discussion was made. according to fisher, when one commits to a side, it is significantly harder to unmake that commitment to move towards the other side. each side would then have to spend a significant amount of time and effort to defend their stand and attacking the opposing side, rather than approaching this discussion rationally. instead, the jury should have discussed the details of the crime with an open mind, with no initial stand taken. they could have systemically laid out all the points made during the trial and approached each point with a fair standard. only after every point has been discussed, then that's when they should have taken a stand. by doing so, it would be more of a discussion than a debate as they go through the findings. if they had done this, no one would have to back down, no one would appear weak. this would have mitigated many of the confrontations made during the film, as many of them were personal in nature addressing personal egos. 7. conclusion the film is an apt example of what happens when you are unable to detach the person from the argument. our personal prejudice and prior experience would interfere with any hope of a fair argument. the film also demonstrates how to address these problems in a discussion through the techniques mentioned earlier. it depicts what would happen if the discussion had been conducted poorly and the repercussions of the words and actions made by the various participants have on a productive discussion. bibliography fisher, roger, bruce patton, and william ury. getting to yes: negotiating agreement without giving in. winnipeg: media production services unit, manitoba education, 2013.

1337;amandachuasineng;"""12 angry men"" is a 1957 courtroom drama film which tells the story of a jury where twelve jurors have a debate on the conviction or acquittal of an 18-year old defendant based on reasonable doubt. the defendant is on trial for alleged murder of his father and he would receive capital punishment if found 'guilty'. this group of jurors have a wide range of personalities, backgrounds, prejudices and emotions, which intensifies the conflict. the film explores many techniques of negotiations and the challenges encountered in the process. at the start of the film, the first count of votes revealed a guilty-to-not guilty ratio of eleven-to-one. however, this ratio gradually shifts throughout the show and eventually all the jurors agreed on a verdict of ""not guilty"" unanimously. despite the negotiation methods in the film ""12 angry men"" being portrayed as effective, there are still many negotiation flaws that can be improved. the book ""getting to yes"" consists of many insights regarding effective negotiation methods to obtain the best outcome from a negotiation. these methods can be used to make the negotiation process in the film smoother. overall, the film is outstanding and worth a watch. the issues addressed in the film are relevant today where emotions and racial stereotypes affects a person's reaction, and people negotiating are more concerned about their own lives than arriving at the best decision.";25 October 2020;10;['angry', 'old', 'reasonable', 'alleged', 'capital', 'guilty', 'wide', 'many', 'first', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'angry', 'effective', 'many', 'many', 'effective', 'good', 'outstanding', 'worth', 'relevant', 'racial', 'concerned', 'own', 'good'];0.1477272727272727

1339;matthias_oh;"this simple but powerful movie showcases the complicated and profound nature of negotiations. in many scenes, it showcases the problem that is beyond a ""guilty"" and ""not guilty"" dichotomy; beneath the positional disagreements lies the conflict of personal interests and emotional struggles. closely related to this topic is the subject matter of making a constructive negotiation, as expounded on further by fisher in his book, ""getting to yes"". below entails some descriptions of the movie that highlights the deeper running issues. relational tensions between negotiators is implicated in negotiations, even if the discussions revolve around the subject matter at hand. juror 3, who positively believes that the defendant is guilty, was clearly infuriated by the growing rejection of his verdict as juror 8 argumentatively raised possibilities that suggest otherwise. in his rage, he resentfully shouted, ""what's the matter with you guys? you all know he's guilty!"", essentially dismissing the concessions made. his misgivings, chiefly against juror 8, culminated in his exclamation that he will ""kill him!"". these emotionally-charged words do not reflect a rational argument, but his impassioned disrespect of juror 8, proving that relational tension was a challenge against constructive negotiation. this conflict exemplifies a ""major consequence"" of the ""people problem in negotiation"", when the ""parties' relationship"" is entangled with their ""discussions of substance."" positional bargaining will put the relationship and substance in conflict, hence fisher encourages negotiators to separate people from problems and deal with the ""people problems"" directly. even though juror 8 did not directly address his relational tension with juror 3, the film highlights its ability to complicate negotiations, which necessitates a separate resolution for the people problem. anyone who wants to understand the complicated nature of negotiations, and learn how to meaningfully navigate a difficult situation with people should really watch this movie with intent.";3 November 2020;9;['simple', 'powerful', 'complicated', 'profound', 'many', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'positional', 'personal', 'emotional', 'related', 'subject', 'constructive', 'deep', 'relational', 'subject', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'rational', 'impassioned', 'relational', 'constructive', 'major', 'positional', 'relational', 'separate', 'complicated', 'difficult'];-0.1604166666666666

1345;saritazhang;"this film was amazing. i could not take my eyes of the screen; every moment of the movie was filled with detail, exciting debate and my brain was constantly engaged. i was deeply touched and greatly impressed by juror #8's determination, courage, intelligence and calmness to persuade the other jurors to give the boy a chance. for myself, i took away important lessons about negotiation. in particular, it is a common mistake to focus on position instead of interest especially in decisions-making situations with a lot of people. this is because position is something that is outward and immediately obvious to the other parties involved, while interest is something that needs to be verbalised and made known. when only the position but not interests is known, people tend to get immediately upset over changes in positions because they are not aware of the reason. this can be seen in the movie, where strong supporters of the conviction of the boy are angered by the jurors changing their vote to ""not guilty"". this is despite most jurors (except for maybe juror #7 and #10) having the same interest to do what is right for the boy. with that said, expressing one's interests in a topic is an extremely useful tool in negotiation. when asked why he votes not guilty, juror #8 made an impactful statement by saying that ""there is reasonable doubt"" when it comes to the ruling. he stated that his interest was to take the jury's decision very seriously because they boy is young and his life is worth the long debate to come to a consensus (""we are talking about somebody's life here, we can't decide in 5 minutes.""). by making known his interest, he allows his opponents to think about their own interest, which, as said earlier, is to come to the right decision. this ""reasonable doubt"" is also what made the second last person to maintain the guilty vote, juror #4, change his mind. please please please do watch this film! it is really worth your time.";9 November 2020;10;['amazing', 'exciting', 'impressed', 'other', 'important', 'particular', 'common', 'outward', 'obvious', 'other', 'known', 'aware', 'strong', 'guilty', 'most', 'same', 'right', 'useful', 'guilty', 'impactful', 'reasonable', 'young', 'worth', 'long', 'own', 'right', 'reasonable', 'second', 'last', 'guilty', 'worth'];0.1471938775510204

1368;benjithemoviefan;this movie is a masterpiece. definitely deserves all its recognition. it took a simple story of 12 jurors testifying their evidence to prove that a puerto rican teenager is guilty or not guilty for the murder of his father and turned it into a gripping, intelligent, and unforgettable masterwork of filmmaking. as the movie goes on, we can see the jurors' motivations, struggles, and hardships as well as the storytelling of the movie just by the performances and dialogue alone which draws you there is no music during the time where they try to solve the case except in the opening credits, when the jurors take a bathroom break, and when the movie ends, and even with all of that, you still get invested in the story and the characters. that's sidney lumet understanding the art of film right there. sometimes, you don't need music or special effects to help the story, you can tell it by performances and visuals. if you are invested in the characters, then you have a good story and 12 angry men achieves that flawlessly. the beauty of the movie is that it feels like an hour or 30 minutes short film when it's actually 1 hour and 36 minutes, but it never gets boring and uninteresting. when a movie feels a few times shorter than it's length, then it's a masterpiece. when i fast forward and backwards, it would say 40 minutes or an hour (i watched this on a criterion collection blu-ray which shows the runtime when you fast forward or backwards) when it really felt like 20 or 10 minutes. that's insane, man. the most important thing about a movie in my view is pacing and 12 angry men is the most fast and relentlessly paced movie i've ever seen so it's also a masterclass of pacing. it's a flawless work of art and i would recommend it to any film buff regardless if they like pre-70s movies or not. i would give the movie thumbs up as well as a a++.;21 July 2021;10;['simple', 'puerto', 'rican', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'intelligent', 'unforgettable', 'alone', 'special', 'good', 'angry', 'short', 'boring', 'uninteresting', 'few', 'short', 'insane', 'important', 'angry', 'fast', 'flawless'];0.0033613445378151

''12 angry me'' pushes you to reflect on very complicated topics. the way that tension is held during the whole movie is akin to waiting for a thunderstorm. i was worried about the boy's life as if it was mine. i also felt deep empathy for the character of henry fonda, whose acting can not be unobserved. fortunately, the thunderstorm ended in rain, which was also reflected in 3rd juror's crying. such a relief.;23 March 2021;10;['black', 'white', 'special', 'colorful', 'young', 'various', 'possible', 'impartial', 'previous', 'such', 'important', 'angry', 'complicated', 'whole', 'akin', 'worried', 'deep'];0.0017006802721088
1370;romainkanynd;"as a team of film critics, we recently went to the cinema to see a broadcast of the movie ""12 angry men"" and god, what a great film for octogenarians! maybe to give you our opinion about it, we must put this dud into context. 12 angry men or ""12 hommes en colere"" in french, is a 1957 american courtroom drama film directed by sidney lumet and based on the eponymous piece of theatre of 1954 written by reginald rose. as lumet is a filmmaker known for his tragedies and critics of american justice system, we were, as fans waiting for a harrowing masterpiece! but we think that our small introduction made you understand that we were disappointed. the movie unfolds in a jury room in which 12 jurors are deliberating the case of an impoverished 18-year-old boy who is accused of stabbing his father to death. therefore, the spectator follows this uneven trial for not less than ninety-six minutes, which is of course a bit exhausting. however, you may be pleased when seeing the cast with henry fonda, which would be normal. yet, he probably is the reason of the movie's recognition, because there is nothing else that distinguishes it from other courtroom films such as liar liar from 1997. maybe, we are scandalmongers because you probably know martin balsam? or john fiedler? no, you don't? to be honest we think that fonda, mr davis in the movie, or the juror eight truly makes the film. if the gamechanger, the one who was about to save the young boy by rebelling against the tyranny of the majority, was anonymous for the spectators, would people give the movie that much attention? we do not think so. nevertheless, the themes addressed in this film seemed intrusting: the justice and the question of morality and values are omnipresent, but they would be the few positive points. in fact, it contains an underlying message about prejudicial actions, the difficulties to be a juror and even racism during the fifties. it provides an interesting perspective on the importance of being a juror and the possible biases that jurors could, and still can encounter nowadays. it is both dramatic and tense, and it is insightful in its depiction of various aspects of humanity. but we were unable to identify with this film as it was impossible to identify with any of the jurors, it felt like they were not communicating any emotion. moreover, the script may seem ingenious but if you dig a bit it is not really the case and almost becomes boring at one point. it was so hard not to fall asleep while watching it. we were neither surprised nor excited to see the film and after we saw it. don't you think the story is a bit far-fetched? twelve brains take ninety minutes to agree on such an obvious case? of course, he was not guilty. but after all, this movie kind of shows how screwed up the american justice system is. the poor boy is found guilty before all the evidence were even considered. logic would dictate that he is not guilty until proven innocent, but apparently only one brain managed to take that detail into account, which made the scenario a bit inconceivable. to be the most objective as possible, 12 angry men is one of the films that did not aged well. overall, this is a good movie if you like vintage (because it is trending again), slow-paced, and closed-door films. you can also go see it if you like films that denounce timeless issues that still occur today. also, if you like henry fonda, you want to watch it because he still plays greatly. it can be a great old school classic, but definitely a waste of time for people, like us from generation z. if you are into more dynamic courtroom movies, we would advice you to watch more recent ones, such as ""just mercy"" from 2019 or ""the trial of the chicago 7"" that was released last year!";26 March 2021;3;['angry', 'great', 'angry', 'french', 'american', 'eponymous', 'harrowing', 'small', 'impoverished', 'old', 'uneven', 'less', 'exhausting', 'pleased', 'normal', 'other', 'such', 'honest', 'about', 'young', 'anonymous', 'much', 'omnipresent', 'few', 'positive', 'prejudicial', 'interesting', 'possible', 'dramatic', 'tense', 'insightful', 'various', 'unable', 'impossible', 'ingenious', 'boring', 'hard', 'asleep', 'surprised', 'excited', 'fetched', 'obvious', 'guilty', 'poor', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'innocent', 'inconceivable', 'objective', 'possible', 'angry', 'good', 'closed', 'great', 'old', 'more', 'dynamic', 'recent', 'such', 'last'];-0.0268243661100803

1412;richie_wev;"when the premise is that twelve men are presiding over a murder case during jury duty, anyone who has ever been required to attend jury themselves will agree that, this sounds like one hell of a boring plot. nevertheless, 12 angry men has become an incredibly popular film over the years and for good reason. the plot is deceptively simple; twelve men in a jury engage in heated discussion with each other, over the innocence of a young man accused of murder. it appears to be a very open-and-shut case, yet the calm, enquiring and objective henry fonda's questionings cause the entire jury to turn on their head's as more and more perceptions start to come to light. the situation this jury finds itself in is in itself, incredibly gripping. we, the audience, look in on people who seem as though their opinions on the matter are firmly set in stone. characters who at first are so certain about the ultimate outcome, they'd rather joke, talk about sports, boast about their business, banter or play crossword puzzles, rather than take the matter at hand seriously. watching henry fonda manage to convincingly break down each and every one of their uncaring barriers is something highly engaging as he seems to be breaking down your barrier as well. something about the way in which the story is portrayed almost makes you yourself feel like one of the characters in the jury; the film is shot in real-time, the characters opinions change with each monologue, the room you are in while watching the film almost becomes just as hot, stuffy and restless as the room in which these jurors preside in. speaking of the jurors, another amazing thing about this film is what amazing characters they are. the twelve we are presented with are all unique and all of them have differing reactions to the situation they are in, the situation to be discussed and to each other and this is one of the most fascinating aspects about the film as a whole. first, there's henry fonda's protagonist, a man who despite being comparatively timid in contrast to the other characters at first, manages to show an admirable amount of unflinching will and integrity, without seeming to become annoyingly sanctimonious. then there's lee j. cobb's excellent performance as our antagonist, juror #3; a man who from the offset is more personally involved with this trial than he will willingly let on. my personal favourite character is the analytical stockbroker juror #4 played by e.g. marshall, as of all the characters in the room willing to vote guilty, he seemed to me as the most logical yet still open to reason. of course, although the film is very good, it isn't perfect. it is however, good enough to the point where i can only really make 'nitpicks' rather than criticisms. one such nitpick is the use of close- up shots during the film, particularly the one's involving the old man, juror #9, which i felt looked quite out of place. the film seemed to flow in a very much naturalistic way, for the close-up shots to be in any way effective. i did also think that while some of the evidence discussed in the juror's room on the young man's behalf, was very convincing, some of it did really seem as though they were grasping at straws; the talk about the knife in particular i found quite circumstantial. maybe more information at the very start of the film, about the case at hand would have been helpful as well. like i mentioned earlier however, these are minor nitpicks. 12 angry men is an extremely interesting film; you have an interesting situation, a load of interesting characters and all of this is excellently executed. considering the setting as well, these 96 minutes seem to fly-by as you never once find yourself bored. a very well justified, timeless classic.";4 July 2011;9;['boring', 'angry', 'popular', 'good', 'simple', 'heated', 'other', 'young', 'open', 'objective', 'entire', 'more', 'more', 'gripping', 'certain', 'ultimate', 'uncaring', 'engaging', 'real', 'hot', 'stuffy', 'amazing', 'amazing', 'unique', 'other', 'fascinating', 'timid', 'other', 'admirable', 'sanctimonious', 'excellent', 'personal', 'favourite', 'willing', 'guilty', 'logical', 'open', 'good', 'perfect', 'good', 'such', 'old', 'naturalistic', 'close', 'effective', 'young', 'convincing', 'particular', 'circumstantial', 'more', 'very', 'helpful', 'minor', 'angry', 'interesting', 'interesting', 'interesting', 'bored', 'justified'];0.2313740079365079

1419;poddarss;"12 angry men (1957) stands out for more than one reason, it was based on a teleplay by reginald rose, and was the first feature film to be directed by sidney lumet. the story deals with a court case relating to murder of a man by his son. 12 members of jury are sent inside the jury room to deliberate over the case and determine whether the boy killed his father or not, we as viewer are unaware of the court preceding that happened before the deliberation. however before the start of discussion between the jury members a preliminary vote is taken to find out where everyone stands, 11 jurors call the defendant guilty without a second thought which leaves only juror no 8 (henry fonda) with reluctance to call the boy guilty so early and without discussion, everyone else believes the case to be open and shut and pressurize the remaining juror to join their side, juror no 8 however has other plan. what follows is an amazing interplay of confrontation, clash of personality and display of bias in the cloak of logic. the screenplay is tight to the extent that you don't want to miss a single scene or dialogue, and mind you maximum movie takes place inside one room with an occasional shot of doorway but believe me you don't mind that a bit, in proverbial terms it is the place where ""all the action happens"". the beauty of the story lies in the way juror no 8 kept insisting on the need to communicate with each other as there is no other way to reach at a logical and fair verdict, he himself is not 100% sure if the boy is innocent, but believes in the principal of american criminal law, one must be convicted of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt, i.e. to say that even if there is shred of a doubt that the man may be innocent than he should not be convicted of the crime. everybody is reluctant to give the boy the benefit of the doubt because of their own reasons, some are convinced the boy is guilty, some are biased and some just want to get over with it so that they can continue with their plans. but what juror no 8 starts catches momentum and people slowly starts to see the light of reason and their conviction that the boy is guilty slowly starts turning into that maybe the boy is not guilty; every evidence presented during the trial is examined and re-examined, the previous notion that there is no doubt that the boy committed the crime is subsided by maybe the evidence was misinterpreted, mind you nobody is absolutely sure that boy is innocent but it is the possibility that the boy may be innocent that starts driving them.";26 December 2015;10;['angry', 'more', 'first', 'unaware', 'preliminary', 'guilty', 'second', 'guilty', 'open', 'other', 'amazing', 'tight', 'single', 'maximum', 'occasional', 'proverbial', 'other', 'other', 'logical', 'fair', 'sure', 'innocent', 'american', 'criminal', 'reasonable', 'innocent', 'reluctant', 'own', 'guilty', 'biased', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'previous', 'sure', 'innocent', 'innocent'];0.0615591397849462

1424;jpfr_76;in the purest sense, this movie represents the art of representation. with only twelve men and a room, the director brings to the spectator the struggle of a fair judgment. without any action in terms of what we are familiar to see nowadays, it's brilliant that a movie like this maintains the spectator always curious and looking forward to see what will be decided in the end. also, it's notable the criticism during all discussions between characters to choose the destiny of a man's life. this is a masterpiece and a must-see. if you want a movie with content this is the one. the script was very well written and the subject is timeless.;10 June 2014;10;['pure', 'fair', 'familiar', 'brilliant', 'curious', 'notable'];0.431547619047619

1433;jordandan53;this film had to have been a risk to the producers. it was a film set almost entirely in one room, i believe there were only three scenes that took place out of it. it is hard to keep the attention of an audience with such a limited set, but this limited set was made up for with excellent dialogue and an intriguing story. the story is a very intricate mystery set in a jury room. there are no flashbacks or anything to show how the crime happened, as would have been the easy route. instead the script allows the characters to paint a picture of the crime in the minds of the viewers through outstanding dialogue. the dialogue never stops and the mystery only deepens. through this dialogue the characters reveal themselves to be a microcosm of society. it would be a difficult thing to not see oneself in at least one of the twelve characters portrayed. the script isn't the only thing that deserves credit, the cast brought these characters to life. without the genuine humanity that the actors brought with them no one would have cared about the responsibility placed on the shoulders of these twelve man as to whether a man should live or whether he should die. the camera work was also excellent. with such small confines it would seem difficult to come up with new shots, but the cameras explored just about every inch of the room. all in all this film is a great feel good movie about the american justice system and how it should really run. and how emotions can be the difference between one man living or dying. although i haven't seen every movie out there i believe that this is one of the best films ever made and deserves every bit of the praise that it has received over the last fifty some odd years.;5 January 2009;9;['hard', 'limited', 'excellent', 'intriguing', 'intricate', 'easy', 'outstanding', 'difficult', 'least', 'only', 'genuine', 'excellent', 'such', 'small', 'difficult', 'new', 'great', 'good', 'good', 'last', 'odd'];0.1944967532467532

1439;dmachop;it's a rarity to find such a film without any action, romance, comedy etc. and especially no commercial elements. well, you can see that it's made in 1957 and maybe that's the reason...?!! the movie starts with a scene in the court(as usual in some movies) where the accused has been proved guilty and given a death sentence for committing a murder. here comes the actual part of the film, where the scene now shifts to the jury room, where twelve men take part in a discussion. the beginning 20 minutes gives the details of jury member, how they're here. it's not so surprising that one decides the life of a boy/man by deciding him guilty or not guilty in order to get to a baseball game!!! as usual, you find an exceptional guy who keeps mum throughout the introduction of the movie(and steals the show for the rest of the part of the movie!!!). he's the only guy who said he thinks the boy was not guilty since there's a little doubt in the murder. and there it starts, the whole discussion takes place with a few breaks and at the end of vote count there seems to be increasing support for the boy being not guilty. however, there's a twist almost at the end of the film, where juror 3 and 4 tear apart the theories of the boy being not guilty. it's not the actual hero who proves the accused is not guilty, but watch for yourself. another one whose performance is to be mentioned is the role of lee.j.cobb who's also the executioner and shows up the emotional stress at the end, exceptional performance of the father!!! finally, i give the movie thumbs up if you're not a fan of action genres, but you enjoy a thrilling ride not through adventure but dialogs that's been crisp and provide a superb stroke of intelligence.;28 April 2009;10;['commercial', 'usual', 'guilty', 'actual', 'surprising', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'usual', 'exceptional', 'only', 'guilty', 'little', 'whole', 'few', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'actual', 'guilty', 'emotional', 'exceptional', 'crisp', 'superb'];-0.0410984848484848

1445;rickoteo;gripping, frustrating, and yet inspirational - 12 angry men is a compelling 1957 black-white courtroom film that showcases one juror's masterful negotiation process with eleven other disagreeing jurors. with a keen eye, one can easily observe a few techniques to bring to the table in their future negotiations and meetings. at the same time, readers of roger fisher's 1991 book, getting to yes would also find that many of his prescribed techniques can be observed in this film. 12 angry men was adapted from another screenplay written by reginald rose, and it tells the story of 12 jurors tasked with the duty to either convict or acquit an 18 year old boy accused of murdering his father after an argument. however, this task is complicated by the condition that the decision has to be unanimous. the film initially sees 11 out of the 12 jurors unanimously agree to convict the defendant. however, one juror (identified as 8) exclaims that there are reasonable doubts in the case, and subsequently builds on these doubts in his negotiation to finally convince the jury to acquit the defendant instead. this is a film that is recommended for anyone interested in understanding the workings of an efficient negotiation. negotiation is a fairly versatile process, and there are always alternatives that one can take to ensure that it is resolved with an agreement that satisfies all the parties involved;5 November 2017;10;['frustrating', 'inspirational', 'angry', 'compelling', 'black', 'white', 'masterful', 'other', 'keen', 'few', 'future', 'same', 'many', 'angry', 'convict', 'old', 'unanimous', 'reasonable', 'interested', 'efficient', 'versatile'];0.0598958333333333

1459;danieljemiologreen;i personally think the movie twelve angry men is better then the play. not just for the reasons that i like retro movies or that the acting was so bad it was kind-of funny. but for the fact that the movies plot connected to me in a way i don't think it connected with other people. because i have a thing for law and i think that this plot and this movie/play showed me a different side of law that isn't really talked about, but is a big part of the process. the reason i picked the movie over the play was that i guess my era is used and is attracted to movies more then to reading also that it was funny that the whole movie was 90 minutes of twelve men sitting in one room which got really boring but not as boring as the play. this might not be the best. another reason i don't like the play as much as the movie is that. i don't think everyone was interested as i was and didn't really follow along and when it came to their part to read i was ready and they weren't ready to read which was really boring. because yo9u would have to wait for them and i think i fell asleep a couple times. but overall the movie was way better then the play. if you're into law i think it's a must see. well before you see the remake. just for some laughs.;22 October 2010;7;['angry', 'well', 'bad', 'funny', 'other', 'different', 'big', 'funny', 'whole', 'boring', 'boring', 'good', 'interested', 'ready', 'ready', 'boring', 'well'];-0.1516666666666667
1460;babynana;"in the movie the 12 angry man, i didn't like the choices that the director made in the movie. first of all, the actors were overacting and they don't sound and their emotion doesn't look believable. for example, when the juror number 3 was having his moment talking about his kid who he ""made the man out of him"" by abusing him and later his kid punched him and ran away. his emotions and the way his voice sounded doesn't seem convincing to me. it seems to me like they are just reading their script out loud. secondly, the camera angle wasn't good. the camera was mostly close up and it was quite boring. you want the audience to look excited or interesting so they will pay more attention to the main points but this movie didn't do that much of a good job. for example, in the jury room, when they were voting one by one, the camera was close up to them that i didn't get to see the reaction on other juror faces when they were voting one by one. i think it will be good to see other juror face and trying to make eye contact with juror to change their vote. finally, the actor that they chose to play the role of the boy who was abused all his life and is a trouble maker, the actor looks nothing like his character in the play. so there fore i think the choices that the director made in this movie weren't that bright and it could have been better and more interesting.";21 October 2010;1;['angry', 'believable', 'convincing', 'good', 'close', 'boring', 'excited', 'interesting', 'more', 'main', 'much', 'good', 'close', 'other', 'good', 'other', 'bright', 'well', 'interesting'];0.2727777777777778
1461;mbarouk_23;i thought that the movie twelve angry men was great because of the way all the actors played their roles to perfection. this is a type of movie were no sound effects were use so it required the actors to really become the character they were portraying in the movie. something else that i like was at first mostly everyone said that the accused was guilty of the crime but then slowly the jurors began to change their minds except for one juror. some of the things that i didn't like was the way it was filmed in black and white because it cause me to have less attention towards it than i would have if i was watching a regular colored movie and also how the whole movie was just filmed in that one room and this did not allow us to see how the jurors lived their lives and acted around other people outside of a jury room. between the movie or the play i would say i like the movie more because i am more of a visual person i learn things faster like that but other than that i thought the movie was interesting because of the way it allowed me to see and believe that character were who they really were when i was reading the play.;22 October 2010;7;['angry', 'great', 'sound', 'guilty', 'black', 'white', 'less', 'regular', 'colored', 'whole', 'other', 'more', 'visual', 'other', 'interesting'];0.0583333333333333
1462;sahmed1;the movie twelve angry men was a good movie. the plot of the movie was good. it was interesting to watch. what i didn't like was the movie was black and white, the actors were not that good at acting, and there wasn't any woman juror in the movie. the interesting part was how everyone thought the boy is guilty at the first except no.8, without even thinking and knowing anything about the case. but they changed their mind after talking and arguing with each other. and it was surprising how the boy was described in the written play actually he is totally different. he looks like an innocent little boy in the movie. in the movie the acting wasn't so good for example how the jurors were arguing and talking, it looked fake. it's a 50's movie that's why the sound system wasn't that good either. also the jury room looked fake, how the inside of the room was. altogether the movie was good but i didn't like the way it was made. and the most important thing was there wasn't any action in the movie which didn't impress the audiences. but definitely i would say it was better than the actual written play. so you can see what's going on in the movie instead of reading and imagining on your head.;5 November 2010;8;['angry', 'good', 'good', 'interesting', 'black', 'white', 'good', 'interesting', 'guilty', 'first', 'other', 'surprising', 'different', 'innocent', 'little', 'good', 'fake', 'good', 'fake', 'good', 'important', 'well', 'actual'];0.2077651515151515
1463;olivadoti-mustafa;"the movie 12 angry men is a nice movie and i liked it. this movie is related to a murder case and the jurors are trying to find out if the son is guilty of his father's murder. the best part of the movie i liked is where juror #. 8 is the only one who votes the boy not guilty and the interesting part of the movie was where all the jurors sit by their numbers so they can point to the right juror for their opinion. after few minutes juror #. 8 tries to prove that the boy is not guilty. he also finds a similar knife that was found at the murder scene and everyone was shocked to see that knife because all jurors thought they don't sell that kind of knife anymore. the movie is more interesting to watch then read the play out of a book because it has the action in movie and the way they talk to each other. it is1950's movie but worth to watch it. the best part of the movie i liked where juror # 3 in anger was really going to stab juror #. 8, but all the jurors stands up and say ""wooohh"" and juror #. 3 stops and they go back to their seats. at the end of the movie everyone agrees that the boy is not guilty. this is a must watch movie specially who likes to watch drama movies.";24 October 2010;7;['angry', 'nice', 'guilty', 'good', 'only', 'guilty', 'interesting', 'right', 'few', 'guilty', 'similar', 'interesting', 'other', 'worth', 'good', 'guilty'];0.0475446428571428

1465;mgray91;twelve angry men was a very good movie, with good dialogue and an excellent cast. the cast had a lot of opposite personalities which made the dynamics on the movie very interesting to watch. although the audio was not as good as present day films and the dialogue was occasionally slow, the tension and interplay of the jurors quickly picked up again and kept your interest in the movie. it was amazing how one by one henry ford's character was able to convert all the other jurors over to a non-guilty verdict. it was really scary how all of the other 11 jurors wanted to vote guilty just to get the trial over with because they didn't want to be stuck at the courthouse. they all had better things to do, like go to a baseball game or visit with the friends and they didn't want to look to closely at the accuracy of the testimony, but henry ford's character made them take the time to think it through. watching the movie twelve angry men was much better than reading the written play because you could really see all the characters more clearly. the emotions, the tension and the frustration was so much more obvious in the film and came across so much more strongly than it did in written form. a movie that i would recommend to anyone who wants to sit down and watch and old black and white film with a strong cast of stars.;24 October 2010;7;['angry', 'good', 'good', 'excellent', 'opposite', 'interesting', 'good', 'present', 'slow', 'amazing', 'able', 'other', 'non', 'guilty', 'scary', 'other', 'guilty', 'well', 'angry', 'well', 'obvious', 'old', 'black', 'white', 'strong'];0.0916666666666666

1471;punkyper;"if you were born in the late 20th century as i, there is a good chance you haven't watched the best court room drama of all time, which i hereby insist that you must. the title alone may not even be known to most people, and that is a shame, because ""12 angry men"" is a fantastic movie that definitely deserves attention. the movie depicts the ongoing ruling of 12 jurors, eleven of which are convinced that the defendant is guilty, but are all met with the resistance of one juror determined to question what seems so obvious to the others. the merits of the case, and the movie, are clear. a young man is charged with murdering his father and the evidence against him is compelling. as both sides have given their closing arguments the jury retires to their chambers, and is faced with the decision of condemning a man to capital punishment. as the setting is set for the viewers and the different characters introduced, the actual course of the movie takes place, and it begins with a preliminary vote: guilty or not guilty. when the tone of agreement has been set, there are 11 votes ""guilty"" and 1 ""not guilty""; and as the 11 rests their eyes upon the one, juror #8, the movie unfolds in a uniquely interesting manner. juror #8(henry fonda) starts off with nothing to validate his position, other than saying that he does not want to sentence a young man to death before at least talking about it. and from that point on, the jurors begin to explore the case's circumstances, all the arguments and testimonies, and one by one starts to rethink their position on the issue. what makes this so interesting to watch, is that the movie's plot unfolds at the same pace it unfolds for the characters. apart from what was said during court, no information is held back, which puts the jurors in the same position as the viewers. this allows a deeper involvement in the movie, and creates a feeling that the viewer is uncovering the truth alongside the characters themselves. it almost feels like a detective/criminal investigation movie at times, and even though the movie ""suffers"" from old age and outdated cinematic effects, the suspense never ceases to exist. the excitement is also strongly affirmed by the growing tension between the jurors, many of which are greatly inconvenienced by their required presence. the feeling of claustrophobia grows larger, and as the persistence of juror #8 starts to affect some of the others, the viewer begins to understand the meaning of the title ""12 angry men"". as the title also suggests, the number of key characters is large, especially since they all appear on screen at all times. despite this the movie never seems to confuse the viewer with a clutter of characters. instead it constantly complements all of the jurors' presence, and never makes any of them feel expendable. this is achieved by presenting all the characters individually, but in such a seamless way that the viewer hardly notices that it's going on. this is also what helps emphasize the feeling of being on the same pace with the characters. as we learn more about the jurors, so do the jurors themselves. this process takes place throughout the entire movie, constantly evolving every character and makes it more and more clear, as to why everyone stands where they stand. all of these different things come together and deliver a weirdly subtle yet suspenseful drama, rich on both deep character involvement, and masterful writing. the movie appeals to the our sense of rational thinking, by making the characters question the circumstances of the case, while also making the viewer question them. on top of that ""12 angry men"" has a wide range of characters, and strikes a near impossible balance, of equalizing the importance of all of them, and thereby justifying their ongoing presence. this isn't a courtroom drama, this is the courtroom drama, and it sets the bar of which all other movies within the genre should be judged.";21 November 2011;9;['late', 'good', 'good', 'most', 'angry', 'fantastic', 'ongoing', 'guilty', 'obvious', 'clear', 'young', 'compelling', 'different', 'actual', 'preliminary', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'interesting', 'other', 'young', 'least', 'interesting', 'same', 'same', 'deep', 'detective', 'criminal', 'old', 'outdated', 'cinematic', 'many', 'large', 'angry', 'key', 'large', 'expendable', 'seamless', 'same', 'more', 'entire', 'more', 'clear', 'different', 'subtle', 'suspenseful', 'rich', 'deep', 'masterful', 'rational', 'angry', 'wide', 'near', 'impossible', 'ongoing', 'other'];0.0167366946778711

1513;tamzhermin;"the movie ""12 angry men"", offers insight into how negotiations can succeed even when the world is against you, as long as everybody takes a moment to talk. although the movie presents an extreme case of negotiating over a human life, a lot of parallels can be drawn onto our reality, where decisions can range from small to big. yet in every one of these decisions, it takes great courage to stand up for your beliefs when everybody else in the room can look so adamant about their views. but if one were to give up without trying, staying silent, or worse, conforming to the majority, can lead to regrettable decisions. each of the 12 characters in the movie, though there exist overlaps, reflects certain human behavioural archetypes that describes the various groups of people in one can find in society. overall, this movie shows how one can dismantle the points of others, even when they may be very adamant about their views in the beginning. oftentimes, this can be done by using the same points that are pointed out, and instead use those points against them by forcing them to reflect upon themselves and realising the areas that they had overlooked. in many ways, the 12 men in the movie reflect our inner thoughts as well, not just society as a whole. in almost every decision we make, our initial thoughts are often biased and full of prejudice. though it is not necessarily wrong to be prejudiced, since often times, they allow us to be efficient in our decision-making, it opens up many holes in our judgments, causing us to overlook things that appear obvious. hence, what we all need is a number 8, a voice in our heads that asks questions again and again, until we have a definitive answer. in fact, i believe that number 8 could very well have been convinced otherwise, and voted with the rest of the men eventually, but he would only have been satisfied if everyone gave their reasons convincingly, after discussions, and second thoughts.";18 October 2020;8;['angry', 'extreme', 'human', 'small', 'big', 'great', 'adamant', 'silent', 'bad', 'regrettable', 'certain', 'human', 'behavioural', 'various', 'adamant', 'same', 'many', 'inner', 'initial', 'biased', 'full', 'wrong', 'efficient', 'many', 'obvious', 'definitive', 'satisfied', 'second'];0.0430124223602484

1543;heartbreakk-643-416253;"12 angry men is a movie about a panel of jurors deciding if a young boy, accused of murder, was guilty or not. throughout this movie, the process of negotiation from the book ""getting to yes"" by roger fisher is applicable. during the first stage of negotiation, the situation is diagnosed. information is gathered, with hostile perceptions and self-interests being identified by the negotiating parties. most of the jurors' self-interests involved leaving the room and reaching a 'guilty' verdict quickly. coupled with the warm, uncomfortable room setting and other personal reasons, the jurors were likely to accede to the pressure of wanting to leave, making a hastily, undeliberated decision. initially, peer pressure and groupthink impaired a rational decision-making outcome. some were firm in their choices, raising their hands quickly to indicate a guilty vote, while others looked around the room first before slowly, hesitatingly raising their hands. the major obstacles include premature judgement, which was derived from not separating the people from the problem. the boy was from a slum background. however, some jurors perceived children from slums to be societal threats, having violent tendencies and bad behaviour. hence, they wanted the boy to be voted as guilty as it benefited society. in the first vote, juror 8 was the only one to vote 'not guilty', emphasising the importance of focusing on interest, not positions. standing by his principles of justice, he explained to the rest of the jurors that his core concern and interest was serving a fair trial. he maintained that he did not want to take a position on whether the boy was indeed guilty without a thorough cross-examination process and further discussion. following that, he acknowledged their interests of wanting to end the discussion and he proposed spending more time discussing about the issue at hand, rather than immediately deeming the accused as 'guilty'. his proposal was consistent with some of the other jurors' principles and values, such as juror 9, who agreed that there should be a longer discussion. juror 8 has also recognised and understood emotions displayed by the other jurors. for instance, he coaxes juror 7, who was feeling impatient to catch his yankees game, that it was possible to spend an hour without missing his game. during the planning stage, ideas to resolve the issue are being generated. at this point, some of the jurors already perceived the negotiation process with a common collective interest, on deriving a verdict based on principle and not pressure. they were more receptive of actively listening on plausible ideas on the boy being 'not guilty'. having objective criteria helped the jurors to focus on interests, not positions. the jurors were constantly reminded that if there was reasonable doubt on the boy's guilt, they should vote 'not guilty' unless otherwise. a fair procedure was involved. for example, all the jurors had to come to a common consensus of twelve 'not guilty' votes. if they were unable to come to a consensus, it implies a hung jury. all jurors had a chance to share about their perspectives, in a round-robin manner. this allowed everyone to have a feeling of participation and a stake in the verdict, with their interests being accounted for if they were stated explicitly. juror 8 constantly probes the other jurors who voted 'not guilty' why so. this allowed the jurors to think through their decision on whether it is rational. he does not attack their positions, but acknowledges that there could be a possibility that the boy may be guilty. one collaborative idea was the re-enactment of the eyewitness accounts, such as the old man claiming to notice the defendant escaping the murder scene. during the re- enactment, the jurors realised that the old man could not have reached the scene in the 15 seconds he had claimed in court. this convinced the remaining jurors that there may be reasonable doubt on whether the boy is indeed guilty, as the confessions may be false. during the discussion stage, differences in perceptions and feelings are acknowledged and addressed, resolving the conflict. the insistence on reaching a verdict was based on principle and not pressure is exemplified through juror 4, who wanted to be convinced based on logic and facts. furthermore, when juror 3 still insists that the boy is guilty, juror 8 wanted to hear his arguments as he was not convinced. hence, the differences in perceptions and feelings are made explicit. it was clear that juror 3's judgment was impaired due to a personal conflict with his son. emphasising with the other parties' emotions is also key to separate people from the problem. even though facts are important, empathy is more crucial. it is paramount to recognise that the other parties have emotions, deeply held values, and different backgrounds and viewpoints and as such may be prone to cognitive biases and prejudice (page 28). one explicit example was juror 10. when he started ranting about how slum children were dangerous, the rest of the jurors turned away from him, remaining silent. it was evident from his emotional outburst that he had a ""personal prejudice"" against slum children and their social background. reactive emotions are not convincing in a negotiation. the displays of anger by juror 3 too made his stand less convincing. the jurors tend to not be receptive of what he said. in conclusion, 12 angry men illustrates how successful negotiations often require careful analysis of different perspectives and arguments put forward. emotions and positions should be separated to reach an objective outcome, satisfying all parties' interests and needs.";29 March

1544;lonevisitor;the plot of (12 angry men) is incredibly splendid. and also the choosing of this subject generally and this specific case. even though this movie is very simple from production wise, such kind of dialog is almost impossible to do it perfectly. i mean writing an ideal script of 12 people in one scene in this way is amazing by all of these people who are from very different backgrounds and don't know each other. also they not just chatting or hanging out, they are working in very difficult conflict which they have to solve in in one season. the several transitions and changes in this long scene is so flawless and smooth in a way that you would definitely believe it is all logical and so reasonable. furthermore, the performance of the main character who is (juror #12) is perfect and i like so much because of is ability of convincing other people and how he used a careful plan to clarify his opinion and the required tools for that.;20 March 2014;9;['angry', 'splendid', 'specific', 'simple', 'such', 'impossible', 'ideal', 'amazing', 'different', 'other', 'difficult', 'several', 'long', 'flawless', 'logical', 'reasonable', 'main', 'perfect', 'other', 'careful'];0.1441666666666666

1546;leowty;"the movie ""12 angry men"" provides an effective illustration of how effective negotiation can be led and carried out. it was a demonstration of skillful negotiation technique that by judge 8 that allow him to achieve success. the key takeaway is to always understand the perspective of the other party. as mentioned by sebenius in the book ""getting to yes"", people tend to be hardwired to focus on their own position in an argument (2001). over-commitment to this position will tend to lead to self-serving bias, where information is unconsciously interpreted in a self-serving way. this is especially so when they do not understand the different perspectives. as seen in the 12 angry men, understanding the perspective of the other party is key to a successful negotiation (fisher, ury, & patton, 2011). in the movie, all the jurors have the common interest of wanting justice to be served. juror 8 understood this and utilized it to his advantage. he asked for a discussion and was able to understand the other jurors' decision-making thought process. this allowed him to address the key issue directly, seen by his questioning of the witness's ability to hear in the presence of a passing train (jurors 5 and 6) and rationalizing the boy's weak alibi (jurors 4). this allows for the reduction of the area of conflict, increasing support for his argument. fundamentally, juror 8 was able to convince the other jurors by appealing to their shared interest of wanting justice to be served and addressing their concerns. this could only be achieved by understanding the different perspectives.";3 November 2019;10;['angry', 'effective', 'effective', 'skillful', 'key', 'other', 'own', 'different', 'angry', 'other', 'key', 'successful', 'common', 'able', 'other', 'key', 'weak', 'able', 'other', 'different'];0.0723684210526315

1552;jameshetfield2;"""12 angry men""'s brilliance doesn't lie in special effects or razzle dazzle. it is, by all accounts, a simple, straight-forward film that is beautifully scripted and perfectly acted in its portrayal of twelve male jurors deciding the fate of a latino boy on trial for the murder of his father. the case seems obvious with a weapon and eyewitness accounts, and the initial vote is 11-1. one juror, mr. davis, certainly has doubts of the boy's innocence but he has enough doubt of his guilt and a sense of responsibility to talk it out as their decision could result in the death penalty for this young man. in his time, henry fonda gave magnificent performance upon magnificent performance. i doubt any list of the best actors of the the last 100 years could possibly be considered complete without him. as mr. davis, fonda is nothing short of brilliant. yet, his brilliance here is an under-stated brilliance. it is not a showy performance or a histrionic performance or a dramatic performance. fonda plays one man, juror #8...an architect, who is capable of calm reason and calmly reasons that the facts may not be what they seem. perhaps the reason fonda was passed over for an oscar nomination here is that he was so normal, so everyday that he didn't even appear to be acting. brilliance. simply brilliance.

1560;ayushman-basu;i don't know whether i will give any movie a 10 on 10 rating ever in my life again, but 12 angry men is such a movie even a whole 10 is an understatement to describe it's magnitude and brilliance. i strictly follow the imdb top 250 list and i have made it my personal mission to see and understand each one of them to the best of my ability. so obviously when i saw 'the shawshank redemption' on number one i saw it and gained a perception that it was the most complete and meticulous movie i have ever seen. but that was until the day i witnessed '12 angry men'. personally, i am not a very big admirer of court room drama or anything related to court room drama. there are very few court room dramas which i like. so i wanted to try this movie out as i heard a lot from my fellow movie buffs. black and white picture and the camera rolled on filming each and every corner of the new york city courthouse. from the initial scenes i thought that i was in for a boring court room drama. but i was kind of optimistic when the scene of court room was over in some minutes and the 12 jury members came into the room. from there i was mesmerized. short, crisp, witty, and outstanding are some of the adjectives which i can use. the way the movie portrays the differing mindsets of the jury members and especially my personal favorite juror number 5 played by lee.j.cobb, it gives the movie a different and unusual edge which i don't find in other dramas. it will be cruel of me to compare 'shawhshank redemption' and '12 angry men' but when it is a matter of ranking there must be some aspects where the both can be compared. both of the movies are excellent in their own ways. but, for me 12 angry men takes the edge over shawshank redemption in the area of script and idea. shawshank redemption spans over a variety of areas and characters which in itself gives the movie an edge over others, although i am not questioning the acting capabilities of morgan freeman and tim robbins. i was engrossed and enthusiastic throughout the whole movie and it gripped me. but to create that same effect in a small and claustrophobic room of a courthouse is according to me a much more arduous. 12 angry men doesn't have a huge surrounding which elevates the viewers experience of seeing the movie apart from the dialogues. it only had 12 rational, emotional, and sweaty jurors who were in an intense deliberation of murder case. another small fact which i noticed in the movie was the close up shot of the young boy whose trial was going on. that shot must have lasted for only seconds, but those that small face shot captured the sadness, bewilderment, abhorrence and insecurity of the boy. for me, that small scene was one of the best schtick i have ever seen. although i have no problem with seeing long movies which span for 3 to 4 hours, but i got my so called 'viewer's satisfaction' in one and almost two hours on seeing 12 angry men and that too to an extent a little more gratification than 'shawshank redemption'. for me, 12 angry men till now is the best flick i have seen till date. i am waiting for such a film who can knock this one from the mantle. till then, next time.;24 July 2013;10;['angry', 'whole', 'personal', 'good', 'complete', 'meticulous', 'angry', 'big', 'few', 'fellow', 'black', 'white', 'initial', 'boring', 'optimistic', 'short', 'crisp', 'witty', 'outstanding', 'personal', 'favorite', 'different', 'unusual', 'other', 'cruel', 'angry', 'excellent', 'own', 'angry', 'enthusiastic', 'whole', 'same', 'small', 'claustrophobic', 'arduous', 'angry', 'huge', 'rational', 'emotional', 'intense', 'small', 'close', 'young', 'only', 'small', 'small', 'good', 'long', 'angry', 'more', 'angry', 'good', 'next'];-0.0039930555555555

1566;GauravKochar;it is an understatement to say that it is a great movie. the plot and the story takes the cake. there are no expensive cars, big houses, and stuff on display, but whats needed in the film are right there in place - the actors. watching it in 2013, where we have multi continent shooting and heavy expenditure incurred on accessories of fake illusions of characters, this film has been shot in almost the same room where the jury members decide the fate of an accused. the 96 minutes that you spend watching the film will definitely change the way you think (if you do think that way). a simple yet very effective story that runs like a knife in butter, smooth as silk and crisp as a nut. it is must watch for all and sundry. to sum it up, it is one of those movies that you will not only enjoy watching, but enjoy recommending as well :);31 August 2013;9;['great', 'expensive', 'big', 'multi', 'continent', 'heavy', 'fake', 'same', 'simple', 'effective', 'smooth', 'crisp'];0.085
1567;penfrasha3;i've seen this movie at least a dozen times, but never tire of watching it. i think it should be a requirement that this movie be seen by every jury, before jury deliberations begin. it is a blueprint for how it should be done. if all juries watched it, i think it would help them to really think about all the facts presented, and help them be better jurors. they could not help but to consciously fight against preconceived opinions and prejudices within themselves and from others. lee j. cobb just rips my heart out, and i cry right along with him at the end, every time. it is obvious that the majority of imdb voters are youngsters with computers and internet access, who probably have never even seen classics like this, as evidenced by the huge difference in the number of votes cast. in the hundred thousand range for movies like lord of the rings, and in the twenty thousand range for this movie. mind blowing special effects in lord of the rings, and just twelve men in a room talking, in twelve angry men. one of the best movies ever made.;21 January 2005;10;['least', 'well', 'preconceived', 'obvious', 'huge', 'special', 'angry', 'good'];0.1095238095238095

1593;ktjeerdsma;12 angry men is a film that takes place entirely in the jury room of the deliberation on a murder case. with the finest of acting, this film guides the audience through the details concerning the murder. at first, the jury box is almost overwhelmingly against the suspect. however, through unbiased questioning of by one of jurors (the only one that is truly unbiased) the audience is quickly drawn in as they realize that it is not the suspect that is on trial, but rather personal bias. this movie is sheer genius and will thrill the audience as they begin to ask questions such as what do we know and how do we know it. this is truly a great film.;5 January 2010;10;['angry', 'fine', 'unbiased', 'only', 'unbiased', 'personal', 'sheer', 'such', 'great'];0.1023809523809523
1594;george-xanthidis;due to the age of this movie, i was skeptical when i first approached it. i see that in some cases, movies of a certain age are held on a pedestal even though they have either been bested or have not aged well. thankfully, this movie is neither. 12 angry men is a premise that is not easily done. a movie that takes place mostly in one room is not that exceptional, but 12 angry men is handicapped even further because we know nothing about the characters, not even their names. nevertheless, the cinematography, writing and acting in this movie are nearly flawless, and have aged like fine wine. having said all this, the movie is not without errors. the writing feels to be forced at some points of the movie, and the leaps in logic are sometimes hard to fully get behind. nevertheless, 12 angry men is one of the best examples of how timeless a movie can be, and how limitations can help a film become a masterpiece.;17 December 2015;9;['skeptical', 'certain', 'angry', 'exceptional', 'angry', 'flawless', 'fine', 'hard', 'angry', 'good'];0.070595238095238

1623;vishad;"it is not often that you come across a thriller movie with no action sequences that blows you away, but that's where the brilliance of screenwriter reginald rose comes in play. the movie is set in a single room where 12 jurors are locked until a decision is made on an apparent 'open and shut' murder case. in the process, the movie touches on several pressing issues: why it is important to question the obvious; troubling sense of priorities of men who value attending a baseball game more than the life of a man; how questioning the facts, eliminating possibilities and being unprejudiced are the necessary qualities of a decision maker. the movie brings to the table 12 men of varied characters and lays bare each one in the limited screen time through just dialogue and no use of flashbacks. even before the debate starts, we get a sense of an impending situation of a deadlock with the clever hints of a hot afternoon, faulty air conditioning, a locked room all adding to claustrophobia. lumet used special lenses which make the room appear smaller than it actually was and throughout the course of the film adjusted the lenses to make he room appear even smaller, adding even further to the claustrophobia. a masterful performance by lee j cobb playing a self righteous juror having troubles with his teenager son steals the show as he acts as a nemesis to henry fonda, who also gave a wonderful performance. a perfect mixture of writing, direction, camera-work and acting make this movie a masterpiece of film making.";15 August 2016;10;['single', 'apparent', 'open', 'several', 'pressing', 'important', 'obvious', 'troubling', 'more', 'unprejudiced', 'necessary', 'varied', 'bare', 'limited', 'just', 'impending', 'clever', 'hot', 'faulty', 'locked', 'special', 'small', 'small', 'masterful', 'righteous', 'wonderful', 'perfect'];0.2294973544973545

1633;gentryphillips;"the film ""12 angry men"" is an amazingly written classic film from the year 1957. this wonderfully created suspense drama is about a jury of 12 men that must come to a unanimous decision to either send an 18 year old boy to the electric chair or to let him free. the young man was placed on trial after supposed evidence was found and eye witnesses saw him murder his father with a knife. at the beginning of the jury meeting, 11 jurors immediately vote to send the boy to the electric chair, while the twelfth is simply hesitant to send the boy to his death without talking about it. angrily and almost against their will, they discuss the murder case and all the events that take place, and slowly but surely find reasonable doubt in all aspects of the ""evidence."" for example, 2 witnesses were brought to the court to testify against the boy. one witness saw the murder from across the street as a train was passing by, and the other was in a room below and heard the scream as someone yelled ""i'm going to kill you!"" as the jury discussed both aspects of the witnesses, they decided that it was impossible for the witness below to hear the murder taking place as a train was going by right outside the window. as more and more doubts filled the room, one by one, the jury members started changing their votes to not guilty. each member of the jury has a different back ground and each seem to find a personal connection to a different member within the trial. one juror has glasses and identifies with the eye witness who also wears glasses but realizes that when she saw the murder from her bed while looking out the window, she probably wouldn't have been wearing her glasses which would have made it very difficult to see. another juror is a father with a bad relationship with his son. he identifies the most with the murder victim who was stabbed ""supposedly"" by his own son. he tends to be more ruthless with the young man on trial and is the very last juror to change his vote to not guilty. i think that this strategy naturally makes the audience try to identify with one of the characters. we tend to ask ourselves, if i were in this situation, who would i be? would i vote guilty or not guilty? we all like to think that we would be the first one to vote not guilty. compassion wins the star role in this film. there may be many different kinds of moral statutes that the film makers lead the audience to believe, but they all tie back into this one simple concept. one of our greatest and most noble examples of compassion is the biblical reference to jesus christ. in some ways, this movie can be related to that seeing as the main character can be seen as a savior for the young man on trial, but because of the very real human element in the film, this is clearly the exact opposite. the first juror may have all the compassion in the world but that just simply doesn't do it justice. he must also convince his fellow 11 apostles to have this same kind of compassion which eventually saves this young boys life. compassion is what makes the audience identify with the main character, not justice. if all 12 jurors had walked into the room, quickly voted that the evidence was good and that this boy was without a doubt the killer then it wouldn't have been in justice or ruthless in the least. after all in the minds of 12 imperfect people, this was a case where the killer was proved guilty. granted the movie would have no plot and it wouldn't have been nominated for 3 academy awards, but it would have been just in the eyes of the legal system. so why does the audience vote for this random act of compassion? is it just? this film has been numbered among the great drama classics in history. not because of its amazing cgi ability to make super robots fight aliens, nor its megan fox type lead female role, but because of the film makers ability to creatively persuade its audience to be morally upright. we as americans are always trying to better ourselves. it's in our blood. however, sometimes we try to focus more on the qualities that will benefit ourselves, instead of helping other people. we try to lose weight, we try to be funnier, be interesting. all of these things are great to a certain extent, but what these brilliant film writers are doing is trying to help us realize is that being american is not about us. it's about helping us to become our best selves in order to help other people. sure, being determined, skilled compassionate, etc. can help us personally, but how can we take these personal strengths and apply them to be the best americans we can be? the main character said it best when he announced, ""wouldn't you want someone to do the same for you if you were in his position?"" the room may have been silent, but the audience already knows the answer to that question. the ""anger"" portion of this movie is not so much anger as it is a character development struggle to become a better more compassionate individual. the argument in this film is one that we lack in today's modern cinema. if the new and upcoming film makers want to learn from history, then they need to take a blast to the past because films like these teach us to be american, be just, but more importantly, to be compassionate.";6 December 2015;9;['angry', 'classic', 'unanimous', 'old', 'electric', 'free', 'young', 'electric', 'twelfth', 'hesitant', 'reasonable', 'other', 'impossible', 'more', 'more', 'guilty', 'different', 'back', 'personal', 'different', 'difficult', 'bad', 'most', 'own', 'ruthless', 'young', 'last', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'first', 'guilty', 'many', 'different', 'moral', 'simple', 'great', 'noble', 'biblical', 'main', 'young', 'real', 'human', 'exact', 'first', 'fellow', 'same', 'young', 'main', 'good', 'ruthless', 'least', 'imperfect', 'guilty', 'legal', 'random', 'great', 'amazing', 'super', 'female', 'upright', 'other', 'funny', 'interesting', 'great', 'certain', 'brilliant', 'american', 'good', 'other', 'skilled', 'compassionate', 'personal', 'good', 'main', 'same', 'silent', 'much', 'compassionate', 'modern', 'new', 'upcoming', 'american', 'compassionate'];0.0815568954854669

1662;rishgoyell;succinct, extremely intriguing and enlightening, 12 angry men revolves around a jury of twelve men who are tasked with the responsibility of deciding the fate of a young boy charged with the murder of his father. the movie, almost completely shot in a small jury room, manages to keep the viewer engaged throughout. the movie begins at the end of the trial, where the judge solicits a unanimous decision from the jury and sends them off to discuss the case. an initial vote, reveals that eleven out of the twelve men are convinced that the boy stabbed his father to death, beyond any reasonable doubt. only one man persists with the vote of not guilty, much to the consternation of others. his sole purpose being to have a proper debate before sending a man to his grave. the movie follows the course of the discussion, as it evolves and the evidence and testimonies are carefully scrutinized. preconceived notions, prejudices and personal histories rise to the fore making things complicated. the movie brings out the fallacies of the jury system and at the same time questions the reliability of testimonies and other such evidence. it also preaches the virtue of standing up for what one feels and at the same time accommodating others point of view. putting aside ones biases and examining facts objectively is shown to be a praiseworthy trait. some brilliant acting performances and a great story-line make it an absolute must watch. the aggression and temper of lee j. cobb is well contrasted with the calm and open-mindedness of juror number 8 played by henry fonda. the meticulous logic applied by e.g. marshall's character, the insensitivity shown by jack warden's and the huffing- puffing ed begley are all quite believable. this short drama left me mesmerized and wanting for more. a movie not to be missed.;11 August 2016;9;['succinct', 'intriguing', 'enlightening', 'angry', 'young', 'small', 'unanimous', 'initial', 'reasonable', 'guilty', 'much', 'sole', 'proper', 'personal', 'same', 'other', 'such', 'same', 'praiseworthy', 'brilliant', 'great', 'absolute', 'contrasted', 'calm', 'open', 'meticulous', 'believable', 'short', 'more'];0.1184782608695652

1676;leonardx-41760;"""12 angry men"" depicts a negotiation among a jury in the 1950s in the united states. the negotiation is regarding a patricide case where the defendant will be issued the death penalty if found guilty. the play revolves around the opinions, perceptions, reason and logic of twelve different characters that are tasked with pronouncing the guilt or innocence of a 16-year-old boy accused of patricide. in his closing statement, the judge instructed the jury that a ""guilty"" verdict can only be delivered in the absence of a reasonable doubt and they had to arrive at a unanimous decision before they could present the verdict to him. some of the notable interests identified in the course of negotiations came from jurors #3, #7 and #10. after the jury was tied at six to six, juror #8 brings up the the testimony of the arresting police officer and juror #5 contests the claim that the defendant had the competency to inflict the chest wound on the deceased. as the discussion went on, juror #7 decided to change his vote to ""break it up"" and swing it to 7 to 5 in favour of ""not guilty"" because he got jaded and was more interested in attending a baseball game in which he had tickets for. therefore, his interest was for negotiations to end quickly. juror #10 despised people from the slums and his attitude suggested that the defendant probably deserved the death penalty. clouded by his prejudice against the defendant, he completely disregarded the notion of justice. in his final monologue when the jury was 11 to 1 in favour of ""not guilty"", we observe that juror #3 was the last to ""break"". this happened only after his emotional outbursts of anger was shown from the broken relationship and hurt he felt from his own son. therefore, his interests showed that he was confused about his position as to whether the boy deserved the death penalty as he made a call based on the personal hurt that he had experienced. in conclusion, 12 angry men is a classic movie which proves why the american trial-by-jury system is effective in helping the judge mete out a verdict. it showcases the great diversity in america and the several challenges it produces. fisher also points out the importance of having various experts and professions' perspectives and opinions which will help to examine the problem.";11 November 2016;8;['angry', 'patricide', 'guilty', 'different', 'old', 'guilty', 'reasonable', 'unanimous', 'notable', 'deceased', 'guilty', 'interested', 'final', 'guilty', 'last', 'emotional', 'broken', 'own', 'confused', 'personal', 'angry', 'classic', 'american', 'effective', 'great', 'several', 'various'];-0.0243055555555555

1678;yeshasdaman;although 12 angry men does not explicitly show all these four aspects, the protagonist of the movie, juror 8 applied several negotiation techniques that accommodates the needs and requirements of that individual and scenario. in most of the scenarios that he is put in and has to deal with, he makes most use of the first two aforementioned aspects, the separation of people from the problem and, focusing on the interests and not positions. at the start of the movie we see that the only juror 8 has not been swayed or influenced due to his past conflicts or prejudices he holds. the movie shows us the true power of negotiating, one man managed to convince 11 other men who were at first staunchly against the idea of the defendant being not guilty. the main aspects of negotiation that he employs is the act of separating the people from the problems and the focus on interests. for example, we see that when juror 8 is challenging testimonies that police officers and witnesses gave he comes across some backlash from the rest of his fellow jurors. but he keeps a calm head and steady composure despite the attacks from the rest. he also makes sure that everyone gets their equal say. if someone comes across as stubborn or just unreasonable he tries to break down their point of view by asking them questions and understanding why they think that way about the problem i.e he is focusing on the interests of the person and not the position he is. as mentioned above, juror 8 keeps everyone focused on topic throughout their discussion. he always finds the underlying interests and reasons behind everyone's position as well. while other jurors such as 3 and 10 kept on antagonizing people and basing their judgments from their old experiences. in fact juror 8 even takes over the job of the foreman and manages to keep everyone on topic. this movie can mostly be seen as critique on american thinking and their law system at the time. several of the jurors just want end the discussion as soon as possible and just send the boy off to his death. but juror 8 would scold them for not taking the discussion seriously and asking them to put themselves in the shoes of the defendant on the verge of death row. here it is important to note that sometimes interests may be better off ignored juror 7 wanting to go to his ball game, juror 10 rambling on some unrelated story and the two jurors who were trying to do business instead of focusing on the topic. of course, positions need to be ignored as well. for example juror 5 was raised in a poor neighborhood and wants to be separated from that fact. he doesn't want to be labelled in that manner and be on similar social standings as the rest of the jurors. we can say that juror 5 basically embodies the aspect of interest, not position. the tactics used by juror 8 can also be analyzed quite thoroughly throughout the movie. his task of convincing 11 other people who were against him seemed like quite the insurmountable task. however, once he managed to get juror 9 to switch to his side despite the initial early criticism and attacks from the other jurors. the jurors are seen to be very easily swayed by the peers and just seem to go with the flow. juror 8 uses this to advantage and once he got juror 9 to his side it was easy to bring more and more people to see that the non-guilty verdict. we also see that sometimes even when juror 8's argument is not very convincing. when he tries to prove that the defendant may have forgotten the name of the movie just due to some emotional stress. he tries to test juror 4 on this but juror 4 names the first film and almost gets the name of the second film. here we see that juror 8 is now quite reliant on negotiation tactics and the evidence for the innocence of the defendant is actually decreasing and there is no massive evidence for realizing that he is truly innocent. another interesting point that i noticed about this movie is that the batna best alternative to negotiated agreement for both groups is actually a hung jury, in fact the only option. however, juror 8 did not want this as it would put him in a disadvantageous situation so he decided on pushing for the votes and wanted to get as many people on his side as fast as he could. if the jurors who really thought the boy was guilty had just waited out, they would have reached a hung jury and probably land the defendant a guilty verdict. there are often times in our everyday life that we are negotiating with someone else. this may be talking to the cashier at a drinks stall about the wrong price being charged or to a professor asking him to shift the deadline or change a grade. from the many classes we had so far, reading getting to yes and watching 12 angry men, i have learnt to appreciate the importance of negotiations in our daily life and how much easier it could be made with the application of it.;13 November 2016;9;['angry',

1697;temporarilyinspired;"many aspects of negotiation can be seen in the film, such as having opposing opinions which cause conflicts to arise, and as a result, being unable to reach a consensus in the beginning. with reference to roger fisher and william ury's ""getting to yes"", we are able to see some of their principles of negotiation being employed in the film. more specifically, we can identify 3 major themes that are good principles of negotiation and are portrayed throughout the film. these themes are focusing on people, dealing with interests instead of positions and using objective standards to negotiate their stands. the most apparent example of focusing on people instead of the problem is the approach that juror 8 takes in the discussion among the jurors. juror 8 tries to understand the different perspectives of each juror. he encourages each of the other 11 jurors to vocalize their reasons for voting guilty. this allowed everyone to participate in the decision-making process, with everyone being aware of each other's viewpoint. by doing this, he was able to step into each juror's shoes and view the case from their perspective. this gave him the ability to identify any inconsistencies or fallacies in their beliefs that the defendant was guilty. for example, he convinced juror 4 to change his vote to ""not guilty"" by demonstrating that juror 4 himself would not be able to remember what movie he watched in great detail, much less the defendant who was under considerable stress then. understanding each stakeholder's perspective in the decision making process is critical to coming to a collective, informed decision. furthermore, juror 8 constantly tries to manage the emotions and encourage objective communication between the jurors. juror 8 understood that many of the jurors were emotionally involved due to various personal reasons, and the sweltering heat did little to help ease the tension that was rising in the room. some of the jurors were impatient and agitated, with some of them occasionally flaring up when they lost their tempers. juror 8 recognized these emotions and allowed them to vent their frustration while he maintained his composure and refrained from reacting to their emotional outbursts. for instance, he allowed juror 3 to express his frustrations without interrupting him, and this eventually led to juror 3 realizing his own biasedness due to his anger towards his son. the open communication as the deliberation progressed helped in creating more effective discussion, which led to less misunderstanding and a more informed decision. the foreman of the jury also encouraged the jurors to listen actively and acknowledge the opinions of the others, creating a healthy environment where people could share their opinions and the reasons for taking a ""guilty"" or ""not guilty"" stand. in the film, we can see juror 8 making an effort to understand the interests of the different jurors. each juror was asked to share his opinion to allow everyone to understand their interests, so that the jury could come to an informed decision. initially, all but juror 8 hastily jumped to the conclusion that the defendant was guilty of murdering his father. understanding the interests of the other jurors helped juror 8 come up with arguments that tackled the problem from each juror's perspective. we can apply the concept of ""being concrete but flexible"" proposed by ury and fisher, where we should treat opinions that we formulate as simply illustrative, with the final decisions being made later. juror 8 was hard on the problem but soft on the people, giving positive support to the jurors' opinions equal in strength to the vigor that we emphasize the problem with. reaching a decision that is undisputed can be achieved when all parties involved in the decision-making process view the process as respectful and fair. at the end of the film, the jury comes to a unanimous decision that is respected by every juror because juror 8 successfully plants a seed of doubt in every other juror. in the film, we can also see that the basis of the arguments for ""not guilty"" were objective, rather than being based on individuals' subjective reasoning. this can be seen when juror 8 challenges the validity of the eyewitness testimonies presented to them. juror 8 astutely points out flaws in the claims made by the 2 eyewitnesses. he utilizes objective measures to analyze the given evidence to sway the few jurors who were convinced that the defendant was guilty based on the eyewitness accounts alone. for example, he proves that the old man would never have been able to reach the door in the time that he claimed he did by making use of the floor plan of his apartment. as such, all the jurors were able to engage in an objective reanalysis of the evidence and individually challenge their own opinions. there was also a focus on the facts of the case, rather than emotions of the individual jurors, which made the decision making more objective and the final decision more accurate. using objective standards is an effective way in making sure that the discussion is conducted in a fair and unbiased manner. in conclusion, throughout the film of 12 angry men, we can see the principles of negotiation from ury and fisher's ""getting to yes"". a negotiation that started out as hostile and focused on attacking the person, developed into one that focused on the objective facts and evidence of the case, and where people's interests and opinions were understood. despite not knowing whether the defendant was guilty, juror 8 manages to convince the other 11 jurors that there was reasonable doubt and this led to the unanimous verdict of ""not guilty"".";24 March

1698;leow-47731;this movie shows twelve men, serving as a panel of juror on a case of a boy charged with murder of his father. the twelve men had to make an unanimous decision by voting to decide the verdict of the 10-year old boy. 11 out of 12 voted that the accused was guilty but juror 8 voted otherwise. the vote by juror 8 stirred unhappiness among others as he was the only one who voted the accused not guilty. when pursued by others to explain his choice, he strongly believed that the boy might be innocent and should be given the benefit of doubt. the life of the boy lies in the hands of the 12 jurors and it should not be taken too lightly. juror 8 felt and wanted to have a discussion over the case and to reconsider the evidence presented in court. through several discussions using principled negotiations, and proving that the evidence were flawed, juror 8 managed to turn the table and convince all the other jurors to vote otherwise - accused voted not guilty of the murder. he felt that there was reasonable doubt not to convict the boy guilty and his determination had served to prove that it is important to separate the people from the problems by eliminating emotions. throughout the movie, there were several quarrels and exchange of words during the discussions but juror 8 kept his mind cool and stayed calm, handling the situation well by not letting other jurors to put him down.;25 March 2017;8;['unanimous', 'old', 'guilty', 'only', 'guilty', 'innocent', 'several', 'principled', 'other', 'guilty', 'reasonable', 'guilty', 'important', 'several', 'cool', 'calm', 'other'];-0.0266666666666666
1699;randz-91492;"12 angry men is a classic example of an effective case of negotiation. the movie tells a story about 12 juries deliberating a decision of either ""guilty"" or ""not guilty"" regarding a child defendant who is accused of murdering his father. juror 8 starts the whole negotiation process by voting ""not guilty"" due to his reasonable doubt and requesting the room to deliberate their decision before sending the defendant to the chair. the movie illustrates good negotiation practices and tactics that eventually led to a dramatic change of votes from 11-1 in favor of ""guilty"" to a unanimous ""not guilty"" by the end of the negotiation. i will write a review on ""12 angry men"" with reference to roger fisher's (1987) ""getting to yes"" and his four principles: separating people from problem (people), focus on interest rather than positions (interest), generate variety of options before settling on an agreement (options) and using the agreement made based on objective criteria (criteria). fisher (1987) elaborates his principle on ""people"" by exploring three different factors that prevent a successful negotiation: perception, emotions and communication. the movie aptly illustrates this ""people"" issue with regards to perception and emotions. perception often proves to be the main problem during a negotiation process as people's past experiences may affect their way of thinking which then affect their decisions. in the movie, juror 10 blatantly condemns the poor people living in slums and he negatively stereotypes them by claiming that ""these people are born to lie"", ""they don't need any excuse to kill someone"" and ""human life doesn't mean as much to them as it is to us"". eventually, the rest of the jury turned their back on him and at that moment, he realized that he has let his negative perception took over him and therefore, is unfit to be a juror of a court. the other factor that affects a negotiation is emotions. as fisher (1987) puts it: ""in a negotiation, particularly in a bitter dispute, feelings may be more important than talk"". people often respond with anger or fear when they feel threatened and excessive emotions will cloud their judgment leading to greater conflict or bad decisions. one clear example is juror 3 who is very emotional about the case as his relationship with his child caused him to declare that misbehaved children must be taught a lesson. he then turns a blind eye against all the logical explanations that the room has presented. eventually, he breaks down at the end of the movie to finally give in to his reasoning and to acknowledge his flawed reasoning due to his emotions. as i mentioned at the start of the review, as a classic, this movie is one of my favorite movie of negotiation and it displays all the essential elements of negotiation very well.";25 March 2017;9;['angry', 'classic', 'effective', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'whole', 'guilty', 'reasonable', 'good', 'dramatic', 'guilty', 'unanimous', 'guilty', 'angry', 'objective', 'different', 'successful', 'main', 'past', 'poor', 'human', 'much', 'negative', 'unfit', 'other', 'bitter', 'important', 'threatened', 'excessive', 'great', 'bad', 'clear', 'emotional', 'blind', 'logical', 'flawed', 'favorite', 'essential'];-0.0654411764705882
1700;bryanng-18958;"despite being filmed entirely in a room, 12 angry men succinctly portrays the difficulties and the different dynamics involved in reaching consensus between individuals with a range of personalities. the movie involves 12 jurors, having to decide on a unanimous decision if the defendant is guilty of stabbing his father to death. mirroring some of the negotiations techniques as exemplified in roger fisher's and william ury's ""getting to yes"", the film shows how such techniques could be used to achieve a common understanding and decision. in this review, i will seek to explore three of the good principles of negotiations according to fisher and ury and how they are utilized in the film, namely focusing on interests, separating the people from the problem and the use of an objective standard to negotiate. initially, upon settling down in the discussion room, all but one juror, juror 8, jumped to the conclusion that the defendant was guilty for murdering his father without much discussion. since the decision had to be unanimous between the jurors, they had to negotiate with each other to find out about their respective viewpoints. in these first few scenes of the film, negotiating through the emphasis on the interest of the different parties was clearly exemplified where juror 8 suggested that each juror could present their opinion and evidences on why each of them felt that the defendant was guilty. in doing so, the interests of the different jurors could be better understood. in this round the table discussion, the idea of ""being hard on the problem and soft on the people"" was clearly reflected where juror 8 committed himself to his interest of achieving a fair and just verdict for the defendant and thus, strongly advocated his interest by constantly created opportunities for constructive discussions to occur between jurors. by targeting the problem and not the rest of the jurors, the rest of the jurors did not feel threatened and hence, was more willing to listen to what each other had to say about the case, which further led to more constructive discussions. an extension to this idea would be ""placing the problem before the answer"". after hearing each of the juror's perspective on the evidence present in the case, juror 8 questioned the validity of some of the evidence raised before giving objective reasons on why some of these evidences may not be as foolproof as some may think. as such, he successfully justifies his reasons for why he feels that the defendant could be potentially not guilty.";26 March 2017;9;['angry', 'different', 'unanimous', 'guilty', 'such', 'common', 'good', 'objective', 'guilty', 'much', 'unanimous', 'other', 'respective', 'first', 'few', 'different', 'exemplified', 'guilty', 'different', 'hard', 'soft', 'fair', 'constructive', 'threatened', 'willing', 'other', 'constructive', 'present', 'objective', 'foolproof', 'such', 'guilty'];-0.0536666666666666

1705;raplover-39704;12 angry men has for a long time been on my list of what i would consider the best movies ever made. when a movie that merely displays a couple of people sitting in a room talking to one another can have you on the edge of your seat, then it's surely doing something right. however, recently my opinion on the movie changed. why, you may ask? because it makes no sense legally. the film is about a jury that has to decide whether there is evidence of a murder beyond a reasonable doubt, which means exactly what it implies. there has to be a reasonable doubt for them not to convict the person, not absence of any doubt at all. evidence is almost never 100% confirmatory, fingerprints or dna don't say anyting definitive and witnesses can lie. but when there is a lot of evidence and all of it is pointing in one direction (as is the case in the movie), then the standard of reasonable doubt has surely been reached. this movie makes no legal sense and has been misinforming people on the way the law works for decades now. it's still great in it's acting and the excitement that it's able to bring to table, but whole premise doesn't make sense.;1 August 2018;6;['angry', 'long', 'good', 'right', 'reasonable', 'reasonable', 'definitive', 'reasonable', 'legal', 'great', 'able', 'whole'];0.2487012987012987

1714;sarenacpavle;"simplicity. despite the setting and a lack of modern video editing skills, this movie manages to keep me on my toes from the beginning until the end. i think that this movie conveys many wise messages through the remarks of the jurors. it's fascinating to me how a variety of different character traits are portrayed in these jurors, so i'll write my view of the most influential people presented in the movie. juror #8 - the protagonist of this movie, and the wisest person in the room. i learned a very valuable lesson from him, which is to always leave room for a reasonable doubt whenever i try to think independently about anything in life really. he is a true example of a smart, calm individual who acknowledges the fallibility of a human and therefore knows that witnesses' statements need to be questioned, especially in a situation where a young man's life depends on it. he is also articulate and very respectful of others, and that's why he became my role model for having a constructive argument with people. another thing that strikes me is that he is able to defend his original opinion despite the fact that 11 people in the room disagreed with him. he didn't succumb to the pressure and just blindly follow the crowd. instead, he showed us how we should behave, especially in today's world where manipulation is dangerously easy with social media and other technologies. i think he was able to do this because he values his own morality more than anything else, which is another reason why i consider him a very good person that i want to aspire to be. juror #4 - the perfect antagonist. he is presented as a man that doesn't sweat which indicates his extreme level-headedness that is very useful in their situation. he is the only person who had reasonable arguments to back up his vote for ""guilty"". he thought that the kid was guilty until the very end when he changed his mind after being convinced by the counterarguments presented by other jurors. that was when he realized that there is a lot of reasonable doubt in the case and that a person mustn't be hung when there are so many unclear evidences. i respect him because he was respectful to others and always articulated his opinions logically which helped create a satisfying debate. juror #3 - inherently not a bad person, and i'll explain why. he is very prejudiced about this case because of his terrible relationship with his son that made him think subconsciously that all kids are bad. he's actually deeply scarred because of this bad relationship and that's why he tries to present himself as a strong, confident, and loud person. he is also very emotionally unstable as he shows many times, and even admits himself. it's in the end that he shows who he really is - a vulnerable man that still mourns his family relationship. he experiences a breakdown and starts crying while changing his vote to ""not guilty"" which shows that he finally realized the flaw in his prejudiced thinking. this is the reason why i don't consider him a bad person, but just a person that has gone through rough times which influenced his subconscious. juror #10 - he was obviously raised improperly which is why he grew into a racist, terrible human being that is full of hatred. along with being a bad person, he also proves to be unintelligent to say the least. he repeats the same few sentences throughout the film, interrupts other people constantly, and never brings anything constructive to the debate. he is a true example of a shallow person that doesn't deserve anything good in life. even though i developed despise toward this character, i think it's very useful to be encountered with this juror in the movie because he is a good reminder that people like him exist in the real world and that i should stay away from them. juror #7 - along with juror #10, he is the worst person in the room. he is so selfish that he prioritizes his entertainment at a sports game over the conversation that will decide whether the boy is going to live or die. he acts this way throughout the debate and shows his stupidity and shallowness by his various acts. he was just so annoying to me that i had to write a special paragraph to recognize what i should never become. other jurors are all good people in my opinion and they were all slowly realizing the complexity of the case and why it's necessary to discuss it deeply. they are all different of course, but i don't feel like it's necessary to write about any of them after discussing the juror #8 who encapsulates all the good traits that can be found in these other jurors. to conclude, this is one of the best movies that i've ever seen because of its meaningful messages and i would recommend it to everyone who loves to think deeply about life.";14 April 2020;10;['modern', 'many', 'wise', 'fascinating', 'different', 'influential', 'wise', 'valuable', 'reasonable', 'true', 'smart', 'calm', 'young', 'articulate', 'respectful', 'constructive', 'able', 'original', 'easy', 'social', 'other', 'able', 'own', 'good', 'perfect', 'extreme', 'useful', 'only', 'reasonable', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'very', 'other', 'reasonable', 'many', 'unclear', 'respectful', 'satisfying', 'bad', 'prejudiced', 'terrible', 'bad', 'scarred', 'bad', 'strong', 'confident', 'loud', 'unstable', 'many', 'vulnerable', 'guilty', 'prejudiced', 'bad', 'rough', 'racist', 'terrible', 'human', 'full', 'bad', 'unintelligent', 'least', 'same', 'few', 'other', 'constructive', 'true', 'shallow', 'good', 'useful', 'good', 'real', 'bad', 'selfish', 'various', 'annoying', 'special', 'other', 'good', 'necessary', 'different', 'necessary', 'good', 'other', 'good', 'meaningful'];0.0767443783068783

1720;itsmearjav;"as my review title suggests, this film was surprisingly engaging. knowing the premise going in, i expected to get bored fairly early on, but boy was i wrong. the movie had my attention from start to finish, even when the characters were going around doing seemingly inconsequential things. speaking of which, i really enjoyed how these small inconsequential things really helped develop the characters. there's only so much you can do in terms of solid character development when you have such a limited setting both physically and time-wise, but because of all the little things the characters were portrayed doing from the get-go, i felt like i could get a genuine feel for each of the jurors, which helped justify their major actions throughout the film. on the topic of detail, i'm sure this isn't very important but for some reason i absolutely loved how the men got progressively sweatier and sweatier as the film progressed. and no, i don't have a sweat fetish. i just enjoyed how the sweat was used to build the atmosphere of the film. i mean sure, you can have the characters go on and on about the weather, but a detail like the amount of the sweat on their faces really helps solidify that atmosphere. i could feel the men's frustration at their situation better by seeing the sweat dripping down their faces and from the stains on their shirt. i don't know, maybe i'm overanalyzing the situation, but that's something i quite enjoyed. i also feel the need to mention how much i appreciated jurors 4 and 11. juror 4 gave the ""negative side"" a logical argument, which, to me, really strengthened the film. too often the ""negative side"" in films like this are completely irrational and awful. juror 4 helped keep the arguments in the film from going completely off the rails. juror 11 was such a burst of sunshine. dang, i loved him. he was hilarious and provided a nice sense of humor to the film when it started to get too tense for too long. sometimes the message the filmmakers were trying to send through juror 11 about immigrants felt a little heavyhanded, but overall, i loved that character. although i mentioned how that message felt a little heavyhanded at times, it was very pleasant to see the film give a message about the risks of racism and racial profiling. the flow of the script was remarkable. it managed to go from plot point to plot point while maintaining a realistic semblance of what such a group of men would be like in real life. i especially enjoyed it when certain jurors were baited into saying completely contradictory things in a completely natural flow of dialogue. i really didn't think that i'd be saying this, but after watching the film, i've come to appreciate the premise of the film as a whole. it was definitely experimental, definitely novel, but that experimentalness definitely paid off. i mean seriously, who would think to make a movie with the setting of a single room in which a jury decides, after being presented the case off screen, whether the accused is guilty or not? and seriously, to be able to pull that off without the film getting stuffy at times and feeling claustrophobic? that's some insane stuff right there. but, as you can see, this film did not receive 10 stars; it wasn't perfect. first of all, despite what i just said about liking the novelty of the premise, it just felt a little too stretched at times. am i supposed to believe that the lawyer, however unmotivated, missed all that contradictory information and problematic evidence in court? if that were to actually happen, it would be very, very concerning. also i couldn't tell if and if, then what, message the movie was trying to send about the state of the american judicial system. i feel like it was, but it was just presented as a half-baked idea. also the whole gig with juror 3. i understand that his stance during the entire movie was due to his complicated relationship with his own son, and i think that's a very interesting motivation for his actions. but i just felt like the resolution of his opposition at the very end of the movie was a little too hasty. and that's about it. would definitely recommend this movie.";3 June 2019;8;['wrong', 'inconsequential', 'small', 'inconsequential', 'solid', 'limited', 'wise', 'little', 'genuine', 'major', 'sure', 'important', 'sweaty', 'sweaty', 'sure', 'negative', 'logical', 'negative', 'irrational', 'awful', 'hilarious', 'nice', 'tense', 'little', 'little', 'pleasant', 'racial', 'remarkable', 'realistic', 'real', 'certain', 'contradictory', 'natural', 'experimental', 'novel', 'single', 'guilty', 'able', 'stuffy', 'claustrophobic', 'insane', 'perfect', 'little', 'unmotivated', 'contradictory', 'problematic', 'concerning', 'judicial', 'half', 'whole', 'entire', 'due', 'complicated', 'own', 'interesting', 'very', 'little', 'hasty'];0.049324912891986

1728;teojenmin;12 angry men is an intriguing movie which i highly recommend watching. it displays the multi-faceted nature of human deliberation and the power of persuasion. the movie starts in a courtroom where the judge directs a jury to decide on the guilt of an accused person. the movie is set in a small room, where the 12 jurors from various professions are seated around a table. in order to sentence the boy to death, there must be a unanimous verdict of 'guilty' among all the jurors. if there is any reasonable doubt among the jury, they are to deliver a sentence of 'not guilty'. strong contemporaneous evidence pointed towards the guilt of the boy as there were several eyewitnesses and the prosecution was able to adduce strong evidence supporting a finding of guilt. when the movie began, 11 of the jurymen raised their hands for a vote of 'guilty'. only juror 8 voted 'not guilty' as he was convinced that there was reasonable doubt regarding the guilt of the accused. the jury begin to debate and discuss their views on why they perceive the accused to be guilty. after juror 8 cast doubt on their decisions, he called for a secret vote. from the secret vote, the plot progresses and we see how the various jurors begin to change their position as reasonable doubt is cast. i like how the director of the movie reveals key information regarding the crime throughout the movie which affects the jury's deliberation but also simultaneously creates an aura of mystery and uncertainty about the actual evidence of the crime. this movie does not disappoint as the intensity and sheer thought into the development of the script provides a compelling and engaging plot for all viewers. it also reveals how humans are intrinsically flawed as we all have prejudices, but there are situations where such prejudice needs to be set aside to achieve justice. the courage of a single juror to stand up against opposing views is laudable and was the key to making an impactful and significant change in someone else's life.;12 October 2017;8;['angry', 'intriguing', 'multi', 'faceted', 'human', 'small', 'various', 'unanimous', 'guilty', 'reasonable', 'guilty', 'strong', 'contemporaneous', 'several', 'able', 'strong', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'reasonable', 'guilty', 'secret', 'secret', 'various', 'reasonable', 'key', 'actual', 'sheer', 'compelling', 'flawed', 'such', 'single', 'laudable', 'impactful', 'significant'];-0.0599914965986394
1729;freimanisroberts;''12 angry men'' is one of the oldest movies i've watched, and whilst not being the most avid movie watcher myself i do appreciate a lot of the details. *the rest of the review will contain spoilers so i suggest watching the movie first and coming back to this review later* plot: ''12 angry men'' takes place in court where an 18 year old boy has been accused of murdering his father, the judge leaves the trial of the boys life in the hands of 12 jurors. if the boy is deemed guilty he shall be executed, if not the boy shall be set free, but there is one condition : all 12 jurors must vote unanimously. the 12 jurors are then escorted into a room where they are locked in until they finish voting, they are allowed to ask for anything they like (evidence, murder details etc.) whilst in the room. the jurors sat down in order (1-12) and they began the judgment with a vote all of the jurors but one (juror 8) voted on guilty, and since the vote had to be unanimous they had to debate until they reached an agreement. interesting facts: 1. the movie almost entirely takes place in a single room. 2. none of the cast members are alive today. 3. juror #10 never utters a single word after he is told to shut up and listen 4. juror #1 never spoke his opinion on the guilt of the boy most likely due to him playing the role of an observer rather than being an active participant himself. review: i loved the movie to no end but that does not mean i'm going to be biased, in fact some of the flaws this movie has really do bug me. i'll start off with the good. the movie is very thought provoking and it shows how taking a bit of time and thinking through everything can lead to a different result rather than recklessly deciding on an answer in mere seconds. the movie itself is really engaging because it takes time between arguments so the audience can think on whose side they are at all times. all of the jurors have moments where they develop themselves as a character, revealing their past, life, job which develops them as a character and lets the viewer connect with them. even though juror #8 said that he is neutral multiple times, i can't bring myself to believe that as he went to great lengths to vindicate the boy's name which was shown in the scene where he went to the slumps and got the exact knife that was in the murder scene. i believe that he truly wished for the boy to be saved and in the end he did so. my biggest gripe with the film was how some evidence and things the jurors said seemed way too convenient e.g. they saw marks from glasses on the nose of one witness or when juror #3 said that he will kill juror #8. i'm not saying it can't happen it's just that it's highly unlikely. i also disliked that some jurors where quite unprofessional, granted i do understand that they are only human, but their job requires that emotions do not get in the way and cloud the facts. all in all the movie was good even with its flaws it was a great watch. i loved how as juror #8 convinced others of the boy not being guilty they came in with their own knowledge on certain subjects and didn't regurgitate what #8 had said. i give this movie a solid 9/10 and i recommend it to anyone who wants a high tension movie that will have you on the edge of your seat. also keep in mind that this movie slightly differs from regular detective movies but that's exactly what makes it so entertaining.;14 October 2017;9;['angry', 'old', 'avid', 'angry', 'old', 'guilty', 'free', 'guilty', 'unanimous', 'interesting', 'single', 'alive', 'single', 'active', 'different', 'mere', 'neutral', 'multiple', 'great', 'exact', 'big', 'convenient', 'unlikely', 'unprofessional', 'human', 'good', 'great', 'guilty', 'own', 'certain', 'solid', 'high', 'regular', 'entertaining'];0.0566031746031746

1733;chtagnes;it is interesting that this movie takes place almost entirely in a single setting, which is the courtroom. through this movie, it can be seen that each jury members have different perspectives and interests which resulted in the different votes. in reality, some discussion or negotiation has to be done to reach a favorable decision because in a situation with multiple stakeholders, different stakeholders will have different personal interests they wish to hold onto or achieve. hence, i felt that this movie was very relevant to the situations we may face in reality. if no negotiation is done, those who make biased decisions may possibly jeopardize the entire situation or cause losses to others, which in this case, was the life of a teenage boy. the way the movie evolves from 11-1 in favor of guilty to 11-1 in favor of acquittal was very interesting as the points brought up by jury 8 was unexpected because it was so detailed and specific. this movie changed my perception of black and white movies, and i really enjoyed this movie.;3 November 2017;7;['interesting', 'single', 'different', 'different', 'favorable', 'multiple', 'different', 'different', 'personal', 'relevant', 'biased', 'entire', 'teenage', 'guilty', 'interesting', 'unexpected', 'detailed', 'specific', 'black', 'white'];0.0645502645502645
1734;scottslsh;i was required to watch this film for one of my assignments. initially, i was not very keen on starting mainly because it was a black-and- white film. yes, i know that there are many great black- and-white classics out there that are far better than most films produced these days. but as a young adult that grew up with some great cinematic films such as the lord of the rings and back to the future to the entire marvel universe series in recent years, i was ignorant to think that this film is going to be boring. never had i been so wrong in my judgement. 12 angry men is an amazing film that i now praise not because i want to ride on the bandwagon culture and pretend that i am cool for knowing, watching, and appreciating an old film. this film had drawn me into the conversation as if i was truly there listening. at times when some arguments become personal and ridiculous, i felt frustrations towards their stupidity (for lack of a better word). hence, i feel that the camera was like the my eyes as if i were really in the room with them. the most intense portion was emotional and not physical. this film does not include a fast-paced adrenaline-filled hot pursuit, grand battles or explosions. however, it comes with in-depth character developments, story progressions and a showcase of a true talented negotiator. the pace of the film is slow, but not to the extent of making you sleepy. in comparison, it is like a broth or stew that has to be simmered slowly to bring out the flavours. else, the development of the characters' mindsets and opinions would have been rather underwhelming. do not let the age of the film fool you. do not let that grainy black-and-white exterior deny your chance to enjoy a good film. while there a some plot-holes that i was not very comfortable with, i dare say confidently that it is going to be worth your time.;4 November 2017;9;['keen', 'black', 'white', 'many', 'great', 'white', 'well', 'most', 'young', 'great', 'cinematic', 'such', 'entire', 'marvel', 'recent', 'ignorant', 'wrong', 'angry', 'amazing', 'cool', 'old', 'personal', 'ridiculous', 'well', 'intense', 'emotional', 'physical', 'hot', 'grand', 'true', 'talented', 'slow', 'sleepy', 'underwhelming', 'grainy', 'black', 'white', 'good', 'comfortable', 'worth'];0.1619791666666666

1737;joyannchua;i personally really enjoyed this movie and thought it had a humorous yet insightful take on negotiations. the movie highlighted a few mistakes that people often make when negotiating, without even being aware of it. one of such mistakes was clearly displayed by juror 3. he ended up arguing his stand because of his pride, rather than his principle. on the other hand, we see juror 8 detached from his stand of 'not guilty'. rather than being stubborn about his own view, he focused on the evidence of the case, never lost his temper and was open to opinions of the other jurors that opposed his. comparing between these 2 jurors, it is obvious which negotiation style led to a more favourable result. juror 8 not only managed to invite the others to participate but also led a smooth negotiation with a conclusive outcome that all parties agreed on. as a viewer of the ongoing negotiations, i found myself shifting from agreeing with juror 3 and his 'guilty' stand at the start, to getting frustrated with his subjective point of view at the end. even with obvious reasonable doubt, he refused to change his view because he was wanted to 'save face'. i could imagine losing my temper and refusing to engage in any more discussions were i to be in such a negotiation, which would ultimately lead to no definite outcome. this movie made me reflect on the different negotiation styles and which usually reaps the most results. ironically, while everyone could see that juror 8 was a much better negotiator, the reality of it is that most people behave like juror 3 and get their personal emotions involved when negotiating. overall, a great and informative film!;6 November 2017;8;['humorous', 'insightful', 'few', 'aware', 'such', 'other', 'guilty', 'stubborn', 'own', 'open', 'other', 'obvious', 'favourable', 'smooth', 'conclusive', 'ongoing', 'guilty', 'subjective', 'obvious', 'reasonable', 'more', 'definite', 'different', 'most', 'well', 'most', 'personal', 'great', 'informative'];0.1333333333333333

1739;sngweiyang;in harper lee's critically acclaimed book 'to kill a mocking bird', a black man was held accountable for raping a white woman. despite having insufficient evidence to prove that he was guilty, he was sentenced to death by the court regardless. we can draw similarities to the issues that were explored in the film 12 angry men. in numerous occasions, the men's judgment were blurred by racial prejudice, so much that they could not make a clear, rational decision on whether to prosecute the black boy. drawing insights from fisher's book getting to yes and relating it to the film, we can see here what may have impeded effective negotiation, preventing an impartial and agreeable outcome. throughout the movie, davis as the protagonist of 12 angry men is thereby strongly represented as an effective negotiator that corresponds to what fisher offered in his book.;6 November 2017;10;['harper', 'black', 'accountable', 'white', 'insufficient', 'guilty', 'angry', 'numerous', 'racial', 'clear', 'rational', 'black', 'effective', 'impartial', 'agreeable', 'angry', 'effective'];-0.0533333333333333
1740;skindeepcinderella;"the movie ""12 angry men"" is about 12 jurors who embark on a difficult task to reach a unanimous vote to either acquit or convict a young man for the murder of his father. the discussion takes place in a stiflingly hot and cramped room where all the members of the jury are motivated to end the session quickly, except for one (juror 8). in the span of the movie, juror 8 was able to convince all other 11 jurors to vote ""not guilty"", though with difficulty and obstacles. the film depicts negotiations at play, which will be discussed in correspondence to fisher & ury's ""getting to yes"" book. #1 moving from positional bargaining to focusing on interests according to fisher and ury (1981), parties should refrain from positional bargaining and to instead, practice principled negotiations. during the jury discussion, positional bargaining is accurately displayed. the jurors started off indicating their stance through an internal vote. this reveals their differing positions and they argue about it till the group ultimately concurs with one position. once jurors took on positional bargaining, it was a challenge to move from being fixated on their individual positions to focus instead on interests and perspectives of others so as to constructively create wise agreements. one underlying common interest that can be identified among-st the jurors is that all of them wants justice for the murder case. this is even though their perception of what ""justice"" could be is largely contrasting. one side felt that the case could be deliberated longer so as to give the disadvantaged boy a fair shot. whereas, the other side felt that justice would be best served through conviction and an eventual death penalty. many times, behind strongly-opposing positions, lie shared interests too. perhaps, recognizing and reconciling similar interests could positively change the circumstances and position the jurors as combating the problem together as opposed to combating each other. fortunately, with juror 8's convincing argument and powerful influence, he was able to garner the support of the otherwise-opposing jurors. otherwise, he would have either backed down by changing his stance or have the jury declared as a hung one. either of these, would not have had any positive consequences. #2 separating people from the problem fisher & ury (1981) postulate that it is crucial to separate people from the issues. as seen from the discussion, the jurors got visibly agitated when others were not on their side. perhaps they felt that their opinions were being encroached on and had interpreted objections from others as personal attacks. inevitably, the relationship between them became entangled with the issue. the authors identified three people problems, namely perception, emotions, and communication. firstly, the tension depicted is the result of variances among-st the jurors, in terms of personalities, values, backgrounds, and worldviews. these form up their perceptions that contribute to what they think, say or do during the discussions. since conflicts in negotiations often stem from differing interpretations of facts, it is then imperative for all to understand the viewpoints of other parties. also, the audience is given a glimpse of the deeply-entrenched prejudices one can have. juror 10 seemed racist and has obvious biases against the defendant. also, as juror 3 has a hostile relationship with his son, he is seemingly unable to separate his ill-feelings towards his son and the defendant. secondly, the agonizing heat led to them perspiring profusely, adding on to their irritability and irrational thought processes. as such, voices rose and tempers flared during their deliberations. emotions visibly ran high, but however, were rarely acknowledged in the movie. thirdly, communication broke down when some jurors walked out or were simply a bystander instead of an active participant in the discussions. for instance, the shy juror 2 was sidelined by the much louder juror 3 & 10. active listening should be practiced so that everyone has a stake in negotiations and to prevent misunderstandings or sides-taking. only when the jurors communicate effectively, will they be able to gain new perspectives and resolve the conflict amicably. #3 using objective criteria to help resolve conflicts, negotiators should utilize objective criteria. battling wills and pressurizing others to back down would hurt relationships and lead to unwise agreements. hence, the use of legitimate, practical, relevant and objective criteria will create a fair procedure to resolve a dispute. given the tense situation, there is immense importance to align the jury's objectives, goals, and rules in negotiations. the foreman was attempting to be as fair as he could. however, as he also voted ""guilty"" initially, he may have been subconsciously biased. as the head juror, he is expected to be a neutral facilitator and mediator. perhaps he could have spelled out an agenda, establish ground rules/procedures, and to summarize discussions. for example, they could engage in rule- setting in the beginning, to provide structure and forbid certain actions such as personal attacks, name-calling or shouting. the foreman chose not to engage in this as he started off the discussion saying he was ""not going to make any rules"". hence, it was inevitable that the jurors were not on the same page; they presumed the guilt of the boy, seemed rather flippant about the situation and were not willing to engage in meaningful debates. for instance, a disinterested juror 10 was doodling while others were discussing. furthermore, juror 7 indicated his impatience when he said ""this better be fast"" as he had tickets to a ball game that night. setting rigid time constraints and deadlines would not be helpful to a productive and robust negotiation session. in addition, juror 8 used scientific facts alongside with his deductions, such as the fastest possible speed the old male witness could walk and the eyesight of the female witness. this was a form of objective criteria as it was logical reasoning and facts rather than arbitrary feelings or thoughts.";7 November 2017;8;['angry', 'difficult', 'unanimous', 'young', 'hot', 'able', 'other', 'guilty', 'positional', 'positional',

1741;chewsijing;"""i just want to talk."" juror 8 asserted to his team of compatriots in the jury room, being the only member of the jury that pleaded 'not guilty' out of the twelve. standing at a vote of 1-11, davis, starring henry fonda, held the reasonable doubt that the evidence presented in court was not substantial to convict the 18-year old of a death sentence. at that moment, his unconventional vote incurred the wrath of many. what could have seemingly been established within a few minutes will now turn into a long deliberation, before reaching the end of the verdict. with no factual proof but mainly assumptions, he was dealt the unlikely odds of winning his case. yet, to uphold the truth and justice, he held the right attitude: to be firm and fair in negotiation. 12 angry men was a powerful and instructive film that laid out a typical negotiation scene in the jury room. members of the jury, belonging to different age groups, status and social backgrounds, were selected at random from various communities in the district. these twelve men then deliberated over the case of a first-degree murder, by beginning with the element of negotiation from the outset: the discussion to talk things out. a series of event were then unfolded and documented, as each juror took turns to proclaim his opinions and convince another that held dissenting views, before reaching a unanimous decision. all juror 8 requested was for the jury to present their case and analysis of their judgment of 'guilty', to identify any logical justifications. here, he understood his role as a negotiator to differentiate between 'position' and 'interest' as once a position has been established, it becomes tedious to alter. thus, he was careful of not allowing positions to drive out interests. on the other hand, juror 3 by lee. j cobb, was stubbornly adamant about his position as the jury member that appeals for 'guilty'. he started with a strong ability to reason about the existential facts, which however, as time goes by began to reveal cracks beneath the surface of his arguments. holding a bias against delinquents, he was extreme on his views and showed no signs of concession to any proved investigations, often offending other members. hence the process of negotiation requires less attention on positions or risk no agreement being formed. the movie intentionally highlighted how the vast differences in the twelve, got in their way of achieving a consensus and how circumstances (e.g. weather) impacted them. often, their arguments side-tracked and led to a series of confrontational retorts and personal attacks, instead of a reasonable discussion that tackles the core of the problem. one of the scenes that revealed a member changing sides from 'guilty' to 'not guilty' in a crucial anonymous vote, was a good illustration of being people- focused than problem-focused. juror 3 let his emotions outburst when he confronted juror 5 (jack klugman), accusing him of changing his vote because he empathized with the defendant, coming from slums himself. the false accusation then led to a lousy impression of juror 3. this showcased personal prejudice against the person, rather than understanding the reasons behind the stand and hence the problem, spiraling into subsequent biases against issues. in conclusion, this is certainly a movie that is worth the watch, capturing all scenes and emotions of the 12 jurors within a jury room.";8 November 2017;8;['only', 'guilty', 'reasonable', 'substantial', 'unconventional', 'many', 'few', 'long', 'factual', 'unlikely', 'right', 'firm', 'fair', 'angry', 'powerful', 'instructive', 'typical', 'different', 'social', 'random', 'various', 'first', 'unanimous', 'guilty', 'logical', 'tedious', 'careful', 'other', 'adamant', 'guilty', 'strong', 'existential', 'extreme', 'proved', 'other', 'less', 'vast', 'confrontational', 'personal', 'reasonable', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'crucial', 'anonymous', 'good', 'focused', 'focused', 'false', 'lousy', 'personal', 'subsequent', 'worth'];-0.0586817653890824
1742;jesslsh;the film 12 angry men is an artful demonstration of a maneuvering of a challenging negotiation. it is a challenging negotiation as it is one fraught with personal biases and emotions of the negotiators. notwithstanding, these are dynamics that could potentially inflict any negotiation, as these characteristics are almost inevitable in negotiators being humans. the situation where the single minority turns the majority over seems to be the result of a coincidental alignment of factors, such as seemingly skilled negotiators, cooperative partners, and so on. however, there are indeed strategic actions that facilitated a movement towards a principled negotiation. a constant theme is the idea of creating space in a negotiation and giving respect for people. fundamentally, negotiators are humans, and each are fallible to their own biases and vulnerabilities. it is important to open the space for negotiation and proceed with respect for the other. this could be achieved through strategic actions such as framing the negotiation process as well as habits of active listening and observing. with these, it will enable us to be able to deal with difficult scenarios in a negotiation too. it is a must-watch for anyone who is interested in negotiation or who simply enjoys some brilliant banter.;8 November 2017;10;['angry', 'artful', 'challenging', 'challenging', 'fraught', 'personal', 'inevitable', 'single', 'coincidental', 'such', 'skilled', 'cooperative', 'strategic', 'principled', 'constant', 'fallible', 'own', 'important', 'other', 'strategic', 'such', 'active', 'able', 'difficult', 'interested', 'brilliant'];0.1566798941798941
1743;teowqeleanor;"a 1957 american courtroom drama film, adapted from reginald rose's teleplay, is an absorbing and compelling movie that attempts to answer the all-important question above with serious implications where a boy's life is decided in the stance taken by each juror. the 96 minutes film delves into approaches of consensus-building, and the challenges involved in the negotiation process among the jurors, each with their own perspectives, experiences and personalities that come into play during moments of intense conflicts. the film starts with the judge's apathetic delivery of instructions, as he informs the jurors to ""separate the facts from the fancy"". indeed, it is important for jurors to objectively separate the people from the problem to get a clearer view of the substantive problem. however, in the film, juror 10 expresses his displeasure and condemnation towards 'slum-born people' such as the accused. he further alleges that ""slums breed criminals"" and they are ""no better than animals who kill for fun"". this scene is perhaps one of the most powerful in demonstrating the blatant impacts of racism and prejudicial mindsets. as the film progresses, juror #8, played by fonda, tries to establish objective standards, free from biases that may stem from individual personalities, emotions and experiences. however, this is easier said than done in reality as demonstrated in the film where each juror is characterized in terms of their backgrounds, occupations and prejudices. fonda also makes it a critical point to help the group focus on interests. the jurors communicate the need to understand their roles clearly and the importance of taking ownership of their stance to ensure a democratic process, and not switch sides without reasons, recognizing the objective criteria. juror 11's anger towards juror 7, who changes his vote in hope to end expediently to attend his baseball match reminds us the importance of having a jury which is to ensure a fair hearing and provide the accused with a voice. a classic courtroom drama with a unique twist, 12 angry men portrays the american justice system and provides a lens to reflect on the intimate ways one relates to another in our daily lives. the film brings to light how discriminatory mindsets may be subconsciously formed where prejudice obscures the truth and blurs objectivity. the film is excellent in educating people on the impacts of every big and small decision made where the main issue may not be everything as it seems. indeed, the jury fulfils a crucial role in the legal system, and in our everyday lives, in the communities we live and work in, the need for structured work processes may inevitably increase barriers towards help-seeking where helping professionals in the community may become boxed up in ticking criteria forms.";8 November 2017;10;['american', 'compelling', 'important', 'serious', 'own', 'intense', 'apathetic', 'important', 'clear', 'substantive', 'such', 'well', 'powerful', 'blatant', 'prejudicial', 'objective', 'free', 'individual', 'easy', 'critical', 'democratic', 'objective', 'fair', 'classic', 'unique', 'angry', 'intimate', 'daily', 'discriminatory', 'excellent', 'big', 'small', 'main', 'crucial', 'legal', 'everyday', 'structured'];0.1386111111111111
1744;annabananatyl;12 angry men is a captivating film set entirely in a sweltering jury room of a courthouse. the jury must deliberate whether an 18-year-old boy from the slums is guilty of murdering his father. a guilty verdict means that the boy will die. as the jury starts their discussion, the line is immediately drawn with 11 members voting 'guilty' and juror 8 voting 'not guilty'. as the men tries to reach a unanimous decision, conflict arises, and we are led to see how the different jurors view the case. some let their personal issues cloud their decisions, while others are barely invested in the situation and simply want to leave the room. juror 8 eventually manages to convince all 11 men to reconsider their stand on the case. one insight gleaned from the film is how our past experiences can lead to the development of deep-seated bias. as juror 8 leads the others through the case, not only does he uncover clues that shows there is more to the case, he also reveals the prejudices and preconceptions that the jury have about the trial, the accused, and each other. the boy accused of the murder came from the slums. for many members of the jury, that is enough to confirm that he is guilty. the people from the slums were insensitively referred to as 'born liars', wild, violent and that 'there is not one that is any good'. thus, it is no wonder that the boy would commit a murder and it is obvious that he is guilty. the jurors who agreed with these over-generalizations are not deliberating on the case based on the facts alone, but letting their own bias cloud their visions. it proved difficult for them to even realize that they do have these biases. juror 3 was also shown to have personal problems with his son and wrongly transferred the anger onto the case as well as fellow members of the jury. at the end, it was a sobering scene as the jury came to the realization that they do hold prejudices, misgivings and mindsets that were wrongly imposed on the case. from 12 angry men, we can see how preconceived notions impacted the way the jurors communicated. though set in 1957, the film provides an excellent case study on negotiation, offering many insights that are relevant as we communicate with others today.;9 November 2017;10;['angry', 'old', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'unanimous', 'different', 'personal', 'past', 'deep', 'more', 'other', 'many', 'enough', 'guilty', 'wild', 'violent', 'good', 'obvious', 'guilty', 'own', 'difficult', 'personal', 'fellow', 'sobering', 'angry', 'preconceived', 'excellent', 'many', 'relevant'];-0.0472222222222222

1768;sherylker;set in 1957, the monochrome film 12 angry men surprisingly did not seem any less relevant even when viewed more than 60 years later, highlighting disagreement, management and negotiation as timeless issues. the film showed juror 8 as the only juror in a murder trial who did not vote for a guilty charge for the accused at the first vote. over the course of the film, juror 8 slowly but successfully manages to convince the other jurors that the case is not as clear as it seemed in court 1. tone throughout the discussion, viewers will notice that more often than not, the jurors who were persuasive raised their points without raising their voices. yet, even while they were not particularly loud and aggressive, it did not undermine their effectiveness. 2. be hard on the problem but soft on the people we observe that juror 8 to be hard on the problem to ensure a fair decision was made, yet he maintained softness and empathy in approaching the jurors - showing respect and acknowledging their right to their own opinions. while the negotiation took place in the context of the controlled setting of a movie, negotiations take place in our lives every day. some negotiations may not result in an outcome that we came in to a discussion hoping to achieve. however, 12 angry men provide good tips on how we can conduct a negotiation.;18 April 2018;7;['angry', 'relevant', 'more', 'timeless', 'only', 'guilty', 'first', 'other', 'clear', 'persuasive', 'loud', 'aggressive', 'hard', 'soft', 'hard', 'fair', 'own', 'angry', 'good'];0.0776041666666666

1770;ngjingyi-92991;going in thinking 12 angry men was a lame black and white film i had to watch for an assignment, i didn't think i was going to enjoy it as much as i did. even though the film was set in one location, there was never a dull point and the conversations and debates between the jurors were always so intense and exciting. the film uses the decision-making process of 12 jurors to bring us on a roller-coaster of emotions. in the short one hour and 36 minutes, many uncomfortable issues were brought to light. this included discrimination, racism, and even more personal problems like self-purpose and worth. all these issues were presented to the audience in a very bite-sized way, with each juror embodying one, allowing us to see the parallels in our own lives. what i found most interesting was how the importance of being a good negotiator shined through for me in the film. 12 angry men was able to portray the wide spectrum of negotiators, from skilled and objective negotiators, to hot-headed and ego-centric ones. through them, we were able to see the repercussions of allowing our emotions and personal pre-conceived notions overwhelm our decisions. i learnt to not be so quick to judge and to always consider the possibility of alternatives before being certain about something. there will always be things that we will not see or know. but yes, all in all, i truly enjoyed the movie as it left me thinking about the uncomfortable issues that we may not always want to deal with. i totally recommend watching this, even if you are someone who is not into older films. it's definitely worth your time!;22 April 2018;10;['angry', 'lame', 'black', 'white', 'dull', 'intense', 'exciting', 'short', 'many', 'uncomfortable', 'personal', 'worth', 'sized', 'own', 'interesting', 'good', 'angry', 'able', 'wide', 'skilled', 'objective', 'headed', 'ego', 'able', 'personal', 'pre', 'conceived', 'quick', 'certain', 'uncomfortable', 'old', 'worth'];0.0921957671957671
1771;itsmeclaudia;"the film '12 angry men' is set in a courtroom where a jury of twelve men deliberate the charge of a defendant of a murder trial with the aim of reaching a unanimous vote. operating on the principle of reasonable doubt, the film appeals to viewers as it depicts the contrasting ways of examining a situation that is both intriguing and captivating, even better that it was in black and white. although the film as a whole had many captivating moments, it was a line expressed by juror 9 that changed the game for me. he voted for 'not guilty' and explicitly explained his vote, ""i respect his motives, but the boy in trial is probably guilty; but i want to hear more."" this line impressed upon me two things: that a person who was previously on the far opposite end of a view could be so open-minded as to consider the possibility of a contrasting view even with little concrete evidence, and that the negotiator (juror 8) could succeed at persuasion just by communicating his motives, which is more significant in the face of such a weak case. this showed me how effective and powerful persuasion can be, especially since beliefs shape our actions which in turn affects everything and everyone. in spite of this, there are also certain aspects of the film that are merely fictional and problems that are harder to deal with in reality. this is seen in one part of the film where the protagonist gave up his interests at one point in time and arrange for a secret ballot where he would change his vote to 'guilty' if there was a unanimous vote. although juror 9 did vote 'not guilty' and the group of men began negotiating again, realistically it would not happen as parties would move on and forget about your interests once you give them up. the storyline falls short in this aspect but the film was still enjoyable as a whole.";23 April 2018;8;['angry', 'unanimous', 'reasonable', 'contrasting', 'intriguing', 'black', 'white', 'many', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'more', 'opposite', 'open', 'minded', 'contrasting', 'little', 'concrete', 'significant', 'weak', 'effective', 'powerful', 'certain', 'fictional', 'hard', 'secret', 'guilty', 'unanimous', 'guilty', 'short', 'enjoyable'];-0.0112619047619047
1772;zehui;the film 12 angry men by sidney lumet gives us a picture of a very probably real life situation of negotiations taking place. it follows 12 white male jurors trying to reach a verdict in the murder trial of a puerto rican teenager who is accused of knifing his father. the task the jurors have is grave as their decision must be unanimous in whether this boy is to be given the death penalty. despite the gravity of the situation, not everyone perceives it this way. i enjoyed how the complexity of human prejudice is explored in the film. while its central story is based on the fact that 12 white jurors are reaching a verdict on a migrant puerto rican teenager's murder trial, the film also turns the prejudice on the viewer - in our assumption that all 12 men are the same. it is highly enjoyable and spurs good thought.;23 April 2018;9;['angry', 'real', 'white', 'male', 'puerto', 'rican', 'grave', 'unanimous', 'human', 'central', 'white', 'migrant', 'puerto', 'same', 'enjoyable', 'good'];0.0777777777777777
1773;kuanmei-22261;12 angry men was a captivating and exciting film from start to end. the film depicts the story of a jury's decision on the case of a teenage boy charged with the murder of his own father based on reasonable doubt. twelve jurors, each with different backgrounds, personalities and interests are involved. the theme of prejudice is explored in this film. through the use of a single setting, lumet effectively delves into the personalities of each juror and their motivations that pushed them to make their decision on the case. juror 10 is a racist bigot, who makes no effort to hide his contempt for residents of the slums. juror 10 frequently has emotional outbursts, and offended juror 5, who grew up in a slum, and disrespected the elderly juror 9 with his crude remarks. juror 3 is a forceful man who is intolerant of others, with a strong but hidden prejudice against juveniles, which reminds him of his estranged son. driven by their prejudice, jurors 3 and 10 were unable to distinguish their emotions from their perception of the problem, causing their decisions to lose objectivity. the film reveals to me how prejudice can significantly distort and influence people's ability to rational decisions. the truth of whether the boy actually committed the murder was never revealed, even at the end of the film. the truth matters little when compared to the significance of how what we perceive may not actually be what is, which the film was able to put across splendidly. my main takeaway is that when entering a new discussion, it is important to be receptive and empathetic but yet firm toward positional pressure in order to produce a convincing argument. this is a film that is worth watching.;23 April 2018;9;['angry', 'exciting', 'teenage', 'own', 'reasonable', 'different', 'single', 'racist', 'emotional', 'elderly', 'crude', 'forceful', 'intolerant', 'strong', 'hidden', 'estranged', 'unable', 'rational', 'little', 'able', 'main', 'new', 'important', 'receptive', 'empathetic', 'firm', 'positional', 'convincing', 'worth'];0.0605384199134199
