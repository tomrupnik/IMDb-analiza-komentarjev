0;MartinHafer;please understand that despite my summary, i did enjoy this clever film. there was a lot to like. however, little of the film seemed oscar-worthy and it probably should not be in the imdb top 250. i think this is a great case of a very good film that has been prematurely elevated to greatness. as far as the plot goes, with zillions of reviews on imdb for this film, i won't even bother. the acting was very good, the special effects ranged from freakin' amazing (such as digitally removing lt. dan's leg--quite an achievement for 1994) to very, very poor (inexplicably, despite forrest being expertly inserted in many scenes, the one with john lennon was very sloppy and the seams were very, very obvious on the big screen). the negatives included a few problems with continuity (such as the happy face being supposedly invented by gump in the late 70s--it had been around for nearly a decade already) and perhaps too much emphasis on episodes as opposed to story. still, it's a very enjoyable film and one you can't help but like. but winning 6 oscars?! it must have been a very, very slow year.;9 June 2008;8;['clever', 'little', 'worthy', 'great', 'good', 'good', 'special', 'amazing', 'such', 'poor', 'forr', 'many', 'sloppy', 'obvious', 'big', 'few', 'such', 'happy', 'late', 'much', 'enjoyable', 'slow'];0.1826488095238095
1;TheLittleSongbird;"forrest gump, i think is a beautiful film. never too schmaltzy, but there are some genuine tearjerkers like forrest at jenny's grave. the cinematography is stunning, the costumes are lovely and the scenery is gorgeous. the music is also very calm and relaxing, perhaps adding to the tone of this film. the screenplay is well crafted, and the story is simple. but what made this movie was its simplicity; it never tries to be too complex and is consequently moving. the acting is just as impressive; whilst tom hanks's accent is a little awkward in places, my only real criticism of this movie, he gives a truly remarkable performance, though i do think morgan freeman deserved the oscar more for shawshank. robin wright gives possibly the best performance of her career, and sally field is very dignified as forrest's mother. the scene stealer though is gary sinise as lieutenant dan, a very moving and insightful performance. overall, an extremely good movie, i will admit i wasn't sure whether i would like it, but the simple answer is this, i do. 9/10 bethany cox";22 November 2009;9;['forr', 'beautiful', 'schmaltzy', 'genuine', 'forr', 'stunning', 'lovely', 'gorgeous', 'calm', 'relaxing', 'simple', 'complex', 'impressive', 'little', 'only', 'real', 'remarkable', 'more', 'good', 'sally', 'dignified', 'forr', 'gary', 'moving', 'insightful', 'good', 'sure', 'simple'];0.4213235294117647
2;bkoganbing;"when tom hanks won his first oscar for philadelphia in 1993 the film received a total of five nominations. his second oscar for forrest gump came in a film that received more than double that in nominations and awards. if forrest gump did nothing else it solidified hanks's credentials as a serious actor. he would never be doing imitations of his bosom buddies character in films again. it also among other awards also won for best picture and best director for robert zemeckis, richly deserved. the film is huckleberry finn like in its canny observations coming from the man who had an iq we are told of 75. but as forrest also tells us, ""stupid is as stupid does"". and forrest with the hand of an unseen providence comes out a lot better than some of the clever people he meets in life. watching the film once again it occurred to me that mark twain if he couldn't have written this himself would have loved the way zemeckis handled the character of forrest gump. the beauty of huckleberry finn and the secret of its success is that twain got into the mind of a child who recorded all the events around him, a child without too much education. what zemeckis did was get hanks into a child like mind who sees things with amazing clarity stripped of any veneer of pretense. which hanks observes in the people around him and in the events that shape america and himself from eisenhower to reagan. there are two prominent female parts in forrest gump. one is for robin wright who plays the abused child julie as an adult. she is forrest's love and best friend and she takes a different path of life one she chose with more deliberation than hanks. their fates though eventually entwined are radically different. the second major female role is for another two time oscar winner sally field who now is playing matronly parts, a far cry from gidget and the flying nun. she gives forrest the maxims he lives by and in a crisis they turn out to be more than sound bite cliches. another award that forrest gump won is for special effects and an award it didn't win was for gary sinise in the role of lieutenant dan taylor, forrest's commanding officer in vietnam. that's something that does not compute because the special effects were to show gary sinise as a double amputee with both legs lost in vietnam. it's some amazing bit of work no doubt about it, but to honor it without sinise whose performance really brings it off is ridiculous. sinise is the educated one who curses the fate that happened to him, but in the end by just going with the flow he does prosper in the end. sinise lost that year in best supporting actor category to martin landau for ed wood, but i think sinise's performance has had a more lasting impact. to those americans who serve our country it certainly has. gary sinise has devoted a great deal of his life and earned treasure to bring entertainment to our overseas troops in iraq, afghanistan, wherever, becoming a successor to bob hope in that regard. he's gone further than that though, setting up foundations to help civilians in both countries and contributing to numerous charities dealing with war and its aftermath. doing that in my humble opinion gary sinise has become one of the great americans of our brand new millenia, a lot more than just an actor. he's forever now known as lieutenant dan. in the end though the film belongs to tom hanks who joined with spencer tracy as the only two male actors to win back to back oscars for best actor. hanks fascinates us and guides us through this film and when we're done we've seen something very special. if you don't believe me about how good forrest gump is, then watch it for a few minutes and see if you're not sucked in. like forrest's mama says, the film's like life which is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you'll get until you open it.""";13 February 2010;10;['first', 'second', 'forr', 'more', 'double', 'forr', 'serious', 'other', 'good', 'good', 'canny', 'forr', 'stupid', 'stupid', 'forr', 'unseen', 'well', 'clever', 'forr', 'much', 'amazing', 'prominent', 'female', 'forr', 'forr', 'good', 'different', 'more', 'different', 'second', 'major', 'female', 'far', 'forr', 'more', 'sound', 'forr', 'special', 'gary', 'special', 'double', 'amazing', 'ridiculous', 'good', 'lasting', 'great', 'overseas', 'numerous', 'humble', 'great', 'new', 'more', 'only', 'male', 'good', 'special', 'good', 'forr', 'few'];0.2068672606463304

4;SnoopyStyle;forrest gump (tom hanks) is a simple man with a sweet heart. it's his journey through american history. his childhood friend jenny (robin wright) would travel the underbelly flipside of the same world. his journey is heavily influenced by his mama (sally field), lieutenant dan (gary sinise), and bubba blue (mykelti williamson). director robert zemeckis has added another chapter to the american mythos. it is a magical tale where the good guys win out. that you can rise to the top no matter what handicap you have. that a good heart will enlighten all it touches. it is a tale worthy of frank capra. if i could have a wish, it is a deeper meaning to gump's journey. for example, he's given a chance to comment on the vietnam war but the sound goes out of his mike. i would have like to hear what he had to say. but that might have been asking too much. more than anything, gump is not controversial.;15 November 2013;8;['forr', 'simple', 'sweet', 'american', 'childhood', 'same', 'bubba', 'magical', 'good', 'good', 'worthy', 'frank', 'deep', 'much', 'more', 'controversial'];0.3303030303030303
5;Hitchcoc;"every once in a while, something comes along that hasn't been done before. this movie is one of those things. first of all, we have a principal character whose take on life is one where you don't judge it; you live it. i know he's a film character. it doesn't matter because we use images such as these to inspire us and to give us our own way of treating each day. forrest lets no grass grow under his feet. he is the consummate optimist. he doesn't complain because he sees early on that it does you no good. his life is one adventure after another, in and out of the public eye, but his shyness and demeanor don't ever get to his head. he is the epitome of patience, something sadly lacking in the lives of most americans. he is pushed around by the gusts of time and always lands on his feet. his relationship with a troubled girl is the one consistent thing in his life, and that is also shows his pugnaciousness. there are some commentators and reviewers who call this character stupid. he is a slow processor, but his stability lies in his morality and his consistency. his mother raised him well. tom hanks has become our new jimmy stewart. his roles are about human emotion and dedication. he is the everyman in many ways. obviously, the subject matter has changed, but you can bank on his decision making when it comes to film. the other heroes are the special effects people. they are able to make this work; to create an incredible world for him to function within. the news clips are quite marvelous. i usually put this film in my top ten.";7 April 2006;10;['principal', 'such', 'own', 'forr', 'consummate', 'good', 'public', 'most', 'troubled', 'consistent', 'stupid', 'slow', 'new', 'human', 'many', 'subject', 'other', 'special', 'able', 'incredible', 'marvelous', 'top'];0.2500919913419913
6;Horst_In_Translation;"20 years after ""forrest gump"" came out, i decided to rewatch this one and it was even better than what i remembered from watching it the first time. the film won 6 academy awards in 1995, including best picture, best director (robert zemeckis, ""back to the future""-trilogy, ""cast away"" again with hanks later on) and best actor (2nd win in a row for hanks after ""philadelphia""). and even if it lost ""best score"" to ""the lion king"", the music, especially the main theme, is nothing short of brilliant. it starts right away as we watch a feather fly towards the film's central character. visually and acoustically a feast from minute one. forrest sits on a bench waiting for the bus and tells his story to the other people who are waiting. thank god he did not know that he could just walk to jenny, otherwise we may have never found out about his stories. and as diverse as forrest's life is, as diverse are also the reactions from those people. some sit quietly, others accuse him of being a liar and the old lady finally is captivated by his story. the interesting thing is that gump gets out the photo as evidence not before the man (who accuses him of lying) leaves. he could have proved it easily, but he has nothing to prove to anybody. this is the frame of the story. the real action takes place in the stories gump tells. some true emotional highlights are included: bubba's death and the funeral eulogy to jenny (great hi. reference by the way) at the end. of course, all the moments with his son (played by the very young haley joel osment) are very much worth watching too. and then there is gary sinise who was pretty much on par with hanks during their comedic and dramatic moments together. he did not win the oscar, but was at least as deserving as landau and jackson. with his character, early on, you could never say if he would develop into a friend to gump or stay/become a big antagonist. finally, it turned out to be the former. when they have prostitutes one night at their place, it becomes truly clear for the very first time. gump serves as a great role model to sinise's character for all he achieved despite his limitations. this is not the greatest movie ever made, but there is a certain charm to it that makes it so unique in movie history, possibly because the central character is at least as unique. and finally, there is the forrest-jenny love story which is sweet from start to finish and one of the main reasons why this film will make you laugh, will make you cry and will make you feel for forrest for its almost 2.5 hours . and even in the almost impossible case that you will not remain interested in forrest's story, this film is very much worth watching alone for all the references to past decades (most of all in terms of the movements in society, music and politics).

8;classicsoncall;"for anyone who grew up in the turbulent sixties, ""forrest gump"" delivers a clever blend of nostalgia mixed with a uniquely creative view of history as experienced by a presumed to be simpleton. while tom hanks' character recalls his life with a slow tangy drawl, he variously entertains and educates a host of passengers waiting for the next bus to their intended destination. some ignore him, some show interest, one even scorns gump's tale of getting rich in the shrimping business, only to depart before forrest has a chance to pull out his copy of fortune magazine. life can be like that for those unwilling to listen and learn, casting doubt instead of exploring the truth and keeping an open mind. i got a kick out of forrest's string of brushes with greatness - the way he taught elvis how to shake his hips, his unquestioning response to lbj's inquiry about his war injury, and the way his war time experience inspired john lennon to write 'imagine'. there was also that ingenious sequence in which he meets president nixon, then inadvertently tips off the watergate scandal. however the most understated and easiest reference to miss was the clever homage paid to the 1969 film ""midnight cowboy"", when forrest wheels lieutenant dan (gary sinise) across busy city traffic, and is narrowly missed by a taxi cab. lt. dan's response was ""hey, i'm walkin' here"", just the way ratso rizzo did in that earlier film. all that with the 'everybody talking at me' movie theme seamlessly woven in as so many songs of that era were utilized with other aspects of the story. for forrest gump, life is not a pretentious path to wealth or fame, but a never ending quest to learn and be a productive human being. not to mention finding one's own true love. for forrest, life long friend jenny (robin wright) represents an unfulfilled ideal, one he accepts into his heart while still a young schoolboy and nurturing that relationship platonically throughout his adulthood. for her part, jenny represents a youthful quest for experiencing life to the fullest, only to make a series of wrong choices that lead her to the brink of suicide. it's fitting that jenny eventually realizes what forrest knew all along, that they were made for each other even if outward appearances seemed to dictate otherwise. i've seen this film only a couple times in the past, thinking it was good, but only considering it for it's entertainment value. i guess one of the benefits of getting older is the insight one gains with experiencing life a day at a time and steady as she goes. my viewing of the picture today gave me a greater appreciation for the subtleties offered in the film, and leads me to believe the world would be a better place if there were a little more of forrest gump in all of us.";12 June 2011;10;['turbulent', 'forr', 'clever', 'creative', 'slow', 'tangy', 'next', 'rich', 'forr', 'unwilling', 'open', 'forr', 'ingenious', 'understated', 'easy', 'clever', 'forr', 'busy', 'walkin', 'early', 'many', 'other', 'forr', 'pretentious', 'productive', 'human', 'own', 'true', 'forr', 'long', 'unfulfilled', 'young', 'youthful', 'full', 'wrong', 'fitting', 'forr', 'other', 'outward', 'good', 'old', 'steady', 'great', 'well', 'little', 'more', 'forr'];0.1869252873563218

(""you didn't do anything wrong, forrest,"" says wright, after he discovered he fathered her child out-of-wedlock); 2 - a blatant anti-gun agenda in which every political shooting is duly noted, along with yet another cheap shot made against richard nixon, hollywood's favorite villain; 3 - the lord's name in vain used 21 times within a 49-minute period, mostly gds by sinise. overall, the ""good"" far outweighs the ""bad,"" making this a truly memorable movie and one that is fairly unfairly blasted by a lot of ""critics."" maybe they didn't like the '60s radicals portrayed in a negative light. that's too bad. i owned this dvd and got rid of it. i'm sorry i did because i'd watch it again and i've seen it three times. love it or hate it - you don't forget it.";16 March 2006;8;['good', 'bad', 'many', 'good', 'good', 'unique', 'lead', 'forr', 'good', 'numerous', 'memorable', 'excellent', 'interesting', 'solid', 'sally', 'realistic', 'unflattering', 'sweet', 'bad', 'liberal', 'fine', 'good', 'wrong', 'forr', 'blatant', 'anti', 'gun', 'political', 'cheap', 'favorite', 'good', 'bad', 'memorable', 'negative', 'bad', 'sorry'];0.1717261904761905

""forrest gump"" unfolds in savannah, georgia, as the eponymous character narrates the story of his life in a number of flashbacks. indeed, two-thirds of the action takes place with forrest on the bench relating his exploits to other people waiting for their bus. the first time that we see young forrest, he has just been fitted with a pair of leg braces at the doctor's office while his mother (sally fields of ""norma ray"") watches. she is determined to see to it that father-less forrest gets to live as normal a life as possible. the school principal (sam anderson of ""la bamba"") fails to convince her that forrest's low i.q. of 75 means that he should not attend regular school classes. despite forrest's intellectual's shortcomings, mrs. gump persuades the principal to permit forrest to enroll in normal classes by having loud, noisy sex with him. the next time that we see young forrest (newcomer michael humphreys) he hesitates about climbing aboard the school bus because he doesn't know the bus driver and has been warned by his mother not to accept rides from strangers. the driver and forrest introduce themselves to each other and he steps aboard because they are now no longer strangers. forrest meets his first best friend jenny curran when she is the only student riding the bus who will let him sit beside her. later, forrest meets his second best friend on his way to military boot camp when bubba makes room for him to sit beside him after others have turned him away. jenny and forrest cultivate their friendship to the point that other students decide to attack forrest. initially, these obnoxious kids throw rocks at forrest while he is walking home with jenny. ""run, forrest, run,"" screams jenny to our hero as the kids hurl more rocks and pursue him on their bicycles. forrest takes off running and his braces disintegrate and he breaks into a loping stride that the kids on their bikes cannot match. the first chronological transition from young forrest to tom hanks as forrest occurs when the same kidsonly olderattack forrest and jenny (robin wright of ""the princess bride"") and try to run him down in their pick-up truck. again, forrest outruns them and scrambles through a practice scrimmage that alabama football coach bear bryant (sonny shroyer of ""gator"") is holding. forrest winds up in college, joins the football and scores touchdowns for the alabama crimson tide. during his stay at alabama, forrest is exposed to the famous stance in the doorway by real-life alabama governor george wallace when the university of alabama was integrated by african-american students. as one of the black students is entering the school, she drops a book and forrest retrieves it on camera. later, forrest visits the white house, drinks 15 dr. pepper sodas, and gets to shake hands with the real president john f. kennedy. meanwhile, jenny has grown up, left her abusive father to live with another person, and ends up in an all-girls' school. forrest shows up and beats up jenny's date because he thinks that the guy is getting rough with her. jenny gives forrest his first sexual experience. she cups his hand over her breast and he blows a gasket while jenny's roommateapparently asleeplistens in horror as forrest admits that he has messed up the roommate's bathrobe. jenny informs forrest that she wants to become a folk singer like her idol joan baez. forrest joins the u.s. army and takes a furlough to memphis, tennessee, to see jenny perform folk songs on stage. forrest knows that jenny got expelled from her college for posing nude in a 'girls of the south' issue of playboy magazine, but he isn't prepared for what he sees when she performs in the nude singing a bob dylan song. when a spectator heckles jenny, forrest comes to her rescue. significantly, the film pioneered some revolutionary techniques, such as inserting a live actor into historic archival footage of important events as well as enabling oscar nominated actor gary sinise to appear convincing as a handicapped vietnam veteran who has lost both legs in combat. if the structure of ""forrest gump"" is reminiscent of david fincher's recent opus ""the curious case of benjamin button,"" this is no surprise because eric roth penned scripts for both ""forrest gump"" as well as ""benjamin button."" roth got an oscar for his adaptation of winston groom's novel. not surprisingly, ""forrest gump"" was awarded oscars for best visual effects. interestingly, paramount pictures produced this film for $55-million dollars and coined over $600 million dollars from it domestically as well as internationally.";1 November 2009;10;['forr', 'epic', 'rural', 'several', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'insightful', 'forr', 'bright', 'forr', 'good', 'forr', 'eponymous', 'forr', 'other', 'first', 'young', 'forr', 'sally', 'determined', 'forr', 'normal', 'possible', 'forr', 'low', 'regular', 'forr', 'normal', 'loud', 'noisy', 'next', 'young', 'forr', 'forr', 'other', 'forr', 'first', 'good', 'only', 'forr', 'second', 'good', 'military', 'forr', 'other', 'forr', 'obnoxious', 'forr', 'forr', 'more', 'forr', 'first', 'chronological', 'young', 'forr', 'forr', 'same', 'forr', 'forr', 'sonny', 'forr', 'crimson', 'forr', 'famous', 'real', 'african', 'american', 'black', 'forr', 'forr', 'real', 'abusive', 'forr', 'rough', 'forr', 'first', 'sexual', 'forr', 'forr', 'forr', 'nude', 'forr', 'revolutionary', 'such', 'live', 'historic', 'important', 'convincing', 'handicapped', 'forr', 'reminiscent', 'recent', 'curious', 'forr', 'forr', 'good', 'visual', 'paramount'];0.1858939393939394

30;Wuchakk;"year of release: 1994 writers: winston groom (novel) and eric roth (screenplay) director: robert zemeckis runtime: 2 hours 22 minutes i haven't seen this film for about 7 years or so. seeing it again i was reminded why this is one of my all-time favorite pictures. the plot: tom hanks plays forrest gump, a mildly retarded alabaman who brushes shoulders with the key figures and events of the 50s through the early 80s. due to hard work, focus and uncommon wisdom he is hugely successful at whatever he does (running, war hero, ping pong, shrimp fishing). meanwhile, the one woman he loves in all the world, jenny (robin wright penn), flounders through life hopelessly trying to find fulfillment in the drug culture with all the wrong people. ""forrest gump"" is hugely entertaining on every level. it's a drama that skillfully includes both lighter, comedic moments and serious, tragic elements. if you've never seen it, don't think for a second that this is some average romantic comedy or goofball comedy. far from it. i don't watch the acadamy awards or give any credence to their judgment (""american beauty,"" best picture? please) but ""forrest gump"" is one instance where they were absolutely right in regard to the best picture award. some have criticized the film as an imbecilic fantasy, arguing that a simpleton like gump would never become successful. it's true that the picture exaggerates forrest's successes and experiences, and in that sense it's not realistic, but the film plainly reveals why he experienced continued success throughout his life. we can all learn from these little gems of wisdom: -- whatever your i.q., zero in on the areas for which you have a real talent. -- focus on those gifts and master them. in other words, don't be a jack of all trades. this is in line with the russian proverb: ""if you chase 8 rabbits you'll catch none."" -- mastering your talents will take hard work (which explains why lazy people are never wealthy, unless they inherit it). -- whatever you do, do it with all your heart. -- love deeply and cultivate deep loyalties (e.g. jenny, bubba & lt. dan). loyalty is underrated. -- be patient and slow to judge (unless someone abuses another person). -- allow others the freedom to choose and make mistakes, even if it seems like it takes forever for them to learn from them. -- if something or someone stinks, reject it and stay away from it (remember the prostitute?). -- keep your word. -- pray and have faith. -- keep a humble spirit no matter how successful or great you become. we can also learn lessons from jenny: trying to attain fulfillment through loose sex and foreign substances is a lost cause. recognize and embrace those who have your best interests in mind (i.e. those who truly love you and are loyal to you); stay away from people who use and abuse you. from lt. dan (gary sinise) we learn a potent lesson about struggling with god to find true peace, success and reconciliation. dan's all-out fight with god on the shrimp boat in the storm is potent and real. the great men and women of the bible experienced intense struggles with god: most of the book of job shows job arguing with the almighty and wanting to put him on trial for crimes against humanity (!!); when god finally answers him job falls to his face in humility and reverence. jacob fought with god all night; the next day the lord changed his name to israel, which means ""struggles with god"" (genesis 32:22-30). also, remember jesus' struggle with god and his will in the garden of gethsemane? another thing we can learn from lt. dan is that he was able to recognize a ""golden connection"" in forrest. no one makes it alone, no one. they had help. despite forrest's lack of academic smarts, dan recognized his wisdom and greatness; it attracted him and he respected it. because of his link to gump he became hugely successful. remember: ""one day of favor is worth a lifetime of labor."" late in the film you'll see lt. dan and his asian fiance at gump's wedding. note how dan looks at forrest when they greet each other. dan shows the utmost love and respect for gump and is in utter awe of his simple-minded greatness. (this is great acting on sinise's part). ""forrest gump"" is a film gem to be relished on many levels. not only will you be incredibly entertained, you may learn a thing or two.";11 March 2014;9;['favorite', 'forr', 'retarded', 'key', 'early', 'hard', 'uncommon', 'successful', 'wrong', 'forr', 'entertaining', 'lighter', 'comedic', 'serious', 'tragic', 'average', 'romantic', 'acadamy', 'american', 'good', 'forr', 'right', 'good', 'imbecilic', 'successful', 'true', 'forr', 'realistic', 'continued', 'little', 'real', 'other', 'russian', 'hard', 'lazy', 'wealthy', 'deep', 'underrated', 'patient', 'slow', 'humble', 'successful', 'great', 'loose', 'foreign', 'lost', 'good', 'loyal', 'potent', 'true', 'out', 'potent', 'real', 'great', 'intense', 'most', 'next', 'able', 'golden', 'forr', 'forr', 'academic', 'successful', 'worth', 'asian', 'forr', 'other', 'utmost', 'utter', 'simple', 'minded', 'great', 'forr', 'many'];0.194662727209897

32;Aaron1375;"this movie had its humorous moments, but with that came way to many sappy scenes and suffice to say i did not love this movie. nothing i hated, but nothing i try to watch when i see it on the television either. the story revolves around the character of the title forrest gump of course. it basically goes through different parts of his life and shows how a very simple man led a rather astonishing life. a rather unrealistic life filled with a bit to much melodrama for my tastes. i can see why others like this movie, but once again just not really my type of movie. tom hanks is good in the lead role and i also thought gary sinese was good in his role too, however i did not care for the character of jenny as she just ticked me off to no end. the film is also better in some places than other as the film really has a rather disjointed feel to it. it goes from here to there and is not hard to follow at times though it just feels like a patchwork movie. the vietnam portion of the film to me was the highlight, here the comedy was good and even the drama worked too. other sections of the film at times just felt to underdeveloped. here is forrest entering college, now he is done two minutes later, here is forrest playing ping pong, now he is back washington d.c. at a black panther party. like i said it has its moments, but for me it was a bit to all over the place like they tried to get everything that was in the book up on screen. and as short as some of this segments were you then have a rather lengthy scene of just him running, though that one was rather good even though it was simple. i will never see how this film beat out ""true lies"" for the best special effects oscar, i was not overly impressed with the scenes forrest was inserted in as it simply looked like they animated the mouths of those he was supposed to be meeting and they sort of stuck him in there using file footage of john f. kennedy for example. i just thought it was just a bit better technique used than that of a steve martin film ""dead men don't wear plaid"". overall it was okay, but just not going to be in my personal top 100 movies of all time.";8 July 2010;6;['humorous', 'many', 'sappy', 'forr', 'different', 'simple', 'astonishing', 'unrealistic', 'much', 'good', 'lead', 'good', 'well', 'other', 'disjointed', 'hard', 'good', 'other', 'underdeveloped', 'forr', 'forr', 'black', 'short', 'lengthy', 'good', 'simple', 'true', 'good', 'special', 'impressed', 'forr', 'well', 'dead', 'okay', 'personal'];0.2521221532091097
33;Sylviastel;when i hear the music, i think of how wonderful the world can truly be if there were more forrest gumps out there. when the film came out, it was truly breathtaking. it showed that the great and talented tom hanks can perform anything. had this film been released a year before? he would have probably have gotten his first academy award for best actor. truthfully, his role in philadelphia was good but not forrest gump. we don't really remember much of the role in the previous film except that he played a philadelphia attorney dying of aids and suing for justice for his termination. while the film, philadelphia is good. it's not forrest gump. what separates forrest gump from philadelphia is that there is so much more going on around the character. i think it's a shame that sally field did not get an academy award nomination for best supporting actress for playing his mother and robin wright also did not get a nomination for best supporting actress for playing the love of forrest's life. they were some of the best female performances of that year alone. when you hear the music or the soundtrack, you are reminded of the some of the most memorable moments in movie history of a truly remarkable character named forrest gump. gary sinise was also worth mentioning because he was nominated for best supporting actor as the man's vietnam comrade who he saved. that touching moment of when forrest realizes his gratitude for saving his life is still chilling and touching and remarkable like the film.;26 January 2006;10;['wonderful', 'forr', 'breathtaking', 'great', 'talented', 'first', 'good', 'good', 'forr', 'much', 'previous', 'good', 'forr', 'forr', 'more', 'sally', 'good', 'good', 'forr', 'good', 'female', 'memorable', 'remarkable', 'forr', 'worth', 'good', 'touching', 'forr', 'touching', 'remarkable'];0.584920634920635
34;JamesHitchcock;"""forrest gump"" was the ""big film"" of 1994, being both a huge commercial success and the winner of six academy awards, including best picture, best director for robert zemeckis and best actor for tom hanks. it tells the story of a man and his journey through life, and is told using a framework device in which the title character narrates his life-story to a succession of people seated next to him at a bus stop. forrest is a young man from alabama, probably born some time during the 1940s, although the timeline is rather confusing. he suffers from what would today be described as ""learning difficulties"", although his athletic abilities win him a place in college on a football scholarship. the film follows him though his college days and his time in the army during the vietnam war, where he is awarded the medal of honor for his heroism in saving the lives of several members of his platoon. after leaving the army, forrest becomes a leading ping-pong player, playing against chinese teams in ""ping-pong diplomacy"". (the sport is always referred to as ""ping-pong"" in the film, even though its players normally prefer ""table-tennis""). he then goes into the shrimping business and, more by luck than judgement, ends up making a fortune, becoming head of the ""bubba gump shrimp company"", named after himself and an army friend killed in the war. (in a curious example of reality imitating fiction, there now actually is a seafood restaurant chain of that name). on a whim, forrest decides to go for a run, and ends up running for three and a half years, crossing america from coast to coast several times during that period. a feature of the film is its hero's meetings with the great and the good; he gets to meet three presidents (kennedy, johnson and nixon) and other celebrities such as elvis presley and john lennon. these scenes were achieved not by using actors but rather by using special effects to insert images of tom hanks into old television and newsreel footage. one of its oscars was for best visual effects. such effects seem to be a common feature of zemeckis' films; others such as ""who framed roger rabbit?"", ""death becomes her"" and ""what lies beneath"" are also notable for creative use of cgi. contrasting with forrest's story is that of the great love of his life, his childhood sweetheart jenny. whereas he leads an essentially conservative lifestyle, she embraces the counterculture of the sixties, all radical politics, drugs and promiscuous sex. eventually she marries forrest while suffering from a mysterious virus (presumed to be hiv, but never named in the film as such), and dies shortly afterwards. this contrast has led to political controversy and to allegations that the film promotes conservative values. the conservative simpleton prospers, whereas the left-wing intellectual does not. the wages of radicalism are death. certainly, the film takes the standard liberal line on issues such as racial integration and the vietnam war, but by 1994 these issues lay two decades in the past. culturally, its politics are much more conservative. hanks's dictum that ""the film is non-political and thus non-judgemental"" has never convinced me. there is, for example, a lot of satire at the expense of the perceived hypocrisies of the hippie movement, such as jenny's boyfriend who is against violence in vietnam but not in his private life, regularly beating her up. ""forrest gump"" was one of the films in which hanks, seen in the eighties primarily as a comedy star, managed to reinvent himself as a serious actor in the nineties, and brought him his the second of his two successive ""best actor"" oscars. he is certainly good here, much better than he was in, say, ""the bonfire of the vanities"" or ""a league of their own"", two earlier films in which he had tried to take on more serious roles. he plays forrest as a sort of holy fool, a man whose simplicity allows his inner goodness and decency to shine through. the character became something of a cult hero, and some of his nuggets of cracker-barrel philosophy, such as ""life is like a box of chocolates. you never know what you're gonna get"" have passed into popular culture. (in fact, most chocolate manufacturers provide a guide to their selections, so you always know exactly what you're gonna get, but we'll let that pass). the film itself is a reasonably good one, even if its morality as sometimes rather simplistic, using forrest's holy fool persona as a means of commenting on the politics and culture of late 20th century america. zemeckis manages the difficult feat of pulling off a delicate balancing act between comedy and tragedy without the resulting mixture ever seeming incongruous. yet i have never regarded it as the best film of 1994, being merely a good film in a year which saw a number of very good, even great, ones such as ""the shawshank redemption"", ""four weddings and a funeral"", ""the madness of king george"", ""la reine margot"" and ""nell"" (which would have been my personal choice for ""best picture""). hanks' performance is good, but not as good as nigel hawthorne's in ""king george"". i suspect that the film's immense success may have been due less to its merits than to the way in which its perceived conservatism fitted the public mood in 1994, the year of the so-called republican revolution which saw the republicans take control of both houses of congress. 7/10";13 July 2009;7;['forr', 'big', 'huge', 'commercial', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'forr', 'young', 'confusing', 'athletic', 'several', 'forr', 'chinese', 'more', 'curious', 'forr', 'several', 'great', 'other', 'such', 'special', 'old', 'good', 'visual', 'such', 'common', 'such', 'notable', 'creative', 'forr', 'great', 'childhood', 'conservative', 'radical', 'promiscuous', 'forr', 'mysterious', 'such', 'political', 'conservative', 'conservative', 'left', 'standard', 'liberal', 'such', 'racial', 'conservative', 'non', 'political', 'non', 'judgemental', 'such', 'private', 'forr', 'serious', 'successive', 'good', 'good', 'well', 'own', 'early', 'serious', 'forr', 'holy', 'inner', 'cult', 'such', 'popular', 'most', 'good', 'simplistic', 'forr', 'holy', 'late', 'difficult', 'delicate', 'incongruous', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'great', 'such', 'la', 'personal', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'immense', 'due', 'less', 'public', 'republican'];0.1964096749811035
35;blanbrn;"""forrest gump"" certainly has to be one of the most heart touching and emotional films that brought joys to the masses over the years. people misjudge it though as a film about a dumb retarded boy named forrest, yet i see it as a much different take as it proves it's okay to be different and slow and do things at your own pace and let things come to you and then good things will happen in life. tom hanks is great as forrest gump as the film spans a life period from forrest's childhood to his growing up, starting with his humble start in a small alabama town with his mother(wonderfully done by sally field). from the start forrest was different as his mother taught him to see the world and life as a box of chocolates, not knowing what your ever gonna get. yet by the hardships and for the way that forrest was made fun of his determination and will would spark him on a life of unexpected but deserved greatness. from his college attending at the university of alabama to his football playing to fighting in war, and making new friends to meeting the presidents! also touching is his heartfelt relationship with life love jenny(robin wright penn). the direction and camera work and special effects of the way the film is crafted by robert zemeckis is brilliant and fabulous it makes the film move well from time period to time period. most of all this film brings the message to me that destiny is often a piece of crap and life many times just goes and happens at random. most of all it's okay to be different and it proves no matter how different that just by being simple many things can be accomplished, and that with faith and determination with god anything is possible.

39;DKosty123;"while this one rates as the premiere performance on film of tom hanks, i think one thing that prevents it from being an all time best film is the entertainment factor. robert zemekis direction efforts are always solid entertaining films (with the exception of a few of the remakes he has done in recent years which thankfully are getting buried without ceremony). tom hanks is not just gump in this movie but he is the narrator for pretty much the whole film. if they had stuck with the book this is based on, there would have been a lot of missing drama. would this movie be as effective if the drama was a lot less? i think it would be. the death of jenny while making for a dramatic ending does not really add to the film other than making you reach for the hankies. for a zemekis film, this one is slower moving than most. it pulls at the heart strings as gump is presented as a stupid person who lucks into many historic moments by accident. really, gump is not stupid, just slow & partnered for much of the film with his commanding officer from the service, a double leg amputee, there is a good chemistry between these characters. there is the dream girl jenny. gump claims to always be thinking of her. good touches in the film include the party with the girls & the guys where forrest breaks up the party by complaining that the one girl trying to make out with him tastes like cigarettes. there is the simile of ""life is like a box of chocolates"" which is the most quoted line of this movie. too many folks don't like the reading of politics into this, so don't look for this. if you just sit back & enjoy the story telling & not look for holes in the plot, then everything is fine. the same applies to the back to the future series zemekis directed. the plots in many of his films are full of holes when you analyze them. so don't do it, why get a headache when you don't need too.";25 September 2010;8;['premiere', 'good', 'solid', 'entertaining', 'few', 'recent', 'whole', 'effective', 'less', 'dramatic', 'other', 'most', 'stupid', 'many', 'historic', 'stupid', 'slow', 'much', 'double', 'good', 'good', 'forr', 'many', 'fine', 'same', 'future', 'many', 'full'];0.1336666666666666

""would you like a choc'-uh-lut?"" you feel like slapping the guy. then taking his darn ""walkin' shoes"" and throwing them in a pool of gasoline and lighting them on fire. along with his box of chocolates. forrest's smug attitude is a bit too self-knowing for my tastes. it's like he's saying a big screw-you to all the people who disagree. he's uncle sam's favorite american - the dumb guy who was too stoo-pid to say no to the government, and in return was awarded with millions of dollars and a happy, content life. all the vietnam protesters were pigs, praise america. as far as ""retard"" characters go, dustin hoffman is still my favorite. leonardo dicaprio in ""what's eating gilbert grape?"" is really good, too. but hanks' performance is just a bit too self-confident and mugging - it's too damn innocent and naive. as i said, this used to be one of my very favorite movies. i loved it. it used to move me to tears at times. (well, almost, anyway.) but i guess i've given my inner cynic too much room to grow - now i see it as a smug, annoying little journey through america's pop culture - with a message at its core that says, ""don't mess with america - or you'll get the gump."" america has enough blind love going already.";5 September 2005;6;['second', 'dem', 'magic', 'inner', 'cynic', 'forr', 'last', 'few', 'bitter', 'few', 'delightful', 'warm', 'inspiring', 'epic', 'top', 'favorite', 'last', 'smug', 'conscious', 'sweet', 'poetic', 'insulting', 'nice', 'firm', 'only', 'forr', 'nice', 'full', 'righteous', 'filthy', 'skank', 'forr', 'right', 'christian', 'obsessive', 'forr', 'forr', 'last', 'good', 'smug', 'sweet', 'smug', 'big', 'favorite', 'dumb', 'happy', 'favorite', 'gilbert', 'good', 'confident', 'innocent', 'naive', 'favorite', 'inner', 'cynic', 'much', 'annoying', 'little', 'enough', 'blind'];0.1533685064935064

43;OllieSuave-007;this movie is one of tom hanks best performances. he plays forrest gump and he narrates his life about having a low iq and meeting his love interest jenny (robin wright penn). this movie it chronicles gump's experiences, by chance, with some of the most significant people and events in american history like elvis presley, jfk, lyndon johnson, richard nixon and service during the vietnam war. ulimately, he surprisingly makes huge accomplishments like being honorably discharged from the military and leading a healthy and successful lifestyle. it sends a strong message that even some people with low iq could achieve the greatest in life. forrest touched the lives of many people, without any idea what he is really achieving due to his low-iq. still, his successes like becoming a football star and saving the life of fellow soldiers are evidence of the superb acting, heartwarming events and awesome directing. there is spirit and humor in the film, which provides some comedy-relief to the turmoil of the 1960s. overall, one of the best films in cinema history and certainly worthy of its oscar wins. grade a;18 June 2007;9;['good', 'forr', 'low', 'significant', 'american', 'huge', 'healthy', 'successful', 'strong', 'low', 'great', 'forr', 'many', 'low', 'fellow', 'awesome', 'good', 'worthy'];0.4327777777777777

45;ElMaruecan82;"""forrest gump"" is one of the rare cases of cinema's magic working more than in any other artistic medium. everything is a visual delight and a triumph in the field of storytelling, from the cinematography to the editing, from zemeckis' sober direction to an extraordinary lesson of acting from tom hanks, the movie is the best picture of 1994, which is saying a lot, and one of the best american films. every film tells a story, but a few of them have this capability to penetrate your hearts and engage your emotions like ""forrest gump"". there are no villains in ""forrest gump"", no room for negativity, the only adversity consists on the many obstacles that life puts on your path, and the only form of heroism relies on the ability to overcome these obstacles, and whether you succeed or fail, the point is to keep your faith on life, and find your own alchemy to transform coal in gold. and forrest gump is the first to have overcome the handicaps that would have deprived him from a 'normal' life. the flash-back introducing sight of little forrest with his legs' braces, hand in hand with mama gump (remarkably played by sally field) would be too tragic if the script didn't rightfully choose to adopt a more lighthearted tone by making forrest gump the privileged witness of his time, of a cinematic journey in american history, with every piece of this epic puzzle connected in a way or another to him. i will never forget my first impression from the elvis presley part, the first indication of what would be the life of gump. something too promising to be eternally stuck in these handicapping braces, and the laughs work as the patient build up to a rewarding climactic moment, the miracle scene or an overwhelming celebration of the triumph of human spirit. and from this miracle, forrest gump becomes the fastest man in the world, and starts one of the most exhilarating chain of events that ever enriched a character. this is the power of forrest gump, a character defined by the way he is, the way he talks, the way he loves, defined by the events he lived, by those he underwent, and those he influenced, by the people that helped and loved him and people he helped and loved. not one-dimensional or dim-witted, gump is one of the most memorable and fascinating characters that even graced the silver screen. who can ever forget ""my name is forrest. forrest gump""? through his silent moments, gestures, speech mannerisms and tom hanks' unique talent to transcend his everyday look, gump conveys the profundity of a character affected and affecting a world in constant change, mirroring mama gump's unforgettable 'chocolate box' catchphrase. and what an epic life for an epic era, gump's talent launches his football athlete career, which gives him a ticket to college, from college to the army, where he'll become a ping pong player before converting to shrimp fishing. every achievement of forrest gump is due to someone he loves, starting with his mama who traded her dignity to provide her son the best education, jenny, his best friend whose unforgettable ""run, forrest run"" will drain the miraculous force that would change his life. and his friend bubba who'll indirectly provide the basis of gump's fortune thanks to a simple promise. and whatever forrest took, he gave it back, to his mother, to jenny, to his best friend's memory, and to lieutenant dan, who thought he had to die in the field of honor, and learned the value of life from forrest's unshakable friendship. that's why i don't get the criticism toward the film, as if forrest gump was a kind of liberal incarnation of the passive state of mind that guarantees happiness. why do people feel the need to appear so smart, to consider a movie where someone got shot in the face accidentally, superior, and it's a fan of ""pulp fiction"" speaking here. maybe, i've missed a point, but ""forrest gump"" is perfectly aware of its comedic mood that almost flirts with parody sometimes. eric roth's oscar-winning script is a kaleidoscope of all the incarnations of america in people's imagery through a glorious succession of anecdotes involving entertainment, music, politics, presidents, scandals, vietnam war, following one of the greatest cinematic soundtracks : the doors, dylan, hendrix ""forrest gump"" is a wonderful voyage to pop-culture america! and the intelligence of the script is subtly hinted in some little details like when forrest evokes his perfect integration in the army. this is pure comedy gold without any forced laughs. and as there's no better comedy than a comedy with a heart, on that level, ""forrest gump"" is so lighthearted it's almost blinding. i guess this comes from forrest's heart, so pure, so white, like the cinematic allegory of voltaire's candid. how fitting that his last job is gardener, which mirrors candid's motto that whatever happens, ""we need to cultivate our garden"". gump does cultivate his garden as a sort of dream-like presence in a very familiar universe, a dream we'd loved to reach and touch, something that floats in our minds like this beautiful feather floating on the sky. men like forrest gump are oddities only made believable through the magic of cinema with no other meaning than to inspire something pure in us. this is why any attempt to rationally analyze ""forrest gump"" and discredit its success is representative of that loss of common innocence, this cynicism people disguise in lucidity and realism, unknowing that they fall in the same trap than those who ran with gump thinking it had a meaning while forrest gump only ""felt like running"". gump didn't necessarily choose his path, but he always followed his heart, his idea of love and friendship.

54;ironhorse_iv;"based on the 1986 novel by winston groom of the same name; forrest gump is about a simple man, named forrest (tom hanks) whom with a low i.q. who goes through life, accidentally being present at many historic moments, while building success for himself, however, never getting with his true love, jenny curran (robin wright) which mostly seems to be the only thing, that is eluding him. without spoiling the movie, too much, this feel-good, financial blockbuster was indeed one of my favorite movies from the 1990s. i still quote, act out, & rewatch this movie, even with the downer tragic ending, this film has. i just can't help, loving it, despite the film changing a lot from the source material, like gump's core personality and size. i kinda like that, he's not an autistic savant. in my opinion, it would be, too jarring. it would be, really too odd and unrealistic to see him, play chess, while being an astronaut, while people still thinking that he's an idiot. i kinda like that the film primarily focuses on the first eleven chapters of the novel, before skipping ahead to the end of the book. the middle part of the book is truly outrageous with gump fighting off, cannibals, and becoming a pro-wrestler. that was way too out there to be taken seriously! the careers, he got in the film, seems more grounded with the reality of his character and the story. in addition to skipping some parts of the novel, the film adds several aspects to gump's life that do not occur in the novel, such as his needing leg braces as a child and his run across the united states. those changes really did help the film, a lot. this movie was also well shot by robert zemeckis. it made great use of its locations. i also love the use of cgi techniques to make it look like tom hanks was in some of the archive footage with various historical figures. most of the visual effects in this film were pretty impressing at the time. yet, i just wish the voice-dubbing was a little better. it doesn't really match well, with the movement of the long-dead historical figure's lips! while, the movie does have a lot of profanity, sex/nudity, drug use and violence for a pg-13. i think it somewhat works with the rebellions style of the 1960s. i also dig the film soundtrack. great use of many well-known artists of the 1950s & 1960s. it's really does fit with that era of time. also, the original music that alan silvestri made for the film was also beautiful. it fits some well in the film. not only did that work, but the acting was outstanding. tom hanks was amazing as the title character. in other hands, this dim-witted, guileless, southern-drawling simpleton hero could had turn into a bumbling yet annoying unlikeable offensive mental retarded stereotype. instead, hanks makes the fictional character, gump seem like a real person with real motives and feelings. he really did deserve the oscar, despite what some critics make say about his performance. even the supporting cast was well-done. i love all of the characters ranging from 'bubba' blue (mykelti williamson) to mrs. gump (sally fields). i even kinda like jenny, even when the writers made her, somewhat a horrible selfish trouble-person, who leaves gump with a kid that grew up to be haley joan osment in one of his first movie roles. then- who can ever forget, lt. dan taylor? this was gary sinise finest role. the character development that they gave him, was heart-breaking, yet hopeful. i love his redemption story. the film has this 'ignorance is bliss' philosophy to it; that makes the movie, fun to watch. the satire on contemporary values, during america's mid-20th century accomplishments is truly funny. the historic 'zelig' style jokes are mostly a hit than a miss to the funny. i also like how ambiguous, forrest's story, as some people believe that he might be an unreliable narrator who whitewashing american history. yet, i don't think, it's as racist or sexist as some people think, it is. the film is a lot more positive than that. forrest is a represented of what is innocence and good about the world. he has this, out right decency about himself. he helps his friends if they're in need, even if some of them, take advanced of his hospitality. forrest gump is also a surprisingly spiritual story, well-told. a lot of people has stated out, the relationship between forrest and jenny echoes the relationship of hosea and gomer in the old testament; which in return is about, the relationship between god and man. hints, the white feather that floats through forrest's life. the movie is about the question of whether we are masters of our own fate or on a path to a predetermined destiny. another thing, interesting, is how some people has been noted to see some political interpretations which i kinda have to disagree with. while, it seem like gump follows a very conservative lifestyle, jenny's life is full of counter-cultural embrace, complete with drug usage, promiscuity, and antiwar rallies, and that their eventual marriage might be a kind of reconciliation between america's extremes political points; i agree with hanks, the film was non-political and non-judgmental. forrest gump isn't about liberal or conservative values. it's about learning to live with your limitations, while also giving it, everything you got. about the film winning best picture in 1994 over films like 'the shawshank redemption' & 'pulp fiction', i think the movie deserve it. while, on the surface, those other two films look superior better and more mature. in true, 'forrest gump' has just as much to give as those films. also, it's by far, the more entertaining film of the three. overall: forrest gump is like a box of chocolates. it's super sweet.";30 July 2016;9;['same', 'forr', 'simple', 'forr', 'low', 'present', 'many', 'historic', 'true', 'only', 'good', 'financial', 'favorite', 'tragic', 'autistic', 'jarring', 'odd', 'unrealistic', 'first', 'middle', 'outrageous', 'pro', 'several', 'such', 'great', 'various', 'historical', 'most', 'visual', 'little', 'well', 'long', 'dead', 'historical', 'great', 'many', 'original', 'beautiful', 'outstanding', 'amazing', 'other', 'southern', 'annoying', 'unlikeable', 'offensive', 'mental', 'retarded', 'fictional', 'real', 'real', 'horrible', 'selfish', 'first', 'gary', 'fine', 'hopeful', 'contemporary', 'funny', 'historic', 'ambiguous', 'unreliable', 'american', 'racist', 'sexist', 'positive', 'forr', 'good', 'right', 'advanced', 'forr', 'spiritual', 'forr', 'old', 'white', 'forr', 'own', 'predetermined', 'interesting', 'political', 'conservative', 'full', 'counter', 'cultural', 'complete', 'antiwar', 'eventual', 'political', 'non', 'political', 'non', 'judgmental', 'forr', 'liberal', 'conservative', 'good', 'other', 'superior', 'well', 'mature', 'true', 'forr', 'much', 'entertaining', 'forr', 'sweet'];0.1108049814035729

59;zkonedog;"when it comes to the greatest dramatic films ever produced, ""forrest gump"" has to be near the top of that list. put succinctly, it has everything a movie could possible hold: adventure, great characters, drama, emotion, and humor. there are very few films that combine all those things with such aplomb as director robert zemeckis does with ""gump"". for a very basic summary, this movie tells the story of forrest gump (tom hanks), a man who, on the ""scale of normal"", falls a wee bit short in the intelligence department. however, via the guidance of his beloved mama (sally field), the constant wanting for childhood sweetheart- turned-wild child jenny (robin wright), and friends like bubba (mykelti williamson) and lt. dan (gary sinise), viewers are shown a life that, despite coming from such a simple mind, touches so many others. first and foremost, this is a movie that perfectly captures the angst of the baby boomers generation. throughout the course of the film, everyone takes a stand on something and refuses to budge. jenny is a hippie, lt. dan has a death wish, and even mama gump is okay with her boy selling out for u.s. ping-pong. the ultimate point made, however, is that such behavior cannot last forever and eventually one has to find their true self. that's exactly where forrest comes in, as he never loses himself to begin with. despite his simple mind, he ""knows what love is"" and shows it to everyone around him, even when they are using him for various reasons. in a swirling, turbulent world, forrest is a bastion of self-awareness (ironic, as his awareness in other life areas is so low!). in order for all those things to work, it takes the acting performance of a lifetime--exactly what hanks is able to give. there may never be a more deserved best actor oscar given to anyone, as he perfectly nails both ""goofy simpleton"" and ""emotionally self-aware adult"", often in the the same scene. as many juicy themes as there are for zemeckis to work with, this is as much a hanks masterpiece as anything else overall, ""forrest gump"" is no less than landmark cinematic effort. it captures the essence of baby boomer social struggles and does so in ways that make it timeless. much like zemeckis' earlier ""back to the future"", it is also a film in which not one scene is wasted. there is something interesting to either behold or ponder in quite literally every frame. every time i watch this movie, i appreciate it a little bit more.";4 March 2017;10;['great', 'dramatic', 'forr', 'great', 'few', 'such', 'basic', 'forr', 'normal', 'wee', 'short', 'beloved', 'constant', 'wild', 'simple', 'many', 'okay', 'ultimate', 'such', 'true', 'forr', 'simple', 'various', 'turbulent', 'forr', 'ironic', 'other', 'low', 'able', 'deserved', 'good', 'aware', 'same', 'many', 'juicy', 'much', 'forr', 'less', 'cinematic', 'social', 'timeless', 'interesting', 'little', 'more'];0.1814950980392156

61;redryan64;"attempting to write a review for this film has proved to be a very difficult job; in fact, it is probably the toughest review that we have encountered over this past decade. producing a write-up is generally on one's overall like or dislike of the film in question. consequentally, our better efforts are rated higher than others for that very reason. passionate prose requires a rationing of fist class, 'grade a' fuel; strictly high octane. that we have no really strong opinion about the worth of this now classic, oscar laden favourite, leaves us with what we fear will turn out to be a figurative stalemate, a split decision, a statistical draw. and we are reminded of former notre dame football coach frank leahy, whose eloquence in surmising what it is like to neither come out a victor, nor failing in the attempt to secure a win. to begin with, the screenplay offers the telling of the story in flashback. the occurrences of what is nearly a life's worth of really unusual happenings and very unlikely coincidences, all seem to have been mixed into an emulsion of what can only be described as some of the most important moments in american and, indeed, world history. while fully realizing that a film, no matter how good it may be, is still just a movie, escapist entertainment. it is a powerful form of fictional day dreaming; but still it's make believe, nonetheless. we are required to be entertained by the incessant recitation of the narrative of all of these events that have led up to forrest gumps reunion with his life long friend and one true love, jennie. the long, deliberate cadence of gump's delivery of this dialog is found to be very amusing, even to the most sour pussed stoic in the audience. sorry for having to throw cold water on our ongoing involvement in this mirth-fest but we really out to pause and give some serious and sober analysis to this, our cause of amusement. when asked in an interview* about how and why li'l abner creator, al capp, chose to build his comic strip around hillbilly characte5rs in a most rural setting of dogpatch, usa; his answer was delivered, quickly and in a most straight manner. al stated that the use of hillbilly characters was a nearly sure fire prescription for success. his reasoning being that the introduction of hillbilly characters makes the job of succeeding in creating the desired yuk-yuks easier because everyone feels that they are superior to these american rustics. we must also consider the characterization of forrest as being not just uncouth or ill mannered; but rather that he is truly slow or mentally deficient. he most certainly must suffer from some acute degree of mental retardation. is this what the pseudo intellectuals in the elite of tinsel town believe to be the polite and proper cause for merriment and mirth? we also detect at least a smattering of snobbishness and sanctimony. this is amplified by an unabashed utilization of patronizing preachiness, which would seam to reassure the production team's moral and intellectual superiority; at least to their way of thinking, we suppose. note: * this interview was done 1n the 1960's and published in a certain quasi-intellectual men's magazine; which also did a good business in peddling the exposition of feminine pulchritude and skin. of course, schultz and i only bought it for the articles. honest!";12 February 2011;8;['difficult', 'tough', 'past', 'overall', 'well', 'high', 'very', 'high', 'strong', 'classic', 'figurative', 'split', 'statistical', 'former', 'unusual', 'unlikely', 'important', 'good', 'powerful', 'fictional', 'incessant', 'forr', 'long', 'true', 'long', 'deliberate', 'amusing', 'sour', 'sorry', 'cold', 'ongoing', 'f', 'serious', 'sober', 'comic', 'rural', 'straight', 'hillbilly', 'sure', 'hillbilly', 'easy', 'superior', 'american', 'forr', 'uncouth', 'ill', 'mannered', 'slow', 'deficient', 'acute', 'mental', 'polite', 'proper', 'least', 'unabashed', 'moral', 'intellectual', 'least', 'certain', 'quasi', 'intellectual', 'good', 'feminine', 'honest'];0.0709643738977072

72;dee.reid;"""forrest gump,"" 1994's controversial and acclaimed best picture oscar winner and is itself adapted from the novel by winston groom, is the simple story of a simple man and the not-so-simple world he is born into. tom hanks is the title character, a southerner with an iq of 75, who as a boy is handicapped by a crooked back and forced to wear leg braces. raised by his mother (sally field) to not let the world hold him back, she does the regrettable and sleeps with a school's principal to get him enrolled. his first days are hard-luck, but that changes when he lays eyes on the beautiful jenny, and the two become close friends, even through high school, when she is now played by robin wright penn. once graduating high school, forrest is encouraged to go to college, where he becomes a football star and is drafted into the united states army upon graduation. forrest's limited intelligence to the situation renders him blind to the vietnam conflict, where his service is guaranteed. he's unaware of the growing resentment towards the war, but his heroic actions to save comrades including hardened veteran lt. dan (gary sinise) and best friend bubba (mykelti williamson) during an ambush by the vc one day encourage a medal of honor award. thus, the world as we know it is seen through the eyes of this simple man who leads an extraordinary journey through some of america's roughest periods: the 1960s through the late '70s. all of this is fickle to him, as his one true love jenny continues to evade him (even though they see one another sporadically over the years, and their encounters are often very brief) and her life becomes increasing less than pleasant. ""forrest gump"" is one of the best movies for a reason: when all hell was breaking loose during radical times of change, one man saw it as a little more than nothing. his unwitting triumphs over the years - football star, war hero, medal of honor recipient, white house honorary guest, millionaire businessman, international ping pong champion, and ultimately, father - are extraordinary to everybody else except him, simply because he's too stupid to realize the significance of his actions. directed by robert zemeckis, everything about ""forrest gump"" is classic and beautiful. from hanks's brilliant and nuanced performance, to the oscar-winning special effects (the insertion of hanks into archival media footage; the digital erasure of sinise's legs to make the audience believe he's a real amputee) to the closing credits, it shines and will forever remain shining as a modern american classic piece of cinema. though forrest himself may not know it, he's found one of the greatest fans in this writer. he's a true inspiration that nothing is impossible regardless of one's intelligence. his message is that nothing can hold you back except you. it's a dream come true from anyone's perspective. 10/10";2 June 2006;10;['forr', 'controversial', 'good', 'simple', 'simple', 'simple', 'crooked', 'regrettable', 'first', 'beautiful', 'close', 'high', 'high', 'forr', 'limited', 'blind', 'unaware', 'heroic', 'good', 'simple', 'extraordinary', 'rough', 'late', 'fickle', 'true', 'brief', 'less', 'pleasant', 'forr', 'good', 'loose', 'radical', 'little', 'more', 'unwitting', 'international', 'extraordinary', 'stupid', 'forr', 'classic', 'beautiful', 'brilliant', 'special', 'digital', 'real', 'modern', 'american', 'classic', 'forr', 'great', 'true', 'impossible', 'true'];0.1997926478283621
73;CubsandCulture;let me start with the aspects of the film i like. hanks' performance is utterly believable and touching. he makes forrest seem utterly believable and sympathetic in spite of the cognitive challenges the man faces. the emotional climax of the story-forrest visiting a person's grave-is very moving and it gives the appearance of grace to the entire film. likewise, forrest the character is a unique take on an american life and at least on the basic level of nostalgia i can get beyond his story. lt. dan and jenny, to a far lesser degree, are also good characters. apart from that there isn't much to like about this film. the main problem is the film has a cheap homespun conservatism to it that feels utterly banal and hateful to the social upheavals and yes progress of the 60's-70's. the film goes out of its way-literally at times-to mute liberal messages and its treatment of leftists (dysfunctional all according to the film) is off putting. it is not so much wrong as unbelievably disconnected to the history. jenny's fate is especially cringe inducing in light of this aspect. technically the film hasn't aged well. the special effects to insert forrest into archival footage doesn't really work anymore. the feather looks really fake at the beginning of the film as well. it is a little baffling that this beat out 4 great films at the oscars.;5 February 2019;5;['believable', 'touching', 'forr', 'believable', 'sympathetic', 'cognitive', 'emotional', 'forr', 'entire', 'forr', 'unique', 'american', 'least', 'basic', 'less', 'good', 'much', 'main', 'cheap', 'banal', 'hateful', 'social', 'liberal', 'wrong', 'disconnected', 'special', 'forr', 'fake', 'little', 'great'];0.1370464852607709
74;ackstasis;"forrest gump is a good-natured simpleton. his below-average iq has restricted him (some might say protected him) from understanding the intricacies of the world he inhabits, and so he is oblivious to the hate and prejudice of american society. robert zemeckis (cast away, back to the future) and multiple academy-award winner tom hanks (philadelphia, saving private ryan) present us with the world as seen through the eyes of forrest gump, in one of the most powerful stories ever committed to screen. though he may not be the smartest person in the world, forrest gump has achieved some amazing things. aside from meeting three different american presidents and becoming a world ping-pong champion, forrest has also been awarded the congressional medal of honour for his courage during the vietnam war, run across the country several times over (because he ""just felt like running""), inspired elvis presley to invent a new type of dance and exposed the watergate scandal. at the heart of the film is a love-story. forrest and his life-long companion, jenny (robin wright penn- hurlyburly, the singing detective), are two completely different people, and jenny knows that he deserves better, but forrest loves her anyway.

83;jimbo-53-186511;tom hanks has proved over the years that he is a talented and versatile actor and his performance as forrest gump is easily one of his best (only his performance in philadelphia was better in my opinion from his films i've seen). but it's not only hanks performance that makes this film remarkable, but the story itself. forrest gump is an unintelligent man, but he has a heart of gold. we get to learn about his life story and everything from childhood, his college years to his service in the army in vietnam to his eventual marriage to jenny. we get to see gump's struggles through life as he is picked on for being unintelligent and we also get to see some happy moments in the 2 strong friendships gump forms with one of his army buddies (bubba) in vietnam and his childhood friend and eventually his wife jenny. what is also great about forrest gump? the fact that we are presented with a central character who we can sympathise with. it is all too easy sometimes for film makers and their writers to create characters who we are supposed to care about, but we start out hating, and hate them throughout the film and then hate them at the end. this is not the case with the character of 'forrest gump' it is impossible not to like forrest as he shows that although he isn't bright, he is still capable of showing his emotions and empathy towards others i.e his protectiveness for jenny, and when he rescues most of his platoon in vietnam. whilst forrest gump is a serious film, it does have many funny moments like when jenny tells forrest gump that she has a son called forrest and that she named him after his dad and forrest gump turns round and says 'he's got a daddy called forrest too'. obviously she then tells him that forrest is his son. is this film perfect? not quite - forrest gump's continual running seemed pointless to me, although it was fun to watch. forrest gump is a wonderful film with a basic story about the life of a truly remarkable person and is well worth your time.;13 April 2013;9;['talented', 'versatile', 'forr', 'good', 'well', 'remarkable', 'forr', 'unintelligent', 'eventual', 'unintelligent', 'happy', 'strong', 'great', 'forr', 'central', 'easy', 'forr', 'impossible', 'forr', 'bright', 'capable', 'most', 'forr', 'serious', 'many', 'funny', 'forr', 'forr', 'forr', 'forr', 'forr', 'perfect', 'forr', 'continual', 'pointless', 'fun', 'forr', 'wonderful', 'basic', 'remarkable', 'worth'];0.3152777777777777

90;davidmvining;gosh, some people really love this movie, and there's no way to convince me that a lot of that isn't due to nostalgia on the part of the audience. the main character's journey functions as a survey of the 60s, prime material for baby boomers to relive their early days in heartwarming package. i...did not live through the 60s. i do not share this love for the period, so i think that explains some of my more muted reaction. it's a fine little movie with a strong central character and very good technical merits (not that i would expect anything less from robert zemeckis), but the survey elements of the history end up feeling shallow to me. so, forrest gump is sitting on a park bench in savannah, waiting for the bus, and he begins to tell his life story to the quiet nurse sitting next to him. he's a man of less than average intelligence who has lived a more than average life. he influenced elvis's dancing when he came to stay at forrest's mother's bed and breakfast house in alabama once. he played for bear bryant on the university of alabama's football team. he interacted with the first black students at the university of alabama right after the national guard forced george wallace to allow them in. he shook hands with jfk. he went to vietnam. he got shot. he played ping pong in china. he shook hands with lbj and showed him his butt when he came back. he participated in the large protest around the reflecting pool. he shook hands with nixon. he called security on the watergate perpetrators. and he did it all while staying his normal, optimistic, and simple self, changing those around him rather than himself. as played by tom hanks, forrest is just the perennial innocent. he walks into every situation convinced of the good graces of those around him, and, like pollyanna, he tends to just make those around him happier. in some ways, this movie reminds me of doctor zhivago where yuri zhivago got shoved from one major historical event to another, but where yuri zhivago never felt like he had any agency, forrest always feels like he's proactively doing things after he gets shoved somewhere new. the best case of this may be the peace protest in dc. forrest is wandering around after having shown the bullet wound on his butt to the president of the united states, just sightseeing, when he gets literally shoved into a line of veterans who are protesting the war. forrest, being the best dressed of the bunch, gets shoved to the front of the line and asked to deliver a speech. the speech gets cut off so that even the audience in the movie can't hear it, but the reaction from the guy who introduced him and stood next to him tells the whole story. forrest said something that touched the hearts of those around him. i imagine the speech was intentionally not heard because it could have split the audience of the movie, and that's not what zemeckis wanted from a heart-warming trip through the 60s, so keeping it unheard prevents any kind of audience blowback. so, while i do feel that it works as a scene and accomplishes what it intends to accomplish, i also feel like it takes an easy way out to make it as broadly appealing as possible. the issue with the thinness of the telling of the 60s really became evident to me once forrest reached vietnam, though. his introduction to the country is a very largely set small scene of an introduction with lieutenant dan. outside, on the coast, with 60s music blaring and a bunch of helicopters flying around. this is zemeckis channeling coppola's apocalypse now, providing nothing new about vietnam cinematically in the process. what gump does is good in this section of the film, the introduction of lieutenant dan and the death of bubba are very well handled, but vietnam as a whole feels shallow here. it became the same with every major event that gump came across. what gump did was entertaining, but the underlying history was just so thin that it becomes kind of frustrating. as a dose of nostalgia, i can understand the appeal, but since i don't share in the nostalgia i don't share in the appreciation. i've spent too much time complaining. the point of gump's journey is that he makes the world a better place in little contributions. that's most evident through the character jenny, the girl he grew up with. she was abused by her father and went down the rabbit hole of the counterculture (providing a surprisingly negative view of the counterculture in a hollywood movie along the way) while forrest keeps popping up and offering to be the rock she needs. built up by his mother's simple lessons from nowhere, alabama, forrest is the good person that jenny can eventually fall back on for support. in a way, jenny and forrest having a child represents two halves of america coming together after the 60s to raise the next generation. the other major character that gump helps is lieutenant dan. raised in a military family with a long history of dying for america from the revolution onward through the second world war (the montage skips a few conflicts along the way), dan gets robbed of his chance to die by gump who saves him. dan, robbed of his destiny, descends into drink becoming a carbon-copy visually of tom cruise in born on the fourth of july. it's through gump's positivity about moving forward with his plan on buying the shrimping boat in honor of bubba and working it to success that brings dan out of his funk. a note about the special effects. many of the visual effects are very good and still hold up, especially the crowd scene around the reflecting pool and everything about lieutenant dan's missing legs, but the stuff that combines gump into existing historical footage has not held up. in the mid-90s, seeing gump in the same visual space with some level of conviction as jfk, lbj, and john lennon was remarkable, but the effects have aged really badly. heads float on shoulder unnaturally while the mouths are awful and move incredibly artificially, often having trouble even matching up with the words being said. mouths are hard to replicate with computer effects, visual effects houses still have trouble with it, but it just looks terrible here. this is largely the same technology that made meryl streep's head backwards in death becomes her, but it's far more ambitious with not enough advancements in the technology, which is unfortunate. all it really does it take one out of the moment that should be funny, but it shouldn't happen at all. overall forrest gump is a nice movie that takes the audience through a survey of 60s america with a likeable main character who always tries to make everyone around him better. it's an appealing journey that's easy to sit through and often quite funny, but it also seems to ride heavily on nostalgia that i don't share, limiting its impact on me and potentially anyone else who doesn't share in the same outlook on the 60s.;23 November

91;gcd70;"comedy-fantasy director robert zemeckis (""romancing the stone"", ""back to the future"", ""who framed roger rabbit"" and ""death becomes her"") branches out on a new tangent with the comedy-drama ""forrest gump"", which tells the rather unlikely tale of a simple alabama boy's incredible journey through life. at times zemeckis manages some subtle and observant comedy, but at other times his attempts at humour fall completely flat. the same too can be said about the dramatic element of the film, with many emotionally powerful moments being contrasted with the bland and ineffective. potentially, ""forrest gump"" could have been a strong, intensely moving saga of the life of an extraordinary - though slightly 'stupid' - human being who's outlook on life could certainly teach us all a thing of two about what should really be important to us. gump's naivety and basic values of friendship and love make him akin to another delightful yet simple character, mickey rooney's ""bill"", a mentally challenged man who's only care was the people close to him. zemeckis does achieve inspiration occasionally -symbolism is interestingly used at the beginning and end of the picture, to represent forrest's biggest responsibility coming into his life and then moving on in it's natural course - but for the most part he approaches the movie as a comedy and so wastes the opportunity to create some truly memorable cinema. tom hanks successfully tackles yet another challenging role, though hardly triumphantly. though forrest's life is a roller coaster of ups, downs and sensational events (too much so i must say), hanks gets very little chance to display a versatile range of emotions, and he doesn't even have the most interesting character. as gump's childhood sweetheart jenny, robin wright portrays with conviction a troubled, tormented and haunted character whose terrible childhood has left her with no self worth. forrest is the only man who has ever respected and loved her for who she is. also in strong support is a very impressive gary sinise as the bitter lt. dan taylor, a man infuriated with gump for saving his life, only to have to live it as a cripple. trapped in a wheelchair and feeling cheated out of his destiny, the lieutenant turns in desperation to booze and fast women. it is these two people, both of whom influence forrest's life greatly, that are by far the most intriguing characters, and it's a shame their parts weren't developed more fully in this film. one mustn't forget the evergreen sally field either. she plays gump's momma, and her small role gives us another glimpse of this fine actress. cinematographer don burgess jumps at the chance to capture some marvellous images of war and peace, with rural america photographed splendidly at times. rick carter's production design maintains the authenticity from the sixties to the eighties, as does the rock soundtrack which even doubles as a narrator on occasion. arthur schmidt, as editor, had a tougher job though, and it would appear he had little idea what to leave in and what to take out. as a result zemeckis' film is patchy and disjointed, inconsistent, episodic and a fraction over long. our director and his script writer (eric roth-groom) have tried too hard, and attempted to say too much. perhaps they could learn something from anthony page's ""bill"" (1981), which was brilliant in its simplicity. rest assured though that the promise shown in this movie indicates bob zemeckis has a definite future in the genre. friday, december 2, 1994 - croydon twin cinema";27 January 2008;6;['new', 'forr', 'unlikely', 'simple', 'incredible', 'subtle', 'observant', 'other', 'flat', 'same', 'dramatic', 'many', 'powerful', 'bland', 'ineffective', 'forr', 'strong', 'extraordinary', 'stupid', 'human', 'important', 'basic', 'akin', 'delightful', 'simple', 'challenged', 'only', 'close', 'forr', 'big', 'natural', 'most', 'memorable', 'challenging', 'sensational', 'little', 'versatile', 'interesting', 'childhood', 'troubled', 'tormented', 'haunted', 'terrible', 'worth', 'forr', 'only', 'strong', 'impressive', 'bitter', 'fast', 'intriguing', 'evergreen', 'sally', 'small', 'fine', 'marvellous', 'rural', 'tough', 'little', 'patchy', 'disjointed', 'inconsistent', 'episodic', 'much', 'brilliant', 'definite', 'twin'];0.1182772166105499

(if only a bomb had landed on his foot. it would have knocked some of that insufferable self-assurance out of him, at the very least.) the film is just one big, long appeal to the pope to have forrest gump canonised, and is about as bearable as any such appeal - and, as is so often the case, the subject of this appeal is someone you wouldn't want to spend five minutes with.

104;Galina_movie_fan;i think of forrest gump (1994) directed by robert zemeckis as a fantasy or a fairy tale set in the real world, and what a marvelous tale it is. it's been 15 years since i saw the film for the first time with my 13- years-old son. we were impressed, touched, and moved by it equally. we laughed, we could not contain tears, and we lived together with the hero, the childlike, naive, and innocent forrest gump, the most unusual lead character you can think of. fg was a big hit when it was released, and it went on to receive 6 oscars including for the best picture, director, best actor, best visual effects, and best screen play. the film's oscar status has made it one of the controversial choices among the film viewers. some completely agree that fg deserved all its awards and its love. the others, and quite few to that believe that the film is totally overrated, sickly sweet, and it is nothing more than the american propaganda of mediocrity. they believe that the film's main idea is, follow the orders, do what you are told, and even if your intellect is low or almost non-existent, with a little bit of luck, you would achieve the success in your life and even would change the history by simply being at the right place in the right time. how wrong i believe they are. you can't think of forrest gump as a real person. he is a fairy tale character, or rather the embodiment of a human with no cynicism whatsoever, the candid, pure, innocent man who is not quick or witty but who knows bad from good and right from wrong and through whose eyes we see the historical events in the live of this country for about thirty years of the last century. forrest may not be an intellectual prodigy but he was led through life's hardships, by the inner moral compass if you will and he knows the very simple truths that he never misses - love and loyalty to his mother, his friends, the girl he loves and his country. the movie covers the look at america not only from forrest's point of view. another look at alternative, rebellious, counterculture america was very well presented through jenny's life. between them two, i believe the film's creators were able to show the changing times and changing face of this country. technically and visually, the film is a marvel. the best songs of the time that were used in the film soundtrack are great and i don't mind them sound almost all the time -the more the better. tom hanks had achieved the very difficult task. his forrest is simple but not laughable. he is a decent and very good man. it is not easy to create such idealistic character and to make him alive and sympathetic. there is not a single false note in hanks' performance, and he absolutely deserves the oscar. when i rewatched the film recently, it touched me as deeply now as it did 15 years ago, and this is for me the sign of not just good but a great movie. and that's all i have to say about forrest gump.;14 February 2010;10;['forr', 'real', 'marvelous', 'first', 'old', 'impressed', 'naive', 'innocent', 'forr', 'unusual', 'big', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'visual', 'good', 'controversial', 'few', 'overrated', 'sweet', 'more', 'american', 'main', 'low', 'non', 'existent', 'little', 'right', 'right', 'wrong', 'forr', 'real', 'candid', 'pure', 'innocent', 'quick', 'witty', 'bad', 'good', 'right', 'historical', 'last', 'forr', 'intellectual', 'inner', 'moral', 'simple', 'forr', 'alternative', 'rebellious', 'counterculture', 'able', 'good', 'great', 'well', 'difficult', 'forr', 'simple', 'laughable', 'decent', 'good', 'easy', 'such', 'idealistic', 'alive', 'sympathetic', 'single', 'false', 'good', 'great', 'forr'];0.2548611111111111

114;bandw;there are many ways that this movie turned my stomach. the idea that a mentally challenged man can achieve such successes in life pushed me way beyond my ability to suspend disbelief. just one example among many: was i supposed to believe that gump could be a successful football player on the university of alabama team? how did he even get into the university? given the tone of the movie i doubt that this was meant as a sarcastic comment on the intelligence of college football players, but that is how i saw it. it's an insult to real players who have worked hard to get on a team. all right, so i should just view this as some feel-good fantasy, yes? but there were some scenes that were played for real: gump's buddy in the vietnam war being fatally shot in the guts, his girl friend dying of aids, his mother dying of cancer. such mixtures of realism and fantasy have never worked for me. putting the above matters aside, there are more serious concerns. the message of this movie, that being mentally challenged is only a minor impediment to achieving great successes in life, is objectionable. how are parents dealing with the real problems that mentally challenged children have in this world supposed to react to this message? or the mentally challenged themselves? or everybody else for that matter. i was highly offended by this movie.;14 March 2014;1;['many', 'such', 'many', 'successful', 'sarcastic', 'real', 'good', 'real', 'such', 'above', 'serious', 'minor', 'great', 'objectionable', 'real'];0.2888888888888889

118;Abdulxoxo;heartwarming and sentimental. tom hanks' narration is fun and strictly from his mentally challenged character forrest gump's child-like perspective. this keeps forrest gump innocent as a film, but thoughtful for the audience who know the historical events are real and have meaning. my problem with the movie is its ridiculously long run-time. it could easily have cut a whole half hour and nothing of importance would have lost. it takes a bit of time before anything interesting happens and focuses too much on silly moments in gump's life. this movie does little to make you understand gump's perspective until he says he may be stupid, but he understands love to jenny. i like tom hanks' energetic and likable performance but it's the vietnam veteran lieutenant dan played by gary sinise that stole the show. he captures the humor and depression of his situation that makes the movie feel so real, even though it's all a fantasy. the jenny character is somewhat unlikable, as she uses gump when she needs him, but does not offer any kindness in return. she is important to gump as she is his friend, but you wonder why she never feels as real as hanks' right hand man. sally field is at least supportive and kindly as his odd mother. both forrest and jenny feel more like representations of their era instead of complete characters. i think that forrest's whole life is all random chance encounters and dumb luck, so was there really a message at all? if yes then it's just ridiculous. anyways, the direction is on point, a lot of scenes are well-shot and has terrific performances, the score is fitting and romantic. i think it has some flaws, but it is always entertaining.;29 October 2020;8;['fun', 'forr', 'like', 'forr', 'innocent', 'thoughtful', 'historical', 'real', 'long', 'whole', 'half', 'interesting', 'silly', 'little', 'stupid', 'energetic', 'likable', 'real', 'unlikable', 'important', 'real', 'right', 'least', 'supportive', 'odd', 'forr', 'complete', 'forr', 'whole', 'random', 'dumb', 'ridiculous', 'terrific', 'fitting', 'romantic', 'entertaining'];0.0830144557823129

120;Howlin Wolf;"... i gotta say, i love it! whether you agree with me will probably depend on whether the whimsical tone of the film is likely to make you want to smile or puke. as i said, i'm in the former camp, but i can well understand anybody who disagrees. this film is certainly a devisive topic amongst my friends and i, faintly dodgy politics and all (more on that later...) before i offer my critique of the film, i just wanna touch on two issues that are vaguely related. firstly, the imdb lists ""the deer hunter"" as a recommendation to those who like this movie. what?? let me assure you, two more movies that are so totally different as these pair would be hard to find. there is a very tenuous possible link with vietnam, but aside from that we're dealin' with chalk and cheese. i recommend cinema and/or de niro buffs check out ""tdh"" for completist sakes, because it's good, but imho vastly over-rated (i know people will say the same about ""forrest gump""!). anyhow, the tone of the two films is completely different, so in my estimation a slight error within the imdb there... secondly, i know people complain because there was a crop of other good movies to get a best picture nod in '94, and ""gump"" beat them to it. most - if not all - of the films nominated that year would have been deserving winners. it just so happened that the academy plumped for gump (sorry about the excruciating rhyme...) this does not devalue forrest gump against the more dramatic pictures any more then it reflects badly on the runners up. it was just a very good period for film, and all us cinema fans should be thankful for that... now that i've got that off my chest, back to the film in question. i feel that hanks' performance stays just on the right side of cloying sentimentality, always threatening to tip over the edge, but never quite doing so. this must be testament to hanks skill as an actor, as with many other actors in the role the character could have become fiercely irritating during the lengthly running time. again, i'm well aware of the arguments that say the character was annoying from the start, but i never felt that to be the case. an able supporting cast serve to back up hanks, and there is a wonderful turn from gary sinise as ""lt dan taylor"". his character almost threatens to inject some edge into the character's ultra-pc universe, but maybe that reflects the fact that the other characters are so wholesome rather than that he is nasty. (spoilers) it's a fun jaunt through some 40 years (i think...) of history, refreshingly not confined entirely to american culture. john lennon makes an 'appearance' at one stage (you could argue that he represents 'cross-culture', but i'm claiming him as one of our own, even though i'm not a scouser but a manc). to those who think part of the fun in watching a movie is predicting events, this one won't provide you with much of a challenge. i recommend sitting back and allowing yourself to be drawn into the movie universe. as other users have pointed out before me, the film can possibly be seen as having a 'reactionary' viewpoint. having the main female character die of aids as a consequence of her earlier hedonist actions seems depressingly intolerant if it was intended to convey some sort of message to the audience. i have no idea if events in the book are the same. for those of you looking for deep subtextual material, it's certainly a juicy bone of contention, but the film can be enjoyed just as well on a purely simplistic level. i don't think the political bias is strong enough to ruin the film. as for my view on whether any such connotation was deliberate, let's just say it wouldn't surprise me... (spoiler end) to close, many of my friends voice much the same objections about the film that i have seen on this site. if the potential for nostalgia combined with goofy fantasy doesn't sound like it will be your thing, then by all means avoid. if, however, the concoction i have described sounds suited to your tastes, then enjoy; because i guarantee you won't find many better examples of this type of thing around.";20 March 2001;9;['whimsical', 'likely', 'former', 'devisive', 'dodgy', 'more', 'related', 'more', 'different', 'hard', 'tenuous', 'possible', 'completist', 'good', 'imho', 'same', 'forr', 'different', 'slight', 'other', 'good', 'good', 'sorry', 'excruciating', 'forr', 'dramatic', 'good', 'thankful', 'right', 'many', 'other', 'lengthly', 'running', 'aware', 'annoying', 'able', 'wonderful', 'ultra', 'other', 'wholesome', 'nasty', 'american', 'cross', 'culture', 'own', 'much', 'other', 'reactionary', 'main', 'female', 'early', 'intolerant', 'same', 'deep', 'subtextual', 'juicy', 'simplistic', 'political', 'strong', 'such', 'deliberate', 'many', 'same', 'suited', 'many', 'well'];0.0896374458874458
121;sme_no_densetsu;"1994 was a pretty good year for film. along with ""pulp fiction"" and ""the shawshank redemption"" we got ""forrest gump"", an idiosyncratic movie that became a global phenomenon. popular with both critics and audiences, it accomplished the rare feat of winning the best picture oscar while also ranking #1 at the box office for the year. the story revolves around the title character, a dim-witted alabamian who unwittingly plays a part in some of the key events of the 20th century. from inspiring elvis presley's signature gyrations to meeting the president (twice), gump pops up all over the place as either a participant or an observer. this tour through american history will hold special appeal for baby boomers but those from subsequent generations with a reasonable grounding in american history will also get a kick out of it. however, the movie isn't just a nostalgia trip. the central love story supplies a strong thread linking everything together, as does gump's relationship with his mother and his two best friends. that being said, perhaps the main reason why the story comes off as well as it does is the actors. tom hanks, in the title role, is the movie's anchor. his performance is by turns funny and touching and it led to a well-deserved second consecutive best actor oscar. the rest of the principle actors were scarcely less impressive. sally field as forrest's mother, robin wright as his long-time love interest and gary sinise as lieutenant dan all gave awards-worthy performances. also worthy of note is mykelti williamson, whose relatively small role as bubba was nevertheless highly memorable. in terms of film-making craft, the movie shows exceptional polish. the direction by robert zemeckis is always well handled and the production values are excellent. the story's breadth provided ample opportunity for striking visuals and varied settings. ilm's oscar-winning visual effects (which memorably inserted hanks into archival footage, among other accomplishments) also deserves credit, though some of the effects are admittedly a little rough in comparison with future efforts. throughout, alan silvestri's oscar-nominated score provided a solid backdrop in tandem with countless shrewdly chosen period-specific pop songs. ultimately, though, ""forrest gump"" is not without its detractors. some claim that the movie is overly sentimental and that the title character is less than endearing. i don't agree with that at all. the movie's poignancy is well-earned and gump himself is an iconic character vividly brought to life. in my opinion, ""forrest gump"" was a deserving best picture oscar winner, even considering its tough competition.";19 June 2014;9;['good', 'forr', 'global', 'popular', 'rare', 'good', 'key', 'american', 'special', 'subsequent', 'reasonable', 'american', 'central', 'strong', 'good', 'main', 'funny', 'touching', 'second', 'consecutive', 'good', 'principle', 'impressive', 'sally', 'forr', 'long', 'worthy', 'worthy', 'small', 'memorable', 'exceptional', 'excellent', 'ample', 'varied', 'visual', 'other', 'little', 'rough', 'future', 'solid', 'countless', 'specific', 'forr', 'sentimental', 'less', 'iconic', 'forr', 'deserving', 'good', 'tough'];0.2371322106078203

123;Screen_Blitz;"calling forrest gump may be saying a lot, but there is nearly impossible to deny the astounding talent roaring in front and behind the camera. robert zemeckis, a filmmaker with a heavenly gift of storytelling, take his talent to the fullest extent with this heartwarming, charm-fueled tale focuses on the eponymous fighting to find his place in the complex world many people struggle to understand. this movie, unraveled from the pages of the screenplay by eric roth, lightens the flame with cinematic mastery with storytelling that blends landmark american history with a timeless tale of a misunderstood man with the heart of gold. when you are supposed laugh, you will laugh. when you are supposed to cry, your eyes will get soaked; and that is only half of the beauty that makes this adaptation of winston groom's novel of the same name a triumphant piece of cinematic glitter. so this film stars oscar- winner tom hanks as, yours truly, forrest gump, a forty-something year old alabama man who suffers a low iq but nonetheless carries a gentle soul. providing the framework of the story is forrest sitting on the park bench as he tells his story to various individuals of his life from his childhood, to his adult life where he caught in the middle of america's landmark moments including the meeting with president john f. kennedy, to his tour in vietnam where he forms friendship with his squadmate lieutenant dan (played by gary sinise), to the lyndon b. johnson administration. while caught up a series of political unrest that ran rampant during the 60s and 70s, he finds himself distracted in his pursue for his childhood sweetheart jenny curran (played by robin wright) who's life is in shambles, while reflecting his life choices all of the wisdom of his mother (played by sally field). this movie never takes its chances to pull at our heart strings for granted, but never does so in a way that feels hammy or exploitative. it is a film with that almost always has its heart in the right place while gently feeding you the message of in the world full of darkness and despair, there is always an underlining humanity resting somewhere within. forrest in particular, wins our hearts with his heartwarming personality as he ventures through key moments in america's history while refusing the let go of the woman dear to his heart. each scene following forrest in the midst of the political tension including the vietnam war, the ill-fated jfk administration is handled with maturity with an underlining dose of snappy charm. flowing with an uproar of social commentary without slapping the story with a bias agenda, it is satisfying to see robert zemeckis prevail his effort in balancing a compelling story with a sweet batch of swift history lessons. of course, the romantic drama is the brighter star in the story. the separation between him and jenny transpires to moments of both bittersweet and melancholy, and the emotional chemistry really grabs at the heart, especially in the beginning when we get a sad inside look at her childhood at the hands of her abusive father. and thanks to tom hanks and robin wright, the romantic affinity between them works gracefully. robin wright plays her role with plenty of humility to prove her talent as an actress. however, this comes less of a surprise than tom hanks who tackles on what may be the most triumphant role of his career. hanks plays the title character, a man with a mental disability that requires a kind of performance that could have easily come off as mawkish and ham-fisted. luckily for a talented actor he is, his performance is blisteringly top-notch with moments that effectively show the down-to-earth nature of his character. he is the ultimate reason why his chemistry with not only robin wright, but his friend gary sinise as the well-acted lieutenant dan works well. forrest gump is a triumphant slice of cinematic art blooming with a a career-defining performance by tom hanks and robert zemeckis working at his prime with a cinematic piece that is simply timeless, if not a masterpiece. for a movie that was predicted to be a critical and commercial by many prior to its release, it is definitely one hell of a sleep hit. i guess it comes to show that forrest's mother was right when she said ""life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get.""";5 December 2017;9;['forr', 'impossible', 'astounding', 'heavenly', 'full', 'eponymous', 'complex', 'many', 'cinematic', 'american', 'timeless', 'same', 'triumphant', 'cinematic', 'forr', 'old', 'low', 'gentle', 'forr', 'various', 'squadmate', 'political', 'rampant', 'childhood', 'hammy', 'exploitative', 'right', 'full', 'forr', 'particular', 'key', 'dear', 'forr', 'political', 'underlining', 'snappy', 'social', 'compelling', 'sweet', 'swift', 'romantic', 'bright', 'bittersweet', 'melancholy', 'emotional', 'sad', 'inside', 'abusive', 'romantic', 'less', 'triumphant', 'mental', 'mawkish', 'talented', 'top', 'ultimate', 'forr', 'triumphant', 'cinematic', 'cinematic', 'critical', 'commercial', 'many', 'forr', 'right'];0.0996947496947497

132;baumer;there are certain films that people should just enjoy. forrest gump is one of them. it makes you feel good. it makes you feel happy and it makes you appreciate what excellent film making is all about. simply put, this movie is pretty much flawless and it is a movie for the ages. pulp fiction was deserving of best picture and so was shawshank redemption, but only one of these fine three films could have won that year. it is like watching the two best hockey teams playing in the stanley cup finals. it is the seventh game and we are now in triple overtime and the score is tied at 2. one team will win the cup, and not necessarily because they are better than the other, but because someone has to win. that was the case in 1994. i loved pulp, and i loved shawshank, but i loved gump too and when it won i cheered out loud. good for robert zemekis. what is so great about forrest gump is that it makes life a little more pure, a little more innocent. forrest never really quite understands what is going on around him and for that reason he lives life in the dark in some ways but in other ways, he sees so much more light than the rest of us. and his antics and the way he lives that life is an inspiration to the rest of us, or at least it should be. and how can you not like the guy. is there a more likable character in the history of cinema? i doubt it! robert zemekis took me completely by storm when i first saw this film. back to the future was a great film and he has always shown that he has a propensity for box office gold, but to make a picture that was not only phenomenally successful at the box office but is this sweet and fun and heart warming, was not what i expected from him. then again, he is a spielberg cronie, so that must mean something. zemekis is one of the strengths of this film, but the tour de force is really hanks. his adaptation of the character is remarkable. he is ever so convincing and even though his work in philedelphia was completely oscar worthy, this is even a step above that. i love him here and i will see anything that he is in from here on out. i love movies. i love what they do to me. i love that they can make me feel a plethora of emotions. even when i despise a film, i can still look back and say that if anything it made me feel something. but forrest gump is a microcosm of why i like movies. my world is little better after i watch this movie and for that i am so glad that this film was made. and for the people that can't enjoy this movie, i certainly hope that in the years to come you can. because you just don't know what you're missing.;9 July 1999;10;['certain', 'forr', 'good', 'happy', 'excellent', 'good', 'fine', 'good', 'seventh', 'triple', 'well', 'other', 'good', 'great', 'forr', 'little', 'pure', 'little', 'innocent', 'forr', 'other', 'more', 'least', 'likable', 'great', 'successful', 'sweet', 'remarkable', 'convincing', 'oscar', 'worthy', 'forr', 'well', 'glad'];0.4321428571428571

134;classicalsteve;"there are two kinds of people in the world, my friend. those who dig forrest gump, and those who don't. i don't. if ""forrest gump"" is truly viewed as some kind of inspirational cinematic experience, then america is in a lot of trouble. forrest gump is no masterpiece of cinema, not even by a long-shot. it is largely a formulated overly sentimental contrivance that simply plays too well into american saccharine tastes, mostly pop melodrama for the sake of pop melodrama. this was obviously made for the same audience that likes ""sleepless in seattle"" and ""lucky you"". certainly, i don't have a problem with the idea of a feeble-minded main character from which to tell a story. (""rain man"", a similar idea, is a far superior story to and much more real than the silliness of ""gump"".) i will concede hanks' portrayal of forrest is no less than brilliant, and he was deserving of the academy award for best actor in 1994. but was this film really deserving of best picture, best director, and best writing? is this film really in the same league as ""schindler's list"", ""ghandhi"", ""the hurt locker"", and ""platoon""? i don't think so. a contrived stooge, a late 20th century throw-back to lenny of ""of mice and men"" (""tell me about the rabbits, george""), enmeshed in a series of sentimentalized vignettes is nothing more than contrived farce. does gump represent the american ideal or fictionalized empty-headed-ness? forrest gump only mirrors american's insatiable appetite for the overly sentimental. instead of telling a true human story, such as ""rain man"", about the struggles of a man verging on feeble-mindedness, the filmmakers decided to sentimentalize him and put him into the most ridiculous and unbelievable of situations. because of the fantastical nature of the entire story, i think ""gump"" does a disservice to those with intellectual disabilities, although i will admit it does so inadvertently. ""rain man"" i think achieves quite the opposite. so many of the scenes in this movie made no sense. in the opening sequence when young forrest's legs are in braces and, inspired by the ""girl next door"", he begins running down a midwest dirt road, and his braces magically come off. oh brother. only hollywood could imagine something that rings of a bad ""saturday evening post"" illustration from the 1950's. not even norman rockwell would have painted something quite so contrived. of course the ""running theme"" will recur toward the end of the the film. later, despite his feeble-mindedness, he's drafted into the army where he puts his rifle together faster and better than anyone in training. he's a feeble-minded genius. maybe an idiot-savant? during the course of much of the film, gump ends up involved in the most unlikely of situations. he plays football under a legendary college coach, goes to vietnam, wins a congressional medal, meets john f kennedy, becomes a ping-pong champion, meets john lennon, informs on the watergate burglars, and ends up investing his ping-pong winnings into the apple computer company. and then goes on a pointless ""run"" where all these people run after him. or maybe this last part is realistic. not about forrest running but that people would follow. obviously everybody followed gump to the box office. and then to the academy awards. it's a wonder the filmmakers didn't have him take the next logical step and have him run for president. raymond babbitt (the autistic character from ""rain man"" played by dustin hoffman) could be his running mate. the only saving grace of the film is some of the vietnam sequences, and his relationship with lut. dan played by gary sinese, who is the other standout talent of the film. gump's tour of duty and his relationship with dan were far more substantive than all the rest of the movie put together. i think it would have been far more interesting and insightful if the story was about a feeble-minded man forced to fight in vietnam rather than adding all the other asinine episodes that made me say to myself, ""oh come on..."" and i liked aspects of gump's relationship with dan, and i wished that had been more developed rather than gump popping up in high spots of american history. when gump reports the watergate burglary, i just about lost my popcorn. the recurring theme of ""gump"" is ""life was like a box of chocolates. you never know what you're gonna get."". as i have never liked most of the candies in those boxes (i always end up with the slimy gooey ones), i guess i am not the right viewer to appreciate the wonders of ""forrest gump"". i typically avoid those boxes of candies just for that reason. i want something that has a little more meat to it, a little more realism, and a little more honesty. not just gooey caramel. whoever wrote forrest gump was eating a box of these candies and decided to make a movie about it. the problem with those box of chocolates is that you know exactly what you're going to get and that's why i avoid them.";18 April 2010;3;['forr', 'forr', 'inspirational', 'cinematic', 'forr', 'formulated', 'sentimental', 'american', 'same', 'sleepless', 'lucky', 'feeble', 'minded', 'main', 'similar', 'superior', 'real', 'forr', 'less', 'brilliant', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'same', 'hurt', 'contrived', 'late', 'more', 'empty', 'forr', 'insatiable', 'sentimental', 'true', 'human', 'such', 'feeble', 'ridiculous', 'unbelievable', 'fantastical', 'entire', 'intellectual', 'many', 'young', 'next', 'midw', 'bad', 'contrived', 'feeble', 'well', 'feeble', 'minded', 'much', 'unlikely', 'legendary', 'congressional', 'pointless', 'last', 'realistic', 'forr', 'next', 'logical', 'autistic', 'other', 'substantive', 'interesting', 'insightful', 'feeble', 'minded', 'other', 'asinine', 'high', 'american', 'most', 'slimy', 'right', 'forr', 'little', 'more', 'more', 'little', 'more', 'forr'];0.0726674737691686

just by being himself. life happens all around him and forrest is often blissfully ignorant. he finds himself caught up in one extraordinary situation after another. in each situation, without fail, he just does the right thing, the good thing. he does what ""smarter"" people, given the opportunity to think about the situation, might not. he thinks not of the consequences, he just follows his heart. and that heart takes him to the most amazing places. he is a man driven by love. love for his friends, for his mama, and above all for his beloved jenny. the story of forrest and jenny is inspiring and tragic, heartwarming and heartbreaking all at the same time. from their first meeting as children the bond between these two is unbreakable. no matter how they may drift apart that connection is always there. and drift apart they do for while forrest has his amazing life's journey jenny has a journey all her own. she embraces life in her own way. in confronting her demons she makes some bad choices. no matter how far gone she may seem to be she knows, and we know, that forrest will always be there for her. forrest doesn't judge her as so many others would. he just loves her, always and forever, no matter how hard she makes it to love her at times. it really is one of the great relationships in movie history. the relationship between forrest and jenny is the real heart of the story but there's so much more. with everything forrest experienced it's remarkable that director robert zemeckis managed to cram it all into less than two and a half hours of film. and give credit to zemeckis too for creating the right tone for the film. in the wrong hands this could have been an overly sentimental mess of a film. but in forrest gump zemeckis presents a film, and a character, which is good but not too good to be true. so many outrageous things happen to forrest gump but you believe in this story every step of the way. zemeckis put all the pieces together perfectly. everything fits, right down to the wonderful soundtrack with the perfect songs for each of the big moments in forrest's decades-long journey. a great share of the credit for the film's success of course goes to tom hanks who played forrest to perfection. an obviously challenging character to play. how far do you go in portraying forrest's innate simplicity? hanks got it just right. the rest of the cast is terrific as well. robin wright hits all the right emotional notes in playing the deeply troubled jenny. sally field is everything you would want your mama to be. mykelti williamson brings great personality to the role of forrest's wartime buddy bubba. michael conner humphreys and hanna hall are wonderfully endearing as the young forrest and jenny. and gary sinise is utterly brilliant in playing lieutenant dan, a character whose story arc is as dramatic and compelling as can be. hanks of course won an oscar for his performance, which was pretty much a given as soon as the film was released. that sinise didn't pick up an oscar as well for his supporting role seems borderline criminal. what a performance he gave in a supremely challenging role. much was made upon the film's initial release about the effects used to insert forrest gump into history. the effects may seem quaint by now but they were truly revolutionary at the time. and they add a nice touch to the movie. it's cute seeing forrest tell jfk he has to go pee or to see him chatting with john lennon. all of forrest's brushes with history give the movie a grander scale. they show the impact this very simple man had on the world. but for all the famous people he met, for all the wondrous things he did, forrest would be the first to tell you that everything he ever needed was right there at home in greenbow, alabama. his friends, his mama, his jenny. that's all forrest gump ever needed. and look at the impact he had on those closest to him, often without even trying. look at where lieutenant dan is in life by the end of the film. forrest got him there just by being himself, by doing what was right. and forrest was of course always there for jenny too. such a simple man yet he touched so many lives. not a smart man?

136;one9eighty;"the life and times of changing america through the eyes of simple man. a lovely and warming film with tom hanks as the lead character telling the story of his life and how things have changed around him. gump leads an extremely full life but despite everything he does; going to war, going for a long run, inventing crazes, playing sports, meeting presidents, catching shrimp - despite everything, all he wants to do is be reunited with his childhood sweetheart jenny. it's fair to say that when life throws a problem, he just gets on with it and does his best, showing the audience that it's not worth being down about big things, not when life is so wonderful and varied. hanks shines and is somehow hypnotic as gump, grabbing the audience and taking them for a ride. robin wright (it's only ""the princess bride"" folks!!) is brilliant as jenny, making you love her and hate her in equal amounts. i also must mention how good gary sinise was as lieutenant dan - like jenny i hated him and loved him in equal amounts. his character development is brilliant and goes to highlight that anyone can change. furthermore, one of the messages of the film (amongst all the others), a small interaction with somebody could have a lasting effect on them - that's how dan turns out after having known forrest gump. this is a pure and inspiration emotional rollercoaster of dramatic film. there are some tongue in cheek moments where factual history is manipulated a little bit, but it's easy to look past these and see a true classic of cinema. if you have not seen this, it is worth rectifying that and watching a true gem as soon as possible - perhaps bring some tissues though. 9/10";18 June 2020;9;['simple', 'lovely', 'lead', 'full', 'long', 'childhood', 'fair', 'good', 'worth', 'big', 'wonderful', 'varied', 'hypnotic', 'brilliant', 'equal', 'good', 'equal', 'brilliant', 'small', 'forr', 'pure', 'emotional', 'dramatic', 'factual', 'little', 'easy', 'true', 'worth', 'true', 'possible'];0.2823660714285714

151;nickenchuggets;"some movies get such a ridiculous amount of acclaim that i have no choice but to be skeptical watching them. i say this because there's a ton of films that people view favorably only for nostalgia and not much else. for the longest time, i thought that this was the case with forrest gump, a movie that is often seen as one of the best in recent memory. having never seen it before, i asked myself if it was actually worth seeing or just something that has been overhyped to an untouchable degree. after watching the whole movie, i can say that it is pretty impressive and well worth your time, but maybe it's not as amazing as everyone says. personally, i thought it was good because of its subject matter. the story involves american history, but it is partially fictionalized in order to bring attention to the title character. forrest gump (tom hanks) is a slow-witted man with an iq barely above that of a 9 year old child. although he's not very intelligent, his actions speak louder than words, and he shows up in numerous important historical events. the vast majority of the movie is told through flashbacks while he's sitting on a bench in alabama in the 1980s. he tells people who sit next to him about his tragic (but also heroic) life story, starting with his childhood in the 1950s. forrest explains how he was named after the famed southern civil war general nathan bedford forrest, the only man in the whole war to be promoted all the way to general while starting out as a mere private. forrest talks about how he had to have metal braces on his legs from a young age because of a physical disability, which actually inspired elvis presley's famous (somewhat vulgar) dance moves. as forrest attends school for the first time, he meets a girl named jenny (robin wright) who quickly becomes his one and only friend, as she is one of the only people to not mock him. as they grow up together, forrest lives through more monumental events, such as meeting president kennedy and seeing the first black students walk into an alabama college. eventually, things take a turn for the worst and forrest is drafted into vietnam. while there, he meets his commanding officer, lieutenant dan, whose military heritage stretches back all the way to the war of independence. vietnam proves to be a harrowing experience for gump, who comes close to losing his life numerous times. he even runs back into a jungle to save his lieutenant from being burned to death after the area is marked for a napalm attack. however, all is not well because lieutenant dan survives, but loses both of his legs, leaving him a miserable invalid. at first, he hates forrest for ""robbing him of an honorable death"", but the two come to respect each other. after the war ends in the 1970s, forrest is sent home and lives with dan in nyc for a while. forrest invests in a relatively unknown little company (apple inc.) at the end of the 70s and gives much of the money to the family of bubba, a soldier forrest served alongside in vietnam. by now, forrest no doubt misses jenny, and runs all across the united states for years on end to keep his mind busy. jenny, who had become a drug addict during the counterculture of the 60s, returns to forrest and marries him in the early 1980s. dan shows up at their wedding, revealing he has new prosthetic legs. unfortunately, forrest's marriage is very brief as jenny reveals she has some kind of unknown virus (possibly hepatitis), and she dies the next year. forrest visits her grave to say goodbye, and the movie ends with forrest wishing his son good luck on his first day at school. i have to say, i was really impressed with this movie. i still think it's overrated, but not without plenty of good reasons. for one thing, it involves history, which is a good thing (for me). it also shows how lucky forrest is, despite being unintelligent. he just so happened to live through all these famous events. i made an attempt to describe some of them, but there's a lot more. after forrest gets wounded in vietnam, he meets the president (again) and shows his injury to lbj. another scene has him meeting abbie hoffman and giving a speech about why the war in vietnam is immoral. because this movie is so long and contains so many different settings, it's quite hard to write about. it's just one of those experiences that can't really be put into words because unless you've seen it, you don't really understand. i just appreciated how it showed forrest staying with his vietnam veteran friend all the way into the 80s, which often happened in real life. of course, like many who came back from that conflict, forrest gets disrespected upon arriving home for participating in what many considered organized murder. it was a big shock to me when i found out that robert zemeckis directed this, since i only knew about him from back to the future. as you might guess from a movie of this magnitude, the acting is all really well done. tom hanks won an oscar for his portrayal of forrest, as he's much more than just an idiot. he's a patriot, warrior, father, and comrade. he has people who depend on him. robin wright as jenny is probably the saddest thing about the movie, as she's one of the only people who appreciates forrest, so seeing her die so early in their marriage was really terrible. the last major character (but definitely not least) is lieutenant dan, played by gary sinise. he reminds me a lot of stereotypical drill sergeant characters, since he's tough on the exterior, but he really cares about his men. he has few ways of showing it, and he's even initially hostile to gump, but he later considers him his best friend for saving his life in southeast asia. overall, forrest gump is a surprisingly emotional and sad movie, but it also has many funny aspects to it. i usually say that only the best movies can make an audience laugh, make them scared, or sad within only one film. in this case i really do think it's fitting.";3 December 2021;9;['ridiculous', 'skeptical', 'long', 'forr', 'good', 'recent', 'worth', 'untouchable', 'whole', 'impressive', 'worth', 'amazing', 'good',

153;rebeljenn;while 'forrest gump' is a good movie, it is a victim of being an over-rated movie. it was one of those films that was in the public eye for a few years, and people quoted it until it became less than a novelty. finally, it died down, and it is nearly forgotten by the fickle mainstream now. the film follows a southern united states boy with a below-average iq into adulthood. it is a film about love and longing as much as it is a comedy film and a historical film. (i know that there are a few rated scenes, but this would be a good film to show to young adults because it is as entertaining as it is a lesson in american history.) forrest happens to be involved in some important events from his childhood in the 1950s (where he meets and inspires elvis) to the end of segregation, the vietnam war, and meeting the president. despite his low iq, luck plays a big part in forrest's life except in his love life where he yearns for jenny, a girl he knew since his childhood. i would recommend this film, even though it is over-rated.;24 November 2005;7;['forr', 'good', 'public', 'few', 'less', 'fickle', 'southern', 'historical', 'few', 'good', 'young', 'entertaining', 'american', 'forr', 'important', 'low', 'big', 'forr'];0.1309523809523809

155;barryrd;"my first comment is that forrest gump touches our hearts, and when you left the movie theatre that was the takeaway. for most baby boomers who are about tom hanks' age, they wanted the satisfaction of going home with the feeling inside of being well entertained, having a great laugh, shedding a tear - a intangible feeling you cannot put into words. but if it leaves you with that feeling of satisfaction, it works. very few movies surpass that sense of satisfaction than forrest gump. my second comment is that tom hanks as forrest gump is an icon of his generation, possibly in the same way that jimmy stewart was for their grandparents in it's a wonderful life. he's a guy who makes us feel good and also someone to admire. of course our lives don't follow a movie script, but it sure is good to see someone who shows the best in all of us. during a conflicted time in american history - the era of kennedy, vietnam, nixon, watergate etc. forest lives out his life as a remarkable but ordinary guy. we're all pulling for him. forrest isn't the ""smartest guy in the room"" but he has confidence in himself and makes the most of what he does have. this movie is pure hollywood. it is from the world of frank capra, not ingmar bergman. we should accept it and appreciate it as such. in this movie, forest is supported and encouraged by sally field, as his mother, robin wright as jenny curran - his one and only, and his best friend gary sinise, as lt. dan, a fellow soldier who lost his legs in vietnam. great piece of film-making with the newsreels from the era spliced into key moments. it's an unforgettable movie.";27 November 2021;9;['first', 'forr', 'most', 'great', 'intangible', 'few', 'forr', 'second', 'forr', 'same', 'wonderful', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'conflicted', 'american', 'remarkable', 'ordinary', 'forr', 'smart', 'most', 'pure', 'frank', 'such', 'good', 'fellow', 'great', 'key', 'unforgettable'];0.3894557823129251

175;sashank_kini-1;forrest gump is an instant classic. it is easily lovable and has a brilliant script, along with a career best performance from tom hanks, great acting by the rest of the cast, a wonderful story and great direction. the story itself is told in such a witty manner, keeping in mind that the narrator is tom hanks and as he is a bit low on i.q, he does not take his life very seriously and merrily spends it. the movie is long but it never drags on. i thought that even if it extended for a few more minutes, i would not mind it. tom hanks gives a splendid performance and is one character that would be remembered. the emotions are expressed through his eyes. it is very hard not to shed a few tears or even keep your eyes dry when he cries or is sad, especially during the death of his closest. jenny's character is absolutely the opposite as she develops all wrong habits and suffers throughout her life. not a very likable character. the other actors too give very good performances, mainly sally field, garry sinise. bubba is also humorous with his obsession with shrimps. everything is good about this movie. the movie doesn't get boring at all. one of the best movies i have seen. 10 on 10 for this film, which is rare since i don't give such rating usually.;19 April 2009;10;['forr', 'instant', 'lovable', 'brilliant', 'good', 'great', 'wonderful', 'great', 'witty', 'low', 'long', 'few', 'more', 'splendid', 'hard', 'few', 'dry', 'sad', 'close', 'opposite', 'wrong', 'likable', 'other', 'good', 'garry', 'humorous', 'good', 'boring', 'good', 'rare', 'such'];0.2499999999999999

180;movieguy1021;winner of six academy awards, forrest gump is still a very popular film today, despite being out for nine years. tom hanks plays the title character who is sitting on a bench, waiting for the number 9 bus. he's relaying his life story to the people also waiting for a bus. his story goes like this: as a young boy in a fatherless household, forrest never got out much. he had to wear leg braces and only found one friend-jenny. 'they's was like peas and carrots.' but, they have to go their separate ways, but always wind up meeting each other again. forrest goes to the vietnam war, is a ping-pong champion, and is a fishing boat captain while jenny becomes a hippie scrounging for cash, etc. the life story is fascinating. i've always like narration, but sometimes heavy narration can become tedious. in some cases, the overwhelming use of narration reminded me of fight club, even though the two films couldn't be more different. during the end of the film, when forrest gets to where he was going, the narration, obviously, wasn't there (since forrest wasn't explaining it to anyone). i missed it. i thought that the narration was the best part of the film. the authenticity of the historic events that forrest got himself into was genuine. not being alive for those parts, i couldn't really relate to them, but i could relate to forrest. he had a certain charm to him that made you root for him as soon as he put the feather in curious george. jenny was also crafted so you could like her and feel sorry for her during her times of despair. sally field plays forrest's mother, mrs. gump, who just is a book of wisdom. with pithy quotes such as 'stupid is as stupid does' and 'life is like a box of chocolates. you never know what you're gonna get', it's no wonder why forrest is able to get to all of the historical time periods. hanks was superb as gump. his southern drawl seemed authentic and his naive character, he was able to bring out 100%, without me thinking for a moment that this was someone other than forrest gump himself. i thought that robin wright, who plays jenny, was also exceptional and brought out all that was needed for her complex character. field had a small role but also brought out her best and made me believe that she was mrs. gump, not sally field. gary sinise plays lieutenant dan, forrest's lieutenant from vietnam. he lost both of his legs, but soon meets forrest again and go on 'crazy schmes', so to speak. his loss of legs was made by wrapping a blue thing around his lower legs, which allowed them to be digitally removed. forrest gump is a touching, moving, gripping, and sometimes funny journey through the eyes of someone with an i.q. of 75. you'll never be the same when you view the world through the eyes of forrest gump. my rating: 9/10 rated pg-13 for strong language, sensuality, war violence, and drug content.;4 January 2003;9;['forr', 'popular', 'young', 'fatherless', 'forr', 'much', 'separate', 'other', 'forr', 'fascinating', 'heavy', 'tedious', 'overwhelming', 'different', 'forr', 'forr', 'good', 'historic', 'forr', 'genuine', 'alive', 'certain', 'curious', 'sorry', 'sally', 'forr', 'pithy', 'such', 'stupid', 'stupid', 'forr', 'able', 'historical', 'superb', 'southern', 'authentic', 'naive', 'able', 'other', 'forr', 'exceptional', 'complex', 'small', 'good', 'sally', 'forr', 'crazy', 'blue', 'low', 'forr', 'touching', 'funny', 'same', 'forr', 'strong'];0.1043233082706766

190;TaylorYee94;of course i heard about this famous 'run, forrest, run!', and how forrest gump is the best of hanks' acting career. however, i'm telling you this was not my kind of movie according to basic information provided. it has one narrative which happens to be biographical. my first thought is that 'forrest gump' will be another linear story talking about one character throughout the whole movie. linear story lacks dynamic and bores me. second, it is very american, the stuff only hollywood clique will enjoy. i keep myself away from the literatures that emphasize patriotism too much. however, this movie does not bore me a bit for 150 minutes. even though gump narrates his whole life from the childhood to fatherhood, it feels more segmented. by cutting each chunk of life story and getting back to gump in the bus station back and forth, it feels like the movie is giving the audience break after each session. i get to refresh and sum up at every scene of gump at the bus stop. also, supporting characters are unique and powerful, making the movie more dynamic. rather than having many insignificant supporting characters, the director chooses to select and concentrate on three. then, the audience can hear about the full story of jenny, bubba, and lt. dan, sharing the story with gump. even though there were many american historical moments, they were just necessary to develop along with gump's story. and it was funny to see presidents and elvis alive again with visual effects. life lessons given to the audience are not just for americans. many countries go through conflict, turmoil, and destruction, and 'forrest gump' concentrates on what choice an individual, gump, makes during those historical chaos. i cried a lot watching this movie because every character was me, my parents, my grandparents, my neighbor, and my heroes. gump's warm heart really console me at difficult times.;3 October 2020;10;['famous', 'forr', 'forr', 'good', 'basic', 'biographical', 'first', 'forr', 'linear', 'whole', 'linear', 'dynamic', 'american', 'whole', 'unique', 'powerful', 'dynamic', 'many', 'insignificant', 'full', 'many', 'american', 'historical', 'necessary', 'funny', 'alive', 'visual', 'many', 'forr', 'individual', 'historical', 'warm', 'difficult'];0.1929999999999999
191;PIST-OFF;i like forrest gump. it's a very emotionally packed movie that is well acted, written, and filmed. i think the film adaptation is better than the book itself and the deep symbolism play an important role in that. the rcreation of five decades in american history is truly a feat to be hailed. and the soundtrack is a very good mix of oldies. one thing that strikes me as impressive in this movie is the attention to details. such as the filming of bubba's ansectors and lt. dan's history of ansestors dying in wars. even the most standard of short scenes can take hours to film. these quick flashbacks take up less than 12 seconds of film and weren't even totally necessary to film, but they did anyway. that gives this movie an a for effort in my book.;24 April 1999;8;['forr', 'well', 'deep', 'important', 'american', 'good', 'impressive', 'such', 'short', 'quick', 'less', 'necessary'];0.2266666666666667

201;Flagrant-Baronessa;in all fairness and all cliches and preachy political statements aside, forest gump is an extremely watchable film on a basic level. if you just see it as a straightforward biographical story, then director robert zemeckis really gets you involved in the main character throughout his life. it features comedy, a war story, portrayals of eras, issues of acceptance and tops it off with a romance story--all supported by mostly strong performances and a fantastic soundtrack. however, when you scratch the surface of some of these things--and sometimes you don't even have to--you see the many issues that the film attempts to tackle and they are so many and so stupidly treated that it really ends up a babble of political correctness. aids, prostitution, racism, war, drugs and conformity are all touched upon at various stages of forest's life as he experiences them like the innocent child that he is. the treatment of some of these issues is offensively moralistic and perpetuates and facilitates the holier-than-thou moral high-ground that zemeckis takes in the film. example: forest fights in vietnam war. forest denounces war. forest makes best friends with an african american guy. forest won't take drugs. forest helps bitter handicapped guy. forest has a sincere mind. the only remotely rebellious character in this film is killed off with aids. or maybe i'm simply too cynical to truly enjoy forest gump and its preachy optimism and 'fine-and-dandy' attitude. either way, this film is obnoxiously politically correct but still quite enjoyable. 6/10;23 July 2006;6;['preachy', 'political', 'watchable', 'basic', 'straightforward', 'biographical', 'main', 'strong', 'fantastic', 'many', 'many', 'political', 'various', 'innocent', 'moralistic', 'holy', 'moral', 'high', 'good', 'bitter', 'handicapped', 'sincere', 'only', 'rebellious', 'cynical', 'preachy', 'fine', 'correct', 'enjoyable'];0.1841666666666666

208;LloydBayer;"when i saw forrest gump, rocky suddenly became a close second on my list of favorite movies. although both these movies are totally different in genre, budget, plot and even levels of acting, their common ground in my opinion is they are both underdog stories. but why forrest gump is my favorite movie of all time is way beyond its underdog factor. it is the nature of the film, with an overwhelming message of innocence of heart and purity of soul that i still find an unfathomable experience every time i watch this movie. i have watched it many, many times, and each time i am deeply moved by its simple yet profound inner meaning. as alan silvestri's soul stirring original score plays through the opening credits, a single white feather twists, turns and drifts through the air, ultimately landing near the protagonist's dirty running shoes. waiting at a bus stop, forrest gump picks up the feather and places it in a bedtime story book he's had since a kid. as another patron sits besides him waiting for a bus, forrest narrates his epic yet unbelievable story. and what a story it is! in flash backs it narrates how as a child he was an outcast in society only because his iq is below average and acceptable levels. but as forrest continues his story, the one person who believes he is no different from anyone else is his mother, and through her can-do attitude, how he got to be where he is: a decorated vietnam war hero commended by the us president, an international sports icon commended by another us president, how he influenced pop culture, and how he got to be recognized by fortune magazine as a multi-millionaire. the very few cynical critics who also enjoyed this movie, feel gump's fortune from impossible twists of fate are implausible coincidences any real person may never encounter however lucky that person may be, more so with below average intelligence. maybe so. but let's not forget, albert einstein had to re-sit his college entrance examination before he started theorizing rocket science. coming back to gump, you have to see him to believe that honesty and loyalty are virtues very few people possess, but for the ones that do, achieving greatness will seem like miracles from heaven. and now for the people who made it all happen. collecting his second oscar for best actor in two consecutive years (first oscar as andrew beckett in philadelphia, 1993), tom hanks as gump is absolutely outstanding and redefines the way you pronounce the word 'chocolate'. easily the most memorable role of his career thus far, hanks will make you laugh, cry, and fall off your seat doing both. to this day, john travolta regrets having turned down the role, and for good reason, as i can't think of anyone else who could have done it the way hanks did. playing gump's only friend, mentor and commanding officer having lost both legs in vietnam is gary sinise as lt. dan in his first and only oscar nominated supporting role. another exceptional feat here, and together with hanks, forms some of the best parts in the movie. hanks and sinise would appear again just a year later in the dual oscar winning apollo 13. playing the women influencing gump's life is sally field as his ""mama"" and robin wright as his one true love, building on a life long relationship since childhood. both field and wright's characters are played flawlessly in a way where gump's method of reasoning comes from his mother while the inspiration behind his adventures comes from wright's character as jenny. also worth mentioning is michael conner humphreys as young forrest, who reportedly influenced hanks' southern alabama accent and the introduction of haley joel osment as gump's adorable son. yes, the same kid who sees dead people in sixth sense. finally, kudos to director robert zemeckis for this brilliant achievement in contemporary film making. adapted for the screen by eric roth (another oscar) from winston groom's novel of the same name, forrest gump is to zemeckis what the mona lisa is to leonardo da vinci. besides the six oscars generated including ""best director"" and ""best picture"", the true mettle of his work lies in integrating the various components of this film into one history altering, ground breaking, block-buster. what we have here is one movie with multiple genres of war, comedy, romance, drama and tragedy all rolled into one unforgettable classic. with friends like steven spielberg and josh lucas, visual effects and cgi are incredible to say the least. and to think this film was made more than a decade before celine dion's duet with elvis presley. if i explain that last line, i'll be letting out some of the best treats of the film. the only way zemeckis can undo himself now is if he makes a sequel. for those who think forrest gump is too much of a dim-wit to make it in this real and fierce world, then these are the people to watch out for, because they are predators who can screw you over without so much as batting an eye lid. and for those who think forrest is a character in a modern fairy tale, then stop for a second and reflect on what a fairy tale really is. it may be nothing but a fable, but it is always a fictitious story with a moral message. whether this fable has a happy ending doesn't really matter, as long as the moral of the story is understood loud and clear. and so i can go on and on as to why you should watch this movie, or buy it and frame it and buy another copy just to watch it every other month; but i can never emphasize enough that each time you watch this movie, it will be like reading a chapter from chicken soup for the soul.";17 June 2011;10;['forr', 'close', 'favorite', 'different', 'common', 'forr', 'favorite', 'overwhelming', 'unfathomable',

211;roghache;this is the warmly amusing, thought provoking tale of forrest gump, a man who despite low intelligence, manages to lead a fulfilled and productive life...even gaining fame on many fronts. forrest himself reveals his story in flashback to a series of assorted passengers waiting at a bus stop bench. as a child growing up in rural alabama, he suffers from polio and must wear leg braces, in addition to coping with ridicule from other school kids because of his diminished mental capacity. forrest discovers that he can run like the wind, leading to a football scholarship and college diploma. then he joins the military and serves in vietnam, where he saves the life of his commander, lieutenant dan, but sees his best friend, bubba, die in his arms. later he becomes a ping pong champion, attending competition in communist china. after being discharged from the army, forrest sets up a shrimp boat company, bubba gump, as he & pal bubba had planned, becoming a millionaire. eventually he decides that he 'feels like running', so spends about three years crossing the country! not a dull life for someone with an iq of around 75. interspersed with forrest's personal tale are assorted historical people and events from the late 1950's to 1970's. forrest just happens to find himself a central personage in various movements (kkk, civil rights, and war protest), exposes watergate, and inadvertently invents the smiley face. he meets presidents kennedy, johnson, and nixon (who bestow his medal of honour and such), teaches elvis to dance, and inspires john lennon's song imagine..all the while blissfully unaware. of course it's all nonsense (great special effects!), but these exaggerated absurdities point out how the forrests of this world do contribute to society and that unsung heroes may lie behind famous celebrities. throughout his life, forrest loves a girl named jenny, who befriends him during childhood and defends him against his taunting schoolmates. for years they are childhood playmates 'like peas & carrots', and forrest imparts a feeling of safe refuge to jenny, who has her own trials dealing with her father's sexual abuse. forrest's ongoing love for jenny is a constantly touching theme, even as she experiences a turbulent young adulthood filled with sex and drugs, becomes a stripper and later hippie, is involved with the black panters, and eventually suicidal. forrest does everything for jenny and always seeks to protect her, although for years she rejects his love and instead prefers abusive men, a result of her childhood experiences. the story's end is beautiful but heart wrenching. forrest & jenny's lovemaking produces a little son, who remains unknown to his dad throughout his early years. by now jenny has come to grips with her personal demons, welcomes forrest's unconditional love, and finally agrees to marriage. alas, she has also been diagnosed with a terminal illness (possibly aids). forrest & jenny have a lovely wedding, but shortly thereafter she dies and leaves their son, little forrest, in the care of his father. the scene where jenny tells forrest about his son is surely the film's most moving, as forrest is flabbergasted with joy that he's the father of this beautiful boy but is also tearfully concerned as to whether he's smart or like his dad. jenny assures him that little forrest is a very intelligent child. only the coldest heart would remain unmoved by this scene, the later one at jenny's grave, or any of those showing little forrest with his doting dad. the character of lieutenant dan is masterfully done, as initially gump's commanding officer resents forrest for having saved his life, forcing his adjustment to living without his legs. later lieutanant dan joins forrest's shrimp boat operation and the pair become friends. it is probably thanks to forrest that dan comes to peace with god, following his vietnam experiences. forrest's 'best good friend', bubba, is also well captured, a rather slow underdog type who's shrimp obsessed. tom hanks gives a brilliant oscar winning portrayal of the rather slow witted but pure hearted forrest. sally field is also wonderful as his practical and doting mother, who convinces forrest that he can make whatever he wants of his life and shouldn't feel inferior to anyone. early in the film, mrs. gump ensures her son's enrollment in a regular school by sleeping with the principal! from an early age, mrs. gump informs her son that 'stupid is as stupid does'...the film's ongoing theme. forrest is aware of his limited intelligence but deals cheerfully and matter of factly with it, experiencing no resentment over his situation or bitterness toward those who put him down. he is the very model of innocence, the essence of the pure in heart. unlike the intelligent folk in the movie, forrest does not behave stupidly, but with kindness, generosity, loyalty, and honour, always keeping his promises. it's a film that definitely makes the viewer question...exactly who are the stupid ones in this story? certainly jenny, with her unwise lifestyle choices. but frankly, in all the ways that count, not forrest. only in the scene where forrest so touchingly questions jenny about his son's intelligence do we grasp how much forrest has suffered, wanting his son spared any ridicule for being slow but instead able to lead a 'normal' life with all the best opportunities. this is a beautiful story, with surely one of the most endearing heroes in cinematic history. hopefully, it will inspire everyone to treat those having mental limitations with the dignity and respect they deserve. the picture of young forrest running to escape pursuit by those bicycling bullies is a vivid reminder of the cruel taunts the mentally challenged sometimes suffer even in this supposedly enlightened era. forrest understands everything truly important in life...family, friendship, love, country, and faith in god. it is a tale of great morality and great simplicity. especially with regard to loyalty, we all have a lot to learn from forrest gump.;30 April 2006;10;['amusing', 'forr', 'low', 'fulfilled', 'productive', 'many', 'forr', 'assorted', 'rural', 'other', 'diminished', 'mental', 'forr', 'good', 'bubba', 'forr', 'dull', 'forr', 'personal', 'assorted', 'historical', 'late', 'forr', 'central', 'various', 'civil', 'watergate', 'smiley', 'such', 'unaware', 'great', 'special', 'exaggerated', 'famous', 'forr', 'forr', 'safe', 'own', 'sexual', 'ongoing', 'touching', 'turbulent', 'young', 'stripper', 'black', 'suicidal', 'forr', 'abusive', 'beautiful', 'little', 'unknown', 'early', 'personal', 'forr', 'unconditional', 'terminal', 'lovely', 'little', 'forr', 'forr', 'moving', 'forr', 'beautiful', 'smart', 'little', 'forr', 'intelligent', 'cold', 'unmoved', 'later', 'little', 'forr', 'forr', 'forr', 'forr', 'good', 'good', 'slow', 'obsessed', 'brilliant', 'slow', 'witted', 'pure', 'hearted', 'sally', 'wonderful', 'practical', 'forr', 'inferior', 'regular', 'early', 'stupid', 'stupid', 'ongoing', 'forr', 'aware', 'limited', 'very', 'pure', 'intelligent', 'forr', 'viewer', 'stupid', 'forr', 'forr', 'much', 'forr', 'slow', 'able', 'normal', 'good', 'beautiful', 'endearing', 'cinematic', 'mental', 'young', 'forr', 'vivid', 'cruel', 'forr', 'important', 'great', 'great', 'forr'];0.1568242790073776

218;dr_clarke_2;"robert zemeckis' forrest gump is much-loved, as is its star tom hanks. but it's an odd beast, and often crops up on lists of films that won the academy award for best picture, but really shouldn't have. a little scrutiny reveals some of the reasons why: more than a quarter of a century after it was released, it resembles nothing so much as a curate's egg. loosely based on a novel by winston groom, forrest gump is a whistle-stop tour of the second half of twentieth-century america, focalised through the eponymous character. gump meets john f. kennedy, witnesses george wallace's ""stand in the schoolroom door"", observes sixties counter-culture, serves in vietnam, becomes tangentially involved in the watergate scandal, meets john lennon, and much, much more. at times it's quite funny, for example when gump's mother has sex with the school principle to safeguard gump's education, and when jenny lets forrest touch breasts, causing him to ejaculate. at other times, it's quite moving, such as when gump tearfully says goodbye to jenny at her grave. mostly however, it's actually rather dull. forrest gump is often interpreted as a conservative movie, one argument being that gump's clean-living and successful lifestyle is positively contrasted with that of his friend and (briefly) lover jenny, who adopts a hippy counter-culture lifestyle, takes drugs and eventually dies of an std. the only people likely to interpret the film in this way are those too stupid to make the link between the sexual abuse she suffers as a child and the psychological damage it causes her as an adult, which only forrest gump's unconditional love for her provides her with any respite from. more relevant to the conservative argument is the fact that gump - who serves his country in vietnam without question - is rewarded (dramatically if not literally) by stumbling into fame and fortune without doing a great deal to actually earn it, arguably peddling the blatantly false message that serving america with unswerving loyalty brings its own rewards. dan taylor's fate might initially seem to contradict or at least counterbalance this argument, but then he too gets a pat and twee happy ending. tom hanks has described the film as non-political and non-judgmental and there's perhaps some truth in that. the film shows various events through gump's eyes, but he doesn't pass comment on any of them (which is patronisingly implied to be because with an iq of seventy-five he doesn't have enough insight or understanding to do so). notably, when gump decides to start running non-stop for four years, people ask him what cause he's running for, listing several examples; he says he just felt like running. ultimately, for all the interpretations that forrest gump has been subjected to, it might simply what it appears to be at face value: a vapid film about an utterly boring character that just happens to have impressive production values. and it is vapid. the character of gump is of course completely unbelievable, blundering through life and meeting famous people, surviving adversity almost by accident, and achieving unlikely successes as a ping pong player and a shrimp-boat captain. his teaching elvis to dance, inspiring john lennon to write ""imagine"", inspiring a man to make a fortune with ""bad things happens"" car bumper stickers and other such contrivances are embarrassingly trite. tom hanks gives an impressively convincing performance as gump and occupies the role so naturalistically that he becomes gump; it's quite remarkable, a performance that sees him bring a specific accent, body language and facial expressions to the part and maintain them throughout. but gump's naivete and innocence are his only defining characteristics; as a result, he's likeable but incredibly boring. robin wright is very good as jenny, who is a vastly more interesting character than gump but still something of a cliche, whilst gary sinise is very good as lieutenant dan taylor, but who is no better written than jenny and is basically ron kovic writ small and with the anti-war activism removed. what does impress about the film is the direction. zemeckis' long fascination with technology makes him well suited to special effects that allow dead famous people to appear in the film and incorporate newsreel footage, often with gump added. visually, the film is distinctive right from the opening shot of the feather drifting down to land at gump's feet. there are lots of nice touches, for example when hanks plays gump's ku klux klan ancestor in a brief flashback shot, and sinise plays taylor's ancestors dying in various wars throughout history in another. the cinematography is glorious and makes the film look amazing. the soundtrack consists almost entirely of songs from the various periods in which the film is set and is one of the best things about the movie. few could deny the talent involved into making forrest gump, or that it's beautifully made and acted. ultimately however, it's pretty but very superficial.";8 July 2020;4;['forr', 'odd', 'good', 'little', 'more', 'forr', 'second', 'twentieth', 'eponymous', 'schoolroom', 'counter', 'involved', 'much', 'more', 'funny', 'forr', 'other', 'moving', 'such', 'dull', 'forr', 'conservative', 'successful', 'hippy', 'counter', 'culture', 'only', 'likely', 'stupid', 'sexual', 'psychological', 'forr', 'unconditional', 'relevant', 'conservative', 'great', 'false', 'own', 'least', 'happy', 'non', 'political', 'non', 'judgmental', 'various', 'enough', 'non', 'several', 'forr', 'boring', 'impressive', 'unbelievable', 'famous', 'unlikely', 'bad', 'other', 'such', 'trite', 'convincing', 'remarkable', 'specific', 'facial', 'likeable', 'boring', 'good', 'interesting', 'good', 'small', 'anti', 'war', 'long', 'suited', 'special', 'dead', 'famous', 'distinctive', 'nice', 'brief', 'various', 'glorious', 'amazing', 'various', 'good', 'few', 'forr', 'pretty', 'superficial'];0.1256601731601731

228;renegadeviking-271-528568;"i could never quite get myself to watch 'forrest gump' but when i did; i had to write about it. once, i was on youtube and saw this episode of tom hanks and meryl streep on ellen's show where tom hanks enacts the famous line 'life is a box of chocolates'. the next thing i knew i was watching 'forrest gump'. certainly, forrest gump is strange; strange in a way that 'the curious case of benjamin button' and 'the great gatsby' are. such stories cannot be 'the help' which is like a telltale of a real-life situation. forrest gump is unusual, a bit slow at times but completely absorbing. forrest gump is about this boy, born with cognitive disability but lives an extraordinary life. he is able to get an education, enroll for sports and excel in every aspect of life. though there is a certain disclaimer landing forrest in disastrous situations, courtesy his marginal intelligence. forrest's personal life is tied with world events that of the vietnam war, protests against the war back home in america, a chance meeting with lennon and so on. once the movie was over, i was keen on reading the book. (yes, i believe - books and movies happen to you as and when they decide so my tbr always goes for a toss.) the moment you open the book, you realize mama never said 'life is a box of chocolates. you never know what you're gonna get'. rather, forrest begins by saying, ""let me say this: bein a idiot is no box of chocolates"". the book was published in 1986 and the movie came out in 1994, and i think the movie was written on the premise that cognitive capabilities cannot be picturized with negativity. the hero of the movie, suffering from whatever condition, has to be the hero; he needs to bring happiness, laughter and the feeling of final victory. in the book, you see forrest grow infront of you; he is narrating his story to you. it is an incredible story that even a local newspaper guy refuses to believe. the movie begins with forrest gump recounting his life's tales to strangers waiting for their bus at a bus stop. and, he begins his story as a young kid with braces on his legs, the physical disability in addition to his low iq. forrest gump is described as 6'6'' tall and weighing 240 pounds in the book but then tom hanks made the character his own. as hollywood stepped in to make movie on this book, it is said that the book sales skyrocketed. yes, a brilliantly written and conceived book needed the movie to get the reader to reach 'forrest gump'. forrest gump is mentioned as an 'idiot' without giving us the specifics on his actual cognitive abilities but surely, he is autistic as inferred from the writing. in my head, i have succumbed to spell ask as 'axe' just like forrest. people laugh, lose patience, treat you shabby. now they says folks sposed to be kind to the afflicted, but let me tell you - it ain't always that way. there are many things that you would dislike about the movie once you have read the book. first, you realize why 'bubba' is so overtly caricatured in celluloid...because the makers wanted to merge bubba with big sam and sue, the orangutan. the portions set in vietnam are kind of eccentric. but the book never tried to be funny or eccentric. forrest genuinely faces trouble in the war-torn highlands of vietnam. it is a personalized account of the experience in a distant foreign land with strong emotions and told with great honesty, you cannot question an ounce of overt depiction in the narrative. second, jenny isn't the character built by winston groom. it is as if the writers of the movie wanted to justify jenny's rebellious attitude towards life, she couldn't just take off to be a singer in a music band or be part of protests on free will. so, childhood abuse is added to her character. it is adorable to see forrest and jenny 'like carrots and peas' in the movie. and, there are umpteen google searches asking if the book also describes them the same. sadly, no. jenny and forrest have a very different relationship, a more longer and equal relationship. and, forrest isn't an idiot when it comes to sexuality in the book. his relationship with jenny is one of the key parameters where the author wants to convey that more than mental faculties, sometimes life is how it is destined to be. hmm...i really wish the section where forrest lands amidst the natives in the forlorn new guinea was part of the movie. i enjoyed reading this section so much, but then the makers would have needed to add big sam playing chess with forrest in the settlement with native cannibals, plus the later part with forrest playing in an international chess championship. from the moment forrest is picked up by nasa for being an incredible mathematical genius and sent to space, it is like reading fantasy. it actually made me be on my toes to prepare myself to stumble upon a sentence reading then forrest woke up in the mental asylum but refused to leave his delusions behind. from ping pong and saving chairman mao to running with the famous actress raquel welch (wearing nothing but a banana leaf to cover herself) and becoming rich over shrimp business, it is unbelievable how winston groom could think of all this!

233;Silverzero;winning umpteen different oscars in 1994 and constantly parodied, forrest gump manages to live up to its 'classic' status. although it does become a bit too manipulative and sometimes surreal in parts, it's also very witty and joyfully nostalgic. tom hanks does the role of crippled hero forrest gump (the most parodied character on the planet). he's ideal for the role but despite whoever takes on the role, the character himself is very unconvincing. gary sinise is a lot more convincing as a cynical vietnam soldier. sally field (melodramatic as usual) doesn't show us anything new but is good for the part nonetheless. robin wright doesn't do much in the film, even though the plot kind of revolves around her. a but more conviction would have been helpful. what the film is best for is its wonderful depiction of the rockin' 50's, the swingin 60's and the sleazy 70's. this is accompanied by a soundtrack, which is well suited to the times. however, the film falls way short on its portrayal of the (glitzy?) 80's. the costumes, set designs and attitudes seem very inappropriate and very little thought went into this part of the movie. the other problem is the script. for the most part it is good but it gets too inventive in some scenes and goes way too far. some surrealism is ok but having one man be involved in every major event in three decades is crossing the line. overall, 'forrest gump' probably didn't deserve to win the oscar for best picture, but if you put all of the evident flaws aside, you have a great movie. i give it 7.5/10.;15 March 2003;7;['umpteen', 'different', 'forr', 'manipulative', 'surreal', 'witty', 'nostalgic', 'crippled', 'forr', 'parodied', 'ideal', 'unconvincing', 'convincing', 'cynical', 'melodramatic', 'usual', 'new', 'good', 'much', 'more', 'helpful', 'good', 'wonderful', 'sleazy', 'suited', 'inappropriate', 'little', 'other', 'most', 'good', 'inventive', 'ok', 'major', 'forr', 'good', 'evident', 'great'];0.3276679841897233

252;basrutten;"contains spoilers ""forrest gump"" is a very creative and clever movie that tells roughly thirty years of recent american history through the eyes of a rather stupid person who somehow manages to be present at many important events of the last half century. tom hanks, as forrest gump, meets three american presidents, inspires elvis and john lennon, becomes a war hero in vietnam, and much more. i must say that i had my doubts when i heard about this movie, but much to my surprise i found this movie to be often very funny. it's not a movie that constantly has you laughing out loud, but several jokes like forrest teaching elvis to dance are priceless, and there are a lot of quotable one-liners. looking at other comments, i see that people have tried to see all kinds of political agendas behind this movie, but for the most part i think it should just be taken as harmless fun, although there are a couple of clear points of criticism (e.g. the movie claims that stupidity is the key to succeeding in the army, and that you can get a college degree by just being good at sports). technically, this movie is great. the special effects people have done a great job of making it look like forrest gump really was a part of history, and the costumes and settings are all completely convincing. the acting is also superb. tom hanks makes forrest totally convincing, and the rest of the cast is great as well. gary sinise is probably the most underrated actor ever, this man deserves to get leading roles, not just supporting ones. i do have a couple of gripes with this movie. for one, at over two-and-a-half hours, it's a bit on the long side. after about one-and-a-half hours, the novelty wears off a bit and while there are still some good scenes in the second part of the movie, the first half is definitely better. also, towards the end the movie succumbs a bit too much into sentimentality. i mean, was it really necessary to overdo the tragic romance (including very tragic ending) between jenny and forrest in this way? in a movie that's mostly fairly lighthearted, putting so much emphasis on the rather melodramatic romance just seems a bit misplaced. all in all though, ""forrest gump"" is a very amusing movie and often hilarious movie with a clever plot and superb acting, that unfortunately drags on for a bit too long and succumbs a bit to sentimentality in the end. *** out of **** stars";18 July 2004;8;['forr', 'creative', 'clever', 'recent', 'american', 'stupid', 'present', 'many', 'important', 'last', 'half', 'forr', 'american', 'more', 'funny', 'several', 'forr', 'priceless', 'quotable', 'other', 'political', 'most', 'harmless', 'clear', 'good', 'great', 'special', 'great', 'forr', 'convincing', 'superb', 'forr', 'convincing', 'great', 'underrated', 'long', 'good', 'second', 'first', 'well', 'necessary', 'tragic', 'tragic', 'forr', 'much', 'melodramatic', 'misplaced', 'forr', 'amusing', 'hilarious', 'clever'];0.2294566544566544

268;kyrat;"maybe the book was better. i get that they were going for a ""stupid is as stupid does"", to show the triumph of optimism, et al. but mostly this movie just made me sad. sad that forrest was treated this way. sad that even his triumphs were accidental. the fact that they had forrest get to meet elvis, the president(s), john lennon and all those other historical figures just made it seem even more fake than the cgi it took to add him to all those historical scenes (george wallace, jfk, johnson, etc.) it threw you out of the realism of the film -- and also seemed so unrealistic that someone like forrest could achieve those kinds of things outside of a film. finally, i don't understand anyone considering his love of jenny as a true romance. yes, i believe he loved her. i believe that she loved him in her own way, but not romantically. i understand that she was incredibly messed up by the sexual abuse of her father and that's why she pursued the self-destructive life she did. i understand that she felt she might not be worthy of forrest because she was suicidal and messed up. she seems to have tried to turn her life around right before she died of aids, and was trying to provide for herself without relying on a man. my interpretation of jenny relationship with forrest was either: 1. she came home because she was pregnant (cue her sleeping all the time), then had sex with forrest, then years later when sick, claimed he was the father, so her son would be taken care of. or 2. forrest truly was the father (and there are hints such as them bending their heads the same way while watching tv & fishing). if so, why did she not tell forrest he had a child until she was dying? i understand maybe she didn't want to marry him and raise the child together - but that still seemed cruel. again, i feel that she only married him at the end as she was dying to give the child a parent. not because she felt true romantic love for forrest. best part of the film were the performances. i did like gary sinese's performance, that was outstanding. his bitterness at being rescued, his life trajectory and turn around were handled very well. tom hanks did a good job of portraying forrest with dignity. and robin wright did a fairly good job as a self-destructive victim struggling to come to terms with her life.";26 July 2015;6;['well', 'stupid', 'stupid', 'sad', 'sad', 'forr', 'sad', 'accidental', 'forr', 'other', 'historical', 'fake', 'historical', 'unrealistic', 'forr', 'true', 'own', 'sexual', 'destructive', 'worthy', 'forr', 'suicidal', 'forr', 'pregnant', 'forr', 'sick', 'forr', 'such', 'same', 'forr', 'cruel', 'true', 'romantic', 'forr', 'good', 'outstanding', 'good', 'forr', 'good', 'destructive'];-0.0767636684303351

284;Torgo_Approves;"(r#79) i would lie if i said that forrest gump isn't an extremely well made movie. from the acting, to the feel-good story, to the pacing, comic timing, and fantastic soundtrack, it is one of the best movies ever made. tom hanks is good as the titular character, and gary sinise and robin wright penn make for a strong supporting cast. robert zemeckis' direction hits all the right notes. the movie is also visually beautiful. so why did i only give it a 7 out of 10? well, as well produced, directed and acted as the film is, there is an underlying cynicism that doesn't work well with the movie's innocent and good-hearted nature. the ""heart-breaking"" scenes become more and more obvious and deliberate with each viewing. don't get me wrong, this is a great feel-good story and i did love it when i was younger. maybe i am just growing more desensitized to this kind of warm-hearted, mushy stuff. the problem probably lies more with me than with the film itself, but i still can't help but feel that zemeckis was a bit too elaborate. there are scenes that, when you're re-watching the film, seem written specifically to make the audience crack up in tears. it borders on being manipulative, rather than letting the audience think for itself. the movie could have worked as a serious drama. i'm a sucker for movies about mentally challenged men and i loved both ""sling blade"" and the more obscure ""den enfaldige mordaren"". in the former, billy bob thornton delivered a total class act. he embodied his character, karl, to the point where you couldn't possibly compare him to his role in, say, bad santa. in ""den enfaldige mordaren"", stellan skarsgard was also utterly believable. but i just can't buy hanks in this role, even if it's probably the one he'll be remembered for. thornton and skarsgard, in their respective roles, *were* their characters. they were as human and real as you and me. hanks' performance is a pure live-action cartoon, a caricature of a mentally challenged man. he's just too goody-goody. too pure of heart. too goofy and lovable. he's a man with no dark sides, and as such he's completely unbelievable. i did laugh at gump's cute lines and catchphrases. i did feel for him when he got bullied around and when he finally got the girl in the end. but i wonder if anyone actually bought gump as a character rather than just ""tom hanks playing a mentally challenged guy"". another problem is that the movie refuses to take any real risks. there is nothing controversial about the subject matter and nothing really inventive about the movie-making (although it is quite an achievement to fit an entire lifetime into a single film!) 'gump' is not a movie that pushes the envelope in any way. this is still a very enjoyable movie and first-timers will probably love it. it took a lot of viewings for me before my strong feelings for it started to falter. on the surface, ""gump"" is one of the best feel-good movies ever made. but if you read between the lines, it is a cynical and very elaborate movie, nearly manipulative, and specifically designed to make you laugh, cry and pay for repeated cinema viewings. at least hanks and sinise do their best.";8 October 2006;7;['forr', 'good', 'comic', 'fantastic', 'good', 'good', 'titular', 'strong', 'right', 'beautiful', 'underlying', 'innocent', 'good', 'hearted', 'obvious', 'deliberate', 'wrong', 'great', 'good', 'young', 'desensitized', 'hearted', 'mushy', 'more', 'elaborate', 'manipulative', 'serious', 'obscure', 'den', 'former', 'total', 'bad', 'believable', 'respective', 'human', 'real', 'pure', 'live', 'goody', 'pure', 'goofy', 'lovable', 'dark', 'such', 'unbelievable', 'cute', 'real', 'controversial', 'subject', 'inventive', 'entire', 'single', 'enjoyable', 'first', 'strong', 'good', 'good', 'cynical', 'elaborate', 'manipulative', 'least', 'good'];0.2693339646464646
285;CMTiago;forrest gump seems to be a movie that is either dearly loved or passionately torn down. it almost always generates discussion and is a cultural landmark in american cinema. i haven't yet gone in to a discussion like this, but should the moment arise, i will definitely defend it, as it is one of my all time favorites. the thing that always gets me is the innocence in which forrest sees the world. he doesn't really know what he is doing or saying, yet to us he makes a huge difference in the world. on the other side of the coin, jenny makes her own choices. choices that lead to a complicated life and an ultimately predictable demise. unlike other characters that seem to have a positive impact on forrest's life, jenny always seems to be the light in his life, despite being a completely dislikeable person at one point of the movie. once again the naive gump doesn't judge jenny's bad decisions, as he still sees that lovely, but damaged young girl he met when he was a child. as far as the movie making goes, fg presents us with a career defining performance from tom hanks, as he handles the emotional conflicts very well in the movie. in a midst of strong supporting performances, for me gary sinise steals the show as lieutanent dan taylor, a man whose changes in life end up being an inspiration. zemeckis's directing is precise, and roth's script is very involving: in the end though, i think alan silvestri's delicate score is what accounts for at least 50% of the movie's dramatic effect. 1994 will always be a year i will fondly remember as a great cinematic year. it features 3 jim carrey comedies that cemented his place in movie history, one of the greatest animated movies of all time, and 3 best picture nominees that would become worshiped movies. whether it's with pulp fiction's violent world, or shawshank redemption's gritty prison vision, or even the endearing drama story that is forrest gump, this is top notch cinema. rating: 10/10;6 September 2014;10;['forr', 'cultural', 'forr', 'huge', 'other', 'own', 'complicated', 'predictable', 'other', 'positive', 'forr', 'dislikeable', 'naive', 'bad', 'lovely', 'young', 'emotional', 'strong', 'precise', 'delicate', 'dramatic', 'great', 'cinematic', 'great', 'good', 'worshiped', 'violent', 'gritty', 'forr', 'top', 'notch'];0.0865530303030303

299;Kubris;"kids these days don't see the right movies. while teens flock to the latest transformers or saw, they neglect the past- even the not-so- far gone 90's. but there's a strange anomaly in that trend... it seems everybody has seen forrest gump at one time or another. and after finally grabbing it on blu ray, i can say i've joined that rank. forrest gump is a fantastic film, and certainly a good one for the masses to see. there's a better chance than not that if you're reading this, you've already seen the film. you probably won't find anything here that you've already heard before. but if you haven't, read on! there are better films than forrest gump, but not many, and it is certainly an excellent film to see, arguably mandatory. forrest gump is a simple man with a low iq, born in the 40's. the film follows his life, showing this impossibly innocent man experience some of the most important events of the mid-to-late 20th century. but he doesn't care for any of that: he just wants to be with his girl, jenny. at its heart, forrest gump is a love story set against a historical backdrop. there's a reason the blu ray box says ""tom hanks is forrest gump"". his performance is mesmerizing, a one-of-a-kind portrayal of a one-of-a-kind role. a southern man with a low iq, the embodiment of innocence, who describes things in the most innocent way, like ""the loving father who liked to touch her"", ""the men who dressed up like ghosts"" and other such things the audience understands. and the voice he uses is so iconic and often imitated. but hanks isn't the only great: the film is host to a group of great characters. there's jenny, forrest's childhood friend and love interest. bubba, forrest's war buddy and fellow misfit, who knows everything about the shrimpin' business. lieutenant dan, as the tragic co who has quite a journey. and lastly momma gump, with her motherly advice and willingness to do anything for her son's education. there's a great feeling to the film. forrest is such a hero: he does no wrong, he is the underdog from birth. it's not cute or charming, but a heartwarming story of beating the odds. forrest goes from great scene to great scene, with such greats as football, 'nam, the hurricane, and the anti-war rally. with the exception of the vietnam scene, which is very well handled for such a foreign scene in an otherwise talking-filled movie, the screenplay has wonderful dialogue and a quirky rhythm. a note to those who saw zumeckis' first great film, back to the future. do not expect more of that. 'future' was a comedy with drama added, forrest gump is a drama with humour added. it's a more mature film,and can take some dark turns, like the 'ice cream' scene. i will draw a parallel to goodfellas (a good thing). where goodfellas shows what the powerful did from the 50's to the 80's, forrest shows what the everyman (and woman) did during that time. also, like goodfellas, forrest gump has a fantastic period soundtrack with lots of 'nam and hippie tunes. not quite as expansive as the mob film, but excellent nonetheless. forrest gump is also more specific: such events as the university of alabama conflict, watergate (hilarious) and buying stocks in ""that fruit company"" make for some historically accurate humour, one of gump's greatest strengths. one relationship in particular is fascinating, the main relation between forrest and jenny. they start off the same, but go down wildly different paths, one constructive, the other destructive. they are such opposite people, but only jenny realizes that. it makes the ending much more interesting, and so much more touching to see forrest question ""if he's smart"". this is one of the most fascinating aspects of the film. this won the oscar for visual effects, but i didn't see it at first. the effects are very subtle. like the ping pong ball, the feather, or- what how is he having a conversation with freakin' president jfk? the effects aren't revolutionary, but very effective. i still don't know how they made the conversations with the dead happen. on the back of the blu ray is a quote, claiming the film to be a ""tonic of the weary in spirit"". that's the perfect description. forrest gump is an uplifting tale of what a single man, even a fictional one, can do with the hand he is dealt. in a decade remembered for its cultural violence (silence of the lambs, seven, pulp fiction) forrest gump is a beacon of good nature, and good nature is something everyone needs. 9.1/10";13 January 2012;9;['right', 'late', 'strange', 'forr', 'forr', 'fantastic', 'good', 'well', 'well', 'forr', 'many', 'excellent', 'mandatory', 'forr', 'simple', 'low', 'innocent', 'important', 'late', 'forr', 'historical', 'forr', 'southern', 'low', 'innocent', 'other', 'such', 'iconic', 'only', 'great', 'great', 'fellow', 'tragic', 'momma', 'motherly', 'great', 'forr', 'cute', 'charming', 'forr', 'great', 'great', 'such', 'anti', 'war', 'foreign', 'wonderful', 'quirky', 'first', 'great', 'more', 'forr', 'mature', 'dark', 'good', 'powerful', 'forr', 'forr', 'fantastic', 'expansive', 'excellent', 'forr', 'specific', 'such', 'hilarious', 'accurate', 'great', 'particular', 'fascinating', 'main', 'forr', 'same', 'different', 'constructive', 'other', 'such', 'opposite', 'interesting', 'touching', 'forr', 'smart', 'fascinating', 'visual', 'subtle', 'revolutionary', 'effective', 'dead', 'weary', 'perfect', 'forr', 'uplifting', 'single', 'fictional', 'cultural', 'forr', 'good', 'good'];0.2978466386554622

307;neenahhh;"i watched this a very long time ago, but i never really appreciated this movie. it must have been because i was very young. i wasn't even born when the movie first aired! however, i do remember a few scenes from this movie. the ones that stuck with me throughout the years were the very, very sad scene of bubba dying and the oh-so-famous quote: ""life is like a box of chocolates. you never know what you're gonna get."" this movie starts with a feather floating in the background, getting flown all over in the place, when finally it lands beside some dirty rubber shoes. the owner of these shoes, forrest gump, picks it up and keeps it. he just sits there, quietly all by himself, when a woman sits beside him on his bench. he then greets her and thus, begins the narration of his life story. his story is wonderful. i loved everything about it. forrest wasn't exactly the brightest crayon in the box. on top of that, he couldn't even walk properly. his iq was a poor 75 and he couldn't even get accepted into a public school. but his mother did everything for forrest. his mother was great. you could see she struggling. i thought it was very cute the way jenny and forrest's friendship blossomed. how she invited him to sit beside her. the way they hung around with each other in their tree and just talked about anything and everything. jenny was very protective of forrest. when the first bullying encounter happened and jenny told forrest to run? that made my skin have goosebumps. it just felt good. ""run, forrest! run!"" i also never realized back then that jenny was having trouble with her father. but now, i understand. jenny's prayer was also.. amazing. ""dear god, make me a bird. so i could fly far. far far away from here."" that just touched me. after his friendship with jenny, forrest met bubba during the vietnam war, after he finished college. during the scene where forrest first entered the bus, it was like the first day of school all over again! nobody would let forrest sit with him. until he came upon a guy who had a weird lip jutting out. that was the start of their strong brotherhood. i felt like the time they spent together was so short. i didn't even cry when bubba died. it was weird since i was expecting to cry, seeing as how bubba's scene was the one that stayed with me all throughout the years. i'm so disappointed in my lack of emotional attachment. but i still love bubba. :) it was nice how forrest went on with his shrimp catching business just for the sake of keeping his promise to bubba. the two things that changed during my previous screenings and the one i had tonight were 1.) i liked lt. dan more than i thought i would and 2.) jenny wasn't all that great. i'll talk about lt. dan first. first of all, i didn't even remember him! i was even shocked when i saw that his legs were cut off! see how much that ""didn't"" affect me. but he was a good friend. he became one of forrest's best friends. he even stood up for him when one of the hookers called forrest stupid. i thought dan didn't care, but that proved me wrong. they even became partners with the whole bubba-gump thing. sweet. now, about jenny. i don't see why forrest liked her. yes, i get that they were friends since childhood, but after they grew out of their childhood, she kept leaving him! i was so mad after she left him during ""the morning after"". at least that sparked forrest's will to run all over america. hm. the ending was great. i forgot all about that. what a welcome surprise. it's just a shame that jenny died, too, in the end. all of forrest's loved ones passed away. all he's got left is little forrest. i guess in a way, that was nice. he had someone to look after and someone to look after him. :) there were a lot of great cameos that i was on a look out for. i loved that elvis part! i even took a second look to check if that guy was really elvis! yes. i know. it's impossible since he's already dead, but hey! it seemed realistic. there were also meetings with different presidents. and a deal he had with a very famous ""fruit company"". the cameos just kept coming and coming. and it worked! the main message of this movie was that life just keeps on going. bad things are inevitable, but you can trust that there will be a million good things that will come your way. it's a movie about life. forrest gump teaches you things. he sees the world from a different viewpoint. not an idiot's viewpoint. but a child-like sort-of perspective. no biases at all. just an average things-the-way-they-actually-are perspective. this is one movie you mustn't dare miss. wonderful movie. just wonderful.";29 January 2011;10;['long', 'young', 'few', 'very', 'sad', 'famous', 'dirty', 'forr', 'wonderful', 'forr', 'bright', 'poor', 'public', 'forr', 'great', 'cute', 'forr', 'other', 'protective', 'forr', 'first', 'forr', 'good', 'forr', 'amazing', 'dear', 'forr', 'forr', 'first', 'forr', 'weird', 'strong', 'short', 'weird', 'disappointed', 'emotional', 'bubba', 'nice', 'forr', 'previous', 'great', 'shocked', 'much', 'good', 'forr', 'good', 'forr', 'stupid', 'wrong', 'whole', 'sweet', 'forr', 'mad', 'least', 'forr', 'great', 'welcome', 'forr', 'little', 'forr', 'nice', 'great', 'second', 'elvis', 'impossible', 'dead', 'realistic', 'different', 'famous', 'main', 'bad', 'inevitable', 'good', 'forr', 'different', 'like', 'average', 'wonderful', 'wonderful'];0.1286265432098765

309;Snowgo;probably the most over-rated movie of the 1990's. who is forrest gump? what is inside his head.., or heart, for that matter? all we can establish is that he is unintelligent enough to make it in the army. is he handicapped? not? he is like an anti-person, whom everything happens to, instead of making things happen.., until he acquires inspiration and ambition out of the blue and goes on an impossible running tour. i have not been able to discern an actual point this movie is trying to make, nor establish just who this mentally-challenged millionaire really is. maybe he appeals to so many people because they identify with him? that is a truly scary thought, but apparently, it seems to be the case. a pointless, stupid movie. a salute to powerlessness and vacuousness.;20 November 2014;3;['forr', 'unintelligent', 'anti', 'impossible', 'able', 'actual', 'many', 'scary', 'pointless', 'stupid'];-0.2333333333333332
310;alexpeychev;i have seen this movie easily a half a dozen times, and i find that the beauty of the film is how forrest gump not only shares his innocence and purity with others, including the audience, he also manages to retain that innocence and purity through some very difficult times. as a viet nam veteran, and a college graduate of the late sixties, i could of course personally relate to the various periods that forrest gump endures. i would only mention that the skillful and seamless blending of music, action, and period costume was enthralling. and yet it was so perfectly understated that forrest gump's travels through thirty five years of the stormiest and most meaningful years of american history only became clearly defined for the viewer. even more so than the well known chocolates quote as a metaphor for life, i felt that the remark that stupid is what you do is probably more workable for most of us.;25 January 2021;10;['forr', 'difficult', 'late', 'various', 'forr', 'skillful', 'seamless', 'forr', 'stormy', 'meaningful', 'american', 'stupid', 'workable', 'most'];-0.0625
311;emilie8605;forrest gump was an excellent movie that made me cry **spoiler** when jenny dies and he doesnt get jenny after he repeatedly saves her over and over again from childhood to adulthood. i didnt like the fact that after all that saving, he didnt see that he could truely do better. but the bond they shared when they first met helped me understand the movie and why jenny was a key person to forrest. his journey being told while waiting at the bus stop has some funny moments and tearjerkers. tom hanks did an incredible job portraying forrest, and made me feel for forrest, he made me feel happy when he does **spoiler** break those braces for his legs and made me feel sad when jenny goes away after he just came back from the war. take the movie and watch this with a huge tub of popcorn and a extra large box of kleenex!

313;jaddison383;forrest gump is a film that has a lot to live up to. many people consider this one of their favorite films. plenty of critics put it down as one the better films ever made. as someone picking it up for the first time over ten years after it was made, i was apprehensive of what to expect. yet, just like the character, the film forrest gump is never pretentious even from the very first minute. we meet forrest sitting on a bench waiting for a bus to come. someone sits down next to him, and forrest begins to tell his life story. simple, poignant, and ridiculously funny is this tale of a man who accidentally finds his way into every major event of his generation. forrest changes the world in unimaginable ways, but all he really wants is jenny, his childhood friend and the girl he's loved his entire life. yet this simplicity is where the movie's strength comes in. everything is really very simple for a man whose iq is no greater than 75. this simplicity deceives us into taking a whimsical tale for granted, and then surprises us with its incredibly moving final scenes. we don't quite realize how wrapped up in forrest's world we are until we find ourselves in tears by the end. and when we leave forrest's world, we miss him very much. we miss his easiness and simple way of living. 8/10 stars! jay addison;15 September 2008;7;['forr', 'many', 'favorite', 'well', 'first', 'apprehensive', 'forr', 'pretentious', 'first', 'forr', 'forr', 'simple', 'poignant', 'funny', 'major', 'forr', 'unimaginable', 'entire', 'simple', 'great', 'whimsical', 'final', 'forr', 'forr', 'simple'];0.1208333333333333

315;possumopossum;"so, what the hell is wrong with having a simple outlook on life? i think the reason we have a lot of problems in life is because we're too smart for our own good, that we always try to complicate things. i think that's what this movie was saying. forrest gump took life on its own terms, and he didn't sweat the little things. he just kept on keepin' on, and that's what the movie is saying. ""don't sweat the small stuff."" you don't have to have an iq of 75 to just relax and take it easy. gump may have been smarter than most of his ""normal"" contemporaries. contrary to what jeanie said to him, he knows better than most people what love is. his loyalty to her in spite of the way she crapped on him until she was almost dead is a testament to that. until the end, she was a dingbat. forrest first lost his best friend bubba in viet nam. then, he lost his mother. then, he lost his jeanie. through it all, he remained stoic. there is something very noble in that. intellectually challenged or not, he was still a human being with feelings. he was smart enough to know what dead is, what right and wrong are. when it gets right down to it, that's all we really need to know. this is a great movie. my only complaint about it is this guy who wrote the screenplay obviously didn't know diddly squat about bear bryant. bear was not a very demonstrative coach. he wouldn't have been jumping up and down on the sidelines screaming, ""run you sonofabitch, run!"" bear was always pretty stonefaced on the sidelines. also, i can't help wondering how they made gary sinese look like he lost his legs. that was very impressive, whatever they did to do that. also, intermixing gump with now dead historic figures was very impressive, showing him shaking hands with jfk, lbj, richard nixon, john lennon. still, number one is it is a good story. 9 out of 10.";17 July 2007;9;['wrong', 'simple', 'smart', 'own', 'forr', 'own', 'little', 'small', 'easy', 'smart', 'most', 'normal', 'contrary', 'most', 'dead', 'forr', 'good', 'stoic', 'noble', 'human', 'smart', 'dead', 'wrong', 'great', 'only', 'demonstrative', 'stonefaced', 'impressive', 'dead', 'historic', 'impressive', 'good'];0.2380265567765568

""forrest gump"" ranks as my favorite film of all time, and for many, many reasons. everything about this beautiful fable is compelling, engrossing, endearing, and absolutely classic. from its memorable ""feather"" opening scene, we are instantly acquainted with the simple,remarkable story of a simple,lovable man,wisked away into the eyes of forrest gump. we learn about individuality (""don't ever let anyone tell you you're different""), values (""stupid is as stupid does""),love (""i'm not a smart man... but i love you""), and so many more honest, appreciative qualities to life, all in the tale of a man who has experienced life for everything it is worth, yet lacking the intellectual capacity to conceive the significance of his life. the story takes us from the childhood days of forrest on his uncertain first ride to school, where he meets the love of his life, jenny (""i had never seen anything so beautiful in my life. she was like an angel""), to his first ride of recruitment in the vietnam war, where he befriends his ""best good friend"" bubba, to finally, taking his own son, forrest, to the busstop for his first day of school. the story has been covered; now for my evaluative assessment. everything in this film, from the brilliant, sensible direction, to the incredibly touching tom hanks as forrest gump, in perhaps the best performance in the history of cinema, to the compassionate, understanding score, to the unforgettable screenplay (as i write this review i am constantly tempted to quote a line from the film), to the realistic visual effects (one would believe forrest gump had actually existed with fame), to such delightful performances as lieutenant dan, played hysterically by gary sinise, and etc. etc. etc. i cannot praise this classic, unequaled, monumental film enough; suffice to say, everything here is perfect, this film is excellent on practically every level, and i have not stopped loving ""forrest gump"" since the first time i heard the line, ""life is like a box of chocolates"". this film is an absolute treasure which shines more and more every time you watch it. **** out of ****";3 June 2004;10;['wonderful', 'beloved', 'forr', 'favorite', 'many', 'many', 'beautiful', 'compelling', 'endearing', 'classic', 'memorable', 'simple', 'remarkable', 'simple', 'lovable', 'forr', 'different', 'stupid', 'stupid', 'smart', 'many', 'honest', 'appreciative', 'worth', 'intellectual', 'forr', 'uncertain', 'first', 'beautiful', 'first', 'good', 'good', 'own', 'forr', 'first', 'evaluative', 'brilliant', 'sensible', 'touching', 'forr', 'good', 'compassionate', 'unforgettable', 'realistic', 'visual', 'forr', 'such', 'delightful', 'unequaled', 'monumental', 'perfect', 'excellent', 'forr', 'first', 'absolute'];0.4237528344671201

331;El-Ak;tom hanks was superb you can't really differentiate him from the character of forrest gump. the story is unique and the direction was good. the movie's music wasn't helpful at all could have added more greatness to the scenes. the rhythm of the movie slowed at some parts and was quick at others but the only thing that bothers is that a character like forrest after all of that could have been used better and had better situations and more effective and i really thought of it as a great performance by hanks although i don't feel most of the scenes were the ones that could show us the character and make it way more epic but you will be taken by hank's performance which was the spine of the movie. his love jenny i suppose wasn't that serious character that fits to guide him or help him and should have been another character that makes that great effect in his life. the telling of the story and camera movements were absolutely gorgeous and robert zemeckis did a great job in it along side with the scenario which reflected the characters so well.in the end a great movie! 8.5/10;14 July 2018;8;['superb', 'forr', 'unique', 'good', 'helpful', 'more', 'quick', 'only', 'forr', 'well', 'effective', 'great', 'most', 'epic', 'serious', 'great', 'gorgeous', 'great', 'great'];0.5116666666666666

336;native_girl333;"""forrest gump"" is a heart-warming and always enjoyable drama about a little clueless forrest (outstanding tom hanks) who thinks with his heart, not with his head. and that is why the audiences love him so much. i have seen this movie without a doubt hundreds's of times. it is so sad and touching but it always gives me an extra optimistic boost. the movie is a journey that guides us trough the life of forrest. we visit forrest's life from his alabama childhood to presidential visit's to vietnam war all the way to his days of adulthood. the director robert zemecis has directed this monumental piece with great sense of humor and a touch of sensitivity. the story begins at a bus-stop where forrest waits his bus to come and while waiting he tells his amazing stories to any one who ever sit down with him on the bench. forrest has an interesting life. he had a crooked back when he was a boy and had to have special metal-braces attached to his legs. people are always teasing forrest because of he has low iq. fortunately he has a strong-minded mother (sally field) who is behind his son when the world turns its back on him. he has also jenny (soulful robin wright, nowadays with penn) as his best friend. forrest is in love with wild and troubled jenny but she is hard to tame. later in his life forrest meets some of america's most famous people like three presidents (jfk, lyndon johnson and richard ""water-gate"" nixon), john lennon, the king of rock'n'roll elvis presley etc. forrest becomes a football star, vietnam hero, pin-ball champion, famous enterprise owner and many more. even he don't got the smarts he still manages to get fame, fortune and respect. nevertheless the most important thing to forrest is jenny. jenny is in his thoughts all the time. the absolutely beautiful music composed by alan silvestri is breath-taking. additional music is a massive collection of 60's and 70's feast. nothing can't beat the good old ""break on trough"" by the doors. i have also a copy of the unbelievable soundtrack. robert zemecis grabbed a subject that was and is still somewhat forbidden matter in modern-day society. with these kind of abilities and talent you can make a successful combination. and i don't understand the people who bark on ""forrest gump"". or that fact which is suggesting that tom hanks didn't deserve to win the oscar from his marvelous lead character! you doubting judases should make watch ""forrest gump"" 24 hours in a row to convince you that you have been seriously wrong...

343;Chuck-149;"i know my one line summary might not be that clear so i'm going to explain it to you. in 1994, we had classics like ""the shawshank redemption"" and ""pulp fiction"" who were in nomination at the oscars and were stolen in every category in which they were nominated. they were all stolen by ""forrest gump"". these two other movies which were completely different in their style from the movies of the same genre as them but who came before them were completely over-looked. and the worst part is ""forrest gump"" is simply the biography of forest gump. also, it robbed every movie in the best actor category. of course it isn't that easy to play someone who is mentally ill but it's easier than playing just some ordinary person and playing it well. forrest gump (tom hanks) lives with his mother and comes from north-west alabama. however, he has a slight mental deficiency and a leg problem for which he must wear a brace. when he starts going to school, he is rejected by everyone except the bus-driver and a young girl named jenny. one day after school, while forrest and jenny are hanging together, they are surprised by a bunch of boys from their school who start throwing rocks at forrest. he tries to run away but because of his bad leg, he can hardly get away. this is the classic scene when jenny yells ""run forrest, run."" and as he runs, his brace starts to come off and the boys who were chasing him are unable to catch up to him for he is too fast, even though they have bikes. as the years pass, forrest and jenny (robin wright penn) go their own way. forrest gets into the army and goes to vietnam. but one night in the camp, all the soldiers are in bed and pass on a playboy magazine. when forrest gets it, he realizes jenny has her photograph in it. further on during the war, he saves the life of his lieutenant named don taylor (gary sinise) but loses his best friend bubba. also, his lieutenant is left legless because of the accident whereas the only forrest gets is a bullet in the butt. when forrest gets home, he as many things to do. on of them is to go over to bubba's parents' house to announce to them he was killed in combat. another thing he does is try to find jenny. the movie is a kind of comedy-drama and is pretty good. but i still don't think nor understand how it won best picture, best actor (tom hanks) and best director (robert zemeckis) at the oscars. i mean, if it had really deserved those oscars, wouldn't it get a higher rank than both ""pulp fiction"" and ""the shawshank redemption"" on our top 250 list? i actually believe that the one who deserved an oscar more than anyone else in the movie is gary sinise as lieutenant don taylor. however, it was almost impossible for him to win that year because we had martin landau in nomination for best supporting actor in ""ed wood"" and he truly deserved the oscar he won. so all in all, this isn't a bad movie, it's just way too over-rated.";18 January 2000;6;['clear', 'forr', 'other', 'different', 'same', 'bad', 'forr', 'good', 'easy', 'ill', 'easy', 'ordinary', 'forr', 'slight', 'mental', 'young', 'forr', 'forr', 'bad', 'classic', 'forr', 'unable', 'fast', 'forr', 'own', 'forr', 'forr', 'good', 'legless', 'forr', 'forr', 'many', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'high', 'top', 'more', 'gary', 'impossible', 'good', 'bad'];0.1395

367;Danimal-7;"forrest gump is a vaguely picaresque story of a mentally retarded but good-hearted fellow who grows up during the 1960s and 1970s, serving in the vietnam conflict, running a shrimping trawler, and pursuing a very unlovable childhood sweetheart. he has no control over his life, but is not smart enough to realize it or care. gary sinise co-stars as lt. dan taylor, gump's ex-c.o. who follows him around after the war like an albatross hung around his neck. it's been five years since i saw this movie, but i still remember how it annoyed me, chiefly by appealing to the basest, most jaded parts of the viewers' personalities. the worst instance was when forrest gump tells the audience that his sweetheart jenny's father loves her a lot, always hugging and kissing her. in my theater, a raucous, cynical snicker rippled through the audience at that line; we are intended to conclude from that statement that jenny's father is sexually abusing her, and zemeckis later confirms this leap to a sick conclusion. it is a truly sad commentary both on the entertainment industry and on the viewing public at large that the very concept of fatherhood today is so disrespected that for a father to hug and kiss his daughter is taken per se as a sign of sexual abuse. jenny's character is so despicable that gump's love for her is inexplicable. perhaps it is intended as an example of really ""unconditional"" love, and shows what a sorry thing that kind of love is, much like the wife who clings to an abusive husband no matter what he does to her. her character hits rock bottom when, having abandoned gump like a used-up tissue and taken his child from him without even informing him, jenny refuses even to apologize to him because she was ""messed up."" gump swallows this excuse with stomach-turning ease. now i don't want to launch into some pat-robertson-like tirade on the decline of american morality. american morality is better today than in the past in many ways. racial hatred has gone from being an accepted norm to being absolutely intolerable. rape is blamed on the victim less frequently than in bygone days. sexual double standards are being abandoned. religious tolerance and inter-faith amity are on the upswing. but in some other ways, american morality is deteriorating, and this one excuse, ""i was messed up,"" is perhaps the best example. every kind of barbarism, from jenny's cruel and heartless manipulation of gump up to and including cold-blooded murder, is now excused with the phrase ""i was messed up,"" followed by an endless litany of the wrongdoer's misfortunes. forrest gump wantonly tries to widen this tear in the fabric of the viewers' moral thought. i'm not buying into it. being ""messed up"" may excuse viciousness against the person who messed you up; it should never be allowed to justify hurting innocent people. the movie's exploitation of the mentally handicapped for cheap laughs is also tasteless and vulgar (and yes, i will shamefacedly admit, i laughed at some of this exploitation). i may not want a mental deficient like gump for an airline pilot, but he deserves to be treated with at least basic decency and courtesy, which this movie doesn't; (i.e. where gump, shaking richard nixon's hand, says ""i gotta pee."" this is funny?). the mitigating, if not the saving, virtue of forrest gump is the acting. tom hanks' rendition of a speech impediment might not fool the parent of a mentally retarded child or a speech pathologist, but it certainly convinced me and the average moviegoer. hanks generates the innocence and pleasantness required of the character, and while the voice grated on my nerves a few times, it was bearable. gary sinise as lt. dan taylor is absolutely wonderful, oozing bitterness and cynicism from every pore. i also give forrest gump some grudging praise for being one of the few movies to use the wonders of modern digital special effects to actually drive the plot, rather than distract from it. titanic and jurassic park also broke some ground, but for the most part i think that most directors lack the imagination to get the most out of the potential of modern special effects. zemeckis integrates the effects into his movies more smoothly than most directors have. i didn't really hate forrest gump. it obviously wants to be loved so much that hating it would be like kicking an annoying puppy. but it's morally obtuse, shallow and vulgar. the laughs are guilty laughs, and the philosophy is nothing deeper than the credo that god does indeed look after fools. rating: ** out of ****.";11 October 1999;5;['forr', 'retarded', 'hearted', 'unlovable', 'smart', 'base', 'jaded', 'bad', 'forr', 'raucous', 'cynical', 'sick', 'sad', 'large', 'very', 'sexual', 'despicable', 'inexplicable', 'unconditional', 'sorry', 'abusive', 'like', 'american', 'american', 'well', 'many', 'racial', 'accepted', 'intolerable', 'bygone', 'sexual', 'double', 'religious', 'inter', 'faith', 'other', 'american', 'good', 'cruel', 'heartless', 'cold', 'blooded', 'endless', 'forr', 'moral', 'innocent', 'handicapped', 'cheap', 'tasteless', 'vulgar', 'mental', 'least', 'basic', 'funny', 'forr', 'retarded', 'average', 'few', 'bearable', 'wonderful', 'forr', 'grudging', 'few', 'modern', 'digital', 'special', 'titanic', 'jurassic', 'most', 'most', 'most', 'modern', 'special', 'most', 'forr', 'annoying', 'obtuse', 'shallow', 'vulgar', 'guilty', 'deep'];-0.1000898472596585

371;seveb-25179;"everyone loves this movie... except me. somehow i find the contrast between the unsophisticated, often rather juvenile, style of humour, which is juxtaposed with issues like physical handicap, child molestation, mutilation from war, death from war and cancer, jarring and uncomfortable. for me i would consider the type of broad acting in this film was fine if it were a pure comedy, such as ""ground hog day"", but in this context, where serious issues are supposedly being addressed, it lacks the necessary degree of subtlety (or respect). tom hanks performance is wonderful, but still essentially cartoonish, like gomer pyle. i don't at any time buy into his portrayal as a credible mentally challenged person. (as, for example, i was able to do with dustin hoffman in rain-man) i guess the director's concept was for us to view the events from what is intended to be forrest's limited perspective, but for me it doesn't work. it's told as a fairy-tale, but personally i'm just not comfortable with many of these topics being dealt with in such a shallow fashion. hitchcock knew how to mix humour with suspense, but it's not an easy trick to pull off, this film tries to mix tragedy with comedy and i find it an unpleasant mixture. in the world where little girls are sexually molested by their fathers and young men have their legs amputated after being caught by an exploding shells, crippled kids don't become all american running backs (although they may become gold medal blade runners at the paralympics!) and intellectually handicapped people don't become shrimp magnates. don't get me wrong, i've nothing against a good fairy-tale, but i suspect this movie aspires to be allegorical and profound as well, which it is not. the movie packs in so many traumatic situations that it fails to do any of them justice, and then casually throws historical ones in on top the assassination of the kennedys and john lennon, along with attempts on george wallis and gerald ford are mentioned, although forrest is not present for any of them and doesn't strike me as a person who has any political awareness or would take notice of current events. (however martin luthor king and malcolm x are spared inclusion.) the frequent use of familiar pop music from the period is another cheap trick to engage the emotions of the audience without doing the work. much of the music has little or no connection to the story and even less to the character of forrest, who has no interest, understanding, or emotional connection with the pop culture of the day. forrest is strangely detached from the world around him, and probably that's the intention? but in that case what relevance or insight can his character have to the events through which he wanders? i'm sure this story is intended to be very deep and meaningful, but really, forrest gump could as easily have been set in the 1920s, 30s or 40s for all the relevance or insight he brings to 50s, 60s, 70s culture. the part of the movie where forrest runs across country invites comparison to peter sellars character in ""being there"", a holy fool, but fg lacks the depth of that movie, and in any case only has five minutes to spare on this topic before moving on again. there is some tenuous and weak humour involving ""sh*t happens"" and smiley face tee shirts, but no actual words of ambiguous wisdom that might account for his following. the film continues to throw issues and situations at us, like so many custard pies, hoping some will stick, but most end up being only half baked. (how do you like them mixed metaphors!) the apple shares bit is pure product placement, forrest was already as rich as they want to make him via the shrimp company. and why would anyone offer the multimillion dollar owner of a shrimp company a job mowing lawns? then we get not one, but two, tragic deaths by disease to weep about, first mom from the big ""c"" and then ""me own me sporting jenny"" from a cause never made clear. jenny only brings forrest back into her life because she is dying, not because she loves him enough to want to share her life and their child with him. how is that inspirational? good things come to those who wait? the meek shall inherit the earth? the secret to true happiness is low expectations? life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what your gonna get (chocolate maybe?) chocolate happens.";22 January 2018;4;['unsophisticated', 'juvenile', 'physical', 'uncomfortable', 'broad', 'fine', 'pure', 'such', 'serious', 'necessary', 'wonderful', 'cartoonish', 'credible', 'able', 'forr', 'limited', 'comfortable', 'many', 'shallow', 'easy', 'unpleasant', 'little', 'young', 'crippled', 'american', 'gold', 'handicapped', 'wrong', 'good', 'allegorical', 'profound', 'many', 'traumatic', 'historical', 'kennedys', 'forr', 'present', 'political', 'current', 'frequent', 'familiar', 'cheap', 'much', 'little', 'forr', 'emotional', 'forr', 'sure', 'deep', 'meaningful', 'forr', 'forr', 'holy', 'tenuous', 'weak', 'smiley', 'actual', 'ambiguous', 'many', 'most', 'baked', 'mixed', 'pure', 'forr', 'rich', 'tragic', 'big', 'clear', 'forr', 'inspirational', 'good', 'true', 'low'];0.1232609710550887

375;nelliebell-1;forrest gump is not a very easy film to look at without really needing to move into depth and vision.the film seems not to allow for a capsule summary and personally it doesn't want to be characterized.the truth is like that in many ways because it stands for something that stands the test of time and perhaps thats what makes some of this going not particularly simple.its difficult not to like this film and more so how we are looked at perhaps as a remnant of time.the early going for the parent was not so easy to understand because there was a lack of humility exhibited by gumps mother but gump was not brought up a certain way that would allow for a typical response and so we have an unusual storyline.doctors can have that kind of sobering effect on developing youngsters,no one reading this can say otherwise because we all grew up.the bullying and clever positioning of scenes is not always enjoyable but it is a way that we are being poked fun at or begged to have a sense of humor.there would of long been a number of fights had that occurred when i was in those grades and indeed i think that here the picture starts to tell us something about bravery,honor,ingenuity,and good fortune. forrest gump can run like the wind.clever,witty and it certainly does keep your interest.however its got to stop this is absolutely ridiculous and that when the story begins to go backward.i thought the anti-war protest scene was a great pitch for an everlasting value,it was unfortunate that the female had no more sense than most of those deals back then because what was represented in the heart of this very decent man was true love.perhaps,perhaps,perhaps it is terribly moving his involvement with jinny.it would of hurt to have gotten all those letters back and so much so that in reality this relationship would not of matured.this is a complicated area because it is suggested that she was the victim of child abuse perhaps though not stated even maybe more so than just abuse.it is further suggested that that was the cause of jinnys proclivities as she wondered about the country side.it is even more involved than that and that she had no home life and only one parent and then not even that.we certainly have the idea here of two youngsters jinny and gump both of which do not share or know what it would be like to have both parents present in there upbringing.the girl is something of a wreck from the start as her idea of stardom in that bar scene was ridiculous. i personally don't have the time nor the room to really look at what it was that this movie attempted to say.why would you have a naked broad on stage with a guitar singing how many roads does a man have to walk down before you call him a man,?if all roads don't lead to rhome i wouldn't know ?this perhaps was a good way to showcase gump more so than other aspect of this film because the broad was in a dump and doing what so many of them do and what is that?i really don't know because it would not of occurred to me nor did it occur to gump that she was his one and only.the tragic idea here has to do with two essential aspects of love,importance and pleasure.the young girl continues to move away from a central point and away from true love.this is the nature of the rebellion in her and eventually she will discover that she has lost something very dear,even very close to her heart.it maybe her love of her parent or maybe her love for forrest gump,however that lost idea is going to fool her into beleiving in something that is not important nor is the pleasure that it provides of a lasting value.i cant provide all that is condoned with its place but it isn't friendly and that is where forrest gump shows the audience what is more important and that is a love of abiding faith so deep as to be though over history.the placement of this picture suggests that there is no place like home,that being greenbaugh,alabama and quite frankly i agree.the suggestion is very appropriate and perhaps well placed.i think forrest gump was a bit over simplified as no one could be that stupid or could he.i think the scenes in college are about as enjoyable as college gets and his military service exemplary.he was trained very well and did this nation a service by representing the usa as one of its ping pong ambassadors to china.there is so much that iam not going to go much father due in principal that unless you cant see it gump is the right man.he has a gift and it is about to pay off.this really doesn't answer what everyone else is doing or what else may in fact be going on but the unbelievable happens apple computer.i think thats a smile and so was his road running.the feather theme by alan silvestri is worth mentioning as a beautiful piece of music.like i said this is not a simple film nor is it exactly what it appears either.;5 November 2004;10;['forr', 'easy', 'capsule', 'many', 'difficult', 'early', 'easy', 'certain',

379;KillerLord;forrest gump is one of those few movies that are so realistic and yet one cannot help but watch with a sense of wonder and amazement each time one sees it. it is the most heart touching movie i have ever seen that has so much to teach you and so much inspiration locked within it. each time i see this movie, i slip into a different mood and the movie never fails to move me. the movie is about a boy with an average iq who is taught by his mother only thing - to never let anyone tell him that he is different and cannot do anything in life. and off he goes pursuing his dreams with only a clean and pure heart and immense sincere dedication as his tools. tom hanks is such a wonderful and a versatile actor. he has played so many diversified roles and each of these roles, he has played with so much finesse. it is hard to imagine what the movie could have been if somebody else stepped in tom hanks' shoes and tried to play the role of forrest gump. my suspicion is that the movie would have been a tragedy had it not been for the beautiful portrayal of forrest gump that tom hanks has done. the oscar he won for the movie is well deserved. forrest gump starts off wonderfully and moves at its own pace. we are gradually exposed to the simplicity and purity of its central character. he demonstrates how the qualities of the strength of heart and soul can win the game anytime over terrific brains. the movie has a lesson to teach that all it takes is focus, determination and a clean mind in order to conquer the world. and what is beautiful about the movie is that it does not show something drastic and unbelievable. it can very well be a tale that is happening right now in our own world. the movie is not all serious. it has a wonderfully portrayed and rightly timed humor content. and no matter how many times you have seen the movie, the dialogs still have their effect on you. each time one sees the movie he or she will smile when the movie wants you to smile and will make you cry when it wants to make you cry. the most touching aspect of the movie is the very character of forrest gump. he is dedicated, sincere and very simple. he has no cynicism in him, no jealousy and not a single trace of any negative emotion. the movie is about his world, a world without jealousy, greed and full of purity. the music score is wonderful, so is the direction, so is the acting and so is the photography. it is indeed hard for one to find anything wrong with this movie at all. it is simply too neatly done and too beautifully handled. i cannot think of one thing in this movie that could have been done in a better way. it is a beautiful movie and deserves all the praise it has been getting. it is destined to stay in the list of best movies ever made perhaps forever. it is one of those movies that one must watch before their time.;9 October 2008;10;['forr', 'few', 'realistic', 'most', 'much', 'much', 'different', 'average', 'different', 'clean', 'pure', 'immense', 'sincere', 'wonderful', 'versatile', 'many', 'diversified', 'much', 'hard', 'forr', 'beautiful', 'forr', 'deserved', 'forr', 'own', 'central', 'terrific', 'focus', 'clean', 'beautiful', 'drastic', 'unbelievable', 'own', 'serious', 'many', 'touching', 'very', 'forr', 'sincere', 'simple', 'single', 'negative', 'full', 'wonderful', 'hard', 'wrong', 'well', 'beautiful', 'good'];0.2493197278911564

385;MadReviewer;"i have a difficult time watching (and reviewing) 'forrest gump'. despite the brilliance of its actors, of director robert zemeckis, and of certain powerful scenes, i find that the overall film itself is a cynical lie. on the surface, 'gump' is a cheerful film about the perseverance of its genuinely sweet title character. under that sweetness, though is a disturbing, uncomfortable message that says daring to dream is a bad idea. for the seven people who haven't seen 'forrest gump', the film deals with the travels and troubles of one forrest gump (tom hanks), an affable man with an iq of 75 who manages to bounce around key historical events from 1950 onward in 'zelig'-like fashion. forrest inadvertently teaches elvis to swivel his hips. forest accidentally becomes a football star. forest accidentally becomes a vietnam war hero, then accidentally becomes a successful businessman. (see a pattern?) throughout all his travels and misadventures, forrest is forced to deal with adversity and hardship and he can never seem to fully capture the love of his childhood sweetheart jenny (robin wright-penn) but through sheer niceness and through blind faith in the goodness of others, forrest invariably manages to push on through his difficulties and to triumph in life. again, on the surface, a sweet, glowing, feel-good film. despite my own misgivings about the film, there's no doubt that tom hanks is simply awesome as gump he clearly deserved the oscar he won for the role. he gives forrest gump a childlike innocence, but there's more to it that that; there's a certain confidence that he exudes at all the right times, as well as insecurities at his low moments. forrest gump is certainly far more complex than the simple figure he appears to be at first glance, and i can't think of any actor who could've played it better than hanks. robin wright-penn is perfect as jenny, who makes an astonishing journey through the years between wide-eyed to hardened cynicism to the acceptance and understanding of experience. i'm surprised she wasn't nominated for an oscar as well. gary sinise makes a perfect counterpoint to gump in the vietnam era as lieutenant dan, another person who can't seem to travel through life quite as smoothly as forrest does. combine this with a superbly paced film, with moments both funny and sorrowful (often at the same time), as well as some of the best, subtle uses of cgi effects ever put to celluloid, and 'forrest gump' should be one of the best films of all time. right? in my opinion, no. 'gump' is a bitter, bitter movie. look at jenny's dreams and aspirations, how hard she works to attain them, and how little she actually accomplishes. ditto the dreams of lieutenant dan, or gump's friend bubba (mykelti williamson). for them, their hopes never ultimately amount to anything, not without the 'accidental' help of forrest gump, anyway. forrest, who has no ambitions, and never shows any true interest in doing anything, becomes wildly successful by doing nothing. in essence, those who dare to dream in 'forrest gump' are punished for their ambition, while those who do nothing are handsomely rewarded. considering that some of jenny's dreams (and lieutenant dan's) are particularly selfish in fact, a few are downright noble i found this little understated message to be incredibly disturbing. it bothered me enough to make me not like this film at all, despite all the wonderful moments it does contain. 'forrest gump' gets an overall grade of a c+ -- it starts out as an 'a', but its dark underlying cynicism drags it back down to that level. but hey, i could be wrong. it's simply the mad reviewer's opinion. good or bad, there's some great performances, and it's also thought-provoking. watch it for yourself, and let me know what you think.";8 May 2001;6;['difficult', 'forr', 'certain', 'powerful', 'overall', 'cynical', 'cheerful', 'sweet', 'disturbing', 'uncomfortable', 'bad', 'forr', 'forr', 'affable', 'key', 'historical', 'forr', 'successful', 'forr', 'childhood', 'sheer', 'blind', 'forr', 'sweet', 'glowing', 'good', 'own', 'awesome', 'forr', 'childlike', 'more', 'certain', 'right', 'low', 'forr', 'complex', 'simple', 'first', 'perfect', 'astonishing', 'eyed', 'surprised', 'perfect', 'forr', 'funny', 'sorrowful', 'same', 'good', 'subtle', 'forr', 'good', 'right', 'bitter', 'bitter', 'little', 'accidental', 'forr', 'forr', 'true', 'successful', 'forr', 'selfish', 'few', 'noble', 'little', 'understated', 'disturbing', 'enough', 'wonderful', 'forr', 'overall', 'dark', 'underlying', 'wrong', 'mad', 'good', 'bad', 'great'];0.1386904761904762
386;kira02bit;conventional wisdom back in 1994 stated that one must either be a huge fan of oscar nominee pulp fiction (which purportedly signified the new cinema) or of its polar opposite, oscar winner forrest gump (which signified old school film). truthfully, i am a fan of neither film and of the best picture nominees for that year, i would most assuredly have picked the shawshank redemption over both without hesitation. forrest gump is a simple story about a simple man - expanded over an arrogant nearly 3 hour running time. a southern man of low i.q., whose good intentions and well-meaning heart allow him to triumph over the obstacles and adversities life throws his way. the film opens with forrest sitting on a park bench regaling others with his exploits, such as his outrunning bullies and becoming a football hero, his tour in vietnam which led to a successful shrimping business and his enduring love for his childhood friend, jenny. director robert zemeckis can be a great director and the first hour of forrest gump is very good. it establishes a tone of bemused whimsy that the material requires. unfortunately, bemused whimsy is a hard tone to maintain, especially when your film has such a slight plot, a running time that would be a strain with the best material, and a central character that is, let's face it, not particularly fascinating. by the midway section, the film starts to stumble and then completely implodes right around the time that forrest starts running back and forth from coast to coast for no apparent reason. for comedic measure and a degree of relevance, the story tries to shoehorn forrest in with historic figures, fads and events, some of which work well and some not at all. the tie-in with watergate and forrest showing his wound to nixon are amusing, but his scene on the national mall at an anti-war protest where the microphone cuts out so the crowd can remain clueless that he is an imbecile is ridiculously coy. and the sequence with john lennon, where it is obvious the words do not match the lip movements is downright embarrassing. the oscar for special effects here is a real stretch. tom hanks can be a great everyman actor (like james stewart). he can also be overrated and it is to his misfortune that the two films for which he won back to back oscars are two of his most overrated efforts. one can see politically in oscar circles why he would win for philadelphia, but the win for forrest gump the next year is most puzzling. forrest has very little range emotionally or intellectually, and he largely reacts to everything the same way. sally field seems oddly miscast as forrest's mother, who apparently gifted her son with his low-rent fortune cookie advice. gary sinise provides the film's only really great performance as forrest's vietnam superior and later friend - providing some of the grit and emotion that the remainder of the film lacks. in the pivotal role of jenny - the girl who forrest has loved since childhood - robin wright is a complete wash-out. the film keeps returning to her character, who has become an embittered drug addict and it founders every time it does. jenny may have her reasons for her addictions, but she is often played as a shrewish selfish person, who takes forrest's help when convenient, and shuns him when she is finished with him. hanks and wright have no chemistry together and because of her shoddy treatment of forrest, i cannot imagine anyone rooting for them as a couple. a foolishly lengthy mid-film sequence with jenny on a ledge contemplating suicide actually had one witty film-goer in my audience begging her to jump - i concur. her final moments in the film are especially absurd - as she once again shows up to prey on forrest's good will - this time announcing that she is dying from some mystery illness which seems to be aids although the filmmakers refuse to say and she wants forrest to care for her son, which she assures him is his (although we as an audience are not really sure given the characters chronic dishonesty). this strange disease seems to have been borrowed from love story, as wright's only major symptom seems to be that she gets more luminous and has better lighting the closer to death she gets. the final hour of the film is near unendurable. the whimsy has been lost and the events surrounding forrest just seem to get sillier and more pointless. as a character on which to hang a film, forrest is largely a slow-witted blank. he ends the film almost exactly as he starts it. he has had no great epiphanies or insights or much in way of growth - he has been largely a passive passenger riding the wave of life. the film's meme that good-hearted people will always get what's coming to them is beyond naive and a tad insulting - as there are many good-hearted people who have the opposite happen. ironically, we never get to see the expressions or reactions of the people forrest victimizes with his tales, which may be intentional since they may have run screaming from the park bench or just passed out in bored apathy.;27 December 2014;4;['conventional', 'huge', 'new', 'polar', 'opposite', 'oscar', 'forr', 'old', 'good', 'forr', 'simple', 'simple', 'arrogant', 'southern', 'low', 'good', 'forr', 'such', 'successful', 'great', 'first', 'forr', 'good', 'bemused', 'hard', 'slight', 'running', 'good', 'central', 'fascinating', 'forr', 'apparent', 'comedic', 'forr', 'historic', 'forr', 'amusing', 'national', 'anti', 'war', 'clueless', 'coy', 'obvious', 'embarrassing', 'special', 'real', 'great', 'back', 'overrated', 'forr', 'next', 'puzzling', 'forr', 'little', 'same', 'miscast', 'forr', 'low', 'great', 'forr', 'superior', 'pivotal', 'forr', 'complete', 'embittered', 'shrewish', 'selfish', 'forr', 'convenient', 'shoddy', 'forr', 'lengthy', 'mid', 'witty', 'final', 'absurd', 'forr', 'good', 'forr', 'sure', 'chronic', 'strange', 'only', 'major', 'luminous', 'final', 'unendurable', 'forr', 'pointless', 'forr', 'great', 'much', 'passive', 'hearted', 'naive', 'many', 'good', 'hearted', 'opposite', 'forr', 'intentional', 'bored', 'apathy'];0.1883154856839066
387;ToldYaSo;"""forrest gump"" is exactly the kind of film that has suffered from too much praise. as someone who genuinely loves this film, i am dumbfounded by those who hate it. but time after time, when a film receives high praise from a great number of people, it leaves high expectations for those who haven't seen it. the result is often disappointment. some people object to its unrealistic approach. suggesting that the involvement of forrest in some of america's pivotal moments in history is not only ridiculous but misleading. another argument i've heard is the fact that a mentally handicapped individual could never attain the levels of success that forrest does. they've missed out on a truly charming, endearing fairy tale that can help you look at life from a different approach, a simple one at that. and the dialogue is so inherently quotable, as the message behind it is so straightforward. ""stupid is as stupid does"". forrest is a purely innocent, well-meaning individual, and there can be no fault found in him. it's the rest of the world that is realistic, impure, and flawed. and so, when forrest hurts, we can't help but hurt for him, when he is successful, we can't help but be happy for him and when his heart breaks, ours breaks also. i can't tell if it's the music, the cinematography or the acting, but the scene where young forrest breaks free of his leg braces to escape the bullies on bicycles, gets me every time. every single time. i've watched this film more times than i care to count, as i feel as though i should be watching something i've never seen before. but this film just makes me feel good, and i'll no doubt watch it again. now you see, i can't help but praise this film, and in a way i'm probably ruining it for someone else. my sister blames me for ruining it for her. it's not easy to forget what everyone's said, and the awards it has won. but if you haven't seen it already, just try and see it with fresh eyes, and open your mind to a very charming film.";3 June 1999;9;['forr', 'much', 'high', 'great', 'high', 'disappointment', 'unrealistic', 'forr', 'pivotal', 'ridiculous', 'misleading', 'handicapped', 'forr', 'charming', 'endearing', 'different', 'simple', 'quotable', 'straightforward', 'stupid', 'stupid', 'forr', 'innocent', 'realistic', 'forr', 'successful', 'happy', 'young', 'forr', 'free', 'single', 'more', 'good', 'easy', 'fresh', 'charming'];0.2092399267399267

390;Tobeshadow;"revisionist reviews love to get salty about how this film champions conservatism; how jenny joins the counterculture and is destroyed by it while forrest does what he is told, follows the conservative lifestyle, and gets rich and happy. frankly, this is complete and utter nonsense and a demonstration that such reviewers have completely lost touch with what cinema is. not all films have to preach a message or follow a political stance. some films don't have to be deconstructed to such a degree that their elegant simplicity is lost and mired by hollow trash-bin arguments written by freshman students out to prove their worldview at any cost. this is forrest's story, and sure, he doesn't understand the things happening around him, be that politics, war or social injustice, but nor does he have to. that doesn't mean we can't read between the lines and realise that these incredibly important moments in us history are still there and happening around him. we can still research and learn more about them. it isn't the responsibility of the film to do this for us, it's up to the viewer to understand the landscape in which the character is placed and to educate themselves if they so desire. or not. there is absolutely nothing wrong with just enjoying this film as a story about a compelling character; a fairy-tale so full of obviously fantastical elements that it could never possibly be true but can none the less be thoroughly enjoyed. forrest's childlike innocence throughout the film in fact allows us to hold a mirror to our own experiences, good and bad, and we grow with him as a character. there's a reason this film is still quoted almost 30 years after its release. the way it effortlessly blends humour and tragedy, how it presents a character who ultimately shows all those around him a way to live, despite supposedly being somehow less than them. people who get annoyed at the film for various reasons miss this message and are are no different than lt. dan howling at the wind. sometimes we should just enjoy a movie because it is just that, a movie.";14 January 2022;9;['salty', 'forr', 'conservative', 'rich', 'happy', 'complete', 'utter', 'such', 'political', 'elegant', 'hollow', 'forr', 'social', 'important', 'more', 'wrong', 'compelling', 'full', 'fantastical', 'true', 'forr', 'childlike', 'own', 'good', 'bad', 'less', 'various', 'different'];0.1686507936507936
391;cartesianthought;it's an anthem to the american dream and hymn the country's history in the mid to late 1900's. but it's also an ambitious movie with lots of iconic and funny moments. the main character is the simple ordinary forrest who finds success in everything just by doing what he's told and following societal conventions without questioning them. of course, it takes a heaping amount of luck to make it happen but it is satisfying to see the good guy win. the antagonist, of course, is jenny, who does happen to question society, becomes a counterculture protester, and she ends up dying from aids. there's pretty binary system of morality at work in the film and a dearth of actually complex or interesting characters, but whatever it's a movie full of quotable dialogue. definitely overrated, but good.;24 December 2015;7;['american', 'late', 'ambitious', 'iconic', 'funny', 'main', 'simple', 'ordinary', 'forr', 'societal', 'good', 'counterculture', 'binary', 'complex', 'interesting', 'full', 'quotable', 'overrated', 'good'];0.1974358974358974

411;critic-22;some users view this movie as inferior to the shawshank redemption (tsr) which was released the same year. personally, i see that both forrest gump (fg) and tsr as the same standard of excellence. both movies shows contrasting aspects of hope and how to adjust to injustices in the outside world. what made fg a classic and probably gave it the best picture oscar was not only the special effects throughout the movie, or the brilliant appropriate use of music fitting the era, but the incredible acting and plot device. when i first saw fg i thought it was a good family comedy with immense amounts of surrealism. however after repeat viewing i realised that fg had one of the most thought provoking scripts ever committed to film. there are so many aspects of the storyline that has never left me ever since i saw the movie almost five years ago. just like life is beautiful there is the external and internal images and story in this picture. the external is a family comedy that will make you laugh as many things seem so outrageous. however internally, fg is a movie about drug addiction, child sexual abuse, a true sacrificial love story with one way traffic, how a person can cope with disability without committing suicide, the nature of god when something terrible happens to you, prostitution and so much more besides. tell me one other movie that can handle these subjects and still make you laugh throughout while telling you important moral lessons? unlike other so called romance movies like titanic, fg was not based on lust rather an understanding and fidelity of other persons' characters. if forrest gump is a bit dumb he makes up for it with his saint like character. what made this movie tragic is the long time span in which forrest is in love with his girl and would do almost anything for her and yet she disrespects him because he is mentally disabled, he is not 'normal'. yet the people jenny hangs around with are spiritually and morally 'abnormal'. if people can't relate to this maybe it is beyond their understanding and comprehension as they have never been in that position. forrest may not be able to verbalise the meaning of love, but his actions put 'normal' people to shame and some. where else in a modern film do you see the hero being rejected by a gril or even genuinely wanting to get married, only in the old classics i suppose!! forrest always has the hope of a better future, he teaches the audience that you should always have an aim to look forward to and that will help to keep you sane under misfortune, even if it's simply running down the road to owning a business. in addition, the movie shows that no matter what your disability you can still make a contribution to society and other people's lives. if this is not a powerful message i have never seen or heard one. forrest knows that jenny is the only girl he has got a chance with to be his wife, which makes the story even sadder as we see jenny living a life on the edge. even at the ending we are unsure whether forrest is really looking after his son, but as long it is jenny's and she is his, he does not mind. maybe this is a blind type of love, but he also loves jenny like a biblical prodigal sister and he does not realise that he may have aids too. however fg gives hope to many millions of people around the world who are disabled and feel socially excluded in society. as the years roll by i still think about this movie which shows aspects of life which are heart wretchingly profound if you look beyond the external window. if this isn't a 10/10 movie i have not seen one.;8 March 1999;10;['inferior', 'same', 'forr', 'same', 'outside', 'good', 'special', 'brilliant', 'appropriate', 'incredible', 'good', 'immense', 'many', 'beautiful', 'external', 'internal', 'many', 'outrageous', 'sexual', 'true', 'sacrificial', 'terrible', 'more', 'other', 'important', 'moral', 'other', 'other', 'forr', 'dumb', 'tragic', 'long', 'forr', 'disabled', 'normal', 'abnormal', 'forr', 'able', 'normal', 'modern', 'old', 'forr', 'well', 'sane', 'other', 'powerful', 'forr', 'only', 'sad', 'unsure', 'forr', 'blind', 'biblical', 'prodigal', 'many', 'disabled', 'profound', 'external'];0.1061738648947951

424;longcooljolie;"in terms of pure cinematic enjoyment, this movie was definitely one of the best of the 1990s and it probably shows up on many ""100 movies to see before you die"" lists. people who saw it as children or young adults when it first hit theaters in 1994 are now probably showing it to their kids, so it's definitely a movie that appeals across generations. since 99% of people frequenting imdb must have seen the movie and there are already close to 3,000 reviews of it as of today, this review will try to discuss some less-talked-about details about the story, the production, the music, the characters, and some other aspects of what make ""forrest gump"" so appealing. first, there's the makeup. tom hanks was about 37 while the movie was being filmed, but through a combination of makeup and possible hairline-lowering, along with his incredible acting ability, he really seemed 17 or 18 during the high school scenes. robin wright's makeup as jenny evolves with both the trials and tribulations of her character and the prevailing styles during all the time periods. she is shown first in early 60s dewy innocence and then doe-eyed and in heavy mascara in some of the later 60s and 70s scenes but also has a ""hippie chick"" aura around the time when jenny and forrest meet in washington. gary sinise as lieutenant dan taylor goes through the most drastic transformations of any character, going from conservative military to full-on hippie and then back again to conservative at the very end. as a result of the character and his work in the movie, gary sinise became an outspoken veteran's advocate through his ""lieutenant dan"" persona. for bubba, the mykelti williams character, his defining facial characteristic was so convincing that producers were shocked to learn it was not real when they wanted him to portray ""bubba-like"" characters in other comedies. so, did the movie win the award for best makeup? no, that honor went to ""ed wood,"" which oddly was a black-and-white film. two themes for which the story and movie get criticized are that the message is that if you obey orders you will succeed in life, but this aspect reflects the earnest innocence of the forrest gump character. it just wouldn't occur to him to do otherwise, the same as when the reporters met him at the mississippi river bridge to ask him why he kept running across the country (was it for the homeless? women's rights""). he said, ""i just felt like running."" the other criticism is that jenny takes advantage of forrest and only defaults to him when she has exhausted all her other options and is literally dying. yet, jenny's character was abused. the narratives make this very, very clear (""dear god, make me a bird so i can fly far, far away from here.""). abused people, and especially abused women have lots of difficulty finding themselves, which is so deftly shown in the movie by her vagabond adventures in the hippie counterculture and then the cocaine-fueled disco era, so her approach/avoidance antics with forrest make way more sense when looked at in that light. jenny's showing up at the end, to me and a few other reviewers, parallels a famous voltaire classic, ""candide."" yes, she comes home to him at the end, but he loved her all along. one of the movie's truly beautiful moments happens right after forrest describes what he'd seen on his cross-country runs and some of the unexpected beauty in vietnam and she says, ""i wish i could have been there with you."" forrest just says, you were. forrest gump is and was an experience movie, the kind you can't watch just once. finally, the musical score by alan silvestri really added to it, especially in the beginning credits, which i won't describe here in order not to ruin it for the one percent who have yet to see it. what the hell are you waiting for?";2 February 2022;9;['pure', 'cinematic', 'good', 'many', 'young', 'close', 'other', 'forr', 'appealing', 'possible', 'incredible', 'high', 'early', 'eyed', 'heavy', 'later', 'forr', 'drastic', 'conservative', 'full', 'conservative', 'very', 'outspoken', 'facial', 'convincing', 'real', 'like', 'other', 'good', 'black', 'white', 'earnest', 'forr', 'same', 'homeless', 'other', 'forr', 'only', 'other', 'clear', 'dear', 'hippie', 'forr', 'more', 'few', 'other', 'famous', 'beautiful', 'forr', 'cross', 'country', 'unexpected', 'forr', 'forr', 'musical'];0.1709319727891156

438;DaRick89;"(original comment september 2005) i saw the critically-acclaimed 'classic' forrest gump just the other night. the story revolves around a slow-witted, unintelligent man by the name of forrest gump. as gump waits at a bus stop, he decides to tell those sitting next to him his life story. as it turns out, gump has been present at many historic events; the problem is, he's too stupid to realise their significance. he also tells of his one true love, jenny, who was the only person in his life to accept him for who he was. however, from adulthood onward, she often eluded him, instead preferring to live a life involving sex and drugs. anyway, enough about the plot. judging by what i saw the other night, forrest gump definitely deserves it's status as a 'classic' movie. first off, it is original to an extent, as it focuses on deconstructing a low-intelligence person, rather than putting one in just for cheap laughs (as in there's something about mary). another interesting aspect of the movie is that there is no real villain who is constantly at odds with gump, as there are in other movies. it also takes on so many moods successfully. most movies choose one mood and stick with it (comedy, romance, etc.), whereas forrest gump provided me with laughs (like when, in a football game, the crowd flashes 'go forrest' and then 'stop forrest' when he reaches the try line) and romance (gump and jenny). second off, some of the acting here is great. tom hanks really does deliver as forrest gump. his accent never wavers and he portrays his low-intelligence character in a touching yet funny way (two signifiers which are pretty much opposites in today's movies). his facial expressions are also quite realistic (see his look when he discovers that he has a son). gary sinise (or as i called him, steve waugh) puts in a pretty good performance as the embittered lieutenant who believes that his destiny was to die in vietnam and is 'pissed off' at gump for robbing him of it. mylketi willamson (i think that's his name), also gives a decent turn as gump's black buddy. thirdly, as aforementioned above, this is like a documentary on american culture in the 50's, 60's, 70's and even 80's, as seen through the eyes of forrest gump. during the movie, forrest meets jfk, lyndon johnson, richard nixon, begins the watergate scandal, serves in vietnam and makes national tv, to name a few. this part of the movie, i believe, is presented in an interesting manner. i find it hard to criticise a movie like 'forrest gump', however, i do have one issue with it. it is a little too righteous. gump has no personality flaws other than being a man of low intelligence. jenny, on the other hand, is constructed as a woman with many flaws and pays the ultimate price as a result. this is a touch unrealistic. however, this is a minor issue which most people won't even see. other than that, it is perfect. i've spoiled enough of the movie for you, so i leave you with this parting advice: see this movie as soon as possible. i saw forrest gump, hoping that it'd be good and i wasn't disappointed, but bear in mind that good is an understatement when referring to this movie. this is probably the best movie i've seen this year (over memento and the dirty dozen). 5/5 stars";10 January 2006;10;['original', 'forr', 'other', 'unintelligent', 'forr', 'present', 'many', 'historic', 'stupid', 'true', 'only', 'enough', 'other', 'forr', 'classic', 'original', 'low', 'cheap', 'interesting', 'real', 'other', 'many', 'most', 'forr', 'forr', 'forr', 'great', 'forr', 'accent', 'low', 'touching', 'funny', 'facial', 'realistic', 'good', 'embittered', 'decent', 'black', 'american', 'forr', 'forr', 'national', 'few', 'interesting', 'hard', 'forr', 'little', 'righteous', 'other', 'low', 'other', 'many', 'ultimate', 'unrealistic', 'minor', 'most', 'other', 'perfect', 'possible', 'forr', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'dirty'];0.1373263888888889

440;Netscape_Navigator;give me a break, this is nothing special. the only reason this movie has the kind of reputation is does is because of the proved fact that it is impossible for someone to play a leading role in which a character is mentally handicapped and *not get a nomination, let alone have the movie received well. think about that for a second and you'll see that's true. there are no movies that weren't received well where an actor played a *main character with a *mental handicap. (keep in mind the asterisked words, that's what qualifies my statement) there are movies like this i do like, this is simply not one of them. this was boring because the film had no direction, it simply feels like you're watching the biography of a person from some historical text played out on the big screen. it's just one episode after the next depicting the heroic acts of forrest and showing the relationships between him and the people he meets, but all these events don't build into any storyline you can care about. each individual episode presents its own challenges to forrest, but these feel isolated and doesn't build to any kind of payoff. if you like stories like this, go watch sling blade, it's a much better movie that doesn't put on a facade of being some grand spectacle of our time.;12 July 2005;4;['special', 'only', 'proved', 'impossible', 'handicapped', 'true', 'main', 'mental', 'boring', 'historical', 'big', 'next', 'heroic', 'forr', 'individual', 'own', 'isolated', 'well', 'grand'];0.0647959183673469

468;paul_mampilly;"1994 was the year where being dumb ruled in the cinemas. two out of ten top grossing movies of this year was about really idiotic or simple-minded people. the first one being the jim carrey vehicle ""dumb and dumber"" and the other one being ""forrest gump"" though the first movie just made the viewers laugh with puerile humour, the latter movie provides a nostalgic travel through important events through history. it is the second movie that i am going to talk about in this review. spoiler plots dead ahead!!! the movie's story is really ""simple"" to pardon the pun. it is about this character that has a very low i.q., who while waiting for a bus, seems to tell his life experiences to folk next to him. it can be considered that this plot seems to be really going nowhere, however forrest life is pretty unique. he seems to bumble into very important historical events in america's history without ever realising. these events last from the 1960's to the 1990's. he got to meet very famous people like j.f.k., lyndon johnson, elvis, and john lennon during his life. he fought in the vietnam war, and made a million in the shrimp business and investing in some kind of fruit computer company. even though he has experienced all these amazing events and people, the only thing that makes him going is his relentless love for jenny, who is a childhood sweetheart who seems to push him away. tom hanks acting is absolutely amazing in this movie, and probably did his best role as the slow-witted forrest gump. he seems to play the everyday man who seems to be in extraordinary events in most of his movies, so therefore he is ideal in this movie. sally field plays one of the most understandable and lovable mothers who do not seem to be so saccharine sweet. gary sinse seems to play a really good role of lt dan taylor, and i thought that robin wright penn was pretty good as jenny. the soundtrack was essential to this movie, since it seems to accentuate each scene with great poignancy. also the music in this movie got me at least singing to it, though i was not even born in half the decades that the soundtrack had in it. it would have to be said that i actually liked this movie. i am not a big fan of nostalgic movies, since i don't usually seem to connect to such films like that. also i am a bit of a cynic when it comes to such films like these. yet this movie seems to hit a a nerve with me and i really enjoyed it and makes me escape to such a fantasy life like forrest gump. also this movie seem to show some social undertones, such as the constant aftermath of vietnam, (nowadays this would be gulf war ii), the fighting against racism, (befriending bubba during such racial tensions), and sexual and physical mistreatments of women (shown many times with jenny). a final point to say is that in this movie, the portrayal is that mr gump is seen as a stupid person. however, it is the line which portrays the irony in this movie, ""stupid is as stupid does"". it shows the rest of the people in this movie who seems to act out this line, such as jenny who seems to be in a constant spiral downwards into hedonism and drugs, and lt. dan who seems to have gone mad when he lost his legs. the movie shows that gump only views the world in simple terms and his morals are never waivered when everyone else's are flipping back and forth over the blurry line of right and wrong. in conclusion, i think this is one of the most heart warming movies i have ever seen and it is up there with ""it's a wonderful life"" sentimentality with dark overtones. however i am still a cynic when it comes to movies.";31 January 2005;8;['dumb', 'top', 'idiotic', 'simple', 'minded', 'first', 'dumb', 'dumb', 'other', 'forr', 'first', 'latter', 'nostalgic', 'important', 'second', 'simple', 'low', 'forr', 'unique', 'important', 'historical', 'last', 'famous', 'amazing', 'only', 'relentless', 'childhood', 'amazing', 'good', 'forr', 'everyday', 'extraordinary', 'most', 'ideal', 'sally', 'understandable', 'lovable', 'sweet', 'good', 'good', 'essential', 'great', 'least', 'big', 'nostalgic', 'such', 'cynic', 'such', 'forr', 'social', 'such', 'constant', 'such', 'racial', 'sexual', 'physical', 'many', 'final', 'stupid', 'stupid', 'stupid', 'such', 'constant', 'spiral', 'mad', 'simple', 'blurry', 'wrong', 'most', 'wonderful', 'dark', 'cynic'];0.0827586206896551

480;schmimic;"starring: tom hanks, robin wright, gary sinise, sally field this was flat out one of the best movies of 1994. it won best picture for a reason, along with a few other academy awards. i think one of the tag lines for the movie was, ""the world will never be the same once you've seen it through the eyes of forrest gump."" how true. the movie is basically one simple man's journey through life. and what a journey. the movie opens with forrest (hanks) sitting at a bus stop, waiting to go see jenny (wright) after being apart from her for years. who is jenny, you ask? we'll get to that in a minute. forrest strikes up a conversation or two with the people that come and wait for the bus with him. or, more accurately, he keeps talking regardless of whether anybody is listening or not. the movie plays out as a flashback, with forrest taking us through all the major events of his life and narrating them. the flashback starts when forrest is a little boy, about six years old or so, just at about the age where he should be starting school. we get to take a look at forrest's childhood as he gets leg braces to straighten out his back, as his momma (field) fights (and does a few other things) to get him into public school, and as he meets for the first time the love of his life. jenny. he meets her on the way to school, sitting next to her on the bus, and they strike up a friendship immediately. eventually we progress to the point where forrest and jenny are in high school, and we travel along with forrest as he makes it onto the football team and gets to go to college. forrest and jenny never date, but he's always there to protect her. anytime he thinks she's in trouble, he rushes to the rescue, ready to beat the ever-loving snot out of anyone who even looks at his jenny wrong. i think one of my favorite scenes in the movie is when someone is dumb enough to slap jenny. the film goes slow motion, forrest's eyes go wide, and he starts charging at this guy like a runaway locomotive, and has the striking force of one too. watching him beat the crap out of that guy is hilarious. as forrest grows up and goes through school, college, the army, a vietnam tour, becomes a ping pong celebrity, a shrimp boat captain, and eventually one of the richest men out there, he also gets to take a few stops in history as the filmmaker gives us his own spin of how he thinks history would have happened if forrest gump were there. he gets to meet the president three times, he's the man who exposes the watergate scandal, he's at the school doors when governor george wallace tries to get some negroes into a white school, and so on and so forth. it's really funny the way they manipulate historical footage to insert forrest into the events of the past. this is truly a great movie. you'd be a fool to miss it. bottom line: 4 out of 4 (own this movie)";23 April 2005;10;['sally', 'flat', 'good', 'good', 'few', 'other', 'same', 'forr', 'true', 'simple', 'forr', 'forr', 'forr', 'major', 'forr', 'little', 'old', 'forr', 'few', 'other', 'public', 'first', 'forr', 'high', 'forr', 'forr', 'ready', 'favorite', 'dumb', 'slow', 'forr', 'runaway', 'striking', 'hilarious', 'forr', 'rich', 'few', 'own', 'forr', 'white', 'funny', 'historical', 'forr', 'great', 'bottom', 'own'];0.1636666666666666

503;CinematicGarbage;forrest gump (1994) is one of the greatest oscar winning movies. it won best picture, best vfx, best director (robert zemeckis), best actor (tom hanks) and best film editing. it was one of the best films i have ever seen. forrest gumps casted tom hanks as forrest gump, robin wright as jenny curran, gary sinises as lieutenant dan taylor and more. first of all, the acting was extremely excellent, tom hanks could act like a stupid guy and he actually won an oscar for that. it was really impressive. the story was really good. starting the time when there was president john f. kennedy and there was was in vietnam (my country, it made me so proud of having vietnam in such a good movie). it was an alabama man with an iq of 75. i could imagine that being forrest gump was the greatest thing. bullied, called stupid is fine, many people though it would make you an outcast. this was such a good movie that some day i want to see it again and again and again. the scenes are really unforgettable with humor and tragedy. i laughed and cried (whenn jenny and bubba are dead). it was the most unforgettable movie ever. well, i had nothing left to say. forrest gump is a must-see. a 9.4/10;27 April 2019;7;['forr', 'great', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'forr', 'forr', 'more', 'excellent', 'stupid', 'impressive', 'good', 'proud', 'good', 'forr', 'great', 'stupid', 'fine', 'many', 'good', 'unforgettable', 'dead', 'unforgettable', 'forr'];0.5416666666666667

522;DonutLover;"this has to be one of the most beautiful movies ever made. i remember the first time i saw it, i was in some department store, and i saw a scene playing on the store t.v. it was the scene where forrest is on merv griffin (?) i believe, talking with john lennon, and actually my first impression was that it was forced, and contrived. corny. so, i never really watched the whole film, until a year or two ago. this movie brings so many tears to my eyes, not because of sadness, but because of the simplicity of life, relationships, and different stories. the little feather in the beginning of the film seems to be on a journey visiting different lives, and by the end of the story, when the little feather moves on on it's path, you are so touched and moved by the beautiful story of forrest gump. my favorite character is probably lt. dan. forrest meets lt. dan in vietnam, and when dan loses the bottom half of his legs, he has a ""problem"", putting it lightly, with god, and his destiny. but, through the years, and by knowing forrest, he comes to terms with his situation, and one of my favorite scenes is where dan is swimming in the ocean. it shows how much he can do, as he can swim just fine, and enjoy that wonderful, cool, free experience available to most of us. by the end of the film he has come such a long way; he is happy, engaged to a nice girl, and walking on titanium legs, with the help of a cane. and boy is he easy on the eyes, at that! i liked the character of jenny, but i hated how she kept leaving forrest, and not telling him why. she deserted him quite a bit. yet he could not hold it against her. she was a survivor of child sexual abuse and incest, so that helps to explain her lifelong struggle with depression. in the end, she does give forrest a wonderful gift in the form of his son, little forrest. however, i thought it a little strange how they handled the a.i.d.s. idea. i mean, if she had a.i.d.s., wouldn't they allude to some form of protection, for forrest, after they got married? even though she died in 1982 (according to the headstone)the medical profession did know at that time, that it was a sexually transmitted disease. and, i am assuming that she meant aids, when she said that she had a virus that the docs didn't know what it was, and that there was nothing that they could do about it. i never read the book, so i don't know if it was explained a little more there. one other little question i had was the scene where forrest opens a letter from lt. dan, telling him that he would never need to worry about money ever again, because of their investments in apple. the letter head says 1975. hmmmm. i guess i'll have to do my research and see when apple became a multi-million dollar company, and went public. i know that when i was in high school in 1982, we were still learning pascal, or whatever those old fashioned computer languages were at that point, before user friendly p.c.s hit the market. i didn't know that apple was that big, already. it may prove that i am just ignorant, and can use a lesson in business history. other than that, and the two scenes of john lennon, and president kennedy, which i thought were hokey, the movie was a huge success in my book. it's a truly beautiful film, and i also like the woman at the bus stop who ends up staying, missing her bus on purpose, so that she can listen to gump. she is a neat character, who is moved by his story. if you like beautiful, moving films, see this one.";25 February 2007;10;['beautiful', 'first', 'forr', 'first', 'whole', 'many', 'different', 'little', 'different', 'little', 'beautiful', 'forr', 'favorite', 'forr', 'bottom', 'forr', 'favorite', 'much', 'fine', 'wonderful', 'cool', 'free', 'available', 'most', 'long', 'happy', 'nice', 'easy', 'forr', 'sexual', 'lifelong', 'forr', 'wonderful', 'little', 'forr', 'little', 'strange', 'forr', 'medical', 'little', 'more', 'other', 'little', 'forr', 'multi', 'public', 'high', 'pascal', 'old', 'fashioned', 'friendly', 'big', 'ignorant', 'other', 'hokey', 'huge', 'beautiful', 'neat', 'beautiful'];0.2847619047619047

535;darth_timon;there are few films that possess a truly breathtaking and epic feel to them these days. many try, but don't succeed. forest gump succeeded in feeling epic to me, even though when it boils down to it, the film is about one person. that one person is one of the most remarkable characters ever to grace the screen, a simple man who nevertheless embraces what life brings him and as a result, has some amazing experiences. tom hanks shows how versatile he is, making what must have been a demanding role look effortless and natural. the result is that you really care about what happens to forest, whether he's running, fighting in vietnam, or seeking to prove to jenny how he feels. gary sinese is also great in this film- his was a truly challenging role- he played a soldier who ends up losing his legs, and feels that forest cheated him out of his destiny of dying in battle. to simulate having no legs is a true challenge, but he does it, and it's believable. the only thing that lets this film down is that it goes in for a somewhat predictable, sentimental ending, in which forest's angel, jenny, dies, shortly after they are married. nevertheless, forest gump is an excellent film and it's no wonder tom hanks took home an oscar for it.;31 January 2008;9;['few', 'breathtaking', 'epic', 'many', 'epic', 'remarkable', 'simple', 'amazing', 'versatile', 'demanding', 'natural', 'great', 'challenging', 'true', 'believable', 'only', 'predictable', 'sentimental', 'excellent'];0.3323529411764706

537;dabeluoki;"forrest gump is a story that follows two characters, one names forrest, the other named jenna. as says forrest gump is a simple relatively wealthy kid man with a low i.q, but good intentions. what makes this move so great is how gump goes through many of the historical events of the 20th century. from dancing with elvis, to entering the vietnam war, to witnesses the original moon landing on tv, to meeting the black panther organization, and even even witnessing the watergate scandal that causes nixon to retire. gump goes through a lot of situations throughout his life, but he never lets anyone of them disturb his happiness. from we're wearing braces on his leg, to get in bullied in school, and as an adult, to even being shot. gump never gives up and continues to believe things will workout all right. that faith always helps him out for example when he gets his braces of he discovers he can run extremely fast, and long, all that running from bullies paid off (insert famous run forrest run here scene here). not only that because he runs so fast football recruiters and coaches notice him allowing him to receive a football scholarship to the university of alabama as a running back. which then allows him to graduate college and join the military when a recruiter talks to him. why he joins the military no reasons he just does it no real explanation to why. that's the thing with his character he basically symbolizes the idea that somebody can make a difference no matter who they are, even the dumbest of the dumb. when he joins the military, he quickly able to fit, you realize forrest really isn't that dumb. he able to quickly able to reassemble his gun in the military, faster than anyone in the u.s military existence. anyway in the military he meets a man named bubba and he comes the best of pals. despite racism clearly being an issue as shown by the historical scene of the desegregation of the university of alabama(extremely funny). bubba and him are quickly able to become the best of friends. to the point where the the shrimp business he always talks with forrest about, he eventually ask forrest to come join him once's they leave the military. which is sad cause bubba ends up dying due to an injury. anyway when he went to go save lieutenant dan his commander and a few other solid jets, dan tells him to leave him, but forrest doesn't listen. this causes gump to become a war hero although dan ends up losing his legs due to serious injuries. while in rehab forrest gump picks up a new skill as ping pong which allows him join the all america ping pong team and even meet jfk. he eventually meets lieutenant dan again and the dude is a mess, he a hopeless goner since he couldn't die war like his ancestors. although he joins gump in his shrimping business challenges god to sink his ship when a huge hurricane hit's louisian, and his ship is the only one that remains. allowing gump to monopolize the business and in the end they both become millionaires, as dan takes over the business although he makes sure to replay gump by making him a stock shared in gump words a ""fruit company""(apple). dan eventually get married and finds a wife. anyway let's talk about gump mother she is an amazing single mother who only ever wanted the best for her child. to the point where she ends up having sex with a school principal early on in the move just so that her child could go to a better school. she always tells gump ""life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get"". basically mean life is unpredictable, it's full of surprises. you pick and piece of chocolate and you eat it, you may like it, but when you pick again you might not like the other one. does that mean you stop eating from those boxes of chocolate no you keep eating a trying the next, who knows you may like the rest of them. when she dies of cancer later on in the story it's very sad. now let's talk about jenna her and gump relationships. jenna starts her life of being sexually abused by her father and that's a common theme in her life in away. which forrest descirbes as ""always kissing and touching jenny and her sisters"". the men in her life are constantly abusing her yet the one man who never even think about touching her, constantly rejects him. jenny was originally gumps only friend as everyone else treated him like the ""idiot"" he was, she was the only one who let gump sit with her on the bus on his first day at school. she was the one who told gump to ""run forrest run"" from the bullies. jenny ends up posing for a playboy while in college and ends up getting expelled. which causes her to perform and sing for a strip club pretty much nude. anyway forrest gump doesn't like how the men grabbed her just like how he didn't like her boyfriend in college grabbing her and beats them up. cussing jenna to be fired, anyway before leaving for the military jenny worried about the vietnam war tells forrest if he is ever scared in vietnam to just run away. she still gives him advice even though he just got her fired meaning she probably didn't like the job anyway. forrest is constantly writing her letter in the military, but is never getting any of them back, although they do end up uniting a few year later in washington d.c, following a mostly muted anti war speech gump was about to accidentally participate in. the two spend the day together and converge at a black panther party sage house, however jenny boyfriend at the time and the party members weren't happy swing forrest there. jenny and her boyfriend eventually get in an argument in which the boyfriend slaps jenny and gump goes ballistic. forres and jenny are forced to leave and they spend the rest of the night reflecting on there journeys. jenny ends up leaving for berkeley's with the same boy that hit her, although not before gump giver her his congressional medal of honor reward, and saying she is her girl to which jenny replies i'll always be your girl. jenny ends going though a really rough time after this she has succumbed further into a life of drugs and instability. battered and high she comes closed to committing suicide. jenny eventually gets her life together and becomes a waitress and ends up meeting gump, she has a child now who she named forrest jump junior. we don't really know if it's really it's gump kid or not but he accepts gump jr. as his own kid. we find out that jenny is ill and suffering from an i own virus at the time know as hiv. which prompts forrest to tell them to come live with him and he promises to come take care of both of them. jenny ask forrest if he will marry her and he agree with great happiness. she ends up dying later on, and the saddest scene appear with gump talking to her at her grave. jenny finally accepted the one man that truly cared for her and she ends up dying. sad, at least gump jr is very bright. forrest gump is an amazing story and

585;swowen-84128;"26 years ago on today, 6th july 1994, this romantic comedy drama hit the cinema in america. directed by robert zemeckis and written by eric roth and based on the novel by winston groom. the story shows the history of forrest gump (played by tom hanks as an adult, and michael conner humphreys as a child), as he shows what influence he has had on the world, and also the personal issues that he deals with along the way. so we see that forrest is sat on a bench, by a bus stop in savannah, georgia telling anyone that sits near him the experiences that he has encountered in his life. he was born and raised by his mother mrs. gump (played by sally field) and had a curved spine that prevented him from walking properly, until he was fitted with leg braces. mrs. gump runs a boarding house out of their home in greenbow alabama. the boarding house is very popular and attracts many tenants (you get to see a few faces and see what influence forrest would have on them). on his first day at school, forrest meets a girl, jenny curran (played by robin wright), and they become best friends. with the leg braces on his legs and living in the cruel world that we live in, forrest would become the target of bullies, we also see how he is able to overcome them. we see forrest growing up and going through college, on to joining the u.s. army and all of the other wonderful and sad things that occur in his life. we get to meet some great people on the way too, lieutenant dan taylor (played by gary sinise), benjamin buford (played by mykelti williamson). also look out for a very young haley joel osment who plays a part too. i absolutely love this movie, and the quotes and quips that forrest says and have live forever in the memory. also you will find that you will end up using these sayings in your real life moments too. the movie was a box office success and was 1994's second highest grossing film, only to be beat by the lion king. it has won lots of awards including academy awards for best picture, best director and best actor for tom hanks. the whole movie, from the actual concept, which is absolutely genius, through to the screenplay, which is magical and passionate, and is technically brilliant and will seduce you into every second. the cast is totally amazing and they are so believable in the roles that they play. i must say though that tom hanks, wow, wow, wow. he actual does turn into forrest gump, i mean its seamless. you watch the movie, you know its tom hanks, but for the 2 hours 20 minutes of the movie, tom is forrest. forrest is tom. you will know what i mean as soon as you see this masterpiece if you haven't already. all i will say is ""life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get"". you certain know what you are getting in this movie. pure entertainment.";5 July 2020;9;['romantic', 'forr', 'personal', 'forr', 'popular', 'many', 'few', 'forr', 'first', 'forr', 'good', 'cruel', 'forr', 'able', 'forr', 'other', 'wonderful', 'sad', 'great', 'young', 'forr', 'real', 'second', 'high', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'whole', 'actual', 'magical', 'passionate', 'brilliant', 'amazing', 'believable', 'actual', 'forr', 'forr', 'forr', 'certain', 'pure'];0.2746059113300493

616;tommythek;"gumption: noun; common sense, horse sense, initiative, enterprise (merriam-webster). chop off the back half of that word and you have forrest gump, a towering fountain of stand-alone common sense in a nonsensical world gone crazy. in a recent letter, a friend told me that she had just watched ""forrest gump"" and that she ""loved that movie."" although it had been some seven years since i had seen it, her comment to me reminded me that i, too, had once ""loved that movie."" when it suddenly showed up on tv last night, i felt the urge, the need, for a refresher course on what it is like to be a forrest gump in a world of schlumps, myself included. moreover, i needed the sanity and serenity of forrest gump the man to assuage the insanity and unserenity that has been the month of september of 2001. i have been assuaged. by now, almost anyone who watches movies has seen ""forrest gump."" at least once. thus, we all know that it cannot be classified as a comedy. nor as a drama. nor an adventure. nor a charmer. nor a tearjerker. and yet, it is all of those things, all in one movie. ""forrest gump,"" when and as you are watching it, reminds you constantly that there is good in the world. even as you are watching bad events transpire in the movie, you seem to know that somehow, good will eventually result. that is because forrest gump is nearby -- around -- somewhere -- and wherever forrest goes, goodness follows. my favorite movie actor is, was and always will be jimmy stewart. with jimmy gone and no longer with us, tom hanks has taken his place. in my heart. just as jimmy was in so very many of his famous and fabulous roles, tom has become the american everyman. he's the guy for whom you always root. you want him to triumph. you want him to get the girl. he has to get the girl! even if the worth of the girl to be gotten is open to question, you still want him to get her, if only because he has always loved her and will always love her so unfailingly and so unconditionally. and when, at last, his unrequited love for his beloved jenny (robin wright) is finally so deservedly rewarded, you feel as if you want to jump up and shout ... ""hallelujah!!!"" then, when jenny tenderly tells forrest that he is the father of her sweet little forrest jr., you think to yourself and you say to yourself, ""yes, self! that is right! that is as it should be!"" and that is right and that is as it should be about this entire movie. even lt. dan (gary sinise), forrest's self-loathing and loathable army buddy, is unable to avoid forrest's goodness wearing off on him. forrest ""touches"" everyone. and he doesn't even know it! he's just a guy living his life. he just ... is ... forrest gump, a guy with gumption in a gumptionless world. i am so very glad and happy that my friend told me she saw ""forrest gump"" and that she ""loved that movie."" she spurred me to watch it once again. having now done so, i feel that forrest has restored both peace and love to my troubled mind and heart over the awful events of september of 2001. he is a reminder to us all that no matter how many hitlers, stalins and bin ladens may rise and fall, we will always have a forrest gump to help pull us thru the evils that these evil men do. peace and love to you, forrest.";29 September 2001;10;['common', 'forr', 'common', 'nonsensical', 'crazy', 'recent', 'forr', 'last', 'forr', 'forr', 'forr', 'least', 'forr', 'good', 'bad', 'good', 'forr', 'forr', 'favorite', 'many', 'famous', 'fabulous', 'american', 'open', 'last', 'unrequited', 'beloved', 'forr', 'sweet', 'little', 'forr', 'right', 'right', 'entire', 'forr', 'loathable', 'unable', 'forr', 'forr', 'forr', 'glad', 'happy', 'forr', 'forr', 'troubled', 'awful', 'many', 'forr', 'evil', 'forr'];0.0459975369458128

618;charishankar;"one of my favourite maugham stories, one that's little known because it's so short, is 'salvatore'. it ends with the following unforgettable words: ""i started by saying that i wondered if i could do it and now i must tell you what it is that i have tried to do. i wanted to see whether i could hold your attention for a few pages while i drew for you the portrait of a man, just an ordinary fisherman who possessed nothing in the world except a quality which is the rarest, the most precious and the loveliest that anyone can have. heaven only knows why he should so strangely and unexpectedly have possessed it. all i know is that it shone in him with a radiance that, if it had not been unconscious and so humble, would have been to the common run of men hardly bearable. and in case you have not guessed what the quality was, i will tell you. goodness, just goodness."" substitute the ""few pages"" for ""a little over two hours"", and there's 'forrest gump' for you, in a nutshell. goodness, unalloyed and uncontaminated, is always very difficult to portray on screen, and it's even more difficult to make a tale of pure goodness riveting viewing. grey is always so much more interesting than white. yet, there are the rare examples of cinematic excellence where the story is just about goodness, and the wonderful places it can take you. told with panache, and essayed with sincerity, goodness still retains its power to hold. 'yankee doodle dandy', with james cagney's unforgettable performance as george m cohan, is one such example. 'forrest gump', with tom hanks literally living the role, is another. the story is epic in scope. it spans more than half of gump's life, and portrays how greatness has nothing to do with iq. there is such a lot to learn, about human nature, from the film, that it can hardly be told within the limited scope of a review. gump lives his life on the surface, and yet the film is introspective, of life, in the extreme. it breaks the wall of entertainment and takes us to a place where celluloid becomes art. i'm saying nothing further about the story. and yet, i cannot but omit to mention the scene, near the end of the film, when gump meets jenny, luminously portrayed by robin wright, and her son. the chiaroscuro of expressions which cross gump's face in that scene can serve as a textbook example for all who want to know what acting is all about. the film is worth repeated viewings even for that one single shot. and yet, wonder of wonders, there are those who have panned 'forrest gump'. well, it takes all types to make a world.";9 September 2013;8;['favourite', 'maugham', 'short', 'salvatore', 'unforgettable', 'few', 'ordinary', 'rare', 'precious', 'lovely', 'unconscious', 'humble', 'common', 'bearable', 'few', 'little', 'forr', 'unalloyed', 'uncontaminated', 'difficult', 'difficult', 'pure', 'interesting', 'white', 'rare', 'cinematic', 'wonderful', 'unforgettable', 'such', 'forr', 'epic', 'more', 'human', 'limited', 'introspective', 'worth', 'single', 'forr'];0.1234788359788359

623;uscoa;"i am surprised that 'forrest gump' made it on the 1997 afi list of the 100 best american films. my only explanation is that had the virtue of being a recent film. it is memorable, no doubt, but it doesn't fit together. when i first saw the film, i didn't understand the black panthers or even the specifics of the vietnam war. ultimately i was lost at some places. now i understand the history, and my stomach turns at the thought of squeezing forty years of history into a two and a half hour film; it didn't work. digressing, i am shocked by how disgustingly idiotic the character is portrayed, under the guise of a 75 iq. i'm no expert, but i don't see someone with that iq dropping his pants or letting himself be hit by rocks. frankly, the rural areas of the south where young gump grew up didn't yield rocket scientists. this is because common sense was taught instead of the abstract reasoning of the weschler iq scorer. just because a person cannot recite ten numbers backwards doesn't mean that they will drop their pants on tv. i'm lingering on this because it annoys me due to my elementary knowledge of these facts which were overlooked in the plot of the film. in the 1979 film 'being there', peter sellers plays chance, a gardener with a mind similar to forrest gump; even a little simpler. however, his character never left the house where he was born and learned everything from television. next up on the docket, vietnam. vietnam was not funny, nor is its interpretation through the eyes of private gump. i don't like heavy-handed vietnam films like 'platoon' or 'apocalypse now', and this film is more accurate, visually; so i hear. as for the aftermath, lieutenant dan's post-war trauma so closely models that of jon voight's character in 'coming home' that i would sue for copyright infringement. the acting has ups and downs. gary senise is excellent as lieutenant dan. robin wright's dime-a-dozen performance makes me want to throw up. sally field is good in her few scenes. star tom hanks is overrated and, frankly, not deserving of that golden statuette. as for the film's best picture oscar, i can only conclude that the judges knew they would be lynched by angry mothers, old people, and arch-conservatives if they selected the ultra-controversial, though much better, film 'pulp fiction'. 'forrest gump' has highlights however. the bus stop bench as a forum was a fresh idea. the bubba-gump shrimp section is hilarious. and the too-little-too-late drama at the end of the film sticks with you. make your own decision, i'm playing it safe with a 5/10.";20 October 2000;5;['surprised', 'forr', 'good', 'american', 'only', 'recent', 'memorable', 'black', 'half', 'idiotic', 'rural', 'young', 'common', 'abstract', 'elementary', 'similar', 'forr', 'little', 'simple', 'funny', 'private', 'handed', 'accurate', 'post', 'war', 'excellent', 'sally', 'good', 'few', 'golden', 'good', 'angry', 'old', 'ultra', 'controversial', 'well', 'forr', 'fresh', 'hilarious', 'little', 'late', 'own', 'safe'];0.1492424242424242

636;bradleyadita;"in the film forrest gump, tom hanks actually plays allegory and myth-in-the-making (aka history) as a ""slow"" individual floating through the decades. the cinematists used this technique of ""history personified"" uniquely to full effect in this film. no other film has gotten away with such an entertaining stroll through the years. not necessarily to be taken literally; this film was so lauded (possibly unknowingly) for its seamless ability to compartmentalize and package the most recent years of american history up to 1994. much like the writing of a history textbook, we watch the years unfold as forrest gump glides through the ups and downs, stoic to the signs of the times. though the film also tells the stories of jenny, lt. dan, bubba, and momma, it is forrest through which we see the world. though each of these characters *(and the many lesser characters) who come in contact with forrest each have their own some what negative first response to him, they each, in surrender, are redeemed. much like each person's relation with history. in the end it is forrest sitting alone on a rock in a small town mississippi once again alone. for alone, history sits on a rock in small town mississippi watching his son ride the bus to kindergarten. through this lens, all the devices of the film take on new meaning. forrest's sporadic television appearances and brushes with celebrity are in fact their own brushes with history. while many films use a boy-girl love relationship as a centerpiece around which to build elaborate stages, here the relationship of love is wrapped around the passage of time. history loves you and history survives you. history is slow and history is a minimalist. the feather device is yet another metaphor for history but one which would not have connected with the audience nearly as much as tom hanks. tom hanks is the feather, the loose leaf, the page from the curious george book. our myth/history set free in the wind yet marked by the past; the pages of our lives.";3 September 2005;9;['forr', 'allegory', 'slow', 'full', 'other', 'entertaining', 'lauded', 'seamless', 'recent', 'american', 'forr', 'stoic', 'forr', 'many', 'less', 'own', 'negative', 'first', 'forr', 'small', 'small', 'new', 'sporadic', 'own', 'many', 'elaborate', 'slow', 'loose', 'curious', 'free'];0.116716995126086

641;FilmCritic-3;forrest gump is one of the movies that actually has a well-written plot. forrest gump (played by tom hanks) is waiting for the bus one day. he is sort of dimwitted, as he has an iq of 75. but as people sit next to him at the bus stop, he goes through so many events that happened through his life, it makes you think that you were actually there with him. this film is absolutely phenomenal. i saw this in 3rd hour english today and this film just went and tugged at my heart strings. this movie was so realistic that you could actually feel forrest's sadness, joys, and even the adventures that he went through in his life. this is one i definitely plan to see again.;25 January 1999;9;['forr', 'forr', 'many', 'phenomenal', 'realistic', 'forr'];0.3888888888888889

644;Science_Fantasy_Guy;every so often there are movies that seemingly get released right at the right time and subsequently become cultural phenomenons beyond their creators' wildest dreams. these movies often largely retain that success and esteem over the years (gone with the wind, star wars and jaws among others) or age poorly and get viewed as undeserving of their huge success at the time (for instance, independence day). although no movie appeals to absolutely everyone's taste, robert zemeckis' forrest gump certainly can be said to belong more in the former category. released in 1994 it raked in nearly seven hundred million dollars worldwide, becoming the second biggest box office hit of '94 (after the lion king) and mopped the floor at that year's academy awards, winning six trophies including best picture (although i prefer pulp fiction and the shawshank redemption by the tiniest of margins, but this isn't about those two), director and actor. it's a classic that, after first seeing it in 1997 when i was 9, has stayed with me to this day. i'm about to explain why. i don't think there's any need for me to talk about the story, so let me begin with the cast ensemble zemeckis assembled for this film. sally field will always be mrs. gump to me, and she turns in a beautiful performance as a strong woman with integrity who vehemently refuses to think of her son as a retard and does her best to make sure he never sees himself as one. an oscar-nominated gary sinise is riveting as the hard-bitten but scarred military man lt. dan who comes to learn from forrest the values of redemption and selflessness. robin wright penn is heartbreaking as forrest's free-spirited but deeply troubled true love whose life takes a very different route to forrest's, and mykelti williamson also gives a very touching turn as bubba, the african-american young man with a heart of gold who becomes forrest's best friend in vietnam. but at the risk of sounding like a hyperbolic and dangerously obsessed fanboy, i daresay the acting masterclass tom hanks puts forth here is the finest display of acting i have ever witnessed. no other actor before or since has made such a convincing transformation into the heart, body and soul of another person as hanks does here. every delayed or confused mannerism is spot-on, his southern accent is flawless and his every emotion letter-perfect. in the whole film, particularly the grave scene towards the end, you look into his eyes and you don't see tom hanks, you see forrest gump. utter perfection. many will say the storyline is a contrived, manipulative and even conservative affair (and, admittedly, in some respects they may be right), but they're oblivious to the darker subtext in eric roth's screenplay and the many postmodern storytelling methods zemeckis deploys here. while we watch forrest encounter so many historic people and events, we see jenny experience the negative side of '60s and '70s counterculture as she protests the vietnam war, embraces alcohol, drugs and illicit sex and also for much of the film's duration forrest's impairments are exploited for laughs. when we analyze this side of the story the film becomes much darker than it initially seems. the unconventional methods zemeckis uses in telling forrest's story enhance this in his narration he discusses things that are yet to happen and the placing of tom hanks into old footage of the real-life events gives the movie a revisionist historical feel. another huge plus is the soundtrack, containing most of the greatest artists from the '50s to the early '80s. forrest gump's charm and appeal is timeless, and its artistic craft is even better. it's a rollicking tapestry of american history from the '50s to the '80s (both good and bad), driven by a powerhouse ensemble cast and a brilliant crew working on a brilliantly constructed screenplay filled with dozens of lines that have entered the lexicon, all brought together by the love and passion of a genius director. forrest gump is a classic that will look handsome in any dvd collection, and is yet another movie that never leaves me feeling amazed no matter how much older i get.

696;DeathFish;i think that this is without doubt one of the true classics in the world of movies. this is an idealistic story of moral and compassion, it teaches compassion to your loved ones, goodness and honesty. all of this is presented by one boy growing up to be a successful man. successful not only in the meaning of financial success, but success in life as well. when i think of the movie, i often think of forrest not as a man, like other characters in movies, but as an idea of life. a pure sense of life created into a fantastic person. what i like the most about forrest is that he has an unfailing ability to do things right, on purpose or not, no matter what people might think of him, or what outcome it could have been. nothing is trivial to him, nothing is too pointless for him to do something about, on the other hand things like image and others opinion about him is not remotely important to him. his in many ways childish behavior, gives him a mystic touch of innocence. this pure way of life, makes us want to be more like him, to be more caring about others, and makes us see what we really should treasure in life. he contains great wisdom from his mother, and his love for jenny is pure, as well as his friendship with bubba and all of his friends even after they have all passed on.tom hanks delivers an exceptional performance and deserves the oscar completely, he captures the nature of forrest gump amazingly and gives this movie heart and soul. the other actors/actresses also makes outstanding performances, robin as jenny touches us deeply with her tragic story and her kindness, which walks hand ind hand with her suffering. gary sinise is simply fantastic, i can not imagine lt. dan as anyone else, he is simply hilarious and thoughtful at the same time( by the way i have to give the special effects crew credit for their work on his legs ). basically every actor who appears on the screen does an exceptional job. the director too uses every possible technique to capture the moral and feelings on the screen, and the details keep emerging for each time you see this movie. all in all a true masterpiece providing comedy, drama, a bit of action and most of all a pure sense of happiness and warmth. it makes you think about the big questions of life, and you decide for yourself how to translate the messages and symbols of this movie. for those of you who either did not understand this movie or have not yet seen it , you should go and watch or re-watch it as soon as possible. enjoy, this is one of my all time favorites. 9/10;17 September 2006;9;['true', 'idealistic', 'moral', 'loved', 'successful', 'successful', 'financial', 'forr', 'other', 'pure', 'fantastic', 'most', 'forr', 'trivial', 'pointless', 'other', 'important', 'many', 'childish', 'mystic', 'pure', 'caring', 'great', 'pure', 'exceptional', 'forr', 'other', 'outstanding', 'tragic', 'fantastic', 'hilarious', 'thoughtful', 'same', 'special', 'exceptional', 'possible', 'moral', 'true', 'most', 'pure', 'big', 'possible'];0.2506462585034013

733;Sithlord-20;"for the life of me i will never understand the popularity of this movie. it is nothing more than a tedious, painfully melodramatic mess. the entire film is based on a gimmick that is repeated ad nauseum until eventually i just wanted to chew off one of my hands instead of watching another minute. that gimmick consists of inserting forrest into an historic event and watching him emerge triumphant. that the film repeatedly has forrest living through (and becoming a hero in) the most tumultuous times in recent american history---vietnam, segregation, the cold war, etc.---is an insult to the people who lived through those times. to say that forrest, with all his moronic wisdom, is smarter than those who actually experienced the event into which forrest is digitally inserted is nothing short of an affront to america itself. one of the greatest tragedies in its oscar sweep is that ""gump"" won for best editing over ""hoop dreams,"" a movie culled from over 300 hours of footage. ""hoop"" is riveting for every minute while ""gump"" drags on and on with superfluous scene after superfluous scene. could that ""forrest running back and forth across the us"" have possibly been milked any longer? this lasts 15 minutes with no reason except to portray the passage of time. and as for forrest's ""soul mate,"" jenny, this little slut is a despicable character who abuses forrest throughout his entire life, both mentally and emotionally, and shows him nothing but disrespect. this character does not deserve our sympathy, she deserves our contempt. ""forrest gump"" is woefully, abominably bad. its main gimmick is cute the first time you see the movie, but after one viewing the entire facade comes crashing down to reveal a redundant plot, mediocre acting (hanks is an oscar-caliber actor, but not for this dreck; he was better in both ""cast away"" and ""saving private ryan"") and inept editing. in my opinion, this stands as the least deserving of all best picture oscar winners. rating: 2/10";20 August 2002;2;['more', 'tedious', 'melodramatic', 'entire', 'forr', 'historic', 'forr', 'tumultuous', 'recent', 'american', 'cold', 'forr', 'moronic', 'smart', 'forr', 'short', 'great', 'good', 'superfluous', 'superfluous', 'forr', 'forr', 'little', 'despicable', 'forr', 'entire', 'disrespect', 'forr', 'bad', 'main', 'cute', 'first', 'entire', 'redundant', 'mediocre', 'well', 'private', 'inept', 'deserving', 'good'];0.0758022774327122

750;naun;there's something of a tradition in fiction of using the idiot savant to hold the mirror up to society and reflect its foibles. the figure of the good soldier schweik was one i remember being introduced to in my early years at university. forrest gump is also a soldier for much of this picture's duration, but the satire is diluted to no more than a few bum and fart jokes in the presence of the great and the good. maybe it's this evasiveness that caused this film to attract such a storm of criticism from the left when it first appeared. seven years on, it's hard to see the film's reluctance to take on biting social satire as something it deserved to be damned for. more likely, it's the film's unflattering portrayal of the counter culture of the sixties that made its baby boomer critics touchy. for the most part, it's a gentle and appealingly whimsical picture. australian - and more particularly, melbourne - viewers will recognize in it something of the spirit of michael leunig's cartoons. in keeping with this spirit is the one aspect of this film that could be regarded as controversial, which is its scepticism toward causes. tom hanks is excellent. it says something about the rest of the world's stereotypes about american culture that one of america's biggest movie stars can hold the screen for hour after hour while remaining the most self-effacing of actors. there is charm and real emotion in his performance. if the film sometimes veers into sentimentality (and it does) it is not hanks' fault. the film isn't a masterpiece. as i say, it does sometimes lapse into sentimentality, and it annoys me that, like rain man, it can't acknowledge disability without conferring on its disabled characters superhuman talents of one kind or another. and, as i'm sure others have pointed out, the trick shots involving gump's encounters with various historical personages had already been done - to much sharper comic effect - by woody allen in zelig. however, for me the film's greatest specific failing is that it doesn't do more with the character of gump's love, jenny, who doesn't do much more in this film than turn up every half hour or so and look beautiful. i thought there was scope there to explore the nature of their mutual dependence more deeply, and to illuminate both characters in the process. to some extent this does happen with the character of lieutenant dan, a nicely drawn character who provides the right sort of counterweight to gump. i don't expect that i will want to see this film again and again, the way i keep going back to leunig's cartoons, which have a kind of natural wisdom-in-innocence that zemeckis' film sometimes visibly strains to achieve. it's not a film that particularly goes anywhere, not that it really means to. but, a little to my surprise, i did enjoy watching it.;26 March 2001;7;['good', 'early', 'forr', 'much', 'more', 'few', 'great', 'hard', 'social', 'likely', 'unflattering', 'most', 'gentle', 'whimsical', 'australian', 'controversial', 'excellent', 'american', 'big', 'real', 'disabled', 'sure', 'various', 'historical', 'sharp', 'comic', 'great', 'specific', 'more', 'more', 'half', 'beautiful', 'mutual', 'right', 'natural', 'little'];0.2063940092165898

762;darrell-garrison;"(10 out of 10) when i was 15, i saw 'star wars' on the big screen for the first time. i saw it many times that summer, and as a 15 year-old boy, it had a tremendous influence on me. no movie came close to supplanting star wars as my all-time favorite movie until 'forrest gump.' i saw 'forrest gump' on the big-screen six times, and many times on video since then. it is the most life-affirming movie i've ever seen. i don't give 10's to movies very often. a great movie should get a 9. the difference between a 9 and a 10 is feeling. how does the movie make you feel after you've seen it? how long do the images stick with you? there is not a single scene in 'forrest gump' that is without thought and feeling. the movie is hilarious and tragic. it is soulful and charming. it is incredibly sad and emotionally uplifting. a true rollercoaster of genuine feelings. set against the backdrop of the 50's through 80's, it has that nostalgic and true ring to it. it has to, since what happens to forrest, forrest gump, is incredible. the movie is audacious to say the least. any other film that puts its no-name central character with people ranging from elvis to nixon will seem like a copycat of this one. hanks is absolutely superb. the previous year he won an oscar for his most sincere work, 'philadelphia'. he won this oscar for his most seminal work. it will probably be the movie he will most be remembered by, even though he has decades of movies ahead of him. the team that put this together, most notably robert zemeckis, did a great job with everything from characters to celebrity appearances to classic music setting the mood (listen to ""camelot"" playing in the background as forrest is in the jfk white house). the weakest parts of the film are robin wright penn, who is a good actress, but not great, and the running scenes. but since robin is not in the film that much, it's okay. and the running towards the end actually give a bit of a breather, i feel, so i'm not bothered by it. with all of the ups and downs in the film, how can i say this is the most life-affirming movie i've ever seen? because at the end of the day, forrest gump is a man who has been to hell and back, who has lost loved ones, who has struggled with his place in the world, and managed to come through it all with sweetness and love. the world changed, and in some ways forrest changed with it, but he is not jaded by it, as you and i are. if we could be as simple as forrest, mightn't we be happier?";25 January 2003;10;['big', 'first', 'many', 'old', 'tremendous', 'favorite', 'forr', 'forr', 'big', 'many', 'most', 'great', 'single', 'forr', 'hilarious', 'tragic', 'soulful', 'charming', 'sad', 'uplifting', 'true', 'genuine', 'nostalgic', 'true', 'forr', 'incredible', 'audacious', 'least', 'other', 'central', 'superb', 'previous', 'sincere', 'most', 'seminal', 'great', 'classic', 'forr', 'weak', 'good', 'great', 'much', 'okay', 'most', 'forr', 'loved', 'forr', 'simple', 'forr', 'happy'];0.2935649935649936

794;hpmc6;what i mean by this is, if a group of friends really wanted to rent it, i wouldn't spend a 'veto' against the film with the group, but i wouldn't pick it either. it's tolerable if you don't expect too much from this 'box of chocolates'. i saw this when it came out, and i haven't seen it since. what struck me, was that when it was over, that people exiting the film were completely silent. i don't know why the other people in the theater were silent, but i was because the film really didn't deliver. i felt it took me on a long trip to nowhere. those in my group felt the same way. but clearly, many other people feel otherwise. while somewhat watchable and pleasant enough to see unfold, and mildly funny at times, expectations of 'something profound' are instead met with a really shallow parade of cliches and stereotypes in a narcissistic baby-boomer nostalgia orgy, the kind of thing that was already wearing out it's welcome from 'the big chill' film & 'thirty-something' type tv shows. the viewer seems obligated to sit there and click on pop icons of the baby boomer past, to make them get off the screen and move on to the next. it's a very shallow parade through history. i'm not politically correct by any means, but it does seem like the worst stereotype was pushed of the vietnam vet, along with other characters, i'm sure many people found some of these characters degrading. a 'slow person' was kind of made fun of, without any real purpose. some parts of the movie, such as 'the run' was just spontaneous, stupid and pointless. if i had no real expectations, i might not have found it as offensive. but the presentation as though this was something culturally profound when it's not left me flat.;31 March 2008;5;['tolerable', 'much', 'silent', 'other', 'silent', 'long', 'same', 'many', 'other', 'watchable', 'pleasant', 'funny', 'profound', 'shallow', 'narcissistic', 'welcome', 'big', 'next', 'shallow', 'correct', 'bad', 'other', 'sure', 'many', 'slow', 'real', 'such', 'spontaneous', 'stupid', 'pointless', 'real', 'offensive', 'profound', 'flat'];0.0401234567901234

""contact"" and even ""beowulf,"" but this one, he asked way too much for me to believe. i actually think the events of ""star wars 1-6"" were more likely to have occurred than the events in this movie. a lot has been said about his right wing political agenda; i don't care; it's his movie, he can do what he wants with, but i don't have to agree. also that this movie is stereotypical to blacks. i always wondered what african americans thought about some of the stuff in it as i don't think it was meant to be racist, but some of it kind of came off like it. i guess it's up to them to decide. now onto the last part of my comment which doesn't have anything to do with why i like/dislike any part of the movie. i've been called a communist, un-american, and other worse things for hating this movie. really what is the point. i don't put other people down for not liking movies i like. everybody's is entitled to their own opinion. furthermore, i thought i lived in (and fought for) a country where i can like or dislike whatever movie i want. i don't like movies because everyone else does, and just because hollywood or the media says that a movie is good, doesn't mean that it is. in fact i tend to disagree with hollywood a lot. anyway, isn't having to like something that's jammed down my throat communist in itself? anyway, if i had to choose between becoming a communist and liking this movie, i would choose communism without a second thought or regret. if i was rating this movie on how much i actually liked it, i would give it a -infiniti just on the stupid screenplay alone. too bad, it took awhile for ""the shawshank redemption"" to get popular, or that would have swept the oscars that year.";19 March 2008;3;['only', 'only', 'other', 'many', 'enough', 'more', 'whole', 'ridiculous', 'historical', 'smiley', 'american', 'believable', 'stupid', 'stupid', 'stupid', 'more', 'stupid', 'stupid', 'stupid', 'apparent', 'stupid', 'stupid', 'stupid', 'good', 'beautiful', 'big', 'useless', 'cool', 'awesome', 'able', 'good', 'horrible', 'basic', 'pathetic', 'southern', 'bad', 'exaggerated', 'cool', 'great', 'next', 'same', 'easy', 'second', 'first', 'least', 'good', 'much', 'likely', 'right', 'political', 'stereotypical', 'racist', 'last', 'other', 'bad', 'other', 'own', 'good', 'jammed', 'second', 'stupid', 'bad', 'popular'];-0.0606547619047618

798;dxia;normally, i detest over use of voice-over narration. i often think to myself that directors use narration only because they can't think of a better way to tell the story through the actions of the characters. why tell the story when you could show it? 'forrest gump,' however, is an exception to that personal belief. the story has to be told through narration because the narrator is in every way the center of the story. forrest's innocence, his inability to see the evil in human beings, carries the movie because he can never lose that innocence. forrest is only a step above raymond from levinson's 'rain man,' and like raymond, he cannot change the way he is. and because we see everything from forrest's perspective, we witness the world through a child's eyes and laugh at the irony. the director, robert zemekis, uses that laughter to probe our evolution. sometimes only through a child's perspective can we look back at how we failed, how we succeeded, and why. in a world that stresses reason and practicality, sometimes it's necessary that we reexamine our humanity by stripping away our cynicism and societal inhibitions, and just take things for what they are. realistically, we live in a world that would destroy a person like forrest gump. but by watching this fairy tale we understand why it shouldn't, and it fills our hearts when it doesn't. what a wonderful movie.;28 February 2004;9;['well', 'forr', 'personal', 'human', 'forr', 'forr', 'necessary', 'societal', 'forr', 'wonderful'];0.25

810;pvsk;i recently saw 'forrest gump' and was amazed. i could not understand, whether it is a family drama or a philosophical movie. as i felt that the movie is much more than a family drama, i am not discussing the story of the movie here. i am trying to analyze the movie from a philosophical/ psychological angle. is there a message the movie is trying to convey? does this movie laugh at people who are supposedly very intelligent, rich but never satisfied or happy? does intelligence above a certain level really makes people feel unhappy about every thing? is emotional quotient (eq) more important than intelligent quotient (iq)? every body knows that focus in so important for success. yet we are so distracted in life that we are unable to concentrate all our energy in a single thing. forrest gump does this so effortlessly. when he runs he runs , when he plays ping pong (table tennis) he does just that. is it because of his below average iq? or is it because of the very high level of mental maturity he has achieved? the way forrest handles all his successes is unbelievable. we see people who become head strong for such trivial things, and forrest wins again and again without even bothering about the level of success he has achieved. there is a particular scene in which forrest says to his bench mate in the bust stop ' i went to washington again, met the president again' the statement sounds so naturally innocent. the actor and the director deserve a special congratulation in this particular scene for making it sound so natural and do not look like a egoistic boast. the director also captures the way forrest handles defeat. forrest never gives up being a shrimp boat captain and he is never bogged down by a failure. this finally makes him a millionaire. it is quoted in bhagavad-gita that 'treating pleasure and pain, gain and loss, victory and defeat alike, engage yourself in your duty'. the statement though it may look so simple is extremely difficult to implement in real life. now researchers have found that emotional quotient (eq) is more important than iq. forrest scores so high in eq, that his iq becomes irrelevant for all his successes. i really don't know whether the director conveyed this message intentionally. this movie also has some incredible acting, where you do not realize that tom hanks has really acted. i guess he has become forrest gump himself. the scene where he shows some sort of emotional outburst is when he discovers about his child. i am sure even a robot will be moved by the scene where he asks his girl friend whether the child is dump or intelligent and asks her permission to talk to his child. he does not ask permission in words, but his facial expression speaks thousand words. every body else in the film has done excellent support acting. a brilliant movie and a must see.;25 September 2001;9;['forr', 'amazed', 'philosophical', 'more', 'psychological', 'intelligent', 'rich', 'satisfied', 'happy', 'certain', 'unhappy', 'emotional', 'eq', 'important', 'intelligent', 'important', 'distracted', 'unable', 'single', 'forr', 'below', 'average', 'high', 'mental', 'forr', 'unbelievable', 'strong', 'such', 'trivial', 'forr', 'particular', 'innocent', 'special', 'particular', 'natural', 'egoistic', 'forr', 'forr', 'simple', 'difficult', 'real', 'emotional', 'important', 'forr', 'eq', 'irrelevant', 'incredible', 'forr', 'emotional', 'sure', 'intelligent', 'facial', 'excellent', 'brilliant'];0.1974786324786324

(james 2:13 niv). i've previously heard mircea cartarescu saying that kindness, rather than intelligence, is the best thing some can have in his life. what would happen if you had a lot of mercy, but little judgment? you find out in the movie. there are some apparent negative roles in the movie. but when you really think about them, the movie gives you some reasons for their behavior. of course, not for every bad character, but for the most important ones, yes. and some of the bad characters transform in the movie, they become something else. i like the fact that forrest goes from a to b rather easily. he has no issue moving on. it's really nice how he transforms his weaknesses into strength. this happens multiple times in the movie. tom hanks plays great. 10/10, no questions about it.";3 August 2020;10;['few', 'forr', 'stupid', 'stupid', 'forr', 'stupid', 'forr', 'silly', 'stupid', 'very', 'stupid', 'impossible', 'huge', 'happy', 'main', 'good', 'little', 'apparent', 'negative', 'bad', 'important', 'bad', 'forr', 'nice', 'multiple', 'great'];-0.1684523809523809

""the shawshank redemption"", and ""pulp fiction"" were far better films, that lost to forrest gump. i found that that was quite bad. sure, forrest gump is good, and fun, but it is nothing compared to shawshank and fiction. and morgan freeman, john travolta, nigel hawthorne and others who gave remarkable performaces, but lost to hanks' overblown one. anyway, that's my 2 cents, forrest gump's good, but has a lot of errors, while shawshank and fiction were better, and didn't have many errors.

922;SeanPennModernPowerhouse;forrest gump is one of the most unforgettable films i have ever seen. director robert zemeckis marked his place in hollywood with the hugely popular back to the future trilogy. tom hanks climbed the ladder of success starring in comedy movies like splash and turner and hooch in the 1980's, but hadn't had critical success until 1993 when he starred in philadelphia with denzel washington, which won him his first oscar for best actor. the movie also features outstanding performances from little known actors gary sinise (apollo 13, ransom, deception), mykelti williamson (heat, con air, three kings, ali) and robin wright-penn, credited as robin wright, (unbeakable). forrest gump starts off with the title character (hanks) sitting on a bench waiting for a bus when a young woman comes and sits next to him. here he starts his story by remembering his first pair of shoes, which in the film are leg braces. forrest tells us how he met his life-long friend jenny (wright-penn), how he served in the vietnam war and how he spent years running for absolutely no reason. hanks plays forrest gump in a way that makes us feel what the character is feeling so most that we develop a sort of relationship with him. gary sinise has an excellent performance as lt. dan taylor who hates gump because he saved him in vietnam because he believes that he should of died on the battle field but late becomes his friend, and who says that sinise can only play bad guys? robin wright-penn handles jenny's drug addiction and the scene were she tries to commit suicide brilliantly. mykelti williamson plays the part of forrest's friend 'bubba' blue, whom he meets in the army, excellently considering that this is the movie where he gets the most screen time that his ever had in the movies that i've ever seen him in. sally feild (mrs doutfire, homeward bound, homeward bound 2: lost in san fansico, legally blonde 2:red white and blonde) plays the part of forrest's devoted mother very well. the little boy who in years to come would rise to fame, haley joel osment (the sixth sense, pay it forward, a.i.), make an appearance as forrest gump jr.. haley, mr. simonet (played by kevin spacey in pay it forward) would be proud. this was one of the best movie's of 1994, others included pulp fiction and speed.*****;3 August 2003;10;['forr', 'unforgettable', 'popular', 'future', 'critical', 'denzel', 'first', 'good', 'outstanding', 'little', 'unbeakable', 'forr', 'young', 'first', 'forr', 'long', 'forr', 'most', 'excellent', 'bad', 'forr', 'most', 'blonde', 'red', 'white', 'blonde', 'forr', 'devoted', 'little', 'sixth', 'forr', 'proud', 'good'];0.253409090909091

926;Walter_c;"it's kinda extremely difficult for me to overestimate such a masterpiece because of its glutted images and metaphors through every single moment. every detail, every action means something in this films, there is no scenes just for eyes watching with brain relaxing. and sooth to say i'm very tired with hearing reviews about ""the film about a down"". a retard (in accordance with the medical sense)? i agree. but human after all, much more humane than anybody else because of the absence of evil within. this is the toughest issue - only a retard (or mentally challenged) person can be truly humane in the modern world? ""forrest gump"" is not a manual for ones who want to become a millionaire or a great player or get lucky. this film is about life with many things it contains - from life values to a country history. furthermore, they all are shown in a different light. so, forrest gump is a simple guy without mastermind at all, but squeaky clean and morally healthy man at the same time. he believes in things another people forgot, he has pure heart, being naive, but honest, frank, unmercenary and true friend. he is guileless, though he seems to be an idiot in the eyes of others. despite of it gump does make a difference between good and bad things, truly good and bad ones. and i discern this movie as a parable about human being, human life. ""stupid"" gump couldn't understand what was the life: ""...if we each have a destiny, or if we're all just floating around accidental-like on a breeze...maybe it's both."" but who can say the absolute truth about what is life being? the eternal mystery. p.s. another point of the film is about parenting (remember ""momma always said"") and how it affects the life time. so keep an eye on your children, try to be wisdom as possible as you can.";29 July 2012;10;['difficult', 'single', 'tired', 'medical', 'human', 'humane', 'tough', 'humane', 'modern', 'forr', 'great', 'lucky', 'many', 'different', 'forr', 'simple', 'clean', 'healthy', 'same', 'pure', 'naive', 'honest', 'frank', 'unmercenary', 'true', 'guileless', 'good', 'bad', 'good', 'bad', 'parable', 'human', 'human', 'stupid', 'absolute', 'eternal', 'possible'];0.0572845804988662

959;jte6451;"""my momma always said, ""life was like a box of chocolates. you never know what you're gonna get."" - forrest gump who doesn't love forrest gump? he is, like, one of the most innocent human beings on the planet. he may not be the sharpest tool in the shed, but he has gone on to achieve greatness that most of us couldn't even imagine he could do. emotionally uplifting, often funny, and inspiring, this movie still retains the magic and positive feeling that forrest left on millions of americans when it came out 25 years ago. based on the novel by winston groom, it follows forrest gump, a simple-minded alabama guy who has a heart of gold, as the story chronicles forrest's life that spans through four decades; from his childhood years, to him being a top college running-back, to him serving in vietnam, becoming a star ping pong player, owning a successful shrimp company, and going on a 3-year cross-country marathon. while that's going on, he also witnesses and, unintentionally, influences certain key events in the second half of the 20th century american history. however, there's one thing that he truly cares about more than all of the achievements that he has made in his life, and that's his childhood sweetheart, jenny, who, unlike forrest, has since been living a self-destructive lifestyle and never reciprocates his feelings for her. an excellently told story that shows us the world through the eyes of forrest and how, simply for being at the right place at the right time, he achieves all sorts of accomplishments that no one thought he could do. it does takes some liberties from the novel and there are some parts that feel a tad bit sentimental at times. however, the focus still remains on our main character. the overall look of the film is fantastic. aside from being excellently-directed, the cinematography is great, the music fits the time periods, and the editing moves at a steady pace. the visual effects, surprisingly, even for the time, are pretty impressive, particularly when forrest meets famous historical figures like jfk, john lennon, and richard nixon. what they did was they took archive footages of these historical figures and digitally integrate tom hanks as forrest into the footage seamlessly, as if forrest is actually there interacting with these historical figures. another one, in particular, involves lt. dan after he loses both his legs. this was done by wrapping blue fabric and ""roto-painting"" around gary sinise's legs and then digitally remove them through cg. these effects were done a mere one year after jurassic park, which was considered a major game changer in the visual effects department, and while forrest gump isn't really a major game changer in that department and there are some small blemishes here and there, still i can't deny that these were impressive for the time; it still looks good though. the performances from the full cast are all excellent. tom hanks is the heart and soul of this movie; he delivers a strong and hypnotizing performance as a guy who is gullible, but very likable. gary sinise is outstanding as lt. dan, forrest's lieutenant during vietnam who loses his legs during an ambush and has became a cynical and bitter cripple who feels that he should carry on his family tradition of dying in a american war, until he finds his purpose again when he joins forrest in the shrimp business, robin wright is great as forrest's love interest, jenny, who lives a self-destructive lifestyle due to being sexually abused as a child to the point where she becomes a drug addict and nearly commits suicide, sally field is also good as forrest's loving and caring mother, and mykelti williamson is great as forrest's war buddy, bubba. overall, forrest gump is just as impactful as it was in 1994. dealing with themes of love, friendship, redemption, and destiny, it's one of my all time favorites and has inspired countless people to follow their dreams, live life to the fullest, and to find their destiny. as forrest would say, ""life is like a box of chocolates. you never know what you're gonna get."" highly mandatory for any movie buff.

961;thepuccacritic;"this may be a good story.. the rise and rise of a character-from a sportsman to a soldier to a millionaire- who has an iq lesser than that needed to get admitted in a state school- where he gets bullied and meets his love of life. this character graph has inspired many bollywood filmmakers (rajkumar hirani, karan johar in particular) to sketch their characters, and they have milked their stories with enough drama too. i turned upon this film after watching its bollywood inspirations. but i wasn't looking for any (melo)drama; but subtlety, of course, which, in my opinion, this film lacked. lacking subtlety is not a problem but hammering with details being blurted out in voice over is, for me. the overdose of voice-over narration concerns me here... it gives too much of unnecessary information which aren't contributing anything to the narrative or the plot or either emotional value, and many of the details are just repeated twice for no particular reason. and this voice-over is not even breaking the fourth wall but is a narration to strangers. he meets these strangers at a bus-stop and they happen to change from time to time, just like the visitors at the home his mom had let for. (such symbolism, if you call it one, work.) he starts his story quoting his 'mama' (and to count how many times this mama's boy calls her out could be one irritating game for viewers). this grown up man taking us into the flashback of his childhood never came across to me as a sympathetic one though the film's 'feather light' treatment (also embodied as a symbolism in the film) worked in many tight scenes but at the same time looked desperate in demanding emotion and sympathy from the audience. (even that white feather hitting the screen with a whoosh at the end came across as- ""oh look, we hit you so hard with such a heartwarming and light story""). maybe i'm too cynical but the character, forrest gump, looked to me as a dumb throughout. and over-usage of the quote ""an idiot is as idiot does"" made him look more. and i totally get that the point of the film was to look the cynical world from the prism of an unintelligent man that would make it look more simpler and a winning place, but all i'm saying that this could have been said differently, more beautifully and overwhelmingly and obviously, with some subtlety. also i'm not asking to take away its classic status. the way the film depicts and incorporates american history, its thriving new culture and counterculture into its storytelling deserves to be acknowledged and that would have surely helped to achieve this status. the music score is indeed beautiful. but only if the director had realized that it's also about the 'sight' and not only 'sound', he would have deployed a more focused and centered cinematographer to work who would add his bit to the narrative. what worries me is that how did a film so repetitive and monotonous in its narration and tone with no powerful visual storytelling win best screenplay and editing awards at the oscars! but again what overwhelms me is the fact that this film which used visual effects as a requirement and not a motif to tell a story won the oscar for best visual effects!";11 June 2014;6;['good', 'less', 'many', 'particular', 'enough', 'much', 'unnecessary', 'emotional', 'many', 'particular', 'fourth', 'such', 'many', 'sympathetic', 'feather', 'many', 'tight', 'same', 'desperate', 'white', 'light', 'cynical', 'forr', 'dumb', 'more', 'cynical', 'unintelligent', 'simple', 'classic', 'american', 'new', 'beautiful', 'focused', 'centered', 'repetitive', 'monotonous', 'powerful', 'visual', 'good', 'visual', 'good', 'visual'];0.096281265031265
962;Cryogenic;"not one to have quite made a classic (though the first ""back to the future"" film and ""who framed roger rabbit?"" come close), robert zemeckis never makes less than interesting work. (i have a particular weakness/affinity for it). in some senses, ""forrest gump"" may be his magnum opus - if only because it showcases all of zemeckis' nuances and idiosyncrasies whilst also somewhat disguising and flaunting its own off-beatedness in a fairly linear - albeit curious - narrative. how do you criticise a film like this? for every negative thrown at gump, i've seen the film produce a reasonable rebuttal in my own mind. it seems to defy criticism altogether. this unique quality of gump stems from its refusal to completely yield to its conflicting tonalities and messages. is it satire, drama or something else? does it favour the american dream, slander it or alternatively embrace and shy away from it? does it champion forrest's virtuosity, outright demean it or look impartially at it? do these labels and divides exist at all - is the film merely disinterested in these things or maybe trying to suggest that we shouldn't be bothered and stop dealing in labels and monikers? many questions - few answers. hanks' performance embodies the film. it's pleasant, slick and affecting - yet was it really more oscar worthy (he won, the others didn't) than gary sinise's in the same film or samuel jackson's in ""pulp fiction""? was the film as a whole deserving of ""best picture""? are you sick of reading questions? it's all so damn hard to pin this work to one thing. the film offers itself up for criticism in a number of areas - in its flagrant sentimentality, in its gimmicky ""forrest interacting with famous people"" sequences, in its vast extravagancies (e.g. any time forrest runs and inevitably performs a remarkable feat) - but all these things seem woven into a greater fabric that spins and toys with them and its pure protagonist, like the wind spinning and toying with the pure white feather and contriving it to land at his feet, not to mention the viewer, in a knowing and powerful manner. truly, there is nothing quite like ""forrest gump"" - nor is there anything like forrest gump. perhaps that is at the root of it all. the film is possibly nothing more than a celebration of individuality. what makes it so profound and transcendental is that the individual of forrest gives us a unique look at varied and turbulent american history, and more broadly, even more varied and turbulent human experience. we should probably be thankful for that. i'm sorry for the slightly unconventional review, but as i've said and implied all over, it's an unconventional film and needs to be handled as such. we can all look tough picking up broken glass with kevlar gloves; when the sharp diamond-like edges can't get to our skin so easily. we can all look good destroying a film with sweeping words; when we've ""gloved"" ourselves away from its smaller details. but how many of us can dispense with the gloves, picking up broken piece after broken piece, constantly risking exposure to the finer qualities of the glass - glass that may cut us? how many of us can dispense with our harsh words, patiently resolving to consider and explore the finer textures of ""forrest gump"" - a film that may be saying nothing of interest and reward our patience by ""cutting"" us? it's a tough one. this review has been non-committal. so is the film. see it. feel it. live it.";18 January 2006;10;['first', 'close', 'less', 'interesting', 'particular', 'forr', 'magnum', 'disguising', 'own', 'linear', 'curious', 'negative', 'reasonable', 'own', 'unique', 'conflicting', 'forr', 'demean', 'many', 'few', 'pleasant', 'slick', 'worthy', 'same', 'whole', 'good', 'sick', 'hard', 'flagrant', 'forr', 'famous', 'vast', 'forr', 'remarkable', 'great', 'pure', 'pure', 'white', 'knowing', 'powerful', 'forr', 'forr', 'more', 'profound', 'transcendental', 'forr', 'unique', 'varied', 'turbulent', 'american', 'varied', 'turbulent', 'human', 'thankful', 'sorry', 'unconventional', 'unconventional', 'such', 'tough', 'kevlar', 'sharp', 'like', 'good', 'sweeping', 'small', 'many', 'broken', 'broken', 'fine', 'many', 'harsh', 'fine', 'forr', 'tough', 'non', 'committal'];0.1436845660249915

969;humayunafzal;i think this is just one of the few few movies which i connected with so well...i don't know where to begin..its been an incredible story and i bet there will not be a movie in future which will be as good.. the life of forrest gump...i must say,if this person existed really then he would have been the most historical person to ever live..and what an amazing,everlasting and natural performance from tom hanks...a well deserved oscar for him.....i think life chose him to be a part of so many great and historical films.. this movie is all about the historical life of innocent forrest gump(tom hanks) and his relation with jenny curran(robin wright)..he lived in alabama and was 10 years old when braces were fit to his feet because of having crooked back..he was a child having a low iq and every person thought of him as a lagging behind person..one day he was running away from his school mates who were bullying him and that day changed the course of his life...he ran for first time...he broke his braces and ran and ran....his inspiration at this time was his best friend jenny curran(robin wright) and later his crush.. forrest was very simple,innocent and straight forward kind of person..still he witnessed some remarkable events in his life.the moments which were going to be written in history of usa..in high school he was there when two negros were admitted in school full of whites for the first time.elvis presley visited his house..he won a medal of honor in vietnam war..he served in army at different spheres..he was part of that football team which won the 1st prize and had a chance to meet with president...forrest met us president 3 times in his life..and all of presidents were different on all 3 occasions..he set a record for running for 3 years and got media attention and got famous all over america...john lennon interviewed him on tv as well...he became filthy rich from shrimping business... this movie is full of life long lessons and some of the best lines of whole cinematic history...forrest's mom always told him that life was like a chocolate box...you never know what you are going to have...in another scene it is quoted that destiny is what that happens to man...and in the end forrest recollects both of these and says life is blend of both of these... whats most upsetting about this film is relation of forest and jenny....although forrest did every one of the things above mentioned but one thing he wanted all his life was jenny...he never had enough of her.he never got that love and romance he deserved...she was his inspiration of every thing he had achieved. he was always thinking about her but she always avoided him knowing that he loved her...finally they meet and marry when she is just about to die..and she dies weeks later..i personally wanted to see both of them together enjoying life and having good time..but that never happens..she loved her and one night when they met for a brief time they had sex which got her pregnant...she never told him and finally forrest saw his son years later..when she finally wanted to be with him...that was one of the most emotional scenes of movie..when jenny told him that he was his dad... but that's what life is all about.sorrow,grief,happiness,sacrifice,innocence,purity,integrity, determination,strength of character,valor and above all love...all these precious life lessons in one movie..feels like dream...there's much to say...there are still many many important points i am leaving because review is stretching miles..the most important mentions are sally field..her role as forrest's mother is depiction of serious determination and will....gary sinise as lt dan is best supporting role one can have...he wanted to die in battle field just as his ancestors had died in every american war but forrest saved him..his character reflected valor,sacrifice and determination...unlike his ancestors..he lived and became successful even after losing both of his legs. all 10 points from me...watch it dozens of time..its only going to turn out better..;5 November 2016;10;['few', 'few', 'incredible', 'good', 'forr', 'historical', 'amazing', 'everlasting', 'natural', 'many', 'great', 'historical', 'historical', 'innocent', 'forr', 'old', 'fit', 'low', 'first', 'good', 'forr', 'simple', 'innocent', 'remarkable', 'high', 'full', 'first', 'different', 'forr', 'different', 'famous', 'filthy', 'rich', 'full', 'long', 'good', 'whole', 'cinematic', 'forr', 'upsetting', 'forr', 'enough', 'about', 'good', 'brief', 'pregnant', 'forr', 'emotional', 'precious', 'much', 'many', 'many', 'important', 'important', 'sally', 'forr', 'serious', 'american', 'forr', 'successful'];0.264891304347826

978;Chelman666;i found this an entertaining movie to watch, nothing more, nothing less. i have one major reason for being negative about this film: it portrays a man who is able to attain the 'american dream' without any intelligence. however much we can admire him for that, i'm afraid that the message being sent out is that you don't need education or smarts and that everything will come to you as if laid by a golden goose. surely this is not what the movie makers intended but that's the way it came across on me. besides that i must say that tom hanks does an excellent acting job, and for that alone the film is actually worth watching...but not a classic.;4 January 1999;6;['entertaining', 'more', 'less', 'major', 'negative', 'able', 'american', 'afraid', 'golden', 'excellent', 'worth'];0.190530303030303
979;Reviewer;a number of users have mentioned that the shawshank redemption (tsr) should have won the best picture oscar over forrest gump (fg). this type of criticism is unjustified when you realise the various reason why fg actually won the oscars!!! 1) the title forrest gump is a bit misleading as the movie is not really about fg as it first seems for the average viewer, rather it is about us the audience who are supposed to be normal but we act in real life even worse than fg. 2) fg is laughing at us as we laugh at him. we see him as abnormal, but when forrest tries to understand us he finds out that normal people cause so much pain in the world towards other people. this is clearly shown with the short clips of political and social history throughout the movie which the viewing audience in the cinema failed to recognise. this helps to prove fg case against normal people. 3) the movie can be interpreted in so many different ways that every time a viewer watches it they get a different version of what forrest sees and understands and what it means for human nature as a whole. only forrest seems normal in the movie, while others are killing pop stars and important people in society. forrest can't understand why normal people do this, as for me personally i agree with forrest on this issue. 4) while forrest is telling his story of events in his life, many of the viewing audience thought it was literally happening, but because some of the events described are surreal in its feel many people thought the movie was silly. yet it was the viewers who were silly as they see things through forrest's eyes not their own. equally the viewer misses many of the important aspects of the movies' message because they fail to go into forrest's world and explore. misinterpretation that the viewer makes: 1) the running scene though at first seeming stupid is in fact one of the most thought provoking scenes ever in the history of movie making, but the average viewer does not realise this, because he/she cannot think broadly. this scene shows that normal people are stupid to follow people in the media as icons thinking they are clever people because they seem to be doing something special. what forrest shows is that famous people are just as brainy as every else. but we normal people worship politicians in vain and others stars to sort out our world problems. 2) when forrest is speaking at a rally against vietnam, again people in real life follow anybody who has a big mouth without really understanding what they are saying - so profound as well as funny. 3) jenny only realises that forrest is the right person for her when it is too late, you should not judge on appearances, rather the character. the movie also shows how normal people bully others, rape and child abuse children, start wars, use people and discriminate others. forrest does not do any of these things, yet we as the viewer call him abnormal. for me, this is the most innovative movie i have ever seen as it has duped the world to think it is about forrest rather than themselves.;10 March 1999;10;['good', 'forr', 'unjustified', 'various', 'forr', 'misleading', 'average', 'normal', 'real', 'bad', 'abnormal', 'forr', 'normal', 'much', 'other', 'short', 'political', 'social', 'normal', 'many', 'different', 'different', 'forr', 'human', 'forr', 'normal', 'important', 'forr', 'normal', 'forr', 'forr', 'many', 'surreal', 'many', 'silly', 'silly', 'forr', 'own', 'many', 'important', 'forr', 'seeming', 'stupid', 'average', 'normal', 'stupid', 'clever', 'special', 'forr', 'famous', 'brainy', 'normal', 'forr', 'real', 'big', 'profound', 'funny', 'forr', 'right', 'late', 'normal', 'forr', 'abnormal', 'innovative', 'forr'];0.0829558652729384
980;Hörnla;"first, i'd like to say that this movie is formidably made. referring to acting, storyline and the astonishing fx i couldn't do more than repeating things other admirers of fg have already said. it's got all in it: comedy, romance and the fuel a movie needs to work: the ""i wonder how it'll all end!"" that keeps (most of) the audience with this character throughout this quite long film. i can't agree with the points often critizised about fg. and, honestly, i think that the less subtle the critics are, the more hurt is their u.s. patriotism. first, if you wonder if something is realistic here, you should stop watching movies. one good thing about fg is, that it isn't supposed to be realistic, though it almost convinces you that it is, but it is far too overdone to be so. it is meant to be a fable, like benigni's ""la vita e bella"". ""stupid is as stupid does"" is to my mind the key word throughout the movie. forrest gump stumbles through world history (though only the united states are shown, but hollywood usually supposes them to be the world so the movie has to be seen more in general than it's usual critics do) and what he sees makes only sense to a dim-whitted who doesn't let himself get stirred by events: politicians are shot at(though no one elects better ones), leutenants seek death in battle, ""running as fast as the wind"" is regarded as sufficient to get a collegue-degree and somebody who wants to change the world ends up in a terrible mess, having somehow missed the point. so we all do stupid often enough, society does and even america does like the rest of the world. just forrest doesn't.(except towards jenny, but that's a completely different thing, that's love.)he has only an iq of 75 but he is the only one who behaves in a way we would like to expect from everyone (though we surely don't want them to talk like that). he has nothing to base his actions upon than his common sense and that shows us how far we've come apart from our ideal of rational behaviour. in the end one word to those who hated the film for jenny's death of aids which they regarded as punishment,decreed by an reactionary movie: to my mind, jenny's death is not ideology, it's tragedy, though it also conveys the basic idea of the movie. we won't get a better world by revolutions or drugs, we only achieve it if more people would do like forrest, even when they have a higher iq.";2 February 1999;10;['astonishing', 'more', 'other', 'most', 'long', 'subtle', 'realistic', 'good', 'realistic', 'overdone', 'fable', 'stupid', 'stupid', 'key', 'forr', 'more', 'general', 'usual', 'well', 'sufficient', 'terrible', 'stupid', 'forr', 'different', 'only', 'common', 'rational', 'reactionary', 'basic', 'well', 'more', 'high'];-0.0310869565217391

(titanic vs. l.a. confidential another example) then the real winners will win hopefully. 1994 was a great year but the academy got all the main oscars wrong (best actress was natalie portman for leon), what a shame. nevertheless my rating for forrest gump is 8/10;24 September 2000;5;['forr', 'first', 'good', 'good', 'same', 'forr', 'good', 'same', 'many', 'good', 'real', 'great', 'forr', 'wonderful', 'forr', 'great', 'right', 'titanic', 'real', 'great', 'main', 'wrong', 'good', 'forr'];0.5001488095238095

997;joekeb;"zemeckis has a compelling style that involves realism, simpleness, and a multiplicity of thematics. most of the scenes with the closeups are very revealing of his style. he is realistic-he likes to show us reality as it is, to show us the details of the characters' faces in order for us to better comprehend the situation and the themes of the film. he also does not back down from going to many extents in order to make his film correspond to the vision he has for it (e.g the multiple and appropriate uses of cgi, the hunting island location for the vietnam war scenes, even his use of historical footage to bring in deceased characters). for example the scenes in vietnam seemed quite realistic because of the closeups showing the details of the soldiers' faces he used but also thanks to visual effects such as the smoke, the bombing sound effects, and the hunting island location. furthemore, he used closeups in the ping pong scenes to show the focused expression of forrest's face or even the closeup showing his handling of the paddle helped us better evaluate his ping pong prowesses. he also shows his realistic style with his choice of tom hanks as the actor for forrest gump; it indeed was a very realistic performance where we couldn't discern him from the character. lastly, he shows that his style also tends towards simpleness as the film is set up in a relatively simple manner (the story isn't hard to follow and he most often shows us reality as it is) that allows for the reader not to be distracted by things other than the messages in the film and relatively easily grasp them. his goal was to effectively transmit the themes and he chose an effective style to do so. i appreciated many aspects of this film. about the way the film was structured, the film combined two elements that pertain to how the film unfolds: for the most part we just saw forest's life, without a specific guiding plot, we just saw how he lived his life and took away the most we could from it, and in the end the director ties these flashbacks to the present, giving us a rather new plot line at the end of the film which i found to be quite creative and whole. then, i absolutely love the first scene, where he starts talking to a stranger, let alone narrates his whole life with no hesitation. we're taught courage from the very first scene, and throughout the film we see that we can learn a lot from less gifted people. the film is riddled with valuable life lessons that we can all learn from, ones that i truly cherished, agree with, and that i will now keep very close to my heart, more than ever. the man had all the wealth in the world yet he was cutting grass for free. all that wealth didn't seem to change the way he lived his life-something that i admire. forrest had a full life yet he always addressed it simply, which is the reason he was truly happy. he ran for three years because he felt like it? what an inspiration. what you take from this is that everyone should do whatever they enjoy doing just because they can, just because that's the way it should be. then, going back to lieutenant dan at forrest gump's wedding, i tend to think of one of forrest gump's sayings ""shit happens"" when i see the lieutenant's face when he meets with forrest. it happens, and that's fine, because it's part of the process and we can still all turn out more than fine anyway just like the lieutenant did. life is like a feather, and we should enjoy the flow it takes us on.";15 December 2021;10;['compelling', 'most', 'revealing', 'realistic', 'many', 'multiple', 'appropriate', 'historical', 'deceased', 'realistic', 'visual', 'such', 'focused', 'forr', 'realistic', 'forr', 'realistic', 'simple', 'hard', 'other', 'effective', 'many', 'most', 'specific', 'most', 'new', 'creative', 'whole', 'first', 'whole', 'first', 'less', 'gifted', 'valuable', 'close', 'more', 'free', 'forr', 'full', 'happy', 'forr', 'forr', 'forr', 'fine', 'more', 'fine'];0.2686580086580086

1064;Jarv1;"i loathe and despise this film on so many different levels. firstly, how did tom hanks win an oscar for speaking very slowly. i have never seen such a collective display of acting incompetence be so highly lauded. secondly, the central message of this film is (spoilers) america is better than everywhere else in the world. don't get me wrong, i like america. i love americans, i waste massive amounts of my time and money on movies, music, and books produced in america- but this bloody movie is a typical of why so many people now seem to be anti-us. if you look at the lengths the ""good"" characters go to conform to society's ideal- his mother having sex with the principal, for example- they will behave in an immoral fashion to further their own lives within the american ideal. furthermore, just in case this subtle point flew over the heads of the audience, the sole character to attempt to break from this conformity is killed with aids. thirdly, i know it is a movie, a work of fiction etc, so there must be some suspension of disbelief, but this simply goes to far. how does a mentally handicapped kid from a redneck backwater manage to meet a significant amount of noteworthy 20th century figures, and be present at so many of the last centuries significant events? also, why does no-one tell him where to go when he is waffling on at the bus stop? next up- no-one ever seems to comment on this, but this film is boring. it is a string of randomly connected events, some of which are so tedious that when i first saw it i literally felt my brain melting. for example (spoiler) when he goes running for god knows how long for no apparent reason- then stops again for no apparent reason. the sheer pointlessness of this section made me want to cry out of frustration. this film is 2 hours and 20 minutes long- not an epic by any stretch of the imagination, but at least half an hour over time. the running section could easily (for example) have ended up on the cutting room floor without detracting from the movie in any way. this is actually typical of so much of the movie- (spoilers) elvis does not add anything to the plot (except irritation), the table tennis scenes, the section with the prostitutes in new york, i could go on and on but frankly cannot be bothered. the basic storyline, as reliant as it is on suspension of disbelief etc, is essentially quite simple. (spoiler)retarded boy from red neck backwater attends several famous events and through god's good graces and america's providence has a fabulously successful life, whilst losing the only woman he ever loved, and making some life-long friends. easy, biographical story, not without a heartwarming premise. instead we have a bloated, appalling, falsely moralistic, repugnant propaganda sequence constructed from a series of irritating set pieces and laden with pseudo-meaningful interludes. why was it not made as a simple fictional biopic? finally, i am not pro-feminist at all, but this movie made my stomach turn in it's treatment of the female characters. all the women of the movie are morally loose- whether it is his mother, love of his life (the only two complete female characters anyway), or any of the minor characters (two hookers leaps to mind), they all display a worrying lack of morals. overall this movie is 140 minutes of my life that i want back. i feel violated for having seen this saccharine wrapped pile of excrement- i think i have given enough reasons for why it is the worst movie of all time without even going into it's wallowing in sentimentality, or dismal direction, or even looking at the waste of fine actors (sally field, gary sinese etc). that tom hanks won his second oscar for this overrated pile of garbage shows what an absolute travesty the academy voting system is.";25 February 2004;1;['many', 'different', 'collective', 'central', 'well', 'wrong', 'massive', 'bloody', 'typical', 'many', 'anti', 'good', 'immoral', 'own', 'american', 'subtle', 'sole', 'handicapped', 'significant', 'noteworthy', 'present', 'many', 'last', 'significant', 'boring', 'randomly', 'tedious', 'apparent', 'apparent', 'sheer', 'least', 'typical', 'much', 'basic', 'reliant', 'simple', 'red', 'several', 'famous', 'good', 'successful', 'only', 'long', 'easy', 'biographical', 'bloated', 'appalling', 'moralistic', 'repugnant', 'pseudo', 'meaningful', 'simple', 'fictional', 'pro', 'feminist', 'female', 'only', 'complete', 'female', 'minor', 'worrying', 'enough', 'bad', 'dismal', 'fine', 'second', 'overrated', 'absolute'];0.0476190476190476

1126;Adargi;forrest gump is a movie heart-breaker of oddball wit and startling grace. there's talk of another oscar for tom hanks, who is unforgettable as the sweet-natured, shabbily treated simpleton of the title. the academy is a sucker for honoring afflicted heroes. in hollywood, it's always raining rain men. credit hanks for not overplaying his hand. he brings a touching gravity to the role of an idiot savant from the south who finds strength in god, country, his childhood pal, jenny (robin wright), and his good mama (sally field). when forrest falls a few iq points shy of minimal school requirements, mama knows who to sleep with to bend the rules. her son has a gift. as forrest makes his pilgrim's progress from the '50s to the '80s, he becomes a college football star, a vietnam war hero, a shrimp tycoon and even a father. taking a cue from zelig, director robert zemeckis places forrest in a vivid historical context he talks with jfk, lbj and nixon, among other luminaries. the effects dazzle, though never at the expense of the story. winston groom, who wrote the 1986 novel, saw forrest as a modern candide, an optimist in the face of strong opposing evidence. but groom is no voltaire, and neither is screenwriter eric roth (mr. jones, memories of me), who blunts his satire with choking sentiment. it's hanks who brings humor and unforced humanity to the literary conceit of forrest, though the slim actor scarcely resembles the 6-foot-6-inch, 240-pound bruiser of the book. in a college dorm with jenny, who lets him touch her breast, the virginal forrest ejaculates instantly, losing her interest and his self-respect. in the army, forrest saves his captain (gary sinise), whose legs are later amputated, and the captain resents him. forrest is everything we admire in the american character honest, brave, loyal and the film's fierce irony is that nobody can stay around him for long. zemeckis doesn't fall into the trap of using forrest as an ad for arrested development. he knows the limits of a holy fool who can't understand the hypocrisy of postwar america that this picaresque epic so powerfully reveals. the peace-love pretensions of the '60s are skewered as neatly as the greed decades that follow. but there is something of forrest that zemeckis would like to see rub off on us: his capacity for hope. it's an ambitious goal in this age of rampant cynicism. godspeed.;6 November 2015;10;['forr', 'startling', 'unforgettable', 'sweet', 'natured', 'afflicted', 'touching', 'childhood', 'good', 'forr', 'few', 'shy', 'minimal', 'forr', 'forr', 'vivid', 'historical', 'other', 'forr', 'modern', 'strong', 'unforced', 'literary', 'forr', 'slim', 'virginal', 'forr', 'forr', 'forr', 'brave', 'loyal', 'fierce', 'forr', 'holy', 'postwar', 'epic', 'forr', 'ambitious', 'rampant'];0.1814814814814814

1135;jbirls21;tom hanks, hands down, gives one of the best performances by any actor. ever. forrest gump is such a compelling, historically based, dramatic and even light hearted film that i believe is the greatest film of all time. gary sinise, or lt. dan, definitely should have won for best supporting actor. he plays a man with no legs for more than half of the movie and he is such a harrowing character at large. moreover, forrest gump, undoubtedly, has some of the best lines in movie history (run forrest run, life is like a box of chocolates, etc), but the morality behind the film is incredible. forrest gump, when he runs across the country for literally no reason, is such an inspirational moment in the film. what i enjoy most about forrest gump is that he unwittingly gets caught up in some of the most key moments in the 20th century. watergate, kennedy, civil rights, vietnam, alabama football - he's there. and because forrest is such a simple man, these scenes are that much more captivating. an absolute 10/10, forrest gump, driven by the once-in-a-lifetime performance by tom hanks, followed by a forceful performance by gary sinise, is the greatest film in history in my opinion. if you haven't watched it, you are missing out big time. myself, it is one of those few movies that never gets old. fantastic every time.;11 May 2014;10;['good', 'forr', 'compelling', 'dramatic', 'hearted', 'great', 'good', 'more', 'harrowing', 'large', 'forr', 'good', 'forr', 'incredible', 'forr', 'inspirational', 'forr', 'key', 'civil', 'forr', 'simple', 'captivating', 'absolute', 'forr', 'forceful', 'great', 'big', 'few', 'old', 'fantastic'];0.3516290726817043

(and yes, they voted for reagan), and they are the two most conservative, boring people i know. so i'm not naive enough to believe that everyone who sailed through those times on the coat-tails of jesus himself emerges wealthy...being naive and stupid does not result in wealth. however, speaking of jesus, he does say, ""the meek shall inherit the earth"" and to have ""faith like a child"". and those are the two themes that i personally believe are being conveyed throughout the movie. lt dan's injuries and consequential behavior had nothing to do with his political views..it had to do with him being unappreciative that his life was saved!! instead of being thankful for having more days on earth, he was cynical and jaded and almost drowned in his own self-pity...forgive me if i don't see a connection to his political affiliation there. so i'm confused by the critics who try to over-politicize this ""feel good"" movie and make it more than it is.. this is a simple statement on mankind and the pleasure of living the good in life. tom hanks has a stellar performance, and i can watch this film over and over and over, as it is truly my favorite.";28 January 2007;10;['sure', 'shocking', 'disturbing', 'tight', 'political', 'few', 'pure', 'forr', 'many', 'special', 'close', 'different', 'popular', 'wrong', 'good', 'evil', 'forr', 'tough', 'same', 'forr', 'real', 'same', 'conservative', 'boring', 'naive', 'wealthy', 'naive', 'stupid', 'consequential', 'political', 'unappreciative', 'thankful', 'more', 'cynical', 'jaded', 'own', 'political', 'good', 'more', 'simple', 'stellar'];-0.0272913466461853
1180;Dashhhka;please understand that despite my summary, i did enjoy this clever film. there was a lot to like. however, little of the film seemed oscar-worthy and it probably should not be in the imdb top 250. i think this is a great case of a very good film that has been prematurely elevated to greatness. as far as the plot goes, with zillions of reviews on imdb for this film, i won't even bother. the acting was very good, the special effects ranged from freakin' amazing (such as digitally removing lt. dan's leg--quite an achievement for 1994) to very, very poor (inexplicably, despite forrest being expertly inserted in many scenes, the one with john lennon was very sloppy and the seams were very, very obvious on the big screen). the negatives included a few problems with continuity (such as the happy face being supposedly invented by gump in the late 70s--it had been around for nearly a decade already) and perhaps too much emphasis on episodes as opposed to story. still, it's a very enjoyable film and one you can't help but like. but winning 6 oscars?! it must have been a very, very slow year.;19 January 2022;4;['clever', 'little', 'worthy', 'great', 'good', 'good', 'special', 'amazing', 'such', 'poor', 'forr', 'many', 'sloppy', 'obvious', 'big', 'few', 'such', 'happy', 'late', 'much', 'enjoyable', 'slow'];0.1826488095238095
1181;arosdara;tom hanks played a controversial character. after all, it is believed that if an actor plays the role of a man with 'problems with his head', then you can then wait a long time for a new role, as if he were a leper. forest is a person who is poorly oriented in social life, or rather does not react to its signals in any way, is extremely focused on details and this is his advantage. forest has a lot to learn. i would recommend watching this film to teenagers as well, as a preventive measure in relationships with people who are not like you. very sobering. the era of the 60s is shown in detail, and at the same time the life of not the most popular social stratum, hippies, vietnam veterans and the political situation in the united states itself. on the one hand, this is the pursuit of the american dream, and on the other hand, it is a subtle first-person narrative, with a lot of drama within the plot. there are many sad moments that set you up for philosophical reflection. in general, this picture can be offered for general development in order to increase the level of empathy for others. strongly touched by the character of lieutenant dan, here is another story, within a story. the love line is generally the highest that i have seen. and of course, the theme of forgiveness, it runs like a through line through the whole picture. music, script, acting and strong emotions - that's what i especially liked. recommend.;19 January 2022;10;['controversial', 'long', 'new', 'social', 'focused', 'preventive', 'same', 'popular', 'social', 'political', 'other', 'subtle', 'first', 'many', 'sad', 'philosophical', 'general', 'general', 'high', 'through', 'whole', 'strong'];0.1046331738437001

1208;ynesh_91;forrest gump happens to be a film that took off, up and away very easily, and it's not hard to see why. as much as it was a very good effort, you can't help but to feel the whole idea is slightly over hyped. the best elements of forrest gump is 2 things. firstly, the excellent performances by the actors. tom hanks and the rest of the cast were brilliant. secondly, the many representation of historical facts weaved into the plot. that being said, it's somewhat understandable, albeit contradictory, why this movie is being rated so highly among viewers. it's nice to watch a movie every once in a while, where everything falls into place perfectly, and no one really wants to question the sheer oddity of it all. forrest gump is a good example of that. the good performance by tom hanks alone undoubtedly is enough for the many to drench this movie in praise. the problem for me then becomes this. knowing this movie is definitely at least a good movie, what's stopping it from becoming great? i think it falls short of giving us the ultimate sense of profoundness and awe by the end. it does, though, but not as profound as other movies from that decade, say the green mile (making this comparison since many claim gump to be one of the best movies out there, it's only fitting to compare it to another heavyweight, nothing to do with tom hanks being in both). i also feel gump, at times within the movie, has moments of drop and stagnation within the plot. it doesn't continually escalate with time. usually in movies it's not a problem, or sometimes necessary, but in gump, these lapses of stagnation can seem almost endless and perhaps a tad bit overused. i will give this movie credit for the acting and for the way it captures the counter-cultures, lifestyles and many nuances of the up and coming usa. it does a good job pacing us through these many historical elements, and has its moments leaving the audience at awe. but i remained convinced a silent minority out there share my opinion on how this movie, despite being a very good effort, isn't as awesome as everyone makes it to be. it could be one of the best movies of the decade, but definitely not the best. 7.7 on my scales. a very good effort. nothing more.;6 October 2012;8;['forr', 'hard', 'good', 'whole', 'good', 'forr', 'excellent', 'brilliant', 'many', 'historical', 'understandable', 'contradictory', 'nice', 'sheer', 'forr', 'good', 'good', 'alone', 'enough', 'many', 'least', 'good', 'great', 'ultimate', 'profound', 'other', 'green', 'many', 'good', 'fitting', 'necessary', 'endless', 'overused', 'many', 'good', 'many', 'historical', 'convinced', 'silent', 'good', 'awesome', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'more'];0.3984234234234233

1215;vaniharish-54223;forrest gump had been one among the most anticipated movies on my watchlist for quite a while. for some reason i kept postponing the event of finally watching it, until one day, i had an unusual instinct to get it done with and after watching the light white feather from the intro scene fly away after two hours and twenty two minutes of constant amusement, i must say that i regret not having watched this movie earlier. it might be very unfair if i don't mention the sublime and magnificent performance of tom hanks. as always, he has done justice to the role of forrest gump too. excellent delineation of the characters coupled with the unique plot of the movie contribute towards the unparalleled success of the same. the perfect pace of narration of the story in retrospect by the protagonist and the way each character has lived to adhere to their inherent traits and acquired mutations, leave us with a vehemently relishing movie experience, which most of us might have been deprived of, for quite a while. although i was a couple of decades late in enjoying the film, i don't think that it had any major impact on how much juice i could get out of the fruit. the movie has the potential to converge your attention right from the beginning to the very last scene. it emphasizes on the relationship of the protagonist between his mother, his beloved childhood sweetheart and his peers and help us decipher the differences in the perception of life and its events from person to person. we are given a chance to take a roller coaster which gives us an insight to the innocent and innocuous nature of forrest, his love for the ones who love him and his views of the societal norms. given the adorable traits of the protagonist, it is almost impossible and certainly improbable for us to not sympathize with our hero on many instances or to not desire to have such a virtuous friend like him. although he is not remarkably smart or sharp, his benign and innocuous nature compensates for the former. to conclude, i'd like to say that forrest gump would be a strong recommendation especially for those who feel deranged or derailed in life. the way forrest strives to catch a break every time, guarantees to inspire the audience too and gives them a sense of hope, indirectly spreading the message to not give up and have faith in the ones who care for you and above all, in yourself. with all this in consideration, it'll be unfair not to give the movie the rating it deserves.;20 February 2019;9;['forr', 'unusual', 'light', 'white', 'constant', 'unfair', 'sublime', 'magnificent', 'forr', 'excellent', 'unique', 'unparalleled', 'same', 'perfect', 'inherent', 'most', 'major', 'much', 'last', 'beloved', 'innocent', 'innocuous', 'forr', 'societal', 'adorable', 'impossible', 'improbable', 'many', 'virtuous', 'smart', 'sharp', 'benign', 'innocuous', 'former', 'forr', 'strong', 'forr', 'unfair'];0.2431935817805383

1269;celebes2;i can't believe the vitriol hurled at this movie. i have seen this movie a number of time since it was released, and it never fails to move me and make me laugh. and by the way i am a liberal, ivy-league educated guy who went to college in the 60's, protested the war (and still thinks it was one of the biggest mistakes in american history) and has never voted republican in his life. and i never thought of this film as a secret right-wing propaganda movie until i read the reviews here. in fact, it pretty accurately depicts some of the characters during that time. for example, the abusive, self-important boyfriend of jenny's during the march on washington was all too common (and someone who jenny, as an abused child, would have been drawn to, unfortunately). some guys who were against (or just avoiding the war) apparently needed to prove their manhood. hence the sds-a lot of those guys were real dicks- i know, i was there. these characters are individuals- not symbols. as for forrest, he goes to nam, yes, but he is color blind, unlike everyone else depicted in the movie (black and white) and stands up for a battered woman. those seem like pretty liberal virtues to me. his great qualities are his loyalty and non-judgmental and loving nature, which are independent of his iq. there were plenty of very stupid people of forrest's generation who behaved very differently toward blacks and women. jenny's father is a perfect example. so maybe its an american cultural or generational thing, because i notice a lot of the film's bashers are from europe. lighten up. its a fantasy, a comedy and yes, has a large dose of nostalgia for the music of the sixties and seventies.;24 January 2010;9;['liberal', 'big', 'american', 'republican', 'secret', 'right', 'abusive', 'important', 'common', 'abused', 'real', 'forr', 'blind', 'black', 'white', 'battered', 'liberal', 'great', 'non', 'judgmental', 'loving', 'independent', 'stupid', 'forr', 'perfect', 'american', 'cultural', 'generational', 'large'];0.0796296296296296

1282;dotwatts-543-201073;"*****warning: this review may contain spoilers**** adapted from the novel of the same name by winston groom, ""forrest gump"" is unlike any movie i've ever seen. for the duration of its two-hour run, it enchants and moves, amazes and inspires, seamlessly blending comedy and drama, history and fantasy, threading its spellbinding yarn against the backdrop of some of the defining events in modern american history. ""forrest gump"" is about forrest gump, an everyman from alabama. while forrest is none too bright, he can run like the wind, which secures him a scholarship to the university of alabama. as the film continues, he becomes a footballer, a soldier, a ping-pong champion, a folk hero and a multi-millionaire. he meets elvis presley and jfk; exposes the watergate scandal; saves lives in the vietnam war; runs across the united states; becomes a household name as a highly successful shrimping boat captain; makes the cover of forbes magazine; and inspires john lennon's iconic record ""imagine."" and yet, in spite of all these events, the defining moments in forrest's life are those he shares with jenny, his childhood sweetheart, who flits in and out of his life as she goes on a downward spiral trying to come to terms with being a survival of physical and sexual abuse by her father when she was a child. it is from these tender and real moments between forrest and jenny that the film finds it emotional core. their relationship develops over the years and ultimately leads to them marrying and having a son together. but even then, jenny's traumatic past comes back to haunt her, as the years of self-destructive behaviour that it triggered led to her becoming ill with an unknown virus (possibly hiv/aids) that tragically claims her life towards the end of the movie. ""forrest gump"" is very much a take it or leave it film. it could be viewed as one-dimensional, optimist bilge, about an idiot meandering aimlessly through life, merely getting lucky. reading between the lines, though, you find a masterpiece, careening between sadness and joy, pain and triumph. robert zemeckis' direction is almost flawless; he renders ""forrest gump"" with aesthetic quality and flair. it includes soundtrack with contributions from various american artists and, of course, alan silvestri, who composes a beautiful piano suite that is magical in itself. recognising technical and writing merit, the standard of acting in ""forrest gump"" is high as to be almost off the scale. tom hanks's performance as forrest gump accrued oscar, golden globe and sag awards that he wholly deserved; he plays forrest's naivety and vulnerability well and his monologue at jenny's grave was a tearjerker. robin wright's portrayal of jenny - a woman crying out for help - was tender and real and gary sinise, playing forrest's commanding officer in the army, lt. dan taylor, who loses his legs after being wounded in combat, is superb, flawlessly capturing lt. dan's wrath, melancholy and despair and later his redemption and joy. there is no way to define ""forrest gump"" as a movie. it can only be defined as art.";11 December 2012;9;['same', 'forr', 'defining', 'modern', 'american', 'forr', 'forr', 'forr', 'bright', 'multi', 'successful', 'iconic', 'defining', 'childhood', 'downward', 'physical', 'sexual', 'real', 'forr', 'emotional', 'traumatic', 'destructive', 'ill', 'unknown', 'forr', 'dimensional', 'optimist', 'lucky', 'flawless', 'forr', 'aesthetic', 'various', 'american', 'beautiful', 'magical', 'technical', 'forr', 'high', 'forr', 'golden', 'sag', 'forr', 'tender', 'real', 'gary', 'forr', 'superb', 'melancholy', 'forr'];0.2497222222222222

1291;sergeantpinback80;"other than the acting of tom hanks, the acting of the co-stars, and the set pieces, this movie is just not worth the hype, and i really hate myself for saying that. tom hanks plays forrest gump, who one day is sitting at a park bench waiting for a bus when he begins telling his life story to a woman sitting next to him. over the course of a few hours he continues telling his story while different people come and go until his story catches up to the moment where he began sitting at the bus stop. his story involves many different points in his life where he unwittingly becomes involved during several historical events during the 60's and 70's, meets a number celebrities and presidents, influences other people and has a significant impact on society. all while this is going on his one true love jenny continues to elude him while she lives a traumatic life on the edge from drugs, abuse, and near suicide. now here is my problem with this movie...forrest gump's life is one big fantasy, a story so outrageous that the movie comes off as more of a comedy than a sappy drama. for one thing the movie is supposed to be about going where the wind takes you, living your life a day at a time, blah blah blah, and yet people seem to forget none of forrest gump's life would have happened the way it did had his mother not had sex with the school administrator. if that had not happened he would not have been on that bus, he wouldn't have met jenny, she wouldn't have inspired him to run, and the rest of his life would have been far different. second, it always amazes me how much success forrest had with everything he did in life. he doesn't just go to college then to vietnam, he goes to college and becomes a football star, he goes to vietnam and becomes a war hero, he goes into the shrimping business and becomes a millionaire, he learns to play ping-ping and becomes an international ping-ping champion. i mean the way things turned out for him he could put his name on the ballot today, and be president of the united states tomorrow. if thats the kind of life you get when the wind blows then i need to go look for a breeze. third, all logic in this movie is completely thrown out the window. for instance, during the running across america story, i still laugh at all the people who just quit their daily lives and started running with a complete stranger. did they just feel it was okay to leave their family and jobs behind? how did they support themselves? how did they eat? where did they sleep? how did they clean themselves? where did they get clothing to wear when the seasons changed? fourth, in terms of his low i.q. are we really sure that was even his problem. i mean other than a couple of areas where he tended to stare off into space i never saw any evidence that he was the idiot he was made out to be. honestly it looked like he was just born with a lack of common sense. i mean he sure as hell doesn't have a problem assembling a rifle together, he takes orders from the military quite well, he can operate a shrimping boat like a champ and playing ping-pong was like riding a bike. for a guy who was supposedly that stupid he seemed to all the things he did far better than the average guy. fifth, he tells his life story to several different people and even after he claims to have done all these fantastic things and become an international celebrity....why do none of the people listening to the story recognize him?!? i'd like to think if i was talking to a guy who was a football star/war hero/business mogul/celebrity at some point i would be going ""hey wait you're that forrest gump guy!"" all in all the movie had a great concept but the story wasn't thought out in the best way. by the way folks, i don't care if you are the fastest runner in the world, you cannot outrun a napalm strike!!!";21 January 2014;2;['other', 'worth', 'forr', 'few', 'different', 'many', 'different', 'several', 'historical', 'other', 'significant', 'true', 'traumatic', 'forr', 'big', 'outrageous', 'more', 'sappy', 'forr', 'different', 'much', 'forr', 'international', 'third', 'daily', 'complete', 'okay', 'low', 'sure', 'other', 'common', 'sure', 'stupid', 'average', 'several', 'different', 'fantastic', 'international', 'forr', 'great', 'good', 'fast', 'napalm'];0.0885714285714285

1293;jacobhunt6;forrest gump is the defining motion picture of the latter half of the 20th century, in so many ways. it is a heart-warming, heartbreaking and beautifully constructed film that takes its audience on an emotional journey that will change hearts, minds and perspectives. the performance of tom hanks is utterly astounding. hanks truly is what made this film a class above, and this is a sterling performance that stands out even in such an accomplished career. he brings heart, sincerity and empathy to a role that immediately captures the love and respect of the audience and leaves them in tears at the beauty and tragedy of forrest's experiences. the story itself is a genius concept executed to perfection. it is an exploration of the last fifty years of the 20th century through the eyes of a literal everyman. the innocent, unassuming perspective of forrest gump allows the audience to reflect on some of the highest and lowest points in america's history through a fresh set of eyes, seeing history from the point of view of someone without the prejudices and biases that come with educated thought and opinion. forrest's mental handicap was necessary to create such a powerful everyman character, and yet hanks manages to execute this without resorting to comical stupidity and dampening the credibility of the film's sincerity. to emphasise the perfection of this film's writing even further, it is an exemplification of circular narrative, with incredible use of music and a variety of film types, camera angles and colour palettes to cover the roughly fifty-year period within its narrative reaches. robert zemeckis and his production team simply do everything right. this is a beautiful tale of love and hate, war and peace, comedy and tragedy that will be talked about for decades, and rightfully so. it is a testament to the writing of winston groom, and of course the directing of zemeckis. hanks' performance is backed up by a supporting cast that executes their respective jobs perfectly, with special mention for mykelti williamson and gary sinise. bubba and lieutenant dan are iconic characters that reflect tumultuous periods of american history, and their interactions with forrest are beautifully executed to a tee. forrest gump is unique in so many aspects. it is a wonderful exploration of the world through a fresh set of eyes, which is a concept so frequently attempted and so rarely achieved to such an impact as this. the world often needs to reflect on itself without its own prejudices, and there is no better film than forrest gump to show us all the state of affairs that we live in. this film should rightfully go down in history as one of the greats, and hanks' performance should be hailed as perhaps the greatest leading performance in cinema. he captured our hearts from the moment that feather settled on his shoe and kept them neatly tucked in his suitcase until that feather drifted away yet again. beautiful filmmaking at its finest.;26 April 2019;10;['forr', 'defining', 'latter', 'many', 'heartbreaking', 'emotional', 'astounding', 'sterling', 'accomplished', 'forr', 'last', 'literal', 'innocent', 'unassuming', 'forr', 'high', 'low', 'fresh', 'forr', 'mental', 'necessary', 'powerful', 'comical', 'circular', 'incredible', 'narrative', 'right', 'beautiful', 'respective', 'special', 'iconic', 'tumultuous', 'american', 'forr', 'forr', 'unique', 'many', 'wonderful', 'fresh', 'own', 'well', 'forr', 'great', 'beautiful', 'fine'];0.3687766830870279

1296;spacelime;"forrest gump is the kind of film that shouldn't work on any level. it's as manipulative as a film can ever be, pulling strings and begging the audience to cry, and the entire event is drowned in sticky-sweet syrup. and yet - incredibly - forrest gump truly works. it is not without flaw - in fact, it would be nearly impossible to count down all of its many problems - but this film succeeds in being an entertaining, whimsical, and - at times - quite beautiful portrayal of life, love, and 20th century america. and while one would be quick to point to director robert zemeckis in regards to the film's success, or perhaps eric roth's screenplay, or even winston groom's book upon which the film is based, i think the reason this film works, is because of tom hank's legendary performance as the title character. forrest gump is a slow-witted alabama native. but indeed, he has extraordinary talent, and an intriguing life story to tell to whoever will sit next to him at the bus-stop. despite being embraced by - seemingly - everyone, forrest gump actually fared less well than critics. it holds a 72% on rotten tomatoes, which is a good score, but not a great one. this is largely because forrest gump will not appeal to the cynical. and lord knows that film critics get enough hate as it is, but there's simply no two ways about it: film critics, generally speaking, are more cynical than the average movie-goer. those willing to accept the occasionally preposterous nature of the film and the sometimes cloying sentimental tone will find a lot to enjoy. but if you've never quite cottoned to the sappier efforts of steven spielberg or renaissance disney, you may find forrest gump to be an eternal 142 minutes. one of the problems with forrest gump is that the film goes to exceedingly great lengths to make forrest as endearing and likable as possible. and honestly, it wasn't necessary; he's already a likable character. additionally, forrest gump just seems to be an expert at everything. when we learn he's an incredibly fast runner, we buy that. but after we learn he's incredible at putting guns together, playing ping-pong, etc., things get a little stale. on top of that, forrest gump also has a running gag in which forrest turns out to be the originator of several pop culture staples, from one of elvis presley's dance moves, to the creator of the ""smiley"" face, etc. forrest gump spends so much time winking at the audience, one begins to ponder the likelihood of contracting an eye-lid blister. in spite of the film's many problems, however, forrest gump is a good film, largely thanks to tom hanks. his performance adds an element of genuineness and sincerity to the picture, thus balancing the syrupy sap. on paper, the forrest gump character comes off as cloying, but when you see tom hanks portray this character, it not only works, it comes to life. this is not a case of a great performance making a decent film worth seeing. this is a great performance that elevates everything surrounding it. it gives the movie a classy nature that makes the sentiment feel earned. there are genuine moments of beauty and grace. in fact, some sequences are almost stunningly beautiful. when the film eases back a little on the sweetness, it has an old-fashioned appeal to it, and an unmistakable charm in the aesthetics of the picture. the visual effects are superb. forrest gump seamlessly blends with the archival footage in an effect that still holds up today. even more impressive - to my eyes, anyway - is the effect used for a character who has lost his legs in the war, and must function without them. i've already praised hanks' performance, but the rest of the cast is worth noting too. robin wright plays forrest's love interest, jenny, in a more serious role. she captures the depth of the character, and is never as annoying as she might have been in less capable hands. gary sinise as dan taylor delivers a performance that's absolutely marvelous, and even giving hanks a bit of a run for his money. sinise's performance is powerful and gripping. sally fields portrays the most charming of the cast, forrest's mother, in a sweet but memorable supporting role. michael conner humphreys and hanna r. hall portray young forrest and young jenny respectively in excellent child performances. alan silvestri's score is very pretty, but it receives an absurdly little amount of screen time. it gets two major appearances (other than the credits), and that is the very beginning, and the very end. you hardly hear it at all the rest of the film, which is largely populated with obnoxious, time-period- accurate, pop and rock songs. while they are interesting from a stylistic point of view, they are simply atrocious from a musical one. they end up stealing a lot of screen time that would have been better served by silvestri's much more palatable musical score. forrest gump is heavily flawed, but it has some wonderful moments. tom hanks gives the performance of his life, and despite too much sweetness at times, the film is a real charmer. the acting is great, the screenplay is great, the score is great, and the characters are great. the over- sentimentality brings the film down a bit at times, but it's hard to imagine that too many people would leave forrest gump without feeling at least a little better about life.";21 October 2014;10;['forr', 'manipulative', 'entire', 'sticky', 'sweet', 'forr', 'impossible', 'many', 'entertaining', 'whimsical', 'beautiful', 'quick', 'legendary', 'forr', 'extraordinary', 'intriguing', 'forr', 'rotten', 'good', 'great', 'forr', 'cynical', 'enough', 'cynical', 'average', 'willing', 'preposterous', 'sentimental', 'forr', 'eternal', 'forr', 'great', 'forr', 'endearing', 'likable', 'possible', 'necessary', 'likable', 'forr', 'fast', 'incredible', 'little', 'stale', 'forr', 'forr', 'several', 'smiley', 'forr', 'much', 'many', 'forr', 'good', 'forr', 'great', 'decent', 'worth', 'great', 'classy', 'genuine', 'beautiful', 'little', 'old', 'fashioned', 'unmistakable', 'visual', 'superb', 'forr', 'impressive', 'worth', 'forr', 'serious', 'annoying', 'capable', 'marvelous', 'powerful', 'gripping', 'charming', 'sweet', 'memorable', 'young', 'forr', 'young', 'excellent', 'pretty', 'little', 'major', 'other', 'very', 'obnoxious', 'accurate', 'interesting', 'stylistic', 'atrocious', 'musical', 'palatable', 'musical', 'forr', 'wonderful', 'much', 'real', 'great', 'great', 'great', 'great', 'hard', 'many', 'forr', 'least', 'little', 'well'];0.2740679824561403

1310;sohum_s;forrest gump is a classic movie and one of my favorite movies of all time. the movie shows the life of forrest gump through a variety of lenses and each time it carries a simple, yet profound message. it feels like a never-ending journey through life but becoming increasingly more interesting through each new phase. this is a movie which will make you feel good about humanity and maybe make you into a better person. tom hanks delivers an exceptional performance as forrest gump. there is excellent character development shown. i think the best part of his character is that despite the various obstacles he faces, his good heart and mindset always lets him continuously improve his life. his sincerity and simplicity is touching and allows the viewer to connect on every level with forrest gump. i also appreciate this film for being able to weave the life of an individual with the historical and social background of the relevant time periods. there are some explicit historical scenes, such as the vietnam war scenes, and they are filmed well. the social class subtleties embedded in such scenes are interesting as well. i am sure if i watch this film another time, i will notice even more noteworthy details pertaining to social issues. this film avoids the dilemma of not being historically accurate because it does not have to be - forrest gump creates the history himself.;24 March 2017;10;['forr', 'classic', 'favorite', 'forr', 'simple', 'profound', 'interesting', 'new', 'good', 'well', 'exceptional', 'forr', 'excellent', 'good', 'various', 'good', 'forr', 'able', 'historical', 'social', 'relevant', 'explicit', 'historical', 'such', 'social', 'such', 'interesting', 'sure', 'noteworthy', 'social', 'accurate', 'forr'];0.3147095959595959

1316;katiecaswell;forrest gump (1994), in my opinion, is one of the greatest films of all time. it is full of really great characters, many memorable lines and teaches an important message. tom hanks who played forrest, a loveable, simple, yet not so intelligent man, delivered a great performance as per usual. forrest shows a new outlook and meaning of life and how we should live in the moment as we follow the many adventures throughout his life. director, robert zemeckis' fun and impressive special effect skills can also be seen throughout the film, but especially when forrest is interacting with many historical figures such as john f. kennedy, richard nixon, and john lennon. while forrest didn't actually encounter these people, cgi was used to insert him into old clips of these historical figures and their mouths were adjusted to look like they were saying something else. it's something that made the movie so much more captivating and realistic. forrest's simple and innocent personality makes it much more enjoyable as he seems to just stumble into all the major historical events during that time. overall, the film balances drama, comedy, and romance very well, and i would highly recommend seeing it.;22 May 2018;10;['forr', 'great', 'full', 'great', 'many', 'memorable', 'important', 'loveable', 'simple', 'intelligent', 'great', 'usual', 'forr', 'new', 'many', 'impressive', 'special', 'forr', 'many', 'historical', 'such', 'forr', 'old', 'historical', 'captivating', 'realistic', 'forr', 'simple', 'innocent', 'enjoyable', 'major', 'historical'];0.3470258907758907

1377;andreysus-28290;"robert zemeckis' film, an all-american phenomenon of 1994, not only became the highest-grossing at that time (collections in the usa alone exceeded the budget by 6 times) and was awarded six oscars, including the main one (""forrest gump"" beat such a rival as ""pulp fiction""). but even now it is on the 22nd place among the most popular films at the american box office in history, and was also named 76th in a survey by the american film institute in 2007 regarding the best films of all time. interestingly, the advertising campaign during the release of ""forrest gump"" was conducted in such a way that the impression was created: the director of three episodes of the fantastic super-spectacular picture ""back to the future"", again shot something unusual, extravagant, connected with time travel. the title character, a native of the southern (and in the understanding of many - obviously patriarchal and conservative) state of alabama, really wanders all over america in the 50-80s, being, one way or another, an eyewitness to historical events in the life of the nation, literally getting into newsreel footage that captured famous political figures of the era from john kennedy to ronald reagan and popular singers from elvis presley to john lennon. just these virtuoso moments in technical execution (the authors of visual effects, led by ken ralston, of course, received an oscar) were spinning on tv, giving rise to the illusion that forrest gump is a kind of chameleon man (like allen's zelig), as if penetrating ""forward into the past"". but the predecessors of the new all american hero, who in a moment turned out to be a cult figure of the mid-90s (even prestigious political magazines devoted several articles to the phenomenon of ""gumpism"", and clubs of ""gumpomans"" began to appear all over america), should not be considered comic or fantasy characters from other works of ""baby boomers"", including zemeckis himself. although it should be noted that forrest gump is, as it were, an ideal representative of this generation, an eternal child who has not changed for forty years of his life (his screen biography ends in the mid-80s), a carefree child of the nation, who was torn out of his native way and family hearth in vain. the parable rebellious ""cuckoos"" and philosophically wise ""simple-minded"" from such brilliant films as ""someone flew over the cuckoo's nest"" by milos forman (based on the novel by ken kesey), ""being there"" by hal ashby (based on the book by jerzy kosinski) and ""the world by garp"" by george roy hill (based on the bestseller by john erving), still belonged to the ""stormy sixties"" or ""bitter seventies"". and even references to the obvious roll call of ""forrest gump"" with frank capra's social comedies, which glorified the ideals of roosevelt's prosperity program in the cinema of the 30s, are superficial and approximate. the kaprov cranks, who were played by gary cooper and james stewart, easily succumbed to political demagoguery and calls for prosperity, preaching love and care for ""every john doe"" living in america from the screen. and with the naive and stupid forrest gump, who has an iq of 75 (us schools accept children with an iq of at least 80) and is not voluntarily involved in many major events of the third quarter of the twentieth century, all this rubbish and husk comes off like water from a goose. in the influential publication ""variety"", in the first response to the not yet exalted tape, forrest gump was called, not without reason, a ""self-imbecile"" and compared with the autistic character dustin hoffman from ""rain man"". by the way, along the way, it should be noted the paradoxical similarity between the two paintings and how difficult they were born. ""rain man"" was going to be shot by at least five directors, because of this, the script was constantly being rewritten. and producer wendy finerman dreamed of making a satirical novel by winston groom for nine years before she found support at a major paramount studio. gump's ""closest relatives"" are precisely the flawed heroes from films created in post-reagan times, at the turn of the 80-90s - in addition to ""rain man"" (4 oscars), we should call ""born on the fourth of july"" (a tape about a disabled vietnam war veteran was awarded only two oscars, but one of them was for directing) and ""the smell of a woman"" (just for the role of a blind retired officer, the outstanding actor al pacino finally received his oscar - and on the eighth attempt) . and tom hanks, played by a young lawyer with aids in philadelphia, was awarded an oscar for reasons of political correctness. so it is not surprising that for the second year in a row he was awarded this award for the role of the ""glorious abnormal"". robert zemeckis' painting is to a much lesser extent an art phenomenon or an example of an ethical act of the author. it is interesting as a psychological and sociological test, because forrest gump has become like an expression of the underlying moods of americans who are tired of the struggle for existence, the race for prosperity and the two-century aspiration for the great american dream. after all, he stopped after three years of continuous running across america (from ocean to ocean), and declares to confused followers: ""i'm tired."" here kaprovsky mr. deeds drunkenly proclaimed the idea of ""back to nature."" and gump, who has not grown wiser in wandering around the world, returns back to his family and from now on will raise a son more intelligent than himself. for americans in the mid-90s, this ingenuous idea turned out to be almost a revelation.

1382;dmoser1;"before i ever saw this film, i heard it criticized for being anti-intellectual, for proffering forrest's limited iq as a virtue to be applauded. that was enough to dissuade me from actually watching it for a long time. when i finally watched it, though, i found it deeply moving, despite my negative expectations. yes, it's practically an exercise in non-stop emotional manipulation. some of it is so heavy-handed that even a softie like me could see it coming and sidestep it. still, there are other scenes that affect me every time, even after many viewings. there are moments of pride, humor, loneliness, gratitude, fear, heartache, and joy, moments that are true down to the bone, even though the film is obvious fantasy. still, it took me a long time to embrace this movie. forrest did indeed have a low iq, and is indeed held up as an american hero, and at first i had trouble with that, just as others did. our culture has suffered enough ""dumbing down"" without popular films promoting stupidity as a positive thing. also, the character of jenny was problematic for me, enough to keep me ambivalent about the whole movie; gump's love for her was almost pathetic and she never seemed to grow in understanding. forrest offers his heart each time they meet, and each time she leaves him behind without explanation or apology, even after the conception of forrest jr., when it seems that she has finally gotten her act together. ultimately, she only returns when she knew her time was nearly ended. through the years, i came across ""forrest gump"" occasionally on cable and i would give it another try. i tired of the historical cgi, inserts, and other pop culture jokes pretty fast; they were mildly entertaining the first time around, but after that they seem like they're just in the way, serving only to space out the really meaningful scenes in order to let you catch your breath. but, oh, those good moments... i knew i had to get past my reservations and figure out why i loved this movie. and finally i have. first, i realized that the review i referred to earlier was wrong. gump's limited intelligence is not presented as his strength; it's simply a fact of his life that allows the plot to develop in a certain way. it also makes him a more balanced character, since everything else about him is so exceptionally good; his low iq is a device that allows us to relate to him on a more equal level. the proof that intelligence is not denigrated by this film is the very moving scene when forrest inquires about his son, fearing that he passed on his only source of (unearned!) shame to his offspring. (imo, this single scene is good enough to justify hanks' oscar.) no, this film isn't about the thing forrest lacks; it's about the things that he has, and he has them in spades: honesty, generosity, loyalty, honor, integrity. the most moving story line, for me, is that of lieutenant dan. forrest saves his life twice, first physically, by dragging him away from a firefight in vietnam, and then spiritually, by being a beacon for dan, a lighthouse leading him from a tempest of self-destructiveness to a haven of sanity and peace. i cannot watch dan's arrival in bayou le batre, or walking at forrest's wedding, without tears. jenny? yes, she fails to appreciate forrest's better qualities too often. but there is some explanation for her behavior towards the end of the film, and in that light i've decided to cut her some slack. again, the film just isn't about jenny's failings, but forrest's loyalty. so, after all this time, i'm happy to finally rate this film... 10/10.";10 November 2004;10;['anti', 'intellectual', 'forr', 'limited', 'enough', 'long', 'negative', 'non', 'stop', 'emotional', 'other', 'many', 'true', 'obvious', 'long', 'forr', 'low', 'american', 'popular', 'positive', 'problematic', 'enough', 'ambivalent', 'whole', 'pathetic', 'forr', 'forr', 'forr', 'tired', 'historical', 'other', 'first', 'meaningful', 'good', 'wrong', 'limited', 'certain', 'balanced', 'good', 'low', 'equal', 'forr', 'only', 'unearned', 'single', 'good', 'forr', 'forr', 'forr', 'forr', 'well', 'forr', 'happy'];0.0963903743315507

1414;leonardo-beltrame;"to get a 10 from me, a movie needs to be practically perfect in all aspects that i consider of the utmost importance: screenplay, acting, characters, technical achievement and soundtrack. forrest gump achieves that task. first of all, i think screenplay and characters ought to be analyzed together. the story of this movie is absolutely brilliant on its surface. the idea of displaying a naive and low iq man who witnesses some of the biggest events of the us history during the second half of the xx century was perfectly performed. it was undoubtedly one of the most amusing things that i've ever seen on the screen. however, the movie was for me something beyond that. forrest gump, as being the simplest man you could ever imagine, represents the human being at its ""purest condition"". gump does everything that we would do in the same situation if we weren't pressured by conventions established by society. most people start drinking beer, for instance, not because they like it, but because they need acceptance from others. forrest's case is different: he drinks coke because it tastes better. he decides to mow the lawn because he likes it, regardless of other people's thoughts about that. he loves jenny without any prejudice or shame, even though she only looks for him when she needs him desperately, representing the rest of the corrupted human race. summing up, he follows his primal instinct and he is unconsciously immune of everything else. this makes forrest gump one of the nicest and well written characters of all time. nothing would be the same, of course, if it wasn't tom hanks in the leading role. he is astonishing, vanishing completely inside the character. robin wright is also perfect as jenny, being able to perform a large amount of feelings among almost two hours and a half. gary sinise and sally field are also great. michael conner humphreys and hanna hall, who performed young gump and young jenny, caught our attention from the very beginning. robert zemeckis and his team made the movie of their carriers. the visual effects were revolutionary, placing gump alongside john f. kennedy and john lennon and making the audience burst out laughing. moreover, the rhythm and the editing were perfect and the cinematography was impressive. the soundtrack is also a differential, because it follows perfectly the passage of time. hence, we enjoy some of the best hits of the 60s, the 70s and the 80s. the original score deserves a mention too. it's simple, beautiful and fits perfectly with the scenes where it appears. forrest gump is directed brilliantly, has memorable characters, astonishing and captivating performances, an original and magnificent plot and a marvelous soundtrack. surely one of the best movies ever made. vote: 10.";3 February 2016;10;['perfect', 'utmost', 'technical', 'forr', 'brilliant', 'naive', 'low', 'big', 'second', 'amusing', 'forr', 'simple', 'human', 'pure', 'same', 'most', 'forr', 'different', 'other', 'corrupted', 'human', 'primal', 'immune', 'forr', 'nice', 'same', 'astonishing', 'perfect', 'able', 'large', 'sally', 'great', 'young', 'young', 'very', 'visual', 'revolutionary', 'perfect', 'impressive', 'good', 'original', 'simple', 'beautiful', 'forr', 'memorable', 'original', 'magnificent', 'marvelous', 'good'];0.3811776061776061

1447;Monkey-37;"i rarely comment, but feel compelled. by reading these comments it is clear how often people miss the point of movies. someone above mentioned that gary sinise was ""the devil incarnate."" it would seem that the language of the character and his proclivity to use the lord's name in vain offended the person. while i appreciate that this person may dislike the film and obviously does not like profanity, i think that this person is missing the point... and this saddens me. i would challenge this person to understand first, then form a opinion later. withhold judgment, at least until the end of the film. the person above let the barest surface of the language cloud their entire perspective of the movie. what a shame. after all, one doesn't have to like profanity to appreciate the point that artists are trying to make by using it. in this particular case, this person above, who seems to be very devout, missed the whole point of lt. dan. in my attempt to voice my own interpretation of lt. dan, and to counter the very poorly voiced opinion that lt. dan is the devil, i fear that i will introduce some spoilers below, so read with care. i hate to spell it out so plainly, but since the person above missed the point so completely, i will give my interpretation, however flawed. during the course of the film, lt. dan was on a very profound and religious journey. the whole point, in my mind, of the character was to explore, it very direct terms, the concepts of faith in the aftermath of tragedy. his use of the language, while consistent with the character, also show his inner turmoil and conflict with god. granted, the language is not for children, but as an adult i can appreciate that lt. dan's language was *supposed* to make me realize that he was at odds with god. by being overly sensitive to the language, this person missed the payoff when lt. dan eventually finds god. i, as a person of faith, found his story, in the subtext of the entire film, to be very interesting and gratifying. great movies, like this one, have layers upon layers of themes and messages. it is what distinguishes them from the normal trash. while you may not like the movie, you should at least do yourself the favor of being open-minded when viewing it. otherwise, don't bother spending your money. for example, the character of lt. dan, while a very fully realized character, was also a symbol of many things in the story. while i will not say that my interpretations are the only possible ones - i believe that lt. dan, jenny and forest were all mirrors of the same character. all three characters go on a journey during this film, all fight the same demons in some form, but all three stories come to a different resolution. as they all ""run"" from their troubles, directly or indirectly, they each take a different path. but lt. dan's path is that of religious redemption. to call him the ""devil incarnate"" and treat him like a blasphemer is to deny the entire idea of redemption and forgiveness. lt. dan was an obvious symbol of post-vietnam america. he suffered physical wounds like we each suffered psychological wounds. and i can still visualize his final confrontation with god. i would like to ask the person above whether they even considered that, high atop the cross-timbers of a wooden mast, with his arms outstretched, his beard and hair whipping in the wind, that lt. dan looked quite christ-like. he called out into the void, and, as forest observed, god came to him. after finding god in the storm, gary is given his peace, tames his demons, and is even eventually given his legs back. a cured body to match his cured soul. i wonder if the person above thinks any of this symbolism to be an accident, or a message of the film. frankly, i doubt this person even thought twice about it, which is what i find sad. but if they had, i wonder if they would have had the same negative reaction to the film. oh well. monkey";25 September 2001;10;['clear', 'incarnate', 'withhold', 'least', 'bare', 'entire', 'particular', 'devout', 'whole', 'own', 'flawed', 'profound', 'religious', 'whole', 'direct', 'consistent', 'inner', 'sensitive', 'entire', 'interesting', 'gratifying', 'great', 'normal', 'least', 'open', 'minded', 'many', 'only', 'possible', 'same', 'same', 'different', 'different', 'religious', 'incarnate', 'entire', 'obvious', 'post', 'physical', 'psychological', 'final', 'wooden', 'like', 'cured', 'cured', 'sad', 'same', 'negative'];0.05

1496;gofigure757;"as a fan of the novelist winston groom, i looked forward to the theatrical adaption of his great novel, ""forrest gump"" (a 20th century ""huck finn"".) much to my surprise, the movie was 180 degrees from the book. the best example of the difference in tone between the movie and book is the now famous ""chocolate"" line. in the movie, forrest often says; ""life is like a box of chocolates; you never know what you're going to get."" the only reference to chocolate in the book (which is written in the first person) is the very first line: ""let me tell you, being an idiot is no box of chocolates."" the theatrical forrest is a dim-wit who keeps falling into dung heaps and comes out smelling like roses. in the book, forrest is a dim-wit who keeps falling into dung heaps and comes out smelling like a dung heap. but both forrests keep on plowing ahead; which is the saving grace of the movie. while the book is much darker and satirical than the movie, the movie does capture forrest's ability to dust himself off and keep going. and it captures the feel of the 50's, 60's and 70's as forrest stumbles from one adventure to the next, accidentally inserting himself into historical events. but what really saves the movie is the performances by tom hanks, robin wright and gary sinise. while i wish some things from the book hadn't been changed (jenny and mrs gump don't die, forrest acts in a movie with raquel welch, forrest becomes a famous blues harmonica player, etc) the ""movie"" version ends up telling it's own story. it may be a completely different story than the book, but it is a story worth seeing. if you love the book, be prepared to separate the movie completely from the book. if you love the movie and haven't read the book, i highly recommend you do so.";8 January 2007;7;['theatrical', 'great', 'forr', 'good', 'famous', 'forr', 'only', 'first', 'first', 'theatrical', 'forr', 'forr', 'saving', 'dark', 'satirical', 'forr', 'forr', 'next', 'historical', 'forr', 'forr', 'famous', 'own', 'different', 'worth', 'prepared'];0.25

1569;dainasavenko;"i feel that now many people will rush to prove me wrong with foam at the mouth, but that's what freedom of conscience is for, to have your own opinion. of course, there is not a single critical review here, all dear visitors of this site like 'forrest gump'. but let's just try to look at the tape logically. i looked at it and will explain why i didn't like this tape! 1) the script. everyone knows this movie, but no one knows the original source - vincent groom's satirical novel of the same name. the screenwriters turned everything upside down, giving melodramatic shades here, developed a love theme, etc. in fact, although gump is a complete idiot in the book, but this does not prevent him from being narcissistic and cynical. i will say right away that if the novel had been filmed without changes, then no one could have been found for this role except bill murray. all the characters in the book did stupid things and it was all woven into the general outline. according to groome's novel, all the successes of america over the past 50 years have been due to a series of accidents, and not thanks to some super-ideas and people. in fact, the novel is anti-american, it's more of a lampoon. and the gump itself is a parody of the 'great american dream' and the fact that 'even an idiot can raelize it'. at least, here we are talking about an incorrect film adaptation, otherwise 'gump' would be a great satirical comedy, and not a silly, snotty pseudo-historical melodrama. 2) characters. if you start analyzing, there is not a single mentally normal person in the film, let's see: gump is a complete idiot, jenny is a victim of a pedophile father, with a damaged psyche, who does not know where to hang herself. she is an alcoholic, a nymphomaniac and a drug addict - a good ammunition. bubba - he has a moronism and plus there are traces of paranoia (fixated on one thing - on shrimp) and a 'harelip'. lieutenant dan is a disabled person who has typical features of the vietnam syndrome, suffers from severe neuroses. gump's mother still seems to be nothing, but it becomes clear that she is an immoral woman, ready to do anything for her goals. the rest of the characters are not particularly spelled out, but they also question the mental state of the characters. and here we are shown real life, which unreal people are trying to play, let's say, with mental disabilities. 3) history. according to the sequence of events, the film resembles an additional manual to a textbook on modern american history, scrolling through the main events of the usa since the 50s. only it is better for americans not to look at such a manual, otherwise they will think that forrest gump is responsible for their entire history. by the way, it's strange that he wasn't elected president of the united states in the end, because he did so much for america. although, in the minds of americans, this thesis turned out later - it was not for nothing that they elected george w. bush. 4) directing. zemeckis' hand is not felt here. how did he not get puffed up, he failed to create his own world in the film and give it a certain atmosphere - what did he get in 'back to the future' and who framed roger rabbit?

1581;Twizm;"forrest gump (1994) rating: 10/10 tom hanks is undeniably an incredibly gifted actor, and this is his best performance. in forrest gump, he creates an unforgettable character, arguably the most memorable of the 90s. forrest, forrest gump is a good natured guy who only has one weakness: he's a little slower than average. but in many ways, he's superior to most so-called ""normal"" people. you rarely see a man with so much enthusiasm and good will! his great personality added to the undying love of his mother (sally field at her best) helped to give him an unbelievable life, filled with memories. and as the film begins, gump, sitting on his bench with a box of chocolates, tells strangers his fascinating story. the film's ingenious script has him involved in every major american event from the 50s to the 80s. he meets everyone from elvis to john lennon, from kennedy to nixon. star quarterback in college and world champion ping-pong player some years later, he even finds the time to go fight for his country in vietnam. perfect example of the american dream, the simple little boy who even achieves to become godzillionaire! just then, director robert zemeckis and hanks would have accomplish a great task, namely telling their country's recent history through the eyes of a simple man, putting everything under a new, uncynical light. but the film also contains one of the most touching of love stories between forrest and his lifelong love jenny. she might have been a ""normal"" kid, but she didn't have it as easy as her buddy. after a traumatizing childhood thanks to an abusive father, jenny goes through all the downsides and fake hopes of that same dream, from strip clubs to thankless waitress jobs. and in the midst of that, she follows the traces of timothy leary and gets into san francisco's acid culture, go hippie and protest war and even end up snorting coke in 70s discos. but forrest still looks after her, and they have the sweetest moments together... zemeckis sure can be proud of his oscar-winning work. while telling a deeply involving story that walks the thin line between drama and comedy, he shoots countless references to events and people. even though none of them lasts much more than 15 minutes or so, each of gump's ""adventures"" feels like a movie of its own. just take the riveting war sequences, or the man's 3 year-long run. zemeckis directs his cast perfectly. besides tom ""two-oscars-in-a-row"" hanks, there's the talented robin wright as the lovable if flawed jenny (who i can't believe wasn't even nominated for an oscar), gary sinise as the intense lieutenant dan and mykelti williamson (whoever that is) as forrest's shrimp-lovin' war buddy bubba. the soundtrack by itself is incredible, covering pretty much all the important music over 30 years, and alan silvestri's score is restrained but efficient at underlining the film's emotional core. there's only one word to truly describe forrest gump: magical.";2 May 2002;10;['forr', 'gifted', 'good', 'forr', 'unforgettable', 'memorable', 'forr', 'forr', 'good', 'natured', 'little', 'slow', 'average', 'many', 'superior', 'normal', 'much', 'good', 'great', 'undying', 'sally', 'good', 'unbelievable', 'fascinating', 'ingenious', 'major', 'american', 'perfect', 'simple', 'little', 'great', 'recent', 'simple', 'new', 'uncynical', 'touching', 'forr', 'lifelong', 'normal', 'easy', 'abusive', 'fake', 'same', 'forr', 'sweet', 'proud', 'thin', 'countless', 'more', 'own', 'riveting', 'long', 'talented', 'flawed', 'intense', 'forr', 'incredible', 'important', 'efficient', 'emotional', 'forr', 'magical'];0.2948339780786589

1595;jjacques1;i am a long time imdb fan and first time reviewer. when i am reading through fellow user reviews, i generally find myself gravitating towards reading reviews that hold the opposite of my opinion. if i loved a film, i read the poor reviews and vice versa on the films that didn't resonate with me. i like finding value in an opposite viewpoint. with that said, while i read through the negative reviews of forrest gump, i found myself thinking that a number of the reviewers might be missing what i see is a large part of the film's message. their focus was on the characters' intelligence and lifestyle. i read things like the point of the film was that you would be successful even if you're an idiot like forrest, as long as you walked a conservative path. if you decided to take the path jenny's character chose, despite the fact she was more intelligent than forest, your life would end in disaster. i think the differences between forrest and jenny's journeys has nothing to do with the disparity in their intelligence or lifestyle but more with the difference between someone who knows who he truly is versus someone who is searching to find out who they are. i don't think the movie is passing judgement on either person's choices. i don't see jenny's life ending the way it does as being a failure. her life had value and she was able to find what she was looking for. forrest's life was incredible and his love for jenny was his guiding star. he lived through so many experiences and met so many famous people of that era. he lucked into wealth and at a couple points in the film became famous in his own right. none of that had any real meaning to him. his purpose came from his personal relationships, protecting and doing right by those he loved and his strong sense of right and wrong. each character's journey (again regardless of intelligence) is representative of the experiences of an entire generation of north americans.;13 October 2018;10;['long', 'first', 'fellow', 'poor', 'opposite', 'negative', 'forr', 'large', 'successful', 'forr', 'conservative', 'intelligent', 'forr', 'more', 'able', 'incredible', 'many', 'many', 'famous', 'famous', 'own', 'real', 'personal', 'strong', 'wrong', 'representative', 'entire', 'north'];0.2848809523809524

1598;jbspurr;"""forrest gump"" professes to be all about innocence, but is certainly the most pernicious highly popular movie of my lifetime, whose subtext is the message that there is something virtuous about invincible ignorance, which will be rewarded in all sorts of improbable and arbitrary ways. an exercise from beginning to end in magical thinking, the movie undermines the manifest fact that achievements in life should and must be earned, and that understanding proceeds from knowledge, which must, in turn, be gained through education, the broader the better. ""forrest gump"" was the perfect vehicle for the reactionary reagan era, with its ""what me worry"", feel-good-about-america message, regardless of what we were (and are) doing, and however much suffering we may countenance or cause (whether in vietnam, chile, guatemala, el salvador, angola, or iraq, then or now). the movie was also a major piece of propaganda in the then new revisionism regarding the vietnam war that began under reagan, depicting anti-war activists as the perfect fit for that most tenacious of ""urban legends"", the spat upon veteran (the only people who spat upon the veterans were the johnson and nixon regimes that put them in harm's way, and then dumped them on the streets without providing any transitional or sustained support before ptsd was fully acknowledged as a consequence of trauma in combat). this movie is also a perfect fit for the kind of know-nothing nativism expressed by the likes of sarah palin and the ""tea party"" movement, and thus a sad commentary on the present condition of life in america as well. it is not a ""candide"" for our time.";9 September 2010;1;['forr', 'pernicious', 'popular', 'virtuous', 'invincible', 'improbable', 'arbitrary', 'magical', 'manifest', 'broad', 'well', 'forr', 'perfect', 'good', 'much', 'major', 'new', 'anti', 'war', 'perfect', 'tenacious', 'urban', 'only', 'transitional', 'sustained', 'perfect', 'sad', 'present'];0.3186688311688311

1601;BeatrixKiddomark1;"despite the 8.7 average rating on imdb, the many praising reviews it receives and the good opinions of my friends, i wasn't really expecting this film to be anything special. however as it is such a highly regarded film, i thought it was probably worth watching, even if i wasn't going to enjoy it. why i knew i wasn't going to enjoy it; it won six ocars but other films that were also released that year have since become more well loved (e.g. pulp fiction, the shawshank redemption), i'm not a really big fan of tom hanks as an actor (shock horror!) and robert zemeckis is definitely my least favourite director, creating films that (in my opinion anyway) have no real aim other than to make some cash. so how did it compare to my pre-judgements? just as i thought really. there were many problems i found in this movie; to start with the camera angles and the camera movement made the film hard to look at visually, as the people and object moving looked very unnatural. another problem is that aside from forrest, all of the characters seem one dimensional as they were all extremely underwritten. leading on from that, for me, the script is a major problem; the dialogue is incredibly tedious, every line made me sigh with frustration, but that isn't the main problem with the dialogue; i watched the film with friends and every few seconds i heard them laughing at the things forrest says, however that's something i couldn't get into, i felt that there is something very malicious about laughing at a man with some kind of mental handicap. though the dialogue isn't the only problem with the script, the whole story is beyond unrealistic. although it isn't unlikely for someone to drift through life and for things to just happen to them, it is unlikely for the majority of them to be such good and life changing things, especially for a man with a mental disability, from a non-privileged background, at this time period. i also find it a little bit sneaky that they never mention what is wrong with forrest, it seems to be they did this so they could include some parts of the plot, for example him having sex with jenny and they her having a child, that i doubt would happen in real life to people in his condition. however, none of this is exactly enraging for me, the only thing that really makes my blood boil, is the vietnam sequence. films that have been made about the vietnam war have been made with the soul purpose to let audiences know, that war is hell and war will destroy you, but forrest's narration tells us that his experience in vietnam was fun, which goes against everything films like platoon, the deer hunter, full metal jacket and apocalypse now stand for and aside from a few seconds of footage, nothing shows the horrors of the war, it's unrealistic and highly insulting to the people who fought in the war. though as i have given it 3/10, there obviously must be a few plus points, there are about three. the effects that put forrest in with archive footage and very well done and well edited, gary sinise is very good in an underwritten part, the fact he didn't win an oscar is a travesty and there are some huggable children in it. though that doesn't make up for the obvious flaws in this movie.";7 July 2011;3;['average', 'many', 'good', 'special', 'worth', 'other', 'big', 'least', 'favourite', 'real', 'other', 'many', 'hard', 'unnatural', 'forr', 'dimensional', 'underwritten', 'major', 'tedious', 'main', 'few', 'forr', 'malicious', 'mental', 'only', 'whole', 'unrealistic', 'unlikely', 'unlikely', 'such', 'good', 'mental', 'non', 'privileged', 'little', 'sneaky', 'wrong', 'forr', 'real', 'only', 'forr', 'fun', 'full', 'few', 'unrealistic', 'insulting', 'few', 'forr', 'good', 'underwritten', 'huggable', 'obvious'];-0.034438775510204

1633;klabys;i have seen this movie easily a half a dozen times, and i find that the beauty of the film is how forrest gump not only shares his innocence and purity with others, including the audience, he also manages to retain that innocence and purity through some very difficult times. as a viet nam veteran, and a college graduate of the late sixties, i could of course personally relate to the various periods that forrest gump endures. i would only mention that the skillful and seamless blending of music, action, and period costume was enthralling. and yet it was so perfectly understated that forrest gump's travels through thirty five years of the stormiest and most meaningful years of american history only became clearly defined for the viewer. even more so than the well known chocolates quote as a metaphor for life, i felt that the remark that stupid is what you do is probably more workable for most of us.;31 October 2016;10;['forr', 'difficult', 'late', 'various', 'forr', 'skillful', 'seamless', 'forr', 'stormy', 'meaningful', 'american', 'stupid', 'workable', 'most'];-0.0625
1634;spatrickjr2;"forrest gump is a timeless film that has won the hearts of millions. it's attraction is a combination of an inspirational story that has heart, the likable innocence of forrest as the pivotal character during significant periods of recent national and even international historical events, and his genuine affection towards the people who become a part of his life. it is a story about life that the audience can relate to on many different levels, containing elements that provoke every human emotion. there are quite a few catchy, memorable ""one-liners"" that have real meaning for us to ponder, and we can even learn a lesson or two from the simple examples that he sets. played by actor tom hanks, forrest was a slow-minded southern boy who overcame his disadvantages and challenges through his own sheer will. often times people are ridiculed by others for being ""different"", as was the case with forrest starting in his youth. whether it was for the braces he wore on his legs or for his below-average iq, there would always be others who would pick on him for no good reason. forrest did the best he knew how and overcame these obstacles in spite of those who looked down upon him. with a strong upbringing by his ""mamma"", played by sally field, he was instilled with a basic sense of good southern values that propelled him to accomplishments of greatness that can be admired by people from all walks of life. on a few occasions when somebody actually treated forrest with the decency and appreciation that all human beings deserve, they won a loyalty from him that would last beyond a lifetime. it doesn't take much sometimes to gain somebody's friendship. maybe it starts with just a simple gesture, like on their first day of school when nobody would let him sit with them on the bus except for the little girl jenny who let him sit with her (and then she had a friend for life). forrest's ""best good friend"" bubba did the same thing for him when they first met on that army bus. since they were both a little slow-minded, they had a lot in common and there was an instant chemistry between them. bubba shared his dream of being in the shrimping business and invited forrest to become a part of it with him, but unfortunately bubba got killed in the war at vietnam and could never realize his dream. however, forrest kept his promise to him and followed through with it for bubba, and when it became a successful business, he remained true to bubba and gave his half of the profits to bubba's family. while in the army, lieutenant dan became a part of his life and was right away someone who forrest looked up to and admired, with the memorable one-liner, ""i sure hope i don't let him down"". after saving the lieutenant's life, their friendship and loyalty continued after the army. when he showed up to fulfill his promise of becoming forrest's first mate, forrest was so excited to see him that he jumped out of the boat and swam towards him, leaving it unmanned. when it then took a whole dock out, only half-embarrassed, forrest looked and proudly said in another one-liner, ""that's my boat"". out of continued respect and appreciation, forrest always referred to him as lieutenant dan. forrest can run, which is a favorite pastime of many people and also can be a source of solitude. when he ran just to run, all of a sudden it just made sense to people and many thought he had ""all the answers"". ""he sure is a running fool"", but when it comes to defending the honor of his girl and doing what's right, he is truly a man on a mission and isn't afraid to fight for what he believes in. these all show qualities of friendship and ideals that everybody can strive for. not only does this film appeal for it's heart-felt entertainment value, but it also has a lot of replay value as well. it's the kind of movie that, each time it is watched, more is learned about the depth of each character and their relationships with forrest. the one-liners are always just as enjoyable and, after all, what red-blooded american couldn't be inspired watching forrest clobber some guy in defending the honor of his jenny? in every way, forrest gump packs a good wallop.";22 July 2005;9;['forr', 'timeless', 'inspirational', 'likable', 'forr', 'pivotal', 'significant', 'recent', 'national', 'international', 'historical', 'genuine', 'many', 'different', 'human', 'few', 'catchy', 'memorable', 'real', 'simple', 'forr', 'slow', 'minded', 'southern', 'own', 'different', 'forr', 'good', 'forr', 'good', 'strong', 'basic', 'good', 'southern', 'few', 'forr', 'human', 'much', 'simple', 'first', 'little', 'forr', 'good', 'good', 'same', 'little', 'minded', 'common', 'instant', 'forr', 'forr', 'successful', 'true', 'memorable', 'forr', 'first', 'forr', 'excited', 'unmanned', 'whole', 'half', 'embarrassed', 'forr', 'forr', 'forr', 'favorite', 'many', 'sudden', 'many', 'right', 'afraid', 'forr', 'enjoyable', 'red', 'blooded', 'forr', 'forr', 'good'];0.2221055088702147
1635;efrainr1974;"the year was 1994, an absolutely amazing year for film. never since i was born, or to my recollection, since that year, has there been a better year for movies. pictures like the shawshank redemption, legends of the fall, pulp fiction, even the crow all came out that year. and then there was the year's crowning jewel - forrest gump. this is probably my favorite movie of all time. anytime i feel down, or just tired of the world beating down on me, i can watch forrest gump and for a few hours, just forget everything. twenty years later (and i can't believe it's been 20 years!) the movie still has the same effect on me. the story revolves around forrest gump, and man born with both physical and mental challenges, but with the wisdom and guidance from his mother, suggestion from his best friend jenny (to just run if he was in trouble) and his kindness and good nature (and somewhat bumbling nature), he succeeds in life. whether he's running from bullies, or bullets, or just life and heartache in general, tom hanks performance (coming off his first oscar win for ""philadelphia"") was his absolute best. he rightfully won his second best actor oscar for his performance here. the trials and tribulations forrest overcomes, while humorously interjecting himself in some of the most memorable events in american history from the 60's and 70's makes the film that much more fun to watch. the supporting cast (robin wright, gary sinise, sally fields) and really everyone in the movie does an exceptional job of bringing it all together. forrest gump is a feel good movie, and a true staple of the 1990's. the soundtrack is one of the very best ever compiled for a movie, and one of the few times i ran out and bough a movie soundtrack. i almost wish i could go back to 1994 and experience it again in a movie theater. but i'd want to do that for every major picture of 1994. if you've never experienced gump - i highly recommend that you do! even more-so if you're in need of cheering up.";21 April 2014;10;['amazing', 'well', 'forr', 'favorite', 'tired', 'forr', 'few', 'same', 'forr', 'physical', 'mental', 'good', 'good', 'general', 'first', 'absolute', 'good', 'second', 'good', 'forr', 'memorable', 'american', 'more', 'sally', 'exceptional', 'forr', 'good', 'true', 'good', 'few', 'major'];0.2907986111111111

1679;brysongraves-89429;cast: tom hanks, gary sinise, robin wright, mykelti williamson, sally field director: robert zemeckis ***this may contain spoilers*** this is the most inspirational movie i have ever seen. starring tom hanks, it is a story about the life of man named forrest gump who experiences many things. his experiences take place at a time when the world is constantly changing, and there is no telling where forrest will end up next. throughout his life's journey, he learns many lessons from all kinds of people. forrest meets some of the most well known public figures of his time. some include elvis presley, john lennon, john f. kennedy, and richard nixon. the movie starts off when forrest is a young boy with braces on his legs. bullies would pick on him everyday chasing him home until one day his braces started falling apart while he was running. when parts began to fly from his legs, he realized he was running and was overcome with joy. this was his turning point when he was a boy. he grew up like a normal person would and graduated high school. after that a football coach noticed his talents as a football player and forrest received a scholarship to play college football. around the time he graduated, the vietnam war was happening. he was drafted and sent to vietnam. he meets bubba who was his best friend and he also meets another great friend named lt. dan. forrest was shot in the war and while he recovered he played ping pong. after his time served in the military, he continued to play ping pong for the united states and made a lot of money. with this money he bought him a shrimp boat and became a shrimp boat captain. lt. dan became his first mate and they started shrimping. one day forrest headed back home on news that his mother was very ill. he stayed with her until she passed away. to deal with the sorrow from his mother passing, he began to run across the country. he would only stop to eat and sleep and would run coast to coast until one day he stopped running. he then returned home and lived there for a while. then one day he received a letter from jennie and went to see her. when he got there she told him that she was sick and that he had a son named forrest. they then moved back to forrest's house and lived there until jennie passed. forrest then raised his son. forrest meets the love of his life when he was a boy and her name was jennie. the love he has for her is what keeps forrest going through life and takes him to all of the wonderful places he goes. she was a sweet girl who was forrest's best friend. she was the one who told him to just run if something bad was happening. her advice led to his braces coming off, his survival, and his freedom from people. she was forrest's number one fan. no matter where she was or what she was doing she would help him if he needed it. as she grew up many things changed about her life, and she wasn't the best person. she moved off to college and got kicked out. then she moved off and left forrest to travel with some hippies, got addicted to drugs, but eventually she turned her life around to become a good person. tom hanks' acting was superb. he played the role of an innocent, simple man who was in large events. the simplicity he brings to the role makes you think that forrest is an actual person. the acting is delivered well and isn't swinging between different personalities. there wasn't a flaw in tom hanks' performance. gary sinise, who played lt. dan, was great in his role. he pulled off the crazy but intelligent leader that he was. for the little time that mykelti williamson played bubba in the movie, you felt connected as if he was your best friend. robin wright played jennie perfectly, portraying jennie as an opposite to forrest. lastly, sally field played forrest's mother perfectly. she was caring, informative, and helpful like a mother should be. all in all forrest gump is an inspirational movie about a simple man who lived an extraordinary life. it is full of life lessons and proves that anybody can do anything.;7 October 2016;10;['sally', 'inspirational', 'forr', 'many', 'forr', 'many', 'forr', 'public', 'forr', 'young', 'normal', 'high', 'forr', 'good', 'great', 'first', 'forr', 'ill', 'sick', 'forr', 'forr', 'forr', 'forr', 'forr', 'wonderful', 'sweet', 'forr', 'good', 'bad', 'forr', 'many', 'good', 'forr', 'good', 'superb', 'innocent', 'simple', 'large', 'forr', 'actual', 'different', 'great', 'crazy', 'intelligent', 'little', 'good', 'sally', 'forr', 'informative', 'helpful', 'forr', 'inspirational', 'simple', 'extraordinary', 'full'];0.2972303921568628
1680;balamuruganp;when i first saw this movie i didn't appreciate it like i do now. i think it may have been because i was so young when i first saw it. just recently i saw the movie again. what an amazing story and moving meaning. that movie teaches you so much about life and the meaning of it. that life isn't as bad as most people make it seem. that an innocent man can impact so many lives with his innocence. the meaning of the movie to me is that everyone needs to have a better outlook on life. that we need to appreciate more of the little things and not let the big things hold us back. that truly although life may throw us trials and tribulations like a box of chocolates but that we have to just bite into it and get through it even if we don't like it. that we all need to hold true to our values and not sink into a place that feels like there's no hope... i just love this movie. and anyone who hasn't seen it or who thinks that don't like it i seriously suggest seeing it or seeing it again. it truly is amazing.;24 October 2016;7;['young', 'amazing', 'bad', 'most', 'innocent', 'many', 'well', 'more', 'little', 'big', 'true', 'amazing'];0.2511363636363636

1723;kameroners;"during most of the decade of the 30s, the united states lived under the shroud of the great depression, a decade of unemployment and high poverty that would changed the face of the country forever. while the entire country suffered the effects of the depression, the inhabitants of the prairie lands had to face an extra difficulty: the dust bowl. the dust bowl was a terrible ecological disaster that destroyed many farms in the area of the great plains, and forced people to migrate looking for better working conditions. the difficulties and social problems that those migrants had to endure in this sad chapter of history became the inspiration for john steinbeck's novel, ""the grapes of wrath"", a book that quickly became a classic due to its powerful depiction of the era. soon after it's release, plans for a film adaptation began to be made, and the man who would bring the novel to the screen would be none other than john ford. in ""the grapes of wrath"", henry fonda plays tom joad, a young man recently paroled from prison who is traveling to his family home in oklahoma. when he arrives, he discovers that the farm is deserted and the only person he can find is jim casy (john carradine), the former preacher of his community. together they decide to go to the house of tom's uncle john (frank darien) looking for the joads, and it's there where they find them packing their belongings as they get ready to move. the joads explain tom that the bank has foreclosed their farm, and that they are moving to california looking for work and a better life. while he is not supposed to leave the state by the conditions of his parole, tom decides to join his family and convinces jim to go with them in the long and arduous trip to california. however, things won't be as easy as they thought they would. adapted to the screen by nunnally johnson, ""the grapes of wrath"" takes on the spirit of john steinbeck's novel and delivers a harsh, crude and very realistic portrayal of poverty during the dust bowl. despite not being an exactly faithful adaptation of the novel (changes were done due to censorship), the movie remains true to that powerful and very human essence that the novel had, and it could be said that johnson distilled the themes of the novel and made an unabashed story free of any political compromises. while this kind of stories often suffer literary embellishments, ""the grapes of wrath"" avoids stereotypes and shows humanity as it is, with all their vices and virtues. it is the excellent development of the main characters what gives that very human touch to the story, as it really shows a real understanding not only of steinbeck's novel, but also of the real social situations that inspired the book. in 1939, john ford was in one of the best periods of his career, having directed ""stagecoach"", ""young mr. lincoln"" and ""drums along the mohawk"" in less than 12 months. ""the grapes of wrath"" would also be shot the same year, being the culminating work of that extraordinary series of masterpieces. while ford was better known for his legendary westerns and larger-than-life heroes, ""the grapes of wrath"" was in many levels a very personal movie for him, so he basically took steinbeck's novel and completely made the story his own. framed by gregg toland's wonderful cinematography, ford brings to life the joads' story in a way that mixes his own style with a focus so realistic that almost feels like a documentary. without excessive sentimentalism, ford tells in this movie a very human tale of survival, so universal that could easily be related to any group of people migrating due to poverty. while ford and toland deserve a lot of the credit, the movie wouldn't be the same without the extraordinary performances of the cast. leading the cast is henry fonda as tom joad, delivering one of his best works of acting in his portrayal of the young man. considering his performance in ford's ""young mr. lincoln"", one could say that fonda's career reached legendary status under ford's direction. while fonda's work is worthy of praise, two actors actually manage to overshadow him in this movie: jane darwell and john carradine. as the idealist preacher jim casy, carradine makes a terrific job in what's probably the story's most interesting character, completely embodying casy's persona in an atypical role for him. like carradine, jane darwell makes a wonderful job (probably her finest) as ma joad, and without a doubt she truly deserved that academy award she received for her performance. as written above, the movie has several considerable differences with the novel (specially the second half), so fans expecting a complete translation of the book will be a bit disappointed. however, johnson and ford did a wonderful job in the adaptation than while considerably different beasts, both the movie and the novel carry the same spirit and the message that steinbeck tried to give in his book. interestingly, producer darryl f. zanuck also saw the film as a personal project and certainly his involvement helped the movie to get away from censorship as most as possible. while the film has indeed some flaws (most famously the sudden and unexplained disappearance of a minor character), it's hard to diminish its value due to them, as the beauty of its craft is so big that they can be easily dismissed. with a haunting atmosphere, a beautiful visual composition, and superb performances by his actors, ford created one of the first masterpieces of the 40s and one of the finest american movies ever made. while already a celebrated director by the time of its release, this movie consolidated ford as a master of his craft. despite their differences, john ford's ""the grapes of wrath"" truly carries the spirit of steinbeck's novel, as well as the ghost of tom joad. 10/10";2 May 2018;7;['most', 'great', 'high', 'entire', 'prairie', 'extra', 'terrible', 'ecological', 'many', 'great', 'well', 'social', 'sad', 'powerful', 'other', 'young', 'only', 'former', 'ready', 'well', 'long', 'arduous', 'easy', 'nunnally', 'harsh', 'crude', 'realistic', 'faithful', 'true', 'powerful', 'human', 'unabashed', 'free', 'political', 'literary', 'excellent', 'main', 'human', 'real', 'real', 'social', 'good', 'young', 'less', 'same', 'extraordinary', 'legendary', 'large', 'many', 'personal', 'own', 'wonderful', 'own', 'realistic', 'excessive', 'human', 'universal', 'same', 'extraordinary', 'good', 'young', 'young', 'legendary', 'worthy', 'terrific', 'interesting', 'atypical', 'wonderful', 'fine', 'several', 'considerable', 'second', 'complete', 'disappointed', 'wonderful', 'different', 'same', 'personal', 'possible', 'sudden', 'unexplained', 'minor', 'hard', 'big', 'beautiful', 'visual', 'first', 'fine', 'american', 'celebrated'];0.1834262485481997

1763;isani;"the first time i saw forrest gump, i loved it. on the second time around, i saw how terrible it actually is. there is not as much a plot as an idea. it's like watching ""look who's talking"", where the writers thought that simply having a baby talk was plot enough to fill a hour and a half. you all know the premise of this movie. the life of a retarded man in 20th century america. he does a lot of unusual things, which all turn out ok and trigger key historical events. this is funny. then the writers see that two hours have passed, and have to conjure an ending. they kill off forrest's wife and have forrest give a tearjerking speech like only tom hanks can. this is uplifting. there. now go home and feel good. some of my friends saw the film as plain all-american propaganda. in my opinion however, the film doesn't really take itself seriously enough to just be a vehicle for the american dream. in fact, forrest gump could have been a biting satire. as the audience is clearly supposed to laugh at forrest's improbable success, the film could be seen as a parody. mostly all the humour comes from the fact that the audience knows that the events are the exact opposite of what would happen in reality. the filmmakers could even have argued that recent history is so insane, that the events could as well have been caused by someone like mr. gump. the movie, however, doesn't have the guts to have lean to the right or left. forrest's pivotal role in history is treated as a mere light-hearted gimmick, omitting all the possibilities for actual commentary. the film tries to have it both ways in many other scenes as well. apparently it's not pc to bully forrest, but on the other hand the audience is supposed to laugh at his antics. forrest as both a war hero and a peace advocate exemplifies this problem. this isn't being ironic, impartial or open to interpretation. especially concerning the vietnam war, the writers have obviously not wanted to offend anyone, now matter how derivative it will look. in the end, it only comes off as having nothing to say.";8 November 1999;5;['first', 'forr', 'second', 'terrible', 'much', 'retarded', 'unusual', 'key', 'historical', 'funny', 'forr', 'forr', 'good', 'plain', 'american', 'forr', 'biting', 'forr', 'improbable', 'exact', 'recent', 'insane', 'lean', 'forr', 'pivotal', 'mere', 'light', 'actual', 'many', 'other', 'forr', 'other', 'forr', 'ironic', 'impartial', 'open', 'derivative'];-0.0223602484472049

1772;Spyrosmoviebuddy;"let me start out with i love tom hanks, and i love the simplex movies he tends to star in. i don't have any complaints about the movie, in terms of cinematography, actors, or premise/theme. this review is about a specific character. that character is jenny. i strongly dislike jenny and now i will go into detail. let me start out by saying, the way they wrote her character is oddly realistic in my opinion and that's part of the reason i have any judgement about her at all. as a teen (first time i saw the movie), i didn't understand why jenny was so reckless, but now i understand that it stems from her childhood. however, this is where it begins fumbling for me. jenny went to college. this means that she has an understanding that hard-work and effort will bring some form of success. with that being said, it vexes me how she treats forest. she treats him horribly. she does not owe him anything in the first place, so her constant toxic, recurring and random appearances in his life are exactly that. after meeting so many men that treated her bad, you would think she would have given him an actual chance earlier on. forest, although ""mentally challenged"" had about the same understanding about the world around him as any other male his age. he was well-built and attractive, and conversational. it makes sense, in an aspect, that because she was abused; she constantly searches for comfort in men that hurt or abuse her. it also doesn't, because again, she went to college. she had in her mind that she owed herself more, and then gives that away. whether directly or indirectly, she's manipulating forest throughout the movie and this is supported by her eventually having a child with him. why have a child with someone you don't take seriously unless you feel like they are benefitting you in some aspect? it's frustrating to watch her take advantage of his simple mind. she knows what she's doing. she's operating on a level, he can't comprehend, which is again -manipulation. she has no sense of self, and apparently no empathy either. if being abused has caused her to seek negative partners, behave dangerously, and more; then why would she constantly push her way into forest's life at random times? and if she's behaving unconsciously, with no intentions (or unknowingly) because she was abused, then why is she able to spend time with other people and give them her quality time? jenny is a careless, and a bit of a heartless individual, and her character irritates me off.";11 January 2020;7;['simplex', 'specific', 'realistic', 'first', 'reckless', 'hard', 'first', 'constant', 'toxic', 'random', 'many', 'bad', 'actual', 'same', 'other', 'attractive', 'conversational', 'frustrating', 'simple', 'negative', 'more', 'random', 'able', 'other', 'heartless'];0.00125

1877;subhadeep-51868;"on july 6, 1994, paramount unveiled robert zemeckis' forrest gump in theaters. the tom hanks satire would go on to win six oscars at the 67th academy awards, including best picture. the hollywood reporter's original review is below: forrest gump is not stupid. although his iq is 75, he sees the world far clearer than most. through his decent, childlike eyes, we too see things in a less confused and muddled way. in this cheerfully straight-arrow moral tale, tom hanks stars as the ""wise fool"" forrest gump and delivers yet another oscar-level performance. paramount will win sensational box office with this robert zemeckis-directed film. raised in the '50s in rural alabama by a single mother (sally field), forrest, being ""different,"" must fend for himself, struggling against not only perceived expectations but boyhood bullies. he unwittingly finds that he's blessed with a talent - he can run like the wind, which wins him a football scholarship to play for bear bryant at the university of alabama. and there's no stopping him after that. an uplifting saga about one young boy's earnest and good-natured attempts to overcome his disabilities, forrest gump is also a cheeky social satire of the past 40 years of u.s. social-political history. eric roth's screenplay, adapted from winston groom's novel, nimbly intertwines forrest's life with the seminal social events and players of the past several decades. unassuming forrest, with his golly-gee enthusiasm and decency, encounters the likes of elvis, george wallace, presidents kennedy through nixon, dick cavett, john lennon and abbie hoffman as he graduates from 'bama, fights in vietnam, competes in international ping-pong, founds a shrimping company, engages in philanthropy and jogs cross-country. contrasting forrest's unassuming innocence with the upheavals and rancor of the times, the film is a wisely goofy commentary on the stupidity of smartness. while forrest's foray's into the dens of the big and powerful are cheekily amusing, the film ambles along over a deeper, darker layer: forrest's love for his childhood girlfriend, jenny (robin wright). an abused child, jenny's life path is a desperate wander to find solid ground. she falls prey to every social movement and fad of the times; unlike forrest, whose unwavering strength and sense of right and wrong protect him from being caught up in social slides, jenny's genuflections reflect her lack of firm values and inner confidence. to some extent, one could argue that jenny symbolizes most of us. if any criticism might be leveled at the film, it is that its most heart-wrenching moments are too adeptly skirted, but, then again, that's in keeping with forrest's strength. highest praise to zemeckis, who has reached a higher maturity plane with his gracefully, technically eloquent direction. carrying his torso in an erect, straight-arched manner, hanks' body language is all-telling. with each strange or perplexing situation, hanks erupts with the smallest twitch or turn, signaling forrest's deep-seated disapproval or, in special other cases, his gleeful, thankful wonderment. mykelti williamson, as forrest's simple-minded g.i. buddy, is also outstanding, while gary sinise is sympathetic as forrest's bitter platoon leader, legless after the vietnam war.";30 April 2020;10;['forr', 'good', 'original', 'forr', 'stupid', 'clear', 'most', 'decent', 'childlike', 'confused', 'straight', 'moral', 'wise', 'forr', 'oscar', 'sensational', 'rural', 'single', 'different', 'uplifting', 'young', 'earnest', 'good', 'natured', 'forr', 'cheeky', 'social', 'past', 'social', 'political', 'forr', 'seminal', 'social', 'past', 'several', 'forr', 'golly', 'international', 'cross', 'forr', 'unassuming', 'goofy', 'big', 'powerful', 'amusing', 'deep', 'dark', 'forr', 'abused', 'desperate', 'solid', 'social', 'forr', 'unwavering', 'right', 'wrong', 'social', 'firm', 'inner', 'most', 'most', 'forr', 'high', 'high', 'gracefully', 'eloquent', 'strange', 'perplexing', 'small', 'forr', 'special', 'other', 'gleeful', 'thankful', 'forr', 'simple', 'minded', 'outstanding', 'sympathetic', 'forr', 'bitter'];0.0978711484593837

1879;ambe-26205;i understand what is the reason for considered forrest gump the best movie of his time when it was released in 1994, directed by robert zemeckis and written by erick roth, although the movie was inspired in a novel with the same name, both are different but the movie continue being interesting the movie plot is about forrest's life who is a simple person with some problems because he was considered mad but, despite that, he could do more things about his life than the expected. forrest is performed by tom hanks who developed the personality of a man with low intellect reflected in his accent and gestures, these qualities do the movie more engrossing and witty due this character is involved in different adventures also we could think that only people who have some kind of special resource or intelligence have the capacities of getting achievements but forrest can do us to think we can be part of some like that whether voluntarily or involuntarily. another characteristic of forrest is he did not think much before to act, so in the movie, as a consequent of his actions, he is part of some historical events including he had been face to face with important historical characters and greet them, in those scenes, there are visual effects which allowed to tom hacks be in those moments and alter the speeches of those characters according to the situation, and other special effects in the movie for generated different atmospheres or setting like war moments or events with a lot of people were innovative to film technologies in that times. sync up forrest's life with historical moments allow us to imagine some characteristics of that age and understand some consequence in the plot, also some characters like jenny performed by hanna r, hall, and the captain dan performed by gary sinise, who appear in different moments of the movie and every time with changes physically or in their way of mind due to his age or relationships with another people, causes a notion of time and the thinking that the people change. this movie is accompanied by whit classic music compounded by alan silvestri which generates different feelings about you are watching at that moment, doing more emotive the scenes. the end was lightweight, in comparison with the rest of the plot but this is thought-provoking due you could think or have different feelings about the movie after watching it, although in the majority is amusing. in my opinion, it is one of the best movies that i have watched, also i recommend it for people who want something classic and comical with different messages about life.;9 May 2020;10;['forr', 'good', 'same', 'different', 'interesting', 'forr', 'simple', 'mad', 'more', 'forr', 'low', 'witty', 'due', 'different', 'special', 'forr', 'forr', 'historical', 'important', 'historical', 'visual', 'other', 'special', 'different', 'innovative', 'forr', 'historical', 'different', 'classic', 'different', 'emotive', 'lightweight', 'due', 'different', 'amusing', 'good', 'classic', 'comical', 'different'];0.1596006144393241

(btw, i posted an earlier version of this to a certain progressive website, in case anyone here reads widely.) consider: 1) forrest was born of an earthly mother, with no indication of who his father was. 2) he became a fisherman at some point in the movie. but considering the sea's ability to rehabilitate lt. dan, and forest's ability to attain lt. dan's loyalty, i'd consider forrest to also be a ""fisher of men"". 3) remember when forrest ran and ran across the country for 3 years, collecting followers along the way? not unlike a certain religious figure. 4) and when he was doing all of that running, forrest performed various ""miracles"". like inventing the smiley-face logo, and the phrase ""s--t happens"". 5) spoiler here.. by the date on her tombstone, forrest's wife jenny was in her early 30s when she died. since forrest was about the same age, we can assume he was 30 when he did his ""preaching"".

(if only a bomb had landed on his foot. it would have knocked some of that insufferable self-assurance out of him, at the very least.) the film is just one big, long appeal to the pope to have forrest gump canonised, and is about as bearable as any such appeal - and, as is so often the case, the subject of this appeal is someone you wouldn't want to spend five minutes with.

1905;thefaded;"forrest gump, the 1994 movie from director robert zemeckis, is a film that appeals to the masses. from the most avid movie goers to those who haven't seen a movie in who-knows-how-long, there is something in it that everyone can enjoy. this movie features both a brilliant soundtrack that appeals to many different music lovers and stunning special effects that catch the eye and boggle the brain. it has been highly critically acclaimed, winning many awards in several categories. it's also very easily accessible to everyone. one of the things that really stands out about forrest gump is the all-star soundtrack. the movie's score features music from such artists as elvis presley, bob dylan, creedence clearwater revival, jimi hendrix, the doors, lynard skynard, the doobie brothers and fleetwood mac, just to name a few. the music in this movie does a great job setting the mood and the tone for the time period it portrays and the major events that take place in the story. the soundtrack has heavily influenced several movies in the years since it was released. its impact was so large that many movies with similar themes and historical timeframes have almost copied the soundtrack entirely. the film even won the oscar for ""best music, original score"" in 1995. with a soundtrack like that, it doesn't even need to be watched you can enjoy the movie with your ears alone. those who do happen to keep their eyes open for the show are never disappointed by the special effects. the storyline of the movie wouldn't be able to survive without the menagerie of cg and makeup that fits every aspect of the story like a glove. the cg managed to place forrest in several highly unlikely circumstances with ease, and made the audience believe he was actually there. through the use of this then-innovative technology, forrest ends up in such places as meeting john lennon on captain kangaroo, conversing with both kennedy and nixon, witnessing the first black students allowed on a white college campus, and running from an explosion in vietnam that narrowly misses him. the makeup transforms gary sinise (lt. dan taylor) into an amputee, and brings sally fields (mrs. gump) through time from young mother to old woman. even for a movie made 15 years ago, these special effects have managed to survive the test of time and still look believable. while we are on the subject of special effects, it has to be mentioned that forrest gump won the oscar for ""best effects, visual effects"", as well. in fact, the movie managed to win several awards. it won a total of six oscars, and was nominated for seven more. among the movie's other oscar wins were: best actor in a leading role (tom hanks), best director (robert zemeckis), best film editing, best picture, and best writing, screenplay based on material from another medium. the movie also managed to grab up an amazing thirty-two additional awards from other awards shows. these awards were well deserved, but not surprising considering the well-known cast and crew, not to mention the brilliant writing and editing. this was not the first award-winning movie for director robert zemeckis, who directed roger rabbit and back to the future, two other films well-known for their brilliant innovation and special effects. if anyone out there still hasn't been convinced to see this movie, there is one more excellent reason to do so: accessibility. because forrest gump has been so critically acclaimed, and due to the fact that it came out so long ago, a person often doesn't have to spend a dime or even leave their house to see it. it's very easy to catch on tv in fact, it will be on hbo at 7pm on friday, february 27th. for those who don't want to wait for it to come to them, it is very easily found in your family's movie collections, sold at almost any store that sells movies, or should be readily available at your local rental location. it's also very cheap. it's been known to hit the five-dollar bin at wal-marts across the us, and is seen at almost every garage or yard sale. this isn't a movie that you'll ever see sold out, either. most movie buffs have already seen it, so it's never too in-demand to be able to find. forrest gump is a movie that just has to be seen. between the soundtrack and special effects, everyone can find something to enjoy. just look at the awards success the movie has had that alone has to be a clue as to how brilliant it is. if that's not enough, you really can't lose if you take a gamble and watch it on tv. you can rest assured, there's not going to be anything better on.";26 February 2009;10;['forr', 'avid', 'long', 'brilliant', 'many', 'different', 'stunning', 'special', 'many', 'several', 'accessible', 'forr', 'such', 'doobie', 'few',

1982;dayshonr;the movie forrest gump was produced in 1994. the director is robert zemeckis. the main character is tom hanks which plays forrest, sally field played forrest gumps mother, and gary sinise played lieutenant dan. tom hanks won the best actor reward and robert zemeckis won the golden globe award. the forrest gump movie was a good movie, i would recommend it for whoever did not watch it. the main part i liked was when lieutenant dan showed up to forrest shrimp boat after telling him that if he becomes a shrimp boat captain, he would be his partner or second man on the ship. the big thing i disliked about it was how jenny would keep leaving and coming back to him, the good thing about that though is that they got married plus had a child. watching forrest gump though made realize dumb or stupid you can do what you put your mind to. the worst thing for me is the guy jenny left forrest for, i disliked how he hit on her but liked how forrest does not like that. when i first was going to start the movie, i thought it was going to be bad until i got like 30 minutes into the movie and it got interesting. one main thing about this is forrest and jenny's love for each other and how they cannot stay away. their love is literally unbreakable, no matter who jenny dates. forrest did not like any other female but jenny, there is one scene that proves the facts he only wants jenny. she's literally everything to that man if you watch the movie the confusing part of this movie is how he just runs nonstop for like 2-3 years just threw the whole state with no purpose. it is just crazy years fly past hair grows out beard hanging then a lot of people just starts to run with him. i think it is odd how while he's running other people just jumps in and starts to run with him. if i was in the movie, i would've just stared at him and wondered why he is running. running really became important to him though because when he was younger, he wasn't able too just run because of the braces on his legs. i would recommend this movie. i recommend this because i second guessed about the movie and thought it was going to be a bad movie, but it became interesting. the movie is good a lot of stuff that i least expected it to.;13 October 2021;10;['forr', 'main', 'forr', 'sally', 'forr', 'good', 'golden', 'forr', 'good', 'main', 'forr', 'second', 'big', 'good', 'forr', 'dumb', 'stupid', 'bad', 'forr', 'forr', 'bad', 'interesting', 'main', 'forr', 'other', 'unbreakable', 'forr', 'other', 'confusing', 'whole', 'crazy', 'past', 'beard', 'odd', 'other', 'important', 'young', 'able', 'bad', 'interesting', 'good'];0.0297619047619047

1989;leticiaheredia;i just recently watched a film in my english class, which noticeably everyone got caught on, forrest, forrest gump is the famous name. this movie has a lot in only one thing, above all, it carries along the life of a man going through a lot of history, especially in the usa, telling his life himself. forrest is a peculiar guy, since his childhood he had problems with intelligence and physical inconvenients too, he could not walk properly. therefore, it was difficult to make friends. however, one day while he was being chased by some bully kids, while trying to escape, he started to run and run, which at some steps after he liberated his legs and set free. he was able to run now, and he was the fastest man ever. throughout his life this unlocked power led him to many advantages and some blue periods of time. especially with a dear friend of him, which he actually loved but it wasn't mutual. in my point of view, i found the movie engaging thanks to the implementation of the history surrounding the years the film is centred. it is amusing how from the start of the movie it keeps on collecting small fragments of history and shows it even through small scenarios. although the romance kept its deadline, it was kind of annoying how the girl he was into never showed appreciation to him. furthermore, one problem that is always being highlighted is the silliness of forrest. i would comment, actually, it was not that he wasn't intelligent, he was and had some of the characteristics of one. but some of the things he used to do were nonsense because he didn't really think about what was being done and didn't really care about some situations so he never showed in a concentrated manner for many things. overall, i would recommend this movie for the drama it has and the american way it was settled. if you want to remember some historical moments, being presented as background, plus, romance and drama you might want to watch this movie. the time-lasting it's actually worth it since you get hooked up with the performance.;25 October 2021;8;['english', 'forr', 'forr', 'famous', 'forr', 'peculiar', 'physical', 'difficult', 'free', 'able', 'fast', 'unlocked', 'many', 'blue', 'dear', 'mutual', 'amusing', 'small', 'small', 'annoying', 'forr', 'intelligent', 'nonsense', 'concentrated', 'many', 'american', 'historical', 'worth'];0.1388888888888889
1990;sofiamontellano;this movie even tho its kinda old the quality of the whole movie itself is great, it has so many hidden messages and applies a lot of values like frienship,ambition,loyalty and many more. there are of course some things that made the movie loose a point in my review, one of them would be jenny's character. let me go a little deeper by saying that at the last part jenny calls forrest to visit her, but in my opinion if she wasnt with that virus she would have never call forrest again. some reasons for my opinion are that she left forrest more than one time, giving him not only trust issues but leaving him with his heart broken. then, she did not only took advantage of him once but she also never told forrest he had a son until he was a todler. over all this very emotional movie had me tearing up at the end is a great example on how to trap the expectator using the story. would 100 percent reccommend it to everyone that asks for a movie recommendation.;25 October 2021;9;['kinda', 'old', 'whole', 'great', 'many', 'hidden', 'many', 'more', 'loose', 'little', 'deep', 'last', 'forr', 'forr', 'more', 'emotional', 'great'];0.247779304029304

2046;leegilady;"the movie ""forrest gump"" sends some very important messages to its viewers, by using different themes, a special setting, an unusual plot, and an ""everyman"" characterization. i think this movie is amazing. it follows the life story of forrest gump. it is a modern classic, which will probably be famous always, and will always be applauded. this movie has a universal theme of acceptance and tolerance. forrest repeats the phrase ""stupid is as stupid does"" many times in the film. it shows how people judge others on their academic intelligence, not on their emotional intelligence. forrest has a very intuitive emotional intelligent, but he is judged by his academic intelligence, which is not very high. it presents to people how ""life is like a box of chocolates,"" and how you can choose what to do but you can't choose what you are and what your destiny is. the main character, forrest gump goes through many incidents in his life, which he doesn't choose. it also shows how forrest is like a ""mockingbird"", bullied and judged unfairly because of his actions, appearance and understanding of things happening around him. the setting of this movie is special. it takes place in a small fictional town in alabama, and in the wider world for 3 generations, from late 1950's threw to late 1980's. the film begins in forrest gump's hometown. forrest is born with a low iq of 70. he has polio and has to wear braces on his legs. he has troubles being accepted by a school and has a very difficult time fitting in. he meets a girl named jenny. jenny has a horrible childhood that involves a father that drinks and sexually abuses her. forrest has a very strong feeling of wanting jenny as a girlfriend and follows her through the whole film. he goes through many realistic incidents, but his response to them is surrealistic. one of those incidents was the vietnam war, where he meets two new friends called bubba (mykelti williamson) and lt. dane (gary sinise). he learns from both of them the meaning of friendship and commitment to one another. he also teaches them a couple of lessons; the real meaning of ""stupid is as stupid does"" and that everybody is equal and have feelings. jenny appears in his life many times and leaves each time, mostly in the end; she leaves some ""foot steps"" after her. those ""foot steps"" always lead him back to her and her influence on his life. both the actors' casting and performance were very good. an american director named robert zemeckis directed the film. tom hanks, who plays the role of forrest gump, does a good job of talking in a southern accent although he is not a southerner. his character is used in a surrealistic way. tom hanks narrates the movie. he talks as a first person narrative. the way he talks creates an unintelligent impression from the viewer's point of view. sally fields who plays mrs.gump, forrest's mother symbolizes a good motherhood, determination and protection of human values. jenny (robin wright) represents total acceptance; she is the first one to really accept forrest as he is. she never judges him on his academic abilities. the movie sends its themes and messages in very unusual but interesting ways. it basically tells about the real and significant incidents through a long period of time. the movie definitely earned the 6 academy awards that it received. it influenced so many people of many different ages in different ways. the script was very touching and the performances were amazing in presenting it. i think ""forrest gump"" is a film that everybody has to see.";31 May 2007;9;['forr', 'important', 'different', 'special', 'unusual', 'amazing', 'forr', 'modern', 'famous', 'universal', 'forr', 'stupid', 'stupid', 'many', 'academic', 'emotional', 'forr', 'intuitive', 'emotional', 'intelligent', 'academic', 'high', 'main', 'forr', 'many', 'forr', 'mockingbird', 'special', 'small', 'fictional', 'wide', 'late', 'late', 'forr', 'forr', 'low', 'difficult', 'horrible', 'forr', 'strong', 'whole', 'many', 'realistic', 'surrealistic', 'new', 'real', 'stupid', 'stupid', 'equal', 'many', 'good', 'american', 'forr', 'good', 'southern', 'surrealistic', 'first', 'unintelligent', 'forr', 'good', 'human', 'total', 'first', 'forr', 'academic', 'unusual', 'interesting', 'real', 'significant', 'long', 'many', 'many', 'different', 'different', 'touching', 'amazing', 'forr'];0.1049968278847589
2047;lunchtime_215;"the movie forrest gump is a very unusual, but a great, film. each of the four story elements of characterization, plot development setting, and themes are very effectively presented. it was very popular when it first came out, and people even now still discuss it, considering it as a modern classic. in the first eighteen days, it took $100 million in only american cinemas, more than any other film made by paramount pictures before. the movie was first written as a novel by an american author winston groom. the movie was made in 1994, directed by an american director robert zmeckis. the story has an odd setting. it is set in a small fictional town in alabama, but also the whole world. the filmmaker used this to represent his theme of 'everyman'. it has a long time setting. the story covers several generations from 1950s to 1990s. by covering of the world's time of losing innocence, as at the same time presenting forrest as a symbol of innocence, he shows how the world has changed during the time. the main character forrest is an extraordinary person. he, played by tom hanks, is born with polio. he needed braces for his legs when he was young. he also has a low iq of 70. he is unusual. he is different from other people in a lot of special ways. forrest gump represents all humanity, as a kind of modern-day 'everyman'. he is judged by his intelligence and appearance by other people. this leads to another theme of the story. judging a person by one thing about them cannot explain the person. the filmmaker uses this astonishing character to show the viewers the surrealism. the events go under realism, but all the things that happen to him cannot happen to one person. this intentionally unrealistic characterization is used to give us the message that we are all human. other characters are also very interesting. his mom mrs. gump, played amazingly by sally field, tries really hard for him to find the best of him. she is willing to do anything for forrest, and she always stands up for him. she symbolizes good motherhood. forrest's beautiful girlfriend named jenny, also his first and the only friend in the school, later becomes his wife. she was the victim of physical and sexual abuse by her father when she was young. her childhood was like living hell for her. in the film played fantastically by robin wright, jenny plays one of the major roles in the movie, contributing to the plot development and the theme of acceptance and tolerance. the mood of the film changes as jenny comes to find forrest, and then just leaves him alone again. the film slowly develops its high points. the first day of school is one. it is important because it shows that even little kids judge him by his looks. later he goes to vietnam and gets involved in the war. when he runs the entire breadth of america, the plot reaches one of its highest points with some humor in it. there isn't only one theme in the film forrest gump. ""life is like a box of chocolate,"" he says. you don't know what you're given, until you've opened your chocolate. additionally, whatever you're given in life, you should always try to achieve your personal best. it also makes the viewers wonder about the idea of destiny and choices in life. the film has a universal theme of acceptance and tolerance. he says, ""stupid is as stupid does."" he might not fully understand what he's really saying, but the filmmaker intends the viewers to understand. it really means that it is not stupid to be unintelligent, but it's stupid to judge people on actions, not reputation, and to name-call them. the film tells us what it's really like to be a human. it expresses another universal experience of how we're more alike than not alike. overall, i would say this movie is terrific. it doesn't only tell us about its themes and meaning of life but make us think about them as well. both the actors' incredible performances, and the stimulating script writing make this movie so magnificent. the movie has won 6 academy awards including best picture. i strongly recommend you watch this movie and or read the original novel. it is important to understand what it's like to be a human, what it's like to be different, what it means to accept and understand each other and i'm sure you'll really like the movie too.";4 June 2007;9;['forr', 'unusual', 'great', 'popular', 'modern', 'first', 'only', 'american', 'more', 'other', 'paramount', 'american', 'odd', 'small', 'fictional', 'whole', 'long', 'several', 'same', 'forr', 'main', 'forr', 'extraordinary', 'young', 'low', 'unusual', 'different', 'other', 'special', 'forr', 'modern', 'other', 'astonishing', 'unrealistic', 'human', 'other', 'interesting', 'sally', 'hard', 'good', 'willing', 'forr', 'good', 'beautiful', 'first', 'only', 'physical', 'sexual', 'young', 'major', 'forr', 'alone', 'high', 'first', 'important', 'little', 'entire', 'high', 'forr', 'personal', 'good', 'universal', 'stupid', 'stupid', 'stupid', 'unintelligent', 'stupid', 'like', 'universal', 'alike', 'terrific', 'incredible', 'stimulating', 'magnificent', 'good', 'original', 'important', 'different', 'other', 'sure'];0.1215493958777541
2048;stars-echo;"the movie forrest gump, directed by robert zmeckis and written by winston groom, is a fascinating film with a lot of great themes. it was released in 1994 with a great actor, tom hanks playing the main character forrest gump. it won six academy awards, which proves that many people liked the film. this story is set in a very small fictional town in alabama, which presents the whole world. it is a microcosm of the world. the filmmaker wanted viewers to empathize with forrest. he wanted us to know how stupid it is to judge people by intelligence and appearances. this film has a very long time setting, from the late 1950s to the late 80s, to show the growth of america and its loss of innocence, in modern times. winston groom presented the characters in a very interesting way by using some of the characters surrealistically but some very realistically. forrest gump, who is played by tom hanks in the film, is presented as an ""everyman"". he is used surrealistically and is a character that is used symbolically. this has a universal appeal. his story applies to every single one of us. forrest gump was born in a small town in alabama as an idiot, and had an iq of 70, which is low compared to ""normal"" kids. he is judged upon intelligence and appearances, but some of the things he says actually have deep meanings. tom hanks was perfectly cast. his gestures, face expressions, and the way he talked made the character seem alive and very realistic. sally fields, who played mrs. gump, did a great job presenting the determination of the mother's character. she is a very realistic character. mrs. gump is willing to do anything for her son. she is very protective and she didn't want forrest to go to a special school, so she even slept with the principal of a school to make him allow forrest to go to that school. jenny, who is played by a wonderful actress robin wright, is also a realistic character. she was the only child who was nice to him in school, and that's why forrest falls in love with her. when she was young, her father physically but also sexually abused her. jenny's dad symbolizes bad fatherhood, whereas mrs. gump symbolizes good motherhood. jenny has a lot of disappointments in her life and also tries to commit suicide, which shows how parenting is important and can ruin one's life. lt. dan is a super realistic character that forrest meets during the vietnam war. during the war he loses both legs and nearly dies, but forrest saves his life. forrest helped lt. dan not give up his life, but start a new fresh life catching fresh shrimps together. they start up a shrimp company and make a lot of money. this develops the theme of true friendship. there are many other themes in this story, such as determination, tolerance, and parenting. but i think there are two very clear and important themes. ""life is a like a box of chocolates"" is one famous forrest gump quotations. this quote hints us one of the theme of this story. it sounds unintelligent, because he is holding a box of chocolates and says it while he's taking one out and eating it, but if you think about it, it has a very deep meaning. you don't know what's going to come up in your life, just like you don't know what kind of chocolate might come out. life's unexpected. but is it really just destiny, or can life be chosen? the quote, ""stupid is as stupid does"" tells us another important theme. it's telling us not to judge by appearances or intelligence. winston groom is giving us a very important lesson: judge on actions, not reputation. overall, the casting and acting of the actors, and each of the four story elements were well presented. the setting and the idea of the universal theme were very well developed. also, the idea of winston groom to present the characters both realistically and surrealistically was brilliant. i think that this movie is very effective and it has messages that teach people a lot of things. forrest gump is a movie that everyone definitely should see.";4 June 2007;9;['forr', 'fascinating', 'great', 'great', 'main', 'forr', 'many', 'small', 'fictional', 'whole', 'forr', 'stupid', 'long', 'late', 'late', 'modern', 'interesting', 'forr', 'universal', 'single', 'forr', 'small', 'low', 'normal', 'deep', 'alive', 'realistic', 'great', 'realistic', 'willing', 'protective', 'forr', 'special', 'forr', 'wonderful', 'realistic', 'only', 'nice', 'forr', 'young', 'bad', 'good', 'important', 'realistic', 'forr', 'forr', 'forr', 'new', 'fresh', 'fresh', 'true', 'many', 'other', 'such', 'clear', 'important', 'famous', 'forr', 'unintelligent', 'deep', 'unexpected', 'stupid', 'stupid', 'important', 'important', 'universal', 'brilliant', 'effective', 'forr'];0.1614620228256592
2049;panli6;"the movie forrest gump is a fantastic movie. both setting and plot were fabulous and it definitely showed ""the world"". forrest gump starts telling how stupid he is and then he becomes a marvelous football player, a ping pong player, and shrimp fisherman. he has a different intelligence and that makes him special and so successful in life. the most inspiring thing he does is how he fights for jenny. when he always follows her and never gives up on her. at the beginning of the film, i thought he was really stupid but i realized that all he says is symbolic. he acts stupid but is actually smarter than most of the other people, that is why you should never judge someone by his/her appearance. he also has the typical alabama accent, which makes the movie seem even more realistic. each character was used surrealistically and unrealistically to show the theme everyman. the actors in this movie are perfectly well cast. forrest gump (tom hanks) is such a good actor and plays his role brilliant. he should've deserved an academic award. sally field, who plays forrest's mother, is actually only 4 years older than tom hanks, plays her role as a mother really well and symbolizes good motherhood. she can act as if she is 20 years older than him. jenny (robin wright) plays her role as a good friend of forrest and hippie also very well. all the main characters do their job really well in this movie. the most supporting character was jenny (robin wright). she was the main reason why forrest gump did everything. at the end where she dies, he even mentions it that he's done everything she wanted and that he loved her. she really supported him to achieve something in his life. i really liked the setting in this movie. where forrest gump starts off as a normal boy to a man in a small fictional town in alabama, and then travels around and sees ""the whole world"". he is a simple alabama kid and becomes all of a sudden really famous. it is like his life was chosen by destiny. that he would start off really small and then become very big and famous. he didn't choose to become a football player or a shrimp fisherman; he met bubba to even find out what shrimps were. only one thing was something he chose and always wanted to have, to get married with jenny. his love and everything he would do for her to make her happy. the author did this on purpose. he wanted to show himself as everyman. that everyman can achieve something in their lives, not as much as forrest gump like he was there most of the events and became a ping pong player and all that. obviously he couldn't be there on those events, but this is for the theme, to show everyman. when forrest gump started to run around the whole world, he inspired many people. only by running he just made them all run with him. he is a great inspiration even though people think he is ""dumb"". he does things that seem to be stupid, but actually are very clever. he is a very hard-working man and achieves everything which everyman wants. that shows basically the theme of this movie: work hard and you will achieve your goals. no wonder that this movie had won several academy awards. it is a great movie and i would suggest all the people who don't believe in themselves to watch this movie. it helped me a lot to work for my dreams, my hopes, and everything what i always tried to be. if i had to rate this movie, i would give 9 out of 10 points because it has an exciting plot and well-chosen characters. alabama is a great place for the setting of this movie and everywhere forrest gump went was also well chosen to show the theme: ""life is like a box of chocolates!"" it means that you never know what you will get and everyman doesn't know what they get except trying to achieve their goals to find out. this movie has more than only one theme, but talking about all themes would take ages. it has got the theme of war and theme of motherhood and much more. the movie was definitely better than the book since it was more realistic and had better characterization. it is basically a message to us to see what is happening in the world or what happened. it really impressed me and i would watch it again because it is so interesting. it is almost perfect but as we all know, nothing or no one is perfect!";4 June 2007;9;['forr', 'fantastic', 'fabulous', 'forr', 'stupid', 'marvelous', 'different', 'special', 'successful', 'inspiring', 'stupid', 'symbolic', 'stupid', 'smart', 'most', 'other', 'typical', 'realistic', 'forr', 'good', 'brilliant', 'academic', 'forr', 'old', 'good', 'old', 'good', 'forr', 'main', 'main', 'forr', 'forr', 'normal', 'small', 'fictional', 'whole', 'simple', 'sudden', 'famous', 'small', 'big', 'famous', 'bubba', 'happy', 'much', 'forr', 'most', 'forr', 'whole', 'many', 'great', 'dumb', 'stupid', 'clever', 'several', 'great', 'exciting', 'great', 'forr', 'more', 'more', 'well', 'realistic', 'well', 'interesting', 'perfect', 'perfect'];0.2554357592093442
2050;alexos3;"my suggestions to the film, forrest gump review are about the irony of this story, the setting, the characterization, the plot, and the theme. i thought this movie tells us about everyone's life and my opinion of this movie was that i liked it very much and it is very enjoyable to watch. you won't get bored and the plot of the movie always develops. in the movie forrest gump, the setting is rather weird because it is set in a small fictional town in alabama. that is where forrest starts. later in the movie the story takes place in the whole world. this means that he represents every human being. the time setting is between the 1950s and 1980s. this time was important to the u.s. history because it was after the world war ii and it was a new start for the people of the united sates of america. another example of everybody or universal is the character tom hanks. tom hanks plays forrest gump. i think he is a very good actor and the role suits him. when forrest gump was a little child he had polio and a low level of iq. his iq was around 70. he lived with his mom in a big farm outside the town. they had no money so forrest's mother used their big house as a hotel. on the first day of school, he met jenny. forrest thought she was a nice-looking young girl and fell in love. another important point of him is that he had polio and everyone rejected him except for jenny. he had polio as he was born and it is when the legs aren't strong enough to hold you and he had to wear braces. sally fields plays mrs. gump, she is forrest's mother and cares a great deal about forrest. after forrest grows old she got a sickness and died with an old age after forrest becomes popular. she was a very good mother to forrest. robin wright as jenny lives alone with her father in a very small house also outside of the town and her father abuses her very often so she tries to stay away from the house as long as possible. in the movie, gary sinise plays lt. dane. he was a super realistic character, meaning that he was almost too realistic for this movie. he plays his role really well and my opinion to him is that he is the best actor from this movie. bubba, he is a fascinating unrealistic character. myketti williamson plays bubba in the movie and was the best friend of forrest in the movie. he is the meaning of true friendship. the one thing that is unrealistic is that forrest gump cannot meet all the presidents of america and all the celebrities that he saw in the movie and run around the world without any reason. it is rather a symbolic meaning. the plot of this movie is very interesting. as time passes the plot development raised always higher and higher. one of the themes of this movie is that the main character, forrest gump, represents everybody's life. one of the quotes that he said was ""life is like a box of chocolates."" it simply means that you will never know what will happen in life because you never know what piece of chocolate you will take out. sometimes you take a good one out or sometimes you take one out you don't like that much. the other interesting quote was ""stupid is as stupid does."" this quote's significance means that you should not judge someone on their reputation but on their actions or it is stupid to call people stupid. this movie was a really good movie. i would rate it really high because the plot of this movie is really interesting and the director must have really thought about it. it would be a really hard movie to make. i think forrest gump is a movie that everyone has to watch because you will see how everyone's life is like. the plot is really interesting because it has a big increase all the time. i like that the plot development of this movie was like this. i really recommend this film to everyone.";4 June 2007;10;['forr', 'enjoyable', 'bored', 'forr', 'weird', 'small', 'fictional', 'forr', 'whole', 'human', 'important', 'new', 'universal', 'forr', 'good', 'forr', 'little', 'low', 'big', 'forr', 'big', 'first', 'forr', 'young', 'important', 'strong', 'forr', 'great', 'forr', 'forr', 'old', 'old', 'forr', 'popular', 'good', 'alone', 'small', 'possible', 'realistic', 'realistic', 'good', 'fascinating', 'unrealistic', 'good', 'forr', 'true', 'unrealistic', 'forr', 'symbolic', 'interesting', 'high', 'main', 'forr', 'good', 'much', 'other', 'interesting', 'stupid', 'stupid', 'stupid', 'stupid', 'good', 'high', 'interesting', 'hard', 'forr', 'interesting', 'big'];0.115710606060606

2052;yooeun228-1;"robert zemeckis directed this movie, forrest gump, in 1994. it well maintained the theme from the original version of book, ""life is like a box of chocolates"" and ""stupid is as stupid does"" this movie contains a lot of great actors and actresses who could act their own characters very well and showed the theme or plot. the reason why this film became so popular is because this story isn't just for the certain period or certain people, but for everyone. the movie begins in the small fictional town in alabama but soon; the setting of this movie goes on to the whole world. the setting also proves about the universal theme, ""everyman"" all the important events happen between late 1950s to late1980s. this movie doesn't only affects about late 1950s to late1980s but the present time also. such as white trash and people who have physical problems didn't live only between 1950s to 1980s but they still exist. there are several characters that strongly affect the theme or the plot of this movie. first of all, the surrealistic character, forrest gump who was acted by tom hanks well represented the theme and also well showed of physical problem of forrest. his iq was under 70 and he had a problem with his legs when he was young. when he became an adult, he was still prejudged by people based on his intelligence. however, later he becomes really famous and rich. this event doesn't really mean to show that forrest gump became a successful person, but the movie is trying to break a strong stereotype of people, by using forrest gump. also, it is telling not to judge people's ability or characteristics by intelligence or physical abilities. like his quote ""stupid is as stupid does."" mrs. gump, sally fields, the actress was actor playing the mother of forrest shows the theme of strong determination of all mothers in the world. even though only ten year older than the grown forrest gump, her acting was so realistic that the audience didn't realize her age. jenny, who was acted by robin wright, showed the reality of dark side of americans' life. in the movie jenny was the ""white trash"" but she isn't the only who is showing the theme of american life but partly, but through l.t he is somehow showing it too. he's character was so realistic. a deep friendship is expressed through his characterization. generally, there are six most interesting events that are happening in this movie. in my opinion, starting the movie by grown forrest gump talking about his childhood from the present time on the bench is a good idea. his first interesting event starts when he entered school. he had a hard time. on the school bus everyone seemed to avoid him or be as far away from him, only because of his physical appearance. but later, jenny who didn't look about her appearance came to him and be friend. other than this, there are three events that forrest gump becoming all famous and meeting the u.s president three times. with this event, the plot goes really high in audience interest and i'm sure that viewers loved these events. lastly, there is one important event left, about jenny and forrest that went audience very pleased but not a real happy ending. i was very impressed with this movie, especially with the acting skills and the themes of this story. this is a film that everyone would like and feel empathy with all these characters. the plot also appeals to average and ordinary people. i recommend this movie to all people no matter how old they are.";4 June 2007;8;['forr', 'original', 'stupid', 'stupid', 'great', 'own', 'popular', 'certain', 'certain', 'small', 'fictional', 'whole', 'universal', 'important', 'late', 'late', 'present', 'such', 'white', 'physical', 'several', 'surrealistic', 'forr', 'physical', 'forr', 'young', 'famous', 'rich', 'forr', 'successful', 'strong', 'forr', 'physical', 'stupid', 'stupid', 'sally', 'forr', 'strong', 'old', 'grown', 'forr', 'realistic', 'dark', 'white', 'only', 'american', 'realistic', 'deep', 'interesting', 'forr', 'present', 'good', 'first', 'interesting', 'hard', 'physical', 'other', 'forr', 'famous', 'sure', 'important', 'forr', 'pleased', 'happy', 'impressed', 'ordinary', 'old'];0.1354056437389771

2076;BrianInvincible;forrest gump an absolute film favourite of mine, mainly because there has never been a movie character that i have appreciated so much as forrest gump. a simple man who experiences (and creates) some of the most significant events in american history, while all he really wants is to be with the woman he loves, jenny. tom hanks gave an incredible performance as forrest, a man of 75 iq who is waiting at a bus stop whilst telling his life story. as we see the story develop from him meeting both his sweetheart jenny, elvis presley and being told 'run forrest, run!' different people arrive at the bus stop and listen to him. each meets his story with emotions ranging from enraptured to derision, as they learn with the audience the incredible life forrest has led. this includes him starring in the all american football team, winning a congressional medal of honour in vietnam, exposing the watergate scandal and making millions from 'bubba-gump shrimping industries', while meeting three different u.s presidents along the way. the film ends on a poignant note, with jenny and forrest meeting again and having a son, as jenny dies of hiv/aids. along with tom hanks in the title role forrest gump featured an excellent supporting cast, with career bests from robin wright penn as jenny and gary sinise as the legless vietnam veteran lt. dan taylor. i was inspired by the wonder of a man experiencing his life without realising its significance to the world, just simply wishing for an emotionally damaged woman who goes on to live a lonely life without him. she rejects forrest, telling him 'he doesn't know what love is', before eventually realising that no-one would ever love her more. due to its preposterous plot line and sentimental tone, forrest gump could easily have descended into melodramatic mush peppered with phony special effects. however in the capable hands of screenwriter roth and director zemeckis the movie becomes a highly entertaining yet profound account of one simple-minded man who goes on an enthralling quest. for such an audacious film there were amazingly few flaws (forrest inspiring john lennon to write the song 'imagine' and the contrivances of him running across america the only examples i can recall). forrest gump is a film that may well transcend anything of its kind. it gave us a character i had great sympathy and hope for, and reminded me that a person needs no intelligence to be an upstanding and admirable person. 9/10 brianinvincible;14 April 2010;9;['forr', 'absolute', 'forr', 'simple', 'significant', 'american', 'incredible', 'forr', 'forr', 'different', 'enraptured', 'incredible', 'forr', 'american', 'congressional', 'different', 'poignant', 'forr', 'forr', 'excellent', 'legless', 'lonely', 'forr', 'more', 'preposterous', 'sentimental', 'forr', 'melodramatic', 'phony', 'special', 'capable', 'entertaining', 'profound', 'simple', 'minded', 'enthralling', 'audacious', 'few', 'forr', 'only', 'forr', 'great', 'upstanding', 'admirable', 'brianinvincible'];0.2393398268398268

2089;pgiuntol;when watching this film, you just have to let yourself get caught up in the movie itself. looking at the unrealistic aspects of it and critizising them won't allow you to get the full affect of the movie. it is just a story. an illogical one that could never have happened in real life, but if you accept it as being true and let yourself get caught up in it, the story becomes incredible. the story combined with the outstanding acting by the five main characters (gump, jenny, bubba, lt. dan, and momma) shows the influence of major historical events on our society. but it shows it through the eyes of a person that doesn't recognize the importance of each of them. the other characters are affected a great deal. vietnam killed bubba. it nearly killed lt. dan, but instead sent him into a depression that only gump's naiveness could have saved him from. and of course jenny might have been the most influenced of all. she represented an abused child, a runaway, a hippy, a drug addict, a slut, and the aids virus. this girl probably went straight to hell when she died but gump couldn't see her faults. he was in love, which was the only thing that affected him throughout the movie. nothing else really mattered to him in the end. he cared for people that cared for him, or that he thought cared for him. he did things for his friends that none of us would ever do because we would be looked at as stupid or crazy. he bought a shrimping boat because of a promise he made to bubba. what kind of moron would buy a shrimping boat if he had never done any shrimping before in his life. forrest gump did and he eventually became a rich man because he didn't know any better. for those of you that don't like this movie, you're looking at it the wrong way. from what i've heard people either love it or hate it. i love it and apparently most other film critics do if it won best picture. pulp fiction is one of my favorite movies and so is shawshank. they were both incredible and unforgettable. but they weren't quite as good as forrest gump.;16 January 2003;10;['unrealistic', 'full', 'illogical', 'real', 'true', 'incredible', 'outstanding', 'main', 'major', 'historical', 'other', 'great', 'hippy', 'only', 'stupid', 'crazy', 'forr', 'rich', 'well', 'wrong', 'most', 'other', 'good', 'favorite', 'shawshank', 'incredible', 'unforgettable', 'good', 'forr'];0.2331439393939393

2116;iparss;"for me the film is a promoter of american culture and values and i want to look at the film from this point of view. it is the promoter of the american values using both conservative and liberal values, but the conservative values are more dominant and highlighted and liberal values are loosely used to promote just the american culture and at the end liberal values are defeated by conservative values although both ideologies are used to promote the american culture. the film also uses the american icon and figure to promote the american culture. family is and home are very important in film, forrest mother is a devoted mother who does her best to keep the family and nurture her child although forrest father is not present and may leave the family but the mother asserts that that he is on vacation so she wants to that they are a family. ""there is no place like home"" and ""family forever"" these themes can be seen in the film when forrest, jenny and their child return their home, greenbow, alabama, as a family. gump is the man family, he is loyal to his love and does his best to have his own family. gump is a hard working guy who works and tries hard to achieve happiness he expects nothing without hard-working. from the beginning gump is running and he even runs across the us, symbolically ""chasing the american dream"". gump also is religious person, after returning home from china he says that people in china do not go to the church or he goes to the church to pray in order to have a big shrimping. forrest also uses liberal gestures, like participating in anti-vietnam war rally and taking part in a tv show to talk about his experience in china, telling that chinese people are deprived from freedom and basic human rights. gump is the symbol of conservative values and jenny is the symbol of liberal values but at the end jenny is dead but gump as the symbol of the conservatives is the source of maintenance and continuity of the american culture. totally the film was made to appeal to conservatives and invalidate liberals but to promote the american culture even by utilizing liberal values. it also is a condemnation of the counterculture movement of the 1960s and its aftermaths. jennifer hyland wang, movie critic, argued that curran's death to an unnamed virus ""...symbolizes the death of liberal america and the death of the protests that defined a decade [1960s]."" even the main structure of the film crew connote the conservative orientation of the film. steve tisch, one of the producers of the film is a conservative person who has produced other conservative film after forrest gump like knowing and the pursuit of happiness that the later one alongside forrest gump are among the best 25 conservative movies by the national review magazine.";17 December 2010;9;['american', 'american', 'conservative', 'liberal', 'conservative', 'dominant', 'highlighted', 'liberal', 'american', 'liberal', 'conservative', 'american', 'american', 'american', 'important', 'forr', 'devoted', 'good', 'forr', 'present', 'forr', 'loyal', 'good', 'own', 'religious', 'big', 'forr', 'liberal', 'anti', 'vietnam', 'chinese', 'basic', 'human', 'conservative', 'liberal', 'dead', 'american', 'american', 'liberal', 'counterculture', 'unnamed', 'main', 'conservative', 'conservative', 'other', 'conservative', 'forr', 'later', 'forr', 'good', 'conservative'];0.1364583333333333

2119;rezvan-bayati;"america as the country which is always on the ""move"", the land of freedom, growth; these are the core ideas for many hollywood movies. the movie forrest gump can be considered as one of these movies.it has got some elements of american identity. the story of a man who is intellectually and mentally under grown and underdeveloped but he appears to be appropriate and rightful in the works in his world. he becomes an icon and hits the press all over the country. his dreams turn to reality and this shows that your imaginings will come true if you try hard enough and at the same time if you are well equipped to freshness and honesty. surprisingly, he visits three presidents, kennedy, johnson and nixon. he receives honors and makes accomplishments in table tennis, shrimp industry, vietnam war. a ""simple"" man from alabama who travels around the world ""runs"" across america and meets political, cultural figures like mao and john lenon as well. the amazing point that makes the main character of the film, forrest gump, lovable and believable is that he keeps his childhood innocence into maturity probably because he is not very smart; his iq is 75 below the normal point which is 80. on the other hand he remains as a child in mind and soul even though he is physically grown. this can be drawn in the picture which he shows his wounded buttock to the president johnson in the white house while he is receiving his medal of honor. this is the indication for his simplicity. he firmly believes in three things god, his mother and his lifelong love, jenny, which remembers her all the time. although the movie keeps eye on gump's life career but mainly it is depicting different periods of american history. for example, it shows scenes from racial discrimination, vietnam war, kennedy assassination, watergate scandal and so on. in some cases it's hard to distinguish clearly what the genre the movie is, whether it is drama, romance or a satire. it can be argued that the director skillfully amalgamated comedy, drama and documentary into each other. technically speaking, the movie is a flashback and a narrative mode in which the movie starts from showing the viewers that gump is sitting on a bench waiting for a bus. at the same time, he tells the story of his life to different people waiting for the shuttle bus. his story is the tale of the nation and the country and even generally the world as well. visually impressive, the makers could successfully have put gump in scenes with the us presidents. even they could have made it possible to hear from kennedy in footballers' visit at the white house. due to this technicality and specialty it won the academy award for the best visual effects in 1994. the movie is ranked as the 71st of the best motion picture of the all time by (afi) american film institute. gump's capability to be in the right place at the right time makes him exceptional, too. he saves the lives of the american troops in vietnam war while he was looking for his intimate friend buba. once he ran like a wind into the football field and he made part of his life career as a footballer star by being too fast in the matches. he is the one who calls the police and apprises them the weird condition in the hotel which was the lead to disclose the watergate scandal that led to the resignation of nixon. his simplicity and honesty is playing a key role in all these situations. despite being not ""normal"" as the doctor and headmaster tell to gump' mother in the beginning but he makes a very successful life career which makes him well known and much more generous and giving .the lessons that gump are given by his mother are very simple but very helpful. one of them is faith and believes in destiny. to do your best but at the same time to keep your faith and be faithful on what destiny brings about to you, to accept it and ""live"" with your ""life"". the main message of the movie can be ""when there is a will, there is a way."" and as the british people put forward ""honesty is the best policy."" these two are as the secret to happiness which gump finds it in his life. other than that his life is inspiring for many such as lt. dan taylor and even jenny who accuses gump that ""you don't know what love is"" but finally backs and returns to the ""kind but slow-witted"" man to make her own life much more ""meaningful"" and cheerful. she even gave birth to a child and named him ""forrest gump""; a new generation but with the old and respected values and beliefs. forrest gump's tale and world is ours, too; with too many ebbs and flows; with sorrows and joys; with defeats and victories. but the tool and rule to overcome the difficulties is simple; to be honest and hopeful. he is exceptional mentally but not morally. his morals help him to make the ""forrest gump"" an icon in the movie and in the real world as well.";8 January 2011;10;['many', 'forr', 'american', 'underdeveloped', 'appropriate', 'rightful', 'true', 'same', 'equipped', 'simple', 'political', 'cultural', 'amazing', 'main', 'forr', 'lovable', 'believable', 'smart', 'normal', 'other', 'wounded', 'lifelong', 'different', 'american', 'racial', 'hard', 'other', 'narrative', 'same', 'different', 'impressive', 'possible', 'good', 'visual', 'good', 'right', 'right', 'exceptional', 'american', 'intimate', 'fast', 'weird', 'key', 'normal', 'successful', 'generous', 'simple', 'helpful', 'good', 'same', 'faithful', 'main', 'british', 'good', 'other', 'many', 'such', 'kind', 'own', 'meaningful', 'cheerful', 'forr', 'new', 'old', 'respected', 'forr', 'many', 'simple', 'honest', 'hopeful', 'exceptional', 'forr', 'real'];0.2389838231943494

2123;Balutesiah2;"about the film: genre of this film is drama which also includes romance. the film is based on a novel by william groom and produced by paramount communications company. it is directed by robert zemeckis. its executive music producer is joel sill. it was released in the us in 1994 and received many awards such as academy award, golden globe award, and people's choice award. the major characters are: tom hanks (forrest gump) , robin wright( jenny) , sally field( f's mother), gary sinise (lieutenant dan), and mykelti william( bubba(. the story is during the period of presidency of kennedy, johnson, nixon, ford and carter. some part of film happens in vietnam. the film shows that many people did not agree with vietnam war. it also shows ""racism"" in the us. for instance, black students were permitted to enroll in college of alabama just during the summer. during the vietnam war, the ""black panthers"" were shaped against the war and against racism and unequal opportunities for blacks. the protagonist is a low iq boy who does great works but not according to specific reasoning and goal. his mother named him ""forrest"" after the great civil war's hero; general nathan bedford forrest. she believed ""forrest"" reminds him that all people sometimes do things that do make no sense. his actions are really in harmony with his name, for instance, he is a great runner, but as he says in the film, he runs without any reason. when he learns to play ping-pong, he plays without thinking. once in the film, he repeats one of his mother's sentences; ""miracles happen every day"". we can see that his success in any area is somehow a miracle. the feather which is shown at the beginning and end of the film is a means to show the passing of time to a destiny; a destiny in which f's mother believes. lieutenant dan loses his belief in god and in destiny especially after his losing his legs in the war. f.g doubts whether we are destined to do some things-as his mother told- or ""are floating around accidental-like a breeze""- as lieutenant dan believed- or both. plot the story is about a man named forrest gump. it involves two phases; in first phase, f.g speaks about his past life and takes us to different places related to his past experiences. but the events happening for him in second phase are not narrated by him as past memories but are taking place at the same time of being shown. most of the story takes place in first phase. f.g is sitting on a bench and waiting for a bus in savannah. he has a small suitcase in which he carries all the important things he has. during the first phase, he talks about his life to strangers who sit on that bench for a short while and wait for buses. now, his life story: f.g and his mother live in alabama. he was a boy with low iq, but his mother sent him to school. when he grew up, he got a football scholarship in college because he could run very fast. the college put him in the all-america team. after five years of playing football, he got a college degree. after his graduation, he applied at army. in the army he made friendship with a person named bubba who was crazy about shrimping and suggested him to buy a shrimping boat after coming back home. the army sent them to vietnam. his officer was lieutenant dan. in the war, f.g and lieutenant dan were shot and bubba was killed. in the field of war, he helped other soldiers very much. he ran very fast and rescued injured soldiers from the field. so, he was awarded the medal of honor by president johnson. because he was shot, he was sent to hospital. there, he learned ping-pong from another soldier. he could play it as well as running. so, the army wanted him to play ping-pong as the special service instead of returning to vietnam. after some years, the army decided he should be on the all-american ping-pong team. the army sent the team to china. he and the team were the first americans who visited china after many long years. after coming back to america, he became a national celebrity and was given the congressional medal of honor. with ping-pong team, he met president nixon. after nixon's resignation, the army discharged him and his service was up. after his being discharged, he bought a shrimping boat and worked on it by lieutenant dan. they made a lot of money in a few years and became the leaders of bubba-gump shrimping corporation. lieutenant dan's belief in god strengthened after being by f.g and seeing miracle-like situations like hurricane carmen which led to their progress in shrimping. in second phase, we see the events at the same time as they happen. he marries his girlfriend ""jenny"". jenny dies because of illness. he takes care of his son whose name was ""forrest"" too. his son was a smart boy. at the end of the film, the scenes are repeated with a difference: the roles of f.g and his mother are replaced by f.g and his son.";30 January 2011;8;['paramount', 'executive', 'many', 'such', 'golden', 'major', 'forr', 'sally', 'many', 'black', 'black', 'unequal', 'low', 'great', 'specific', 'forr', 'great', 'civil', 'general', 'forr', 'great', 'accidental', 'forr', 'first', 'past', 'different', 'past', 'second', 'same', 'most', 'first', 'small', 'important', 'first', 'short', 'low', 'crazy', 'other', 'injured', 'special', 'american', 'first', 'many', 'long', 'national', 'congressional', 'few', 'like', 'second', 'same', 'forr', 'smart'];0.1277187902187902

""forrest gump"" demonstrates that doesn't matter if you are different. it doesn't matter if you have a handicap. you can decide how to deal with it. every human being is worth exactly the same, and even if you are in a position of disadvantage you don't have to be depressed. all that you need is the will to look at the bright side of life. all you need is the feeling for true love, friendship and the determination to make yourself and others happy. at times in our life we will realize that things will happen to us that are out of control, but the most important thing is to remember that they way we react to these things is in our control. intelligence isn't the most important attribute in life. the truly important values are happiness, friendship, love, courage and freedom. the film forrest gump proves that our lives are a combination of destiny and floating through life like a feather in the breeze. the film ""forrest gump"" is very similar to the film ""benjamin button."" both of these movies involve characters, forrest and benjamin, who are faced with, and overcome the unique challenges in their lives. forrest is mentally slower than most average people are, but he proves that determination and perseverance are just as valuable in life, and with the refusal to give up, anything is possible. benjamin button, played by brad pitt, encounters his own unique setbacks in his life. he is born with a disorder that makes him age backwards. he's born as a wrinkly baby who is aged as if he were in his 80's. as he gets older his age makes him appear younger. although this may seem like a big setback for some benjamin preservers throughout his life and accomplishes many incredible feats just as forrest did in ""forrest gump."" the special effects in the film ""forrest gump"" help demonstrate the theme of the movie. a perfect example of how the special effects support the theme of this movie is that lt. dan, who is injured in vietnam, is portrayed throughout the movie as having no legs. in all actuality the actor playing lt. dan does have his legs throughout the film. the use of computer generated imaging helps the audience see lt. dan throughout the movie after vietnam with no legs. lt. dan, although very depressed early on after his injury overcomes his new fate and becomes a successful, functioning member of society and even gets fake legs in the end of the movie. it is obvious through lt. dan, much like forrest, that in life it doesn't matter if you are different than everyone else, what matters is what you make of your life. you may be drifting through life in a breeze but with some good decisions and a little destiny everything can work out in the end. symbolism is another element that helped contribute to the theme of forrest gump. the white feather that is present in both the beginning and end of the film is representative of numerous characters in the movie. each character is floating through life ""accidental like on a breeze."" forrest is most representative of this. after briefly learning of his character, it would never be expected of him to accomplish the things he does in his life. it seems that his fate is almost ""accidental like."" forrest never really planned his life out, things just kept falling into place for him. the symbolism of the feather is also indicative of jenny's character in the film as well. jenny drifts through life, most of the time struggling, never trusting herself or anyone else around her. she drifts through phase to phase in her life, but in the end, like destiny, she ends up back with forrest. even though forrest has some disadvantages in his life, he doesn't let these hold him back. he lives his life like the feather in the wind that is present in both the beginning and the end of the film. forrest goes through life wondering what will happen next for him, longing for jenny's love, but letting the winds of his life guide him throughout his journeys. and in the end, like destiny, forrest and jenny get to be married together and start a family.";16 June 2011;9;['forr', 'most', 'below', 'average', 'many', 'magnificent', 'many', 'significant', 'full', 'forr', 'many', 'full', 'true', 'forr', 'lifelong', 'forr', 'many', 'live', 'important', 'forr', 'numerous', 'forr', 'many', 'forr', 'different', 'human', 'worth', 'same', 'bright', 'true', 'happy', 'important', 'important', 'important', 'forr', 'forr', 'similar', 'forr', 'unique', 'forr', 'slow', 'most', 'average', 'valuable', 'possible', 'brad', 'own', 'unique', 'wrinkly', 'old', 'young', 'big', 'benjamin', 'many', 'incredible', 'forr', 'forr', 'special', 'forr', 'perfect', 'special', 'depressed', 'new', 'successful', 'fake', 'obvious', 'forr', 'different', 'good', 'little', 'forr', 'white', 'present', 'representative', 'numerous', 'accidental', 'forr', 'accidental', 'forr', 'indicative', 'most', 'forr', 'forr', 'present', 'forr', 'forr'];0.2810094997594997

2146;enricobonanno;"how can you start talking about a movie like ""forrest gump"" without being bias on the whole hype that has been surrounding it since it came out. for someone who actually knows about films, it is a personal insult that the academy awards considered this movie to be in higher standards than... pulp fiction the shawshank redemption quiz show and even four weddings and a funeral and how could robert zemeckis' (i hate that name) work be considered better than... krzysztof kieslowski for red!!!!!!!!!!! quentin tarantino for pulp fiction!!!!!! woody allen for bullets over broadway!!!!!! robert redford for quiz show!!!!!!! not to mention that the academy is such an airhead that frank darabont the director of the shawshank redemption wasn't even nominated!!!!!! let's consider many important factors for this movie to be loved blindly, without a true sense of reflection and observation. number 1: i have to much time on my hands, number 2: it stars tom hanks who undoubtedly represents the white, flawless way of american life. he is the jimmy stewart of today (that could not hurt). he is talented, but highly overrated. he has some excellent performances, but he always seems the same to me. he could never have the talent that actors like gary oldman, ed harris, sean penn, russell crowe or denzel washington have to reinvent themselves every time in a different role. he is the typical american male sweetheart, regardless everybody loves him. his star power more than his ability as an actor helped this movie to get sold and appreciated. number 3: stories about characters with disabilities always, and i mean always sell in hollywood (rainman, i am sam, nell, my left foot, awakenings, one flew over the cuckoo's nest) not that i am saying that these great films compare to forrest gump, but the idea itself whether good or bad sells. number 4: the history of the united states is taken rather lightly in this movie, all the events that take place around the character happen without his knowledge in the most unconvincing of methods. racism, vietnam, meeting a number of american presidents, his unheard speech at lincoln memorial, the hippies, drugs, bubba gump shrimp, apple computers, amongst other historic events in which the character gets involved, but does not seem to grasp the magnitude of those very events. he is mentally handicaped as we are shown from the beginning, so because we are suppose to believe that he is emotionally handicap too. he never seems to get emotionally affected by anything, unless it involves jenny, even then it does not appear to be convincing or moving in any way. number 5: the story itself appears to me as manipulative, sappy, uncompromised and made in half measures. it touches certain issues, but never dwells on them with justice. the ingenuity of the character, his disability seems enough reason to feel that all the events are seen with a certain depth. which they are not. it is unfair, because hanks' charm and gump's likeable stupidity work as a hook to entangle people's emotions. it never allows for anyone to make an effort to see beyond the story and into the gut of what was attempted to be said. number 6: stupid moments, everybody loves them, hollywood is an expert of what people like and what they want to spend their money on. gump begins a ""marathon"" across the country for no real reason at all, half way decides he's had enough, by then the entire country was following him (as a metaphor for the movie itself). elvis presley the king or rock ends up as a youngster, who knows how, in gump's house as a visitor. gump who has braces in his legs miraclously teaches him the dance moves that made him famous. something that i personally cannot consider to be taken lightly is an issue like the vietnam war, but forrest somehow manages to run in and out the jungle in the middle war saving people left and right. maybe zemeckis never read a book or even watched a film (apocalypse now, platoon, full metal jacket, casualties of war) to illustrate him on what really happened on that war. young soldiers were getting killed by the dozen. forrest gump is a fairy tale based on unfounded grounds and hypocritical notions of ""reality"". oliver stone dedicated his film platoon to the american soldiers in vietnam, he went there for real and saw what happened. zemeckis has decided to ignore all these factors and still believe that his adored character could even be immune to a experience like vietnam (in every aspect possible). to conclude please do not let yourself be manipulated, not just because forrest gump won the oscar for best picture makes it one of the best films of the 90's. the ""sweetness"" of this movie is not even sweet, its only the a ploy, a sales pitch of the american dream. in 20 years who will remember forrest gump, and more importantly who will remember that film when the shawshank redemption and pulp fiction are still in people's memories for real reasons. they are art films, forrest gump the oscar's favorite. and seriously folks if you haven't seen kieslowski's red run over to blockbuster and rent it. its the end of the color trilogy. then you'll know what we mean. thank you. viva el cine!!!!";15 January 2004;2;['forr', 'whole', 'personal', 'high', 'tarantino', 'many', 'important', 'true', 'much', 'white',

2160;tru_blond_2;i believe that forrest gump had the criteria for a great movie including its plot, characters, rating, and graphics. the plot is one everyone can relate to. the plot consists of someone not fitting in and breaking through the standards that people placed on him and finding his true love. the actors that are playing these roles could not have been more perfect. forrest is an average man with a very low iq but he has an optimistic view of the world. tom hanks plays forrest and he plays it well. along with mykelti williamson playing forrest's very good friend bubba blue. there are many actors and characters in the movie, but every role was successfully played out to its full potential. the rating on this site is an 8.7 out of 10. this rating is an accurate one because it reflects not just what one or two people think of it, but a multitude of people. the movie won six academy awards including best picture. an 8.7 is a good rating, it could be even higher for the amount of awards it got and how many people loved it. the graphics, for when the film was made, were great. the war scenes, the presidential scenes, and the segment with elvis presley and all the other famous characters, were portrayed well. it made the movie seem less fictional and more relatable. with the great plot, awesome characters, accurate rating, and exciting graphics, the movie forrest gump is a must-see.;31 January 2012;9;['forr', 'great', 'true', 'perfect', 'forr', 'average', 'low', 'optimistic', 'forr', 'forr', 'good', 'many', 'full', 'accurate', 'good', 'good', 'high', 'many', 'great', 'presidential', 'other', 'famous', 'fictional', 'relatable', 'great', 'awesome', 'accurate', 'exciting', 'forr'];0.4611904761904762

2193;s-hothi;written by my daughter.... this film has to be one of my favourite films of all time and not just because of their accent but there extremely funny impressions. tom hanks plays forrest very well and in fact so well that he won six academy awards including best picture. although i am a girl i think it wouldn't be that bad to see how it was like to have forrest's point of view and his experiences. there are also lots of things that you can learn from this film. so i would agree that you should definitely watch it ! i think forrest is more of a child than a grown up which is also why i like him. this film cheers you up, makes you laugh and appreciate life.;6 April 2013;10;['favourite', 'funny', 'forr', 'good', 'bad', 'forr', 'forr', 'more'];0.1875

2195;alex_ryde;"having seen the movie and read the book, i feel it necessary to make an observation. even though the movie is based on the book, it is remarkably different. in the book, forrest goes into space; bubba is white and meets forrest in college; forrest runs as a candidate in the senate; forrest does not serve under lieutenant dan in the army, but meets him in hospital afterwards; forrest's mother and jenny do not die (they do kick it in gump & co. though); and there is also forrest's wrestling career and his friendship with the orangutang sue that should be mentioned too. the book is a fantastic piece of literature and should be on every college syllabus everywhere. but if the film had been taken directly from the book, i doubt it would have been so successful. the film includes fantastic sequences (forrest running and influencing pop culture; forrest directly influencing john lennon) that do not appear in the book. the way forrest is tied into the last 40 years of american history is great, if a little convenient. i wonder though, whether the sequel will follow gump & co. or whether they will create another new monster.";12 April 2007;10;['necessary', 'different', 'forr', 'white', 'forr', 'forr', 'forr', 'forr', 'forr', 'fantastic', 'successful', 'fantastic', 'forr', 'forr', 'forr', 'last', 'american', 'great', 'little', 'convenient', 'new'];0.208987603305785

2200;ahmedyousryhafez;i am a big fan of tom hanks and i have enjoyed pretty much all of his movies and i think forest gump is my favorite hanks film of all time. it's such a nice story that is told in a clever way making you feel like a child once again, the main character played by hanks is lovable, you can't help but hope for the best for him and simply just want to reach out and tell him everything will be ok. the movie has a realistic feel even thought it's fictional but this is because of how it goes though real time events, the main reasons why i love this movie so much is because it's like reading a book the story line takes you to another time and other place and the only bad thing is when it ends and you bounce back to reality.;10 February 2015;10;['big', 'favorite', 'nice', 'clever', 'main', 'lovable', 'good', 'ok', 'realistic', 'fictional', 'real', 'main', 'other', 'only', 'bad'];0.1946428571428571

2202;johnmccahill;"forrest gump was absolutely incredible. there are many reasons for this; the movie was acted elegantly being one of them. also, the story line was rivetingly moving. lastly, there are many quotes from the film that simply unforgettable. those are the reasons why forrest gump is so incredible. first of all, forrest gump is such an amazing film because the acting made this movie so memorable for everyone who would watch it. even though tom hanks has had many other amazing performances such as woody from toy story, his role as forrest is by far the most memorable in my opinion. furthermore, robin wright does an incredible job as jenny, who is forrest's true love in the movie. the combination of these to stars was instantly recognized by many as a recipe for a film that would warm the hearts of many for decades to come. that is why the acting in forrest gump helps to make this motion picture so amazing. secondly, a reason that i feel makes this movie so incredible is that i have never seen a movie that has had a story line that is so moving. there are so many events that happen in this movie that make me want to cry because they make you feel so good inside that these things have happened. for instance, when forrest meets up with jenny fret not seeing her for a few years and meets his son was incredible. he asks jenny as his son gets on the bus, ""is he smart?"" jenny responds with, ""he's the smartest in his class."" this scene is without a doubt the most moving scene that i have ever seen in a movie, ever. that is why i feel that the story line of this movie is more riveting, heart-warming, and moving than any other movie out there. however, there are a couple elements in this movie that some people would view negatively about this masterfully created movie. some events are completely preposterous, but they help make the movie's plot tremendously, and they make you appreciate reality more. for instance, there is no way that any human would be able to run across the country three times in a row only stopping to eat and use the restroom. however, this event makes the movie interesting and only makes you realize how far someone can go to overcome adversity. finally, the last reason that i have that contribute to the masterpiece that is forrest gump is that some of the quotes that were made throughout the film are very memorable. one quote made by forrest makes you really think about life; ""my momma always said, 'life was like a box of chocolates. you never know what you're gonna get.'"" this is possible the greatest movie quote of all time. another quote, which was made by mrs. gump; ""you have to do the best with what god gave you."" this quote makes you realize that there are always going to be struggles in life, but you have to make the best out of everything that god puts upon you. that is how the quotes from forrest gump help make this movie one of the best films of all time. in conclusion, i challenge you, the reader, to watch the masterpiece forrest gump and look out for the choir group, ""the hallelujah singers."" this is a group led by marleena smalls of beaufort, who played bubba's mother in the movie. also, watch for more memorable quotes, amazing performances by actors, and events that will move you an make you feel warm inside. forrest gump is truly one of the greatest films of all time, and it is both a memorable movies ever; this is because of all of the reasons that have been stated above.";9 November 2012;10;['forr', 'incredible', 'many', 'many', 'unforgettable', 'forr', 'incredible', 'forr', 'amazing', 'memorable', 'many', 'other', 'amazing', 'such', 'woody', 'forr', 'memorable', 'incredible', 'forr', 'true', 'many', 'many', 'forr', 'amazing', 'incredible', 'many', 'good', 'forr', 'few', 'incredible', 'smart', 'smart', 'moving', 'riveting', 'other', 'preposterous', 'more', 'able', 'interesting', 'last', 'forr', 'memorable', 'forr', 'possible', 'great', 'good', 'good', 'forr', 'good', 'forr', 'memorable', 'amazing', 'warm', 'forr', 'great', 'memorable'];0.5006968641114984
2203;tjcpug;"the movie forest gump was the best movie that tom hanks ever stared in. tom hanks has stared in hundreds of movies that were instant hits but forest gump was by far his top performance. there are also many aspects that make this movie the top movie of its time. one scene particularly of the movie really describes what kind of man the main character is and, gives a big glimpse of who he is. tom hanks has stared in many hit movies; like, the green mile, saving private ryan, and the da vinci code. this movie is different that other because it really suits the personality of tom hanks and, in the making of this movie it is obvious that he had a lot of fun portraying the role of forest gump. the character forest gump is portrayed as a man who as a child was bullied a lot as a child because of his leg brace and lack of intelligence. he never new the importance of his life. as a child he met elvis presley and gave him the inspiration to do his dance moves that were considered atrocious in that day in age. also had a great talent for running as he discovered as he was running from bullies who were on bicycles and a truck chasing him through the fields. as he grew up he didn't gain much more brain power but gained the power of care, empathy, and love. this screen play is sure to make you cry but laugh just as much. that is exactly what the directer winston groom was trying to achieve with this film. furthermore, this film is considered by me and thousands of other people across the globe. this movie won 26 awards and nominated for countless others. critics have made this a easy 8.7 but, i would give it a ten. sure to make laugh cry and all of the in between. this was the best movie made its century because of the selfless acts that the main character, forest gump had done for his country and those around him. his lack of knowledge on curtain subjects he makes up in his empathy for others and the selfless acts for his friends and family. although, forest talks funny and some may consider this annoying. this is a long movie that jumps from scene to scene and one has to be deeply involved in the story line to understand it. people may also question the authenticity of all acts that forest gump did. people may also get confused with all of the character that are introduced and later plays a important role. nevertheless, forest is a small town man who listens to what he is told and always remembered the quote that everyone has hear one time or another, "" mama always said life was like a box of chocolates you open it up and you never know what your going to get."" that really meant a lot to forest because he keeps a open mind to all options and everyone has a place in his heart. for example he just joined the military, and met someone named, bubu. bubu and forest soon became good friends and when bubu got injured in the battle field, forest ran back into the dense jungle riddled with gun shots and explosions in search of his friend bubu with out thinking. this really gave a big inside view on the character of forest gump. however, the choice is up to you. do you think this is a movie that you would thoroughly enjoy? or just another movie that goes down in your list of movies that you wish to see. it just depends on the kind of movie you enjoy and connect to. if you like comedy, romance, war all in one movie, then i would bump it right up to the top of your list of things to watch. forest gump";13 November 2012;10;['good', 'instant', 'top', 'many', 'top', 'main', 'big', 'many', 'hit', 'green', 'private', 'different', 'other', 'obvious', 'atrocious', 'great', 'more', 'sure', 'much', 'other', 'countless', 'easy', 'sure', 'good', 'main', 'funny', 'annoying', 'long', 'confused', 'important', 'small', 'open', 'good', 'dense', 'big', 'inside'];0.1614583333333333
2204;jackcox1996;i do not mean to sound like a 'fanboy', but this film was simply amazing. it is one of the rare films in the modern age to teach the audience a lesson, a moral even - pure good deeds, and a kind heart are always welcomed within society. tom hanks played forrest extremely well. even in the first scene where we see him sitting on a bench, without dialogue we can tell that this character is mentally challenged. he barely even uses body language. hanks plays forest extremely well through all the different stages off his later life. forest is just a nice character, not wanting to hurt anyone or anything. a real heart-warming character. this film has been beautifully directed by robert zemeckis. i am a fan of zemeckis, he has directed other favourite films of mine such as the back to the future trilogy, cast away and the polar express, but this is his best work yet. the way he makes the audience feel the characters is very well done. whilst watching this, i felt so many different feelings such as guilt, sadness and joy - which is what this film is all about. his work on forrest gump has been recognised, as he won best director at the academy awards, as well as five others. whilst watching this film, i and i'm pretty sure everyone else who has seen it, felt the feelings of forrest. from his school days getting bullied and his beloved bubba dying in vietnam, to receiving a medal of honour and becoming a millionaire. i cannot emphasise enough, that tom hanks played this role to perfection. i love the way the film is told through forrest. he tells people at a bus stop the story of his life, and the people listening in really represent the audience, as they get drawn into the story and simply do not want it to end. i also like the way in which zemeckis has included the white feather at the beginning and end of the film. as a whole, this film is brilliant, and i recommend it to absolutely anyone. it is so inspiring, and everyone can be like forrest.;12 November 2012;10;['amazing', 'rare', 'modern', 'moral', 'pure', 'good', 'kind', 'first', 'different', 'later', 'nice', 'real', 'other', 'favourite', 'such', 'future', 'polar', 'good', 'many', 'different', 'such', 'forr', 'good', 'sure', 'forr', 'beloved', 'forr', 'white', 'brilliant', 'inspiring', 'forr'];0.3077380952380952

2219;julicastrorivas;"movie critic title: ""forrest gump"" by: julian castro ""forrest gump"" is a great movie that almost everybody that likes to watch movies, has some day seen this film, and have thought it is a great movie. i have seen recently this movie two times and in my entire life i have seen it 5 or 6 times and every single time i see it, i become more satisfied and proud that still good movies can be created. this movie was directed by robert zemeckis, and its main actors are tom hanks as forrest gump and robin wright as jenny curran, forrest's love throughout the entire movie. this film is a dramatic comedy because you feel as if you were the character, so you acquaint with the protagonist and you fell what he feels during the film. but also this movie has very funny scenes that make you laugh and enjoy the movie much more. this movies takes places in various settings were forrest gump goes throughout the film. the most important places are greenbow, alabama which was his hometown, also savannah, georgia, vietnam, new york city and washington d.c. these settings are great places to develop the plot in the film. forrest gump is a person that has mental trouble; he has a type of mental retardation. this disability doesn't stop him of doing all of the accomplishments that he achieves throughout the story. what forrest does is that he follows what his heart wants so he does anything humanly possible to achieve his goals. but gump's most important goal is to achieve the love of his life, jenny. forrest met her since their childhood and since then gump felt in love with her. so throughout the whole story he tries to achieve his aim with her. in this, very well directed film; the actors did a great job making their specific roles. for example the protagonist of the story forrest gump (tom hanks) was a great actor in this film, because he never overacted in any scene of the movie. hanks is the perfect actor to do the role of the main character because has a lot of experience in doing a lot of films and most of them are loved by the public. so my personal thought is that tom hanks was chosen to be the protagonist actor because of his great quality in the art of acting. also a great actress was robin wright and she did the role of jenny curran. she did a great job in her part and she also has the natural ability of being another great main actress and does it flawlessly without overacting. robert zemeckis (director) did a great decision by choosing those actors and because of his awesome decision this movie turn out being a great movie. ""forrest gump"", in general, it has very unique scenes. personally, i liked the beginning of the film because i thought it was a very unique part, which forrest starts telling some of his life experiences and things that happened to him that had a big impact on him, to a woman that was seated next to him in a bus. this is the only movie that i've seen that it starts like this one. also a very nice part in the film is when forrest was talking with jenny about his experience in vietnam, and jenny was paying close attention to what was forrest saying to her. this was an amazing part because jenny told forrest, after his experiences, that she loved him. this was a very powerful part because we see that forrest felt great after those words. this movie is known for having many different moral and life lessons. this movie tells us that people that have mental problems such as forrest gump can succeed. the only limitation for you is you, this means that i you want to achieve something no matter what, if you have dedication and effort to achieve that something, you will reach that goal. also another moral lesson that this movie shows us is that war is not needed to have an agreement. this movie tells us that war is bad and it can affect many people's lives and families. also the last lesson that ""forrest gump"" taught us was that don't give up, what we need to do is to try as hard as we can to pass through the obstacles that life puts us in front. a clear example of this lesson is forrest, life was hard to him because he was handicapped but with some effort and hard work he succeeded in everything he did. i think people that watch this movie will see similar moral lesson, because the movie is trying to teach us the lessons that i mentioned in the paragraph. this pg-13 film is a great movie that anybody that is above 13 years old can watch. but i specially recommended it to people that failed in life, so that this movies teaches them that they still have an opportunity to stand up from that failure and learn from it. i would not recommend this movie to people that don't have a open mind, because they wont learn from their errors or from their mistakes, but generally i recommended to almost everybody. finally, this movie is a marvelous piece of art, because it is wonderful movie to watch and every time you see it you learn something new that will help throughout life or in future real life situations. scale of 1-10: 9.5 julian castro is a 10th grader critic from lincoln school. he is from san jose, costa rica and is 16 years old. this critic is made for a film app elective class. by practicing and doing more critics he will become a master in the critic area, that's why this exercise was ordered by the professor to do.";4 June 2013;9;['forr', 'forr', 'great', 'great', 'entire', 'single', 'satisfied', 'proud', 'good', 'main', 'forr', 'forr', 'entire', 'dramatic', 'funny', 'more', 'various', 'forr', 'important', 'great', 'forr', 'mental', 'mental', 'forr', 'possible', 'important', 'forr', 'whole', 'great', 'specific', 'forr', 'great', 'perfect', 'main', 'most', 'personal', 'great', 'great', 'great', 'natural', 'great', 'main', 'great', 'awesome', 'great', 'forr', 'general', 'unique', 'unique', 'forr', 'big', 'only', 'nice', 'forr', 'close', 'forr', 'amazing', 'forr', 'powerful', 'forr', 'great', 'many', 'different', 'moral', 'mental', 'such', 'forr', 'only', 'moral', 'bad', 'many', 'last', 'forr', 'clear', 'forr', 'hard', 'handicapped', 'hard', 'similar', 'moral', 'great', 'old', 'open', 'marvelous', 'wonderful', 'new', 'future', 'real', 'old', 'elective', 'more', 'critic'];0.3108444695401218

2227;blackbaryam;"i've never met anyone like forrest gump in a movie before, and for that matter i've never seen a movie quite like ""forrest gump."" any attempt to describe him will risk making the movie seem more conventional than it is, but let me try. it's a comedy, i guess. or maybe a drama. or a dream. the screenplay by eric roth has the complexity of modern fiction, not the formulas of modern movies. its hero, played by tom hanks, is a thoroughly decent man with an iq of 75, who manages between the 1950s and the 1980s to become involved in every major event in american history. and he survives them all with only honesty and niceness as his shields. and yet this is not a heartwarming story about a mentally retarded man. that cubbyhole is much too small and limiting for forrest gump. the movie is more of a meditation on our times, as seen through the eyes of a man who lacks cynicism and takes things for exactly what they are. watch him carefully and you will understand why some people are criticized for being ""too clever by half."" forrest is clever by just exactly enough. tom hanks may be the only actor who could have played the role. i can't think of anyone else as gump, after seeing how hanks makes him into a person so dignified, so straight-ahead. the performance is a breathtaking balancing act between comedy and sadness, in a story rich in big laughs and quiet truths. forrest is born to an alabama boardinghouse owner (sally field) who tries to correct his posture by making him wear braces, but who never criticizes his mind. when forrest is called ""stupid,"" his mother tells him, ""stupid is as stupid does,"" and forrest turns out to be incapable of doing anything less than profound. also, when the braces finally fall from his legs, it turns out he can run like the wind. that's how he gets a college football scholarship, in a life story that eventually becomes a running gag about his good luck. gump the football hero becomes gump the medal of honor winner in vietnam, and then gump the ping-pong champion, gump the shrimp boat captain, gump the millionaire stockholder (he gets shares in a new ""fruit company"" named apple computer), and gump the man who runs across america and then retraces his steps. it could be argued that with his iq of 75 forrest does not quite understand everything that happens to him. not so. he understands everything he needs to know, and the rest, the movie suggests, is just surplus. he even understands everything that's important about love, although jenny, the girl he falls in love with in grade school and never falls out of love with, tells him, ""forrest, you don't know what love is."" she is a stripper by that time. the movie is ingenious in taking forrest on his tour of recent american history. the director, robert zemeckis, is experienced with the magic that special effects can do (his credits include the ""back to the future"" movies and ""who framed roger rabbit""), and here he uses computerized visual legerdemain to place gump in historic situations with actual people. forrest stands next to the schoolhouse door with george wallace, he teaches elvis how to swivel his hips, he visits the white house three times, he's on the dick cavett show with john lennon, and in a sequence that will have you rubbing your eyes with its realism, he addresses a vietnam-era peace rally on the mall in washington. special effects are also used in creating the character of forrest's vietnam friend lt. dan (gary sinise), a ron kovic type who quite convincingly loses his legs. using carefully selected tv clips and dubbed voices, zemeckis is able to create some hilarious moments, as when lbj examines the wound in what forrest describes as ""my butt-ox."" and the biggest laugh in the movie comes after nixon inquires where forrest is staying in washington, and then recommends the watergate. (that's not the laugh, just the setup.) as forrest's life becomes a guided tour of straight-arrow america, jenny (played by robin wright) goes on a parallel tour of the counterculture. she goes to california, of course, and drops out, tunes in, and turns on. she's into psychedelics and flower power, antiwar rallies and love-ins, drugs and needles. eventually it becomes clear that between them forrest and jenny have covered all of the landmarks of our recent cultural history, and the accommodation they arrive at in the end is like a dream of reconciliation for our society. what a magical movie.";24 February 2014;10;['forr', 'forr', 'conventional', 'modern', 'modern', 'decent', 'involved', 'major', 'american', 'only', 'retarded', 'small', 'forr', 'more', 'clever', 'forr', 'clever', 'only', 'dignified', 'straight', 'breathtaking', 'rich', 'big', 'quiet', 'forr', 'forr', 'stupid', 'stupid', 'stupid', 'forr', 'incapable', 'less', 'profound', 'good', 'new', 'forr', 'important', 'forr', 'ingenious', 'forr', 'recent', 'american', 'special', 'computerized', 'visual', 'historic', 'actual', 'forr', 'special', 'forr', 'kovic', 'able', 'hilarious', 'forr', 'big', 'forr', 'forr', 'straight', 'parallel', 'antiwar', 'clear', 'forr', 'recent', 'cultural', 'magical'];0.0863246249874157

2249;boisthebomb;"this movie is excellent because of its supporting characters. the movie takes place during the 1950's to 1970's, and follows the journey of a simple man living in alabama, named forrest gump. the movie starts off with him describing his childhood to a complete stranger, while waiting for a bus at the bus stop, and continues to tell his story to several different strangers. when he is telling his story he reveals that he fought in vietnam, met a few presidents, and even won the medal of honor. throughout his story, forrest has a huge impact on the people in his life, which also have the same effect on him. i like the movie forrest gump because the plot hooks you right from the beginning, with supporting characters that make their own unique contribution to forrest's life. in forrest gump there are four supporting characters named mama, lieutenant dan, jenny, and bubba. each of these four supporting characters has an effect on forrest's overall story. mama is forrest's mother, and is the foundation for his life. mama is the character who raised him, taught him right from wrong, and was always able to help him by explaining the aspects of life in a unique way. for example, when forrest asks what happened to his father, his mother says ""he is on vacation"" and uses this to explain that the father left them. lieutenant dan is the lieutenant in charge of forrest while he is serving in vietnam. lieutenant dan is the man that inspires forrest to be a better person, and to never leave a man behind. after vietnam, the two of them go into the shrimping business together and make a lot of money. initially when forrest first meets lieutenant dan, dan is very hostile. once they go into the shrimping business together, forrest mentions that dan has ""coming to jesus"" moment, which i think was influenced by forrest. jenny curran is in my opinion the most important supporting character in the entire movie, because she is constantly forrest's object of affection. in the beginning of the movie, they first meet on the school bus, where forrest compares jenny to an angel. from that point on, they become best friends and is mentioned that they are ""like peas and carrots"". in every significant event in forrest's life, forrest always mentions something about jenny or that he misses her. they have several encounters throughout the entire movie, with one of them resulting to parenthood for jenny and forrest. towards the end of the movie, jenny reveals that she has some kind of virus but the doctors do not know what it is, and ends up asking forrest to marry her. forrest and jenny get married, but unfortunately jenny dies shortly after. this leaves forrest to raise their son on his own. bubba is the last supporting character, and is forrest's other best friend, besides jenny. forrest meets bubba in vietnam, and persuades forrest to go into the shrimping business. overall this is a must-see movie because of its use of supporting characters to heavily influence the main character's thought process and way of life. it is more interesting to watch a movie or tv show when you care not only about the main character, but the supporting characters as well. you're more intrigued to watch the entire movie because you want to know what the resolution is for everyone, because it is fairly easy to predict the outcome for the main character a majority of the time. in conclusion, i like the movie forrest gump because the plot hooks you right from the beginning, with supporting characters that make their own unique contribution to forrest's life.";24 September 2013;9;['excellent', 'simple', 'forr', 'complete', 'several', 'different', 'few', 'forr', 'huge', 'same', 'forr', 'own', 'unique', 'forr', 'bubba', 'forr', 'overall', 'forr', 'able', 'unique', 'forr', 'forr', 'forr', 'well', 'forr', 'first', 'hostile', 'forr', 'forr', 'important', 'entire', 'forr', 'forr', 'good', 'significant', 'forr', 'forr', 'several', 'entire', 'forr', 'forr', 'forr', 'forr', 'own', 'last', 'forr', 'other', 'good', 'forr', 'forr', 'main', 'interesting', 'main', 'entire', 'easy', 'main', 'forr', 'own', 'unique'];0.2643229166666667

2282;Hamish_D;"""life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what your gonna get..."" and that famous quote begins a masterful story of a man named forrest gump. tom hanks plays forrest gump who basically tells his life stories to people on a park bench around the bus stop. his life stories include the vietnam war, genius ping pong skills, being in the all american football team, meeting president kennedy, great running, making friends, falling in love with a childhood friend and being in a great shrimp company. we see his life story as flashbacks and we enjoy them, of course. i've never seen a movie quite like forrest gump. this movie made me laugh, cry and warmed my heart. robin wright portrays jenny, forrest's best friend since they were six years old and sally field is fantastic as forrest's wise and caring mother. but the character that is considered to be my favorite character is gary sinise as lt. dan, who was with forrest and the rest of the troops during the war. at first, his character's lifestyle made me feel sad, but later on lt. dan thanks forrest for saving his life and enjoyed life as it is. forrest saved his life during the war and later on, he had to be amputated. this movie is one of my personal favorites and robert zemeckis' best film that he directed. the ending works out perfect too. forrest is at the park bench because he's meeting jenny and an elderly woman tells him that the apartment she lives in, is just around the corner. forrest hops out of his seat and manages to find jenny and also finds out that he is the cause of jenny's 8 year old son. afterwards, forrest and jenny get married and lt. dan shows up at the wedding with his new fiancee. now we see that lt. dan is stabled and has changed his life. later on, jenny tells forrest that she has an unrecognizable virus. at first i thought that it was because of jenny's bad decisions in the past. and then jenny passed away of sexually transmitted diseases. we later see forrest talking to jenny's grave and promising her that he will take care of their son... and he does. i have to be honest with you, when i first saw forrest gump, i was disappointed because of jenny's death, but then i saw it again and i love it. i now realize that it was meant to be. she can't just live, knowing that she made risky and bad decisions. but the movie still had a heartwarming and sweet ending, involving forrest saying goodbye to his son, who is going to school. this beautiful scene reminds me of forrest's first day at school. and as forrest says goodbye, the feather that he collected at the start of the film, flew out of the curious george book and it took us away from a film that is built to perfection. definitely one of my classic favorites.";20 January 2014;10;['famous', 'masterful', 'forr', 'forr', 'american', 'great', 'childhood', 'great', 'forr', 'good', 'old', 'sally', 'fantastic', 'forr', 'wise', 'caring', 'favorite', 'gary', 'forr', 'sad', 'forr', 'forr', 'personal', 'good', 'perfect', 'forr', 'elderly', 'forr', 'old', 'forr', 'married', 'lt', 'new', 'forr', 'unrecognizable', 'bad', 'forr', 'honest', 'forr', 'disappointed', 'risky', 'bad', 'sweet', 'forr', 'beautiful', 'forr', 'first', 'forr', 'curious', 'classic'];0.2751165501165501

2293;atgreen;on july 6th, 1994, this country was introduced to another movie that will go down as one of the all-time greatest films in united states history. this movie is forrest gump (zemeckis, 1994), and it was directed by robert zemeckis. forrest gump (zemeckis, 1994) will always be known as one of the best films of all times as years go by. it is the story of a simple minded man from greenbow, alabama, named forrest gump, who lives life in the moment and succeeds in everything he does as he finds himself contributing to many historical events of the mid twentieth century without even trying. there are many different aspects to this film that make it great, but there are a few significant ones that stand out among the rest. the significant aspects that make this such a great film include the use of tom hanks, the memorable soundtrack, historical references, and the heart-warming love story. tom hanks is the star in the film forrest gump (zemeckis, 1994) as he plays the role of the main character, forrest gump. tom hanks had been a big time actor in hollywood even prior to his outstanding performance in this movie as he also starred in films such as big, a league of their own, and sleepless in seattle. forrest gump (zemeckis, 1994) was not an easy movie to play the lead role in as he had to play the role as a mentally challenged man with an i.q. of seventy five and keep that role consistent through the entire movie. this role cannot be easily achieved by just anyone, but tom hanks went above and beyond playing the role of forrest gump. tom hanks earned himself an abundance of awards from this movie that consisted of a golden globe, an academy award, a screen actors guild award, and a people's choice award for best actor, becoming only the fourth actor to win consecutive awards. the soundtrack of forrest gump (zemeckis, 1994) is another aspect that makes this movie so great. a movie's soundtrack can really set the tone for a scene, and the soundtrack of forrest gump (zemeckis, 1994) succeeded in setting a good tone with its choice of music. the movie's setting takes place from the mid to late twentieth century, and the movie's soundtrack is mostly based around that time setting with songs from that era. the soundtrack consisted of many 1960 and 1970s artists and bands such as creedence clearwater revival, elvis presley, the beach boys, simon & garfunkel, lynyrd skynyrd, and many more. the soundtrack of the movie really set the feel of the time setting it was placed in. the soundtrack was rated among the top ten for several months in the billboard 200 album chart when the movie was first released. the historical references in this movie make things a little bit more interesting through the way forrest gump somehow finds himself contributing to them. throughout the movie forrest gump found himself in a lot of significant moments of us history without even knowing it. the first reference was in the beginning of the movie when forrest reveals that he was named after nathan bedford forrest, who was the leader of the ku klux klan. another example is when forrest was a young boy his mother had a bed and breakfast, and they had a young musician staying with them by the name of elvis presley. forrest had braces on his legs and was dancing to the music elvis presley was playing on his guitar. this dance that forrest had displayed to presley ended up being presley's signature move when he became famous. later on in forrest's life, he was staying in the watergate hotel where he witnessed the watergate scandal. forrest called the front desk and told them what he saw, and, without even knowing it, he was the reason president nixon was impeached for the watergate scandal. many other significant parts of u.s. history were referenced in the movie such as the vietnam war, in which forrest fought in, the black panthers, the hippie movement, and even more. this movie does a good job of showing how the u.s. progressed from the 1960s through the 1980s to make this movie more interesting. forrest gump (zemeckis, 1994) not only provides a sense of humor and drama throughout the movie, but it also has a twist of love throughout the movie as well. forrest fell in love quickly with a girl named jenny when he meets her on the bus for his first day of school. he and jenny spent most of their childhood together, but seem to fade apart as their lives went on. however, this did not keep forrest from maintaining his love for her. despite jenny eluding him, forrest did not let her go and continued to love her. forrest and jenny end up having a baby together and get married in order for forrest to be the father of the child. this love story puts a great twist in the movie to put an emotional toll on the audience. it shows that anybody can love anybody despite any circumstances. overall, forrest gump (zemeckis, 1994) is a great movie with a great message that will go down as one of the all-time best. the movie contains many different aspects that lead it to being such a great film. the use of tom hanks, the memorable soundtrack, historical references, and the heart-warming love story, all make this movie what it is. forrest gump (zemeckis, 1994) will be a film that people will watch and love for a long time.;21 February 2014;10;['great', 'forr', 'forr',

2302;mpalmer118;"tom hanks, stars as the title character in the novel turned movie, forrest gump. the movie depicts forrest's many adventures, as he narrates them to a string of strangers at a bus stop. ""stupid is as stupid does,"" forrest states to a stranger reluctantly listening to his story. despite his low iq, forrest has inadvertently become a part of many of the history making moments in second half of the 20th century. the film follows forrest as he teaches elvis presley to dance, becomes a college football star, meets john f. kennedy, serves with honor in vietnam, speaks at an anti-war rally at the washington monument, punches a black panther, defeats the chinese in table tennis, meets richard nixon, discovers the break-in at the watergate, builds a successful shrimping business, and becomes wealthy through an investment in a ""fruit company"" aka apple computers, and becomes an icon by running across the country for several years. intertwined throughout his adventures is his undying love for jenny, played by robin wright. sally field's stars as forrest's mother, whose wisdom is extolled throughout the movie. gary sinise stars as lieutenant dan, forrest's commanding officer in vietnam and reluctant friend. forrest gump uses a series of flashbacks and voice over narrations to tell the story of a seemingly less than extraordinary man living an extraordinary life. this style of storytelling has been used, with mixed results, in movies for years, including the iconic citizen kane. the opening scene find forrest sitting on a bench as a feather slowly drifts in the wind and lands at his feet, this sets the pace for the movie and subtly introduces one of the themes, is life a series of coincidences or are we the masters of our own destiny? forrest tells one of his listeners, ""my momma always said, life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna to get."" his life certainly seems to reflect that sentiment. through a series of well-timed coincidences forrest influences some major historical events, including the watergate scandal, and falls into some incredibly fortuitous opportunities, like his college football career. other events seem to be more of guided destiny, like his service in vietnam, which led not only to meeting lieutenant dan, but also his ""best good friend"" bubba. he subsequently goes on to save half the platoon, including lieutenant dan and brings bubba's shrimping boat business to fruition and becomes very wealthy. the antithesis to these opportune events is forrest's unrequited love for jenny. throughout all the stories jenny pops in and out of forrest's life, even when it seems that she is gone forever. he has loved her forever, but she keeps running from her past, in which forrest is irrevocably entwined. eventually destiny wins and jenny, now terminally ill, returns a final time with their son, forrest. the ending scene ties the theme back in, as the same feather falls from a book and is again carried away in the wind. the movie's portrayal of all these incredible events hinges on some incredible cgi and special effects, but not the fast-action, explosive effects we often see these days. forrest's image is superimposed on historical news reels, at times with humorous results, like showing his unfortunately placed war wound to president lyndon johnson. one especially noteworthy example is the editing to reflect the loss of lieutenant dan's legs. in every post-vietnam scene that includes lieutenant dan, his legs had to be digitally removed. the digital editing is so seamlessly done that some viewers thought that actor gary sinise had actually lost his legs. forrest gump successfully uses a mix of cgi enhanced flashbacks and voice-over narration to cause the viewer to reflect on destiny and the ripple effects we may have on the people with whom we interact. are our lives just a series of coincidences or the destiny we chose?";4 May 2014;9;['forr', 'forr', 'many', 'stupid', 'stupid', 'forr', 'strange', 'low', 'forr', 'many', 'second', 'forr', 'anti', 'war', 'black', 'successful', 'wealthy', 'several', 'undying', 'forr', 'reluctant', 'forr', 'less', 'extraordinary', 'extraordinary', 'mixed', 'iconic', 'forr', 'own', 'forr', 'forr', 'major', 'historical', 'fortuitous', 'other', 'more', 'good', 'good', 'wealthy', 'opportune', 'forr', 'unrequited', 'forr', 'forr', 'ill', 'final', 'forr', 'same', 'incredible', 'incredible', 'special', 'fast', 'explosive', 'historical', 'humorous', 'noteworthy', 'post', 'vietnam', 'digital', 'forr', 'ripple'];0.1978816526610644

2318;talktomylittlefriend;"i've never seen anyone like forrest gump in a movie before, and for that matter, i've never seen a movie quite like ""forrest gump"". any attempt to describe him would risk making the movie seem more conventional than it is, but let me try. it's a comedy, i guess. or maybe a drama. even a dream.... the title character leads viewers through an accidental travelogue of american social history from the early 1960s through the present in this revisionist fable. vietnam, desegregation, watergate and more are presented from the perspective of hanks' lovably slow-witted character as he finds himself embroiled in situations he can't quite comprehend. academy award nominations: 13, including best picture, best actor--tom hanks, and best director. academy awards: 6, including best picture, director, actor and adapted screenplay the screenplay by eric roth has the complexity of modern fiction, not the formulas of modern movies. its hero, played by tom hanks, is a thoroughly decent man with an iq of 75, who manages, between the 1950s and the 1980s, to become involved in every major event in american history. and he survives them all with only honesty and niceness as his shields. yet this is not a heartwarming story about a mentally retarded man. that cubbyhole is much too small and limiting for forrest gump. the movie is more of a meditation on our times, as seen through the eyes of a man who lacks cynicism and takes things for exactly what they are. watch him carefully and you will understand why some people are criticized for being ""too clever by half"". forrest is clever by just exactly enough. tom hanks may be the only actor who could have played the role. i can't think of anyone else as gump, after seeing how hanks makes him into a person so dignified, so straight-ahead. the performance is a breathtaking, balancing act between comedy and sadness, in a story rich in big laughs and quiet truths. forrest is born to an alabama boardinghouse owner (sally field), who tries to correct his posture by making him wear braces, but never criticizes his mind. when forrest is called ""stupid"", his mother tells him, ""stupid is as stupid does."" he turns out to be incapable of doing anything less than profound. also, when the braces finally fall from his legs, it turns out he can run like the wind. that's how he gets a college football scholarship, in a life story that eventually becomes a running gag about his good luck. gump, the football hero, becomes gump, the medal of honor winner in vietnam, and then gump, the ping-pong champion, gump, the shrimp boat captain, gump, the millionaire stockholder (he gets shares in a new ""fruit company"" named apple computer), and gump, the man who runs across america and then retraces his steps. it could be argued that with his iq of 75, forrest does not quite understand everything that happens to him. not so. he understands everything he needs to know, and the rest, the movie suggests, is just surplus. he even understands everything that's important about love, although jenny (robin wright), the girl he falls in love with in grade school and never falls out of love with, tells him, ""forrest, you don't know what love is."" she's a stripper by that time. the movie is ingenious in taking forrest on his tour of recent american history. the director, robert zemeckis, is experienced with the magic that special effects can do, and here he uses computerized visual legerdemain to place gump in historic situations with actual people. special effects are also used in creating the character of forrest's vietnam friend lt. dan (gary sinise), a ron kovic type who, quite convincingly, loses his legs. using carefully selected tv clips and dubbed voices, zemeckis is able to create some hilarious moments, as when lbj examines the wound, in what forrest describes as ""my butt-ox"". the biggest laugh in the movie comes after nixon inquires where forrest is staying in washington, and then recommends the watergate. as forrest's life becomes a guided tour of straight-arrow america, jenny goes on a parallel tour of the counterculture. she goes to california, of course, and drops out, tunes in, and turns on. eventually it becomes clear that between them, forrest and jenny have covered all of the landmarks of our recent cultural history, and the accommodation they arrive at in the end is like a dream of reconciliation for our society. what a magical movie!";26 May 2005;10;['forr', 'forr', 'conventional', 'accidental', 'american', 'social',

2334;henriksengrant;"forrest gump is a very inspirational film about a man, named forrest gump, who has a lower iq than average, but has a very exciting and adventurous life because of all of the major historical events that he just so happens to run into. forrest gump stars tom hanks, as forrest gump, robin wright, as jenny curran, and gary sinise, as lieutenant dan taylor. the acting in this film was of very high quality because the actors made it seem like the story actually happened. they also did a great job at making the characters seem more relatable to the viewer. tom hanks actually won an oscar for best actor in a leading role and gary sinise was nominated for best actor in a supporting role for their performances in forrest gump. the director is robert zemeckis and the writers are winston groom, who wrote the novel, and eric roth, who wrote the screenplay. forrest gump is very well directed and written because of many aspects, including the visual effects and how most of the film is a narrated flashback. the visual effects in this film were outstanding. when forrest was meeting all of the presidents and when he was getting involved in the integration crisis at alabama, it seemed like forrest was actually there. this added on to the believability of the film. i also thought that it was very entertaining to be able to see the story from the view of forrest gump himself and wouldn't be nearly as fun if it weren't told like it was. one of my favorite characteristics of forrest gump is how entertaining and fun it is. the film never ceases to surprise the viewer. forrest gump is a fictional character that is getting involved with events that actually occurred in real life. also, forrest never really seems to realize the importance of all the events that he has accidentally influenced or walked into, which makes the film even more entertaining. there are also many serious attributes of forrest gump that make it a great film. forrest seems to have a happy and successful life just from being innately good. this teaches a moral lesson to the viewer to show that good things happen to good people. a moral lesson is key to a film being considered good because it really gets the viewer invested in the story and makes the situations more relatable to their life. forrest gump is great because the film is encompassing the themes of entertainment and teaching a moral lesson. also, forrest gump is a very memorable film, especially the quotes. lines, such as ""run, forrest, run!"", ""life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get"", and ""stupid is as stupid does"", are among the quotes that many people, including me, had heard before ever seeing forrest gump. many people also know forrest gump because of its groundbreaking plot, which just so happens to be my favorite part of the film. in my opinion, the plot of forrest gump is the key reason why it is such a fantastic film. the plot is a mixture of multiple genres, such as drama, action, comedy, and even romance. when a film can cover all of these genres, it is bound to connect with many people in the audience. forrest gump can also be included in the vietnam war movie category because forrest is sent off to fight the war in vietnam after he enlists in the u.s. army. the setting of the film was an influential part of why the plot was so good because the story took place during a very interesting and exciting part of american history. another one of my favorite aspects of forrest gump is the soundtrack because it contains many songs that were produced during the setting of the story. it includes some of my favorites, such as ""fortunate son"", by creedence clearwater revival, ""california dreamin'"", by the mama & the papas, and ""mrs. robinson"", by simon & garfunkel. the songs that were featured were very popular when they were released and continue to be popular in today's culture. the soundtrack simply adds on to the list of reasons why forrest gump is such a fantastic film. in my opinion, it is one of the greatest films of all-time and will continue to be for a very long time. i believe that it will definitely stand the test of time very easily and will be a classic in the future.";6 October 2014;10;['forr', 'inspirational', 'forr', 'low', 'average', 'exciting', 'adventurous', 'major', 'historical', 'forr',

2359;vandeheyk;forrest gump is quite a unique character in a movie not to mention real life. trying to explain what forrest gump is a movie would be a challenge. the movie seems like a mix of different genres, there is comedy, drama, action, and its also a story about coming to age. the many different genres of this film are probably a main reason while this film is number 13 on imdb top 250 movies of all time. it caters to so many different audiences, that anybody can find someway to relate to this film and it's message. the screenplay which was wrote by eric roth has the depth of modern movies and its protagonist, played by tom hanks, is a very honest and wholesome man who happens to have a low iq of 75, this film shows him growing up between the 1950s and the 1980s and ends up becoming a part of every major thing that happened during that time in american history. he overcomes all of this turmoil with nothing but honesty and sayings that his mom always told him.the film is more of a look back at american history, through the narration and eyes of a mentally handicapped man.tom hanks is probably the only actor that could have pulled this off, he is amazing actor which has been a variety of films he isn't one of those actors that is only really good at playing certain parts. the theme of forrest gump is to teach a lesson about overcoming adversity no matter what challenges that you face, you never know the amazing places that your life will take you. we see that this film centers on man who isn't the brightest bulb in the closet. but he has many other amazing qualities that allow him many opportunities in his life. for instance, there is a part in the film the doctors thought forrest was never going to walk without the help of special braces. he defies the odds by simplifying trying to run away from some bullies, and finds out that his legs are just fine. they make forrest's legs are a big part of this film because of his incredible speed and endurance this allows him to go to college and played for the alabama crimson tide. he even said the military was easy all you had to do was listen to what you are told and say yes sir. it is not that easy for most people, trust me i did 8 year in the army. the whole film is about overcoming adversity, another example of the theme, when forrest becomes a world class ping-pong champion he proves that you don't need to be very smart to be successful life, all you need is a little can do attitude and some elbow grease. he did all this and the only person that believed in him was his mother played by sally fields and jenny played by robin wright. robert zemeckis, the director, did a great job making forrest do his own narration, you felt that you were in the head of forrest the whole time going on the journey of his life with him. this was a much better way of delivering the story then hearing it from a third party narrator. he also does some brilliant camera angles that show forrest's emotions during much of the film, you can see gump's emotions as he lives this events over again in his life, which helps you feel more connected to the protagonist. in conclusion, forrest gump is a great film when you need a reminder that anything is possible and can be overcome with just a different outlook and some hard work. it doesn't matter what type of genre is your favorite this movie will instantly become on of your favorite classics that you will never get tired of no matter how many times that you watch it. this movie is an easy 5 stars for me, it has so many simple yet complex elements in the story and the character development. you will surely not be disappointed.;5 February 2015;10;['forr', 'unique', 'real', 'forr', 'different', 'many', 'different', 'main', 'top', 'many', 'different', 'someway', 'modern', 'honest', 'wholesome', 'low', 'major', 'american', 'more', 'american', 'handicapped', 'only', 'amazing', 'good', 'certain', 'forr', 'amazing', 'bright', 'many', 'other', 'amazing', 'many', 'forr', 'special', 'fine', 'forr', 'big', 'incredible', 'crimson', 'you', 'easy', 'most', 'whole', 'forr', 'smart', 'successful', 'little', 'only', 'sally', 'great', 'forr', 'own', 'forr', 'whole', 'well', 'third', 'brilliant', 'forr', 'much', 'connected', 'forr', 'great', 'possible', 'different', 'hard', 'favorite', 'favorite', 'tired', 'many', 'easy', 'many', 'simple', 'complex'];0.2985281385281385

2361;tinkle03;"forrest gump is a film that portrays the life of forrest gump through flashbacks and voice over narration. we meet forrest gump, a slow man perfectly portrayed by tom hanks, at the beginning of the film when he introduces himself to the first person who sits next to him on a bench at a bus stop. it is from this point that we begin the journey of his life starting with his ""philosophical"" mother mrs. gump played by sally fields and his unfortunate need for leg braces. from here forrest takes the bus to school for the first time and we are introduced to his childhood friend and love at first sight, jenny curran played by robin wright. in college, jenny and forrest go their separate ways. throughout forrest gump's life he experiences and causes many historical moments such as inspiring elvis presley's dance moves, meeting multiple presidents, and uncovering the watergate scandal. although, these are monumental experiences, it seems he is somehow always drawn back to jenny. in the film, they are brought back together several times. a significant time being when forrest loses his mother and jenny stays with him. the morning after their night together, she once again leaves him. in the end, we are brought back to forrest gump, the narrator, in present day looking for jenny in response to a letter she sent him. the result of their one night together, left them with a son, forrest played by haley joel osment. jenny and forrest gump are finally united and get married before she dies of an unknown virus. the film ends perfectly on a scene much like the one where forrest first met jenny, but with little forrest getting on the bus for school for his very first time. the theme of this film seems to be torn between drama and comedy. however, the main focus is the endurance and true love that forrest has for jenny. although, he is always there for her when she needs him, she always ends up leaving him and going her own way. this fact does not seem to deter his love for her and every time she comes back into his life, he embraces it. a scene that reinforces this unbreakable love that forrest has for jenny is when they are reunited again in washington. they are having a conversation before jenny leaves him once again, which she has done multiple times before this scene. even though she is preparing to leave him again, forrest gives her his medal of honor and tells her that the reason he is good to her is because she is his girl. and then she was gone from his life again. another film that is quite a different story but relates to the endurance of true love is the notebook. in this film a young man tries his hardest to be with a young woman, before they are separated. years later they are brought back together, but she is with another man. when they finally end up with one another she ends up with alzheimer's. he spends the remaining days of their lives together reading to her and trying to bring her back to him. music has a way of affecting our emotional response to a film. in forrest gump the use of music is very effective especially when changing scenes. when jenny hitches a ride with a stranger instead of staying with forrest, the musical score is soft and almost sad. however, the musical score playing when they see each other again in washington is blissful and romantic. another technique used in this film is voice-over narration. this narration done by forrest emphasizes his thoughts and feelings of jenny even though she is absent from a majority of the film. the use of this narration conveys his slow point of view on his life and the things that happened in it, but also speeds the passage of time along. the film itself is already a little longer than necessary, so voice-over used for narration is important in moving the film along at a good pace but creating an impact on his way of thinking. overall, this film holds your interest in its creativity and alterations of historical events. the intermittent connection of forrest and jenny's lives surpasses decades. in the end, even though jenny has an unknown virus, forrest marries her and takes care of her until death do they part. this ultimately paints the picture of the true love that forrest had for jenny and how it endured the test of time.";8 February 2015;9;['forr', 'forr', 'forr', 'slow', 'first', 'philosophical', 'sally',

2376;jenkins_kai;"the tale of forrest gump has always been awe-inspiring. in my youth, i would curl up on the couch with the family and watch it religiously. we would quote it, laugh, and reminisce of our favorite parts. growing up, i have come to realize that the ambition that tom hanks portrays as forrest is definitely something to be desired. i always connected with his character and never truly understood why. it wasn't the low iq. i am quite intelligent. it wasn't what he accomplished. i have only done a handful of things, none of which are noteworthy. so reviewing this film as an adult, i realized i was watching it through a different pair of eyes. at first i thought the movie had changed. no... i had. the reason why i connected so much with forrest are two-fold. first, his desire for strong relationships. there were so many people that shunned him and hated upon him, much of which i can relate to. however, throughout the film, we remember his relationships. the love he has for the character jenny is so strong, it keeps him loyal throughout his entire life, despite always taking second to someone or something else. he knew what his heart wanted and waited patiently for his time. his relationship with his ""mama"" is definitely on to be desired. sally field brought a nurturing side to her son who already had shortcomings from childhood. yet, she always used positive reinforcement to encourage him and build him up. his relationship with his army buddy bubba was something truly remarkable. in times of hardships, a man who he barely knew, he risked his life for. granted, throughout training they did get to know some about each other, but the fact that bubba treated forrest like an equal is something so commendable and it makes me want to be a better person like that. forrest's relation ship with lt. dan was, albeit, an unhealthy one from the start, but even though dan was a loner, gave up on life, and despised forrest for saving him in vietnam, he ended up living a full life with his new wife, who could see past his disability and truly love him for who he was underneath. these days we don't see people behaving this way anymore. almost like respect is beneath us. i will treat a custodian the same way i treat a president. people say respect is earned. no... respect is given. it doesn't matter who you are, what matters is who you are. within. i know that last statement may sound redundant, but i'm sure some of you (hopefully all of you) can see the meaning for what it's worth. secondly, forrest's financial gains. throughout his life, he accumulated a substantial amount of wealth. the greatest thing? he didn't let it change him. he was the same forrest he was as a child as he was after his accomplishments throughout his amazing life. there was no greed. there was no revenge. there was no backstabbing. there was no hate. just love. all he did throughout the film... was love. it is because of my thoughts on the film that truly make me reflect and want to be more like forrest. despite hardships, disabilities, and hate promoted everywhere he went, he rose above it all to maintain his self-respect and his dignity. he chose not to let outside forces change who he was within. i love him for that. to tom hanks, should he ever read this review: you did a splendid job. i wish words could express how much i truly enjoyed your portrayal of the great forrest gump, but all you need to know is that, as a child, it brought me joy and laughter. as an adult, it did it again, just in different ways. i commend you and i thank you. i guess it turns out that life is like a box of chocolates...";18 July 2015;10;['forr', 'inspiring', 'favorite', 'forr', 'low', 'intelligent', 'noteworthy', 'different', 'forr', 'fold', 'strong', 'many', 'much', 'strong', 'loyal', 'entire', 'sally', 'positive', 'remarkable', 'other', 'forr', 'equal', 'commendable', 'well', 'unhealthy', 'forr', 'full', 'new', 'same', 'last', 'redundant', 'sure', 'worth', 'financial', 'substantial', 'great', 'same', 'forr', 'amazing', 'forr', 'outside', 'splendid', 'great', 'forr', 'different'];0.2690656565656565

2396;ismith-49239;"forrest gump film review by ivy smith in the movie forrest gump, tom hanks portrays the main character forrest, a simple man that is not very intelligent but has good intentions toward his mother (sally field) and best friend jenny (robin wright). throughout the movie forrest tells the story of his life but since he doesn't know any better he was put into the middle of some major historical events that have happened from the 1950s - 1980s. this movie is like no other of the time of its release in 1994, still now in 2015 this movie is a favorite of many. we first see hanks' character forrest on a bus bench in savannah, georgia telling his story to a stranger that sat next to him. he begins his story at the beginning, him as a boy having to get braces for his legs. his story goes on and he meets jenny on the bus when no one else would let him sit down. from that moment on jenny and forrest are the best of friends. one day bullies were chasing forrest and jenny said ""run forrest! run!"" and then he started running and his leg braces broke off and he is a very fast child. after a while forrest finds himself running away from bullies again and he runs straight across a football field and he gets a free ride into college. he goes to tell that he goes through many big historical events and some of those were school integration, he gets to meet president john f. kennedy, the vietnam war, he was on a tv show and met john lennon a few months or so before he died, he inadvertently helps expose the watergate scandal and many more events. he tells them through his mind and it seems all too innocent because of his low iq. his relationship with jenny continues and he keeps trying to save her but she keeps running away. through jenny's eyes you see the hippie movement, drug and alcohol abuse, her sleeping around, and a failed suicide attempt. jenny cleans up and decided to go back to forrest and stays with him and soon after she runs away again. forrest gump is based off of a book called forrest gump by winston groom in 1986. the book was more harsh than the movie so the film writers took off some of the edge and made it into a more lovable movie. they took out some of the adventures forrest had because they were a little ridiculous. the movie took great special effects in how they put the actor tom hanks into different scenarios in time, such as being put into a video with john f. kennedy and using special effects to take off lt. dan's (gary sinise) legs after the vietnam war scenes. the movie won six academy awards for best picture, best actor in a leading role, best director, best visual effects, best adapted screenplay, and best film editing. the movie was nominated for seven golden globe awards. the film won three of them best actor - motion picture drama, best director - motion picture, and best motion picture - drama. forrest gump was also nominated for six saturn awards and won two of them, best fantasy film, and best supporting actor. the movie is also on many lists and it mad #240 on the greatest movies of all time list. i find the movie deserving of all the awards it got and being on all the lists it's on. the acting was great and i could really tell the actors were into the roles they were cast for. tom hanks does a wonderful job of playing a disabled man and getting the voice and actions right. i give this movie an 8 out of 10 stars only because it does jump around a tad bit but it works well in the terms how fast you have to go through his whole life. the movie is wonderful and i have watched it so many times with my family and friends. i always find something new when i watch it over again, just those little things you don't notice when you first watch it. i have always found that fascinating.";12 October 2015;8;['forr', 'forr', 'main', 'simple', 'intelligent', 'good', 'good', 'forr', 'well', 'major', 'historical', 'other', 'many', 'forr', 'forr', 'good', 'forr', 'forr', 'fast', 'forr', 'free', 'many', 'big', 'historical', 'few', 'many', 'more', 'innocent', 'low', 'forr', 'forr', 'forr', 'harsh', 'lovable', 'forr', 'little', 'ridiculous', 'great', 'special', 'different', 'such', 'special', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'visual', 'good', 'good', 'golden', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'forr', 'good', 'good', 'many', 'mad', 'great', 'great', 'wonderful', 'disabled', 'right', 'whole', 'wonderful', 'many', 'new', 'little', 'fascinating'];0.3655853994490357
2397;seanspiering;since i first saw this film at the age of 8, forrest gump has always been my favourite film. as a child this film was magical and forrest inspired me with his ability to run fast. the scene where he breaks from his leg braces is iconic and highlights how well the movie matches music to emotion. the forrest gump theme music by alan silvestri hits the mark and truly captures the beauty of a feather moving in the wind. the movie uses the theme of life being like a box of chocolates. you never know what you're going to get. what the audience gets is top tier cinema production on all levels. the director robert zemeckis delivers a visually stunning film that shows so much of the american dream. the acting showcases tom hanks, sally field and gary sinise in their elements and they bring such life and dimension to the characters as we follow forrest and his mama across the decades. the movie tackles some of the hard topics with grace and surprising wit, all the while being respectful and quite informative of many historical moments without getting caught up wasting too much time on any one moment. the film to personally becomes one of understanding why exactly forrest was able to be so successful. luck? funny script? are we to believe its like the movie being there where a man can succeed by the mr magooing of his ignorance and naivete. no. forrest is successful because he is trusting. he puts his faith in others and in return friends help him. sure a man of lesser intelligence can be swindled and taken advantage of but the story says that a man who works hard, trusts his fellow man and loves his mama and his god will succeed in america. the american dream.;15 October 2015;10;['forr', 'favourite', 'magical', 'forr', 'iconic', 'forr', 'top', 'stunning', 'much', 'sally', 'such', 'forr', 'hard', 'surprising', 'respectful', 'informative', 'many', 'historical', 'much', 'forr', 'able', 'successful', 'funny', 'forr', 'successful', 'less', 'fellow'];0.3465686274509804

2420;toccina;spoiler warning!!!! forrest gump is in reality a movie that covers a plethora of issues for example racial issues with the kkk and black panthers, drugs, peace, war, and finally disability. for this review i would like to touch on the disability portion. i must first say that even though this movie is mostly comedic it can still be said that it is partially accurate. in the beginning forrest breaks off his braces to help with his scoliosis but broke them off to run away from bullies. yet even though he had this disability against him he still had the ability to do it. so in reality this movie begins by saying that it's more about ability. i can prove this point further by saying that he became a war veteran with a medal of honour and also managed to become a millionaire and then evidently a successful father, even though forrest was put in the situation that was impossible, and even if it was for comedic purposes it is much deeper, yet he still managed to come out ahead. mostly a duration of the movie it is asked if forrest is stupid, now forrest doesn't like it and even though he may have a low iq he still manages to pull through in the long run. this is also the case for lt. dan, he is in vietnam harmed in battle and winds up with his legs amputated, later in the movie he gets prothstetics and is able to walk again, he also ends up being a millionaire because of his success in the shrimp industry. it's not that he is in need because he is disabled but is able to help because he is able. so in reality forrest gump isn't necessarily a film about specifically disability or otherwise it is something that shows how much of an ability you have whether or not you have a disability from birth or war or some other thing. it takes a will to do something and this is why i would give this movie a 9/10 because of its uplifting story and some form of motivation to do something with your life.;9 March 2016;9;['forr', 'racial', 'black', 'comedic', 'accurate', 'forr', 'more', 'successful', 'forr', 'impossible', 'comedic', 'deep', 'forr', 'stupid', 'forr', 'low', 'long', 'able', 'disabled', 'able', 'able', 'forr', 'much', 'other', 'uplifting'];0.081547619047619

2461;marwanmak;a masterpiece in every way. it reminds me of my rises and falls in my life and just seeing how resilient forrest gump became was really inspiring. he had so much to offer the world, even when no one saw his ability to contribute to society. he did everything from leading a football team to a championship, to being a war hero. even through the tough times in high school to the frantic relationship with jenny, forrest still remained humble and resilient. any anti-bullying campaign, in my opinion, should use forrest gump as a prime example. maybe even go as far as showing the movie. the movie also shows what it truly means to keep a promise. the promises that forrest made to his mother, bubba, jenny and lieutenant dan were all kept. his love, passion, drive and spiritual understanding were all unconditional. what an amazing movie.;29 May 2018;10;['resilient', 'forr', 'inspiring', 'much', 'tough', 'high', 'frantic', 'humble', 'resilient', 'anti', 'bullying', 'forr', 'prime', 'spiritual', 'unconditional', 'amazing'];0.1118518518518518

2475;chris-kape;i have seen this movie at least a dozen times - likely even more. for me, it is a top 5, and could easily be tied for #1 with the other 4! the beauty of the film is found in forrest gump's innocence and purity and the way he deals with adversities and others, especially being raised in a conservative, white-powered, pre-60s alabama culture. he does not see color, race, intelligence or gender - partially thanks to the way his mother raised him and painted a simple picture of life analogies for him to understand everything. he somehow manages to retain that innocence through some very difficult times. as he is picked on as a child, as a vietnam soldier then veteran, as a college graduate of the late sixties, and as an adult struggling through friendships, love, death, money and life challenges. anyone watching should be able to personally relate to some of the various periods and parts of forrest's life. i would not be doing this review justice if i did not mention the skillful and seamless blending of music, action, and detailed costumes that lent itself to making this film epic. it truly is a film that captures your attention and imagination and holds it for its entire length. i recently shared it with my kids, who, even after 20+ years, found it amazing to watch.;19 January 2017;10;['least', 'likely', 'more', 'top', 'other', 'forr', 'conservative', 'white', 'simple', 'difficult', 'late', 'able', 'various', 'forr', 'skillful', 'seamless', 'detailed', 'entire', 'amazing'];0.0916666666666666

2484;sherryshin;"""like a box of chocolates, you'll never know what you're going to get"". like a box of chocolates, in the film, forrest gump, you never know what you're going to get. directed by robert zemeckis in 1994, the academy award winning best picture, forrest gump, follows the life of main character forrest gump through some of his most important life events. played brilliantly by actor tom hanks, audience members empathize for forrest as they watch him overcome tremendous hardships as a handicap, growing from a mentally unstable little boy to a successful war veteran and business owner. through heartbreak, triumph, and loss, so many elements of emotion can be felt through the movie. also, with the events of forrest's life very much paralleling with america's history, historical moments of our country's past can be reminisced through the film. the film's main story line with regards to american history, with the variety of elements such as comedy, drama, and romance woven together in the plot, all brought out through tom hanks exceptional acting, makes the movie forrest gump, one of the most iconic of all time. forrest gump's plot not only follows the story of forrest's life, but gives a glimpse at various historical moments of america. one of the many historically significant scenes includes the the hippie movement and their anti-war protests, as well as the black panther party, which forrest's long time lover, jenny, was a part of. the movie also displays what some may say is the most ""accurate depiction of the vietnam war"", as forrest, for most of his life was a veteran of the war. the vietnam war is one of the most controversial armed conflicts to ever take place in the 20th century, and during the movie, viewers experience a realistic depiction of the ""desultory"", ""purposelessness"" of it. the historical significance that the movie encapsulates is important as it provides viewers a glimpse into the history of america through a first person point of view. the roller-coaster of emotions that are felt in the movie by various elements including comedy, drama, and romance, makes forrest gump an enthralling film to see. the first time i watched the film, in the beginning, i thought that the movie was just a comedy, something that would make me chuckle here and there. little did i know that the movie contained so many lessons and morals that hit me on a deeper level. i say that the film is like a chocolate molten cake, which from the outside has the appearance of a normal, one flavored, typical sponge cake. however, delving deeper into the cake, breaking the outside, chocolate oozes out, similar to what's really under the surface of the movie, forrest gump. i feel like many expect the movie to just be a comedic one, but really there is so much more than that. there is romance, drama, and heartbreak, all encapsulated in one two hour span of a film. the movie's twists and turns and the various life events of forrest are so unexpected that i found myself crying one minute and laughing hysterically the second after. you can experience so many emotions in just this one film. without tom hanks' brilliant acting as forrest gump, the movie's inspiring story line and captivating emotional elements would not have been exhibited at its greatest potential. what was most exceptional about hanks' acting was his ability to naturally and accurately display a slightly disabled man, a very hard task for any actor to do. there is a fine line between overly exaggerating the role of a handicap person and slipping out of the true character of one, and in my opinion, tom hanks perfectly maintained his character throughout the entire film. in 1995, a year after the film was released, tom hanks won the academy award for best actor, golden globe for best actor, screen actors guild award for outstanding performance by a male actor, and many other titles. tom hank's was and still is admired for his performance as forrest, which was a tricky role to play, yet a powerful one that made the film so iconic. without the deep rooted american culture and various elements evoking different emotions in the plot of the film, as well as tom hank's brilliant acting, forrest gump would not be the iconic movie that it is. released in 1994, still today in 2017, forrest gump holds its magic and makes for one of the most iconic movies in history. silly, heartwarming, and inspiring, forrest gump is an american classic that everyone should get the chance to watch.";2 March 2017;10;['forr', 'good',

2522;kelseykilbane;forrest gump, a comedy and drama film that takes people through history seeing the world through forrest gump's (tom hanks) eyes. a simple, optimistic, man, with a low iq score sits at a bus stop as he narrates his flashbacks. it all begins from a young age when his mother, mrs. gump (sally field) taught him to choose his own destiny. throughout childhood, forrest spends his days growing up, going to school and running around with the love of his life, jenny curan (robin wright). as time progresses, and strangers come and go from the bench and forrest narrates his experiences from joining the army in vietnam and making friends with his shrimp- crazed friend, bubba (mykelti williamson) to developing a passion for ping pong and meeting several presidents. while getting to know forrest's character, the theme of choosing your own destiny captivates viewers as they watch forrest create his own history. the use of motifs and narration carry out the theme from the opening scene. the film opens up to a feather drifting aimlessly in the air, before landing on forrest's foot. the feather, that appears again later in the film, is a motif that symbolizes forrest as he aimlessly goes through life, creating his own destiny wherever the world takes him. retelling his life events, as he narrates the flashback scenes allows viewers to quickly pick up on forrest's personality. although his iq score is low, it is clear that he is in fact very intelligent and chooses to see the good in situations. while forrest may be saying one thing, his flashbacks give the audience more depth and layers to the plot. special effects position historical characters throughout the film to uniquely communicate the passage of time. as his life changes, he doesn't worry about a thing, other than his love for his long- time friend, jenny. by not letting anything get in his way, forrest keeps his mother's lessons in mind, and chooses his own destiny that makes you stop and consider what is truly important in life. the use of motifs, flashbacks and forrest's narrating on the bench helps you fall in love with this simple character and his journey through life. all aspects of this movie are carefully thought out and allow the viewer to interpret and consider a deeper message, giving this film the ability to be comical, entertaining and thought provoking.;17 September 2017;9;['forr', 'forr', 'simple', 'optimistic', 'low', 'young', 'own', 'forr', 'forr', 'several', 'forr', 'own', 'forr', 'own', 'forr', 'forr', 'own', 'forr', 'low', 'clear', 'intelligent', 'forr', 'more', 'special', 'historical', 'other', 'forr', 'own', 'important', 'forr', 'simple', 'deep', 'comical'];0.2816071428571428

war, hippie culture, the moon landing, john lennon's murder, the aids breakout of 1981, and many other historical events that took place from 1944 to 1982. this movie is loved by many as it can appeal to a wide range of people with the use of genres, its quotability, the advanced editing, and the amazing acting by tom hanks. while many movies will fall under the genre categories of comedy, action, romance, etc., forrest gump doesn't have just one set genre. forrest gump includes many aspects from different genres making it appeal to a wider range of people. it includes genres such as epic, action, drama, romance, and comedy. according to stardust, ""the statistics portal"", ""films within the comedy, adventure, action and drama movie genres generated the most box office revenue"". creating a film the falls under the four most popular genres is incredibly smart because it is likely the film will have something in it to appeal to nearly everyone. one main point this movie shows is that someone can make a difference no matter who they are or what their intelligence level is. it's important that this point doesn't just discuss one type of person but that anyone, no matter who they are or their intelligence is can make a difference. since this movie has been released it has been quoted in daily conversations, thanks to the amazing writing done by winston groom. it has also been referenced in more movies and tv shows than i can count. one of the most quoted lines from the movie would be, ""my mama always said, 'life was like a box of chocolates. you never know what you're gonna get.'""-forrest. this quote was voted as the #40 movie quote by the american film institute. i think this quote really stood out as everyone knows life is a mystery. even if you think you've planned everything things are going to come around and change that. although forrest didn't really have his life all planned out many things came about that quickly changed his course. he was simply handed a flyer to apply for the u.s army, which immediately led to a scene of him finding a seat on the bus that took them there. having been given this flyer led to him enlisting in the army which led to him becoming a ""war hero"" which led to many other things and great opportunities. despite the unlikelihood of all of these events happening to one single person, we all know that life is unpredictable. forrest gump's special effects were outstanding for the time it was made. the special effects team on this film won an oscar for the editing of the movie and even created a new term called ""gumping"" as they were able to place tom hanks' character in the previously recorded historical footage. the special effects team used cgi to edit tom hanks face over people who were actually there. they were then able to edit any other hand and arm movements. the editing in the film allowed forrest to meet john lennon, john f. kennedy, and richard nixon. often times these characters would be shown talking to forrest gump but obviously that couldn't have happened so they used voice-overs to make it seem like the conversations were actually taking place. the amazing special effects team on this film won an academy award for best film editing. another aspect of this film that made it so great was tom hanks portrayal of forrest gump. when they first started filming they wanted tom hanks to have an eased southern accent but the little boy who played young forrest had naturally thick southern accent that was hard for him to change. so the director talked to tom hanks and they decided it would be best if tom hanks changed his character's accent to match the boy's natural accent. tom hanks spent hours sitting around talking to and recording the boy talking to try to match it perfectly. having put in the extra effort to match the accents showed how dedicated tom hanks was as, in the end, it's completely believable that the boy just grew up and his accent stayed. john travolta was the original choice to portray forrest gump but i am so glad he turned it down as i can't imagine anyone else playing forrest gump. the extra effort the tom hanks put into this movie doesn't just show through the accent but also through his amazing acting skills and his believability. the movie forrest gump got a very underrated score on rotten tomatoes, but i think it deserves much better as it was an amazing film that took the audience through historical events through the eyes of a man with an iq of 75, but in the end his iq didn't really matter as he was able to accomplish so much that the average person wouldn't even dream of. with the use of genres, its quotability, the special effects, and the amazing acting by tom hanks this movie has won many awards including six oscars.";5 November 2017;9;['forr', 'rotten', 'forr', 'forr', 'low', 'able', 'many', 'historical', 'such', 'many', 'other', 'historical', 'many', 'wide', 'advanced', 'amazing', 'many',

2534;gar-28;in philadelphia hanks played a gay man dieing of aids fired because of his sexuality. it took courage to take the part and hanks used to to open the heats and minds minds of many viewers. when i first saw gump i thought it was sentimental and cloyingly sweet. after talking to a friend who works with the handicapped my impression changed. underneath the sugar coating the movie presents the idea that if people with iqs below 90 wanted to they could get into the army (gump would never have gotten into the army), be war heroes, start successful businesses and become rich. it makes believable the idea that these people need no help from the rest of us. hanks is cute, beguiling and an altogether 'lovable little retard'. the image it presents of real handicapped people who struggle to get by in our world is callous and degrading.;4 February 2006;3;['gay', 'many', 'sentimental', 'sweet', 'handicapped', 'successful', 'rich', 'believable', 'cute', 'lovable', 'little', 'real', 'handicapped', 'callous', 'degrading'];0.3321969696969697

2546;bibianafinkler;"if you want to understand forrest gump, you have to pay attention to all of the movie's characteristics. this wonderful film, directed by robert zemeckis, has a great cast on all levels, creating a perfect atmosphere to describe the journey of forrest gump (tom hanks). it shows - in a singular way - significant historical and political events (such as the vietnam war), cultural movements (like the hippies in the 70's) or important figures (such as elvis presley) to american history and culture. in the first scene, you could ask yourself: who is this guy? what would make this movie's story different from others? well, you will see the world through the eyes of a mentally challenged man who has a different perception of life, people and love: forrest is a pure heart. because of him, we see an idealized vision of earth that ignores grim social realities. however, at the same time, we realize that his perception of life has a powerful message: how evil and complex our society can be. it is not only about a different hero. if you are waiting for a conventional life story that does not require that you think outside the box, i would suggest another type of plot. the way that forrest sees the world is a way of softening the strong american reality of vietnam war, the oppressive educational system, and the prejudiced society which still exists and echoes nowadays. this happens in the washington speech scene, when forrest said: ""sometimes when people go to vietnam, they go home to their mommas without any legs. sometimes they don't go home at all. that's a bad thing. that's all i have to say."" unfortunately, the microphones were turned off when he was speaking these words. other moments also call our attention to important points or personalities of american culture. for example, one of the running scenes, in which a prison chain gang works as a background to forrest's adventures and he inspires john lennon to compose ""imagine"" based on his point of view of china. this modern fable, full of a singular, direct and true simplicity of a man and his memories will keep you on the edge of seat. forrest gump needs to be seen between the lines. in the first moments you will not believe in his pure heart. however, it makes all the difference when we are watching this movie. if life is a box of chocolates that you never know what you are gonna get, you will not be disappointed with his stories and all the meanings expressed by this movie through photography, soundtrack, visual effects, easter eggs etc. besides all that, the film won, in 1995, six academy awards for best picture, best director (for robert zemeckis), best actor (for tom hanks), best adapted screenplay (for eric roth), best film editing, and best visual effects. it should be seen by everyone. a classic movie, due to its technical production and its messages to the viewer. i truly recommended it.";22 December 2017;9;['forr', 'wonderful', 'great', 'perfect', 'forr', 'singular', 'significant', 'historical', 'political', 'such', 'cultural', 'important', 'such', 'american', 'first', 'different', 'different', 'forr', 'pure', 'grim', 'social', 'same', 'powerful', 'evil', 'complex', 'different', 'conventional', 'forr', 'strong', 'american', 'oppressive', 'educational', 'prejudiced', 'forr', 'bad', 'other', 'important', 'american', 'modern', 'full', 'singular', 'direct', 'true', 'forr', 'first', 'pure', 'visual', 'easter', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'visual', 'classic', 'technical'];0.1765010351966874

2600;cole-22948;"forest gump movie is about a young man by the name of forest gump who did not allow is disability to limit him from doing anything in life. whether dominating on the gridiron as a college football star and fighting in vietnam. the main characters in the movie is forrest gump played by tom hanks, mrs. gump played by sally field, and jenny curran played by robin wright. forest gump was raised in the 1950's in alabama by his single mother mrs. gump. forrest who appears different from other children has to fend for himself and has gone through a lot of bullying throughout school, and also adult hood. forrest was born with strong legs but a crooked spine, and as a result was required to wear leg braces which made walking very challenging for him to do. forrest had a low iq level of 75 that almost prevented him from getting accepted in school. forrest mom who is his biggest support will do anything for forrest by any means. even if she had to sleep with the principal to get forrest accepted in school, which she did. mrs. gump always remind forrest not to let anyone tell him he was different growing up. forrest also, had another supporter jenny curran, who was also forrest biggest supporter. she always stuck up for forrest whenever other children bullied him and also tells him to run from his bullies. due to this, forrest was able to run out of his leg braces and became a very fast runner. in fact, forrest got accepted on the football team due to how fast he was at running. there are many themes that can be taken away from the film, but the biggest one you can see throughout the movie is love. forrest was so in love with jenny from they were kids to adult. however, jenny was blinded by the love that forrest had for her. ""the love that forrest had for jenny reminded me of the movie ""the cider house rules"" where homer was infatuated with candy. jenny more gravitated to abusive men because she was molested by her father as a child. as a result, she starts doing playboy and taking drug substance. despite jenny's horrible lifestyle, forrest never gave up hope on her, as well as his love for her. in fact, he married jenny in a scene at the end of the movie where she came back sick from an uncured illness and fathered their son he met for the first time. the son was supposedly conceived from a onetime love making they had before she had fled. the cinematography places and moves the camera around the characters to outline the power and significance the historical events have in influencing forrest's life. you can see a lot of close up shots throughout the film. such as the scene when forrest was in the army. many close-up shots were used to show the dirt, blood and scars on forrest from the war. you can also find a symbol used in the movie which is the feather from the first scene. it shows a significant meaning to forrest life. the feather plays a role as a motif through the story, alluding to how forrest's life forms randomly, and his innocence as well as sadness stays with him as he travels down many different roads. in spite of forrest's challenges has a child, he did not let it defined what people say he cannot do. forrest proved these people wrong by finishing high school and going to college. in addition to, playing college football, fighting in the vietnam war and having normal feelings for a woman whom he loved that he married for one year until she died.";25 July 2018;10;['young', 'main', 'forr', 'single', 'forr', 'different', 'other', 'forr', 'strong', 'crooked', 'challenging', 'forr', 'low', 'forr', 'big', 'forr', 'forr', 'different', 'forr', 'forr', 'big', 'forr', 'other', 'forr', 'able', 'fast', 'forr', 'many', 'big', 'forr', 'forr', 'forr', 'abusive', 'horrible', 'forr', 'sick', 'uncured', 'first', 'onetime', 'historical', 'forr', 'close', 'such', 'forr', 'many', 'close', 'forr', 'first', 'significant', 'forr', 'forr', 'many', 'different', 'forr', 'forr', 'wrong', 'high', 'normal'];0.0683095238095237

2636;rvy-75114;"forrest gump is one of the most iconic movies in the 20th century. it contains some of the most famous quotes such as, ""run forrest, run!"", ""my mama said life is like a box of chocolates"", and my personal favorite: ""jennyyyy"". also, no other movie in history has spurred the creation of a successful, themed food chain. however, these reasons are not what makes, forrest gump, the best movie ever created. the bildungsroman movie, forrest gump, is the greatest movie ever created in the 20th century because of its ability to transcend nearly all levels of society and how it effectively critiques each of them. forrest gump explores southern society in an unique way. following forrest's early life, we get a glimpse into what life was like in the south for a mentally challenged young man with a single mother. forrest's mother is well off and has a large estate. we see that his mother cares for him, despite his handicaps. she, ""convinces"" the principal to allow forrest to enter a school known for academics. also, she never fails to remind forrest that he isn't dumb, but that he is special. forrest's mother is a caring woman who will do anything to see that her son succeeds in life. this caring relationship contrasts with jenny's family. jenny comes from a house with an alcoholic, abusive father. they both live in an old, small, rundown house. she consistently runs away and hides from her father. this displays the vast socio-economic differences in the south. there are families who have ""old money"" and live in large estates with housekeepers and groundskeepers and who speak with ""southern sophistication"". on the other hand, there are people who are living in poverty and who have extremely dysfunctional families. the insight into southern culture was so realistic, that viewers did not even think about the inaccuracies the depictions could have portrayed; the performance was spot on. southern culture has influenced forrest gump's character and how he reacts to the military culture in the next stage of his life. according to the movie, military culture in the 1970s is a combination of intensity and relaxation. when forrest steps on to the bus going to boot camp, he is immediately greeted by a screaming bus driver. at boot camp, a drill sergeant hollers explicit words and intimidates the new recruits. he eventually stands inches in front of forrest and asks him what is his (forrest) purpose in the army. after forrest responds, the sergeant yells, ""... that is the most outstanding answer i have heard. you must have a goddamn iq of 160"". he then marches off barking orders to the rest of the group. forrest matches his intensity by also yelling at the top of his lungs. this portrays the military as an inhospitable environment only for the strong-willed. it is the stereotypical depiction of boot camp. however, upon arrival at vietnam, forrest and his best friend, bubba, realize that vietnam was nothing like they had expected. men were barbecuing meats, smoking cigarettes, and having a grand time. they eventually meet lieutenant dan; lieutenant dan is a laid back and shirtless officer who shows them around camp. it somewhat startled forrest and bubba, as this was not what they had expected. this depiction of soldiers who are relaxing heavily contrasts with the earlier depiction from boot camp. the contrast symbolizes the public belief surrounding vietnam during the 1970s. in the beginning of the war, society believed that americans were doing a good job and keeping peace: paralleling forrest and bubba's preliminary thoughts on what vietnam was going to be like. however, soldiers were misusing their time and were being reckless with the supplies paid for by taxpayers. when forrest exits the war, he is eventually sucked into anti-war protest, in which the viewer is able to experience the counter-war culture. the director portrays the hippie/anti-war culture as fervent and almost hypocritical. forrest meets jenny at an anti-war rally and he is invited to see what goes on during the planning of these rallies. jenny's boyfriend is a high ranking ""officer"" in his anti-war organization. upon arrival, forrest sees a boardroom with plans, just like those in military offices. also, the black panthers, an african-american radical group, also joins the anti-war planning. every single person in the room has a burning passion to end the war, just as the soldiers had a burning passion to get home as well. the protestors were ""anti-war"" and ""anti-violence"", however, they were very aggressive when talking about the war. also, jenny's boyfriend hits her, which triggers forrest to attack him. forrest and jenny are subsequently kicked out. the anti-war movement was portrayed in a negative light, despite their intentions. though they wanted to be the opposite of the military, the counter-war movement to be quite similar to the military. they had a similar hierarchy and same fervent passion. the protestors want to promote peace, but they still showed aggression.. the anti-war protestors are essentially hypocrites. forrest gump is the greatest movie ever created because of its unique perspective on society in the 1970's. no other movie has captured the human experience as accurately as this movie has. it's perspective spans from the rich to the poor, and from vietnam war supporters to the counter-war movement. through the eyes of forrest, we see into the southern, military, and anti-war cultures. we see how a young man raised in the south with good morals, survives the military, and faces the hypocritical anti-war protestors. forrest gump is not only a heartwarming movie about a mentally challenged man who is able to miraculously influence 1970s society, but also, a film masterpiece due to how it critiques the cultures within society, through which forrest transcends.";13 October 2018;10;['forr', 'iconic', 'famous', 'such', 'forr', 'personal', 'other', 'successful', 'themed', 'forr', 'good', 'forr', 'great', 'forr', 'southern', 'unique', 'forr', 'early', 'young', 'single', 'large', 'forr', 'forr', 'dumb', 'special', 'caring', 'caring', 'alcoholic', 'abusive', 'old', 'small', 'vast', 'economic', 'old', 'large', 'southern', 'other', 'dysfunctional', 'southern', 'realistic', 'southern', 'forr', 'military', 'next', 'military', 'forr', 'explicit', 'new', 'forr', 'forr', 'forr', 'outstanding', 'goddamn', 'forr', 'inhospitable', 'strong', 'willed', 'stereotypical', 'forr', 'good', 'grand', 'forr', 'bubba', 'early', 'public', 'good', 'forr', 'preliminary', 'reckless', 'forr', 'anti', 'war', 'able', 'counter', 'war', 'hippie', 'anti', 'war', 'fervent', 'hypocritical', 'forr', 'anti', 'war', 'anti', 'war', 'forr', 'military', 'black', 'african', 'radical', 'anti', 'war', 'single', 'anti', 'anti', 'aggressive', 'forr', 'forr', 'anti', 'war', 'negative', 'counter', 'war', 'similar', 'similar', 'same', 'fervent', 'anti', 'war', 'forr', 'great', 'unique', 'other', 'human', 'rich', 'poor', 'counter', 'war', 'forr', 'southern', 'military', 'anti', 'war', 'young', 'good', 'hypocritical', 'anti', 'war', 'forr', 'able', 'due', 'forr'];0.1362713788943297

2638;jasonuemail;"the phrase ""life is like a box of chocolates"" is extremely misleading. while it is true that you never know what will be inside that box, the contents of a chocolate box are always good, unlike life. if you live a life like anyone but forrest gump, life is actually like a box of those jelly beans that are either tasty flavors such as lime or strawberry banana, or disgusting ones like grass clippings or rotten eggs. forrest gump, played by tom hanks in forrest gump, stumbles through life aimlessly and ends up being one of the most successful men on the planet. robert zemeckis' forrest gump is one of the most iconic movies and should serve as the model for how a film should be made. its wonderful storytelling, advanced special effects, and valuable life lessons raises the movie to a level that only a select few have eclipsed. zemeckis brilliantly tells the story of forrest's life through a series of flashbacks. the plot is intriguing by itself, but the flashbacks add a unique spin to the movie. forrest is first introduced as a middle aged man sitting at a bus stop adorning a pair of extremely worn out shoes holding a suitcase and a box of chocolates. although some might argue that the use of flashbacks is unnecessary, the audience receives a lot of insight about forrest's life by telling the story through flashbacks. forrest effectively serves as a narrator and is able to tell the audience what he was thinking and what resulted from his actions. by delivering the story in flashbacks, forrest is also able to provide comedic relief throughout the movie. from moments when he explains how he was named after the founder of the kkk, to how he inspired elvis presley's dancing or even he is reminiscing about visiting the white house, the movie provides an effective amount of comedy in order to maintain its seriousness. forrest's narration also provides a seamless transition between various flashbacks. this, combined with the fact that the plot of the story is based off of what actually happened in real life, makes for impeccable storytelling. by having the plot revolve around events like the vietnam war and multiple presidencies, the viewers who grew up or lived during these times can easily recollect their experiences. the powerful storytelling combined with amazing special effects makes forrest gump one of the most memorable films. the special effects team demonstrates their mastery throughout the duration of the movie. forrest is embedded into numerous video clips that display monumental moments in history and include some of the most iconic figures of the 60s and 70s. forrest can be seen shaking hands with john f. kennedy, showing his gun shot wound to lyndon johnson, and discovering the watergate scandal during richard nixon's presidency. he also appears on a tv show with john lennon. these edited videos provide laughs for the entire audience in addition to making the film very memorable by relating forrest's life to what actually happened in real life. the editors and producers don't only excel in planting forrest in the middle of history changing moments, but demonstrate their excellence while depicting events of the vietnam war. the movie is able to accurately portray the scene in vietnam with huge explosions and gunfire, as well as adding in rain that goes sideways or even seems like it's rising up. the scenes of the war are able to show men getting blown up, bleeding out, and losing their limbs. the effects team was also able to demonstrate their ability while creating the very first scene of the movie. the screen opens up and follows a feather making abrupt movements, wandering about in the air. although it may sound simple, complicated movements in the background are also completed, and the entire surrounding area is painted by following the feather around. the scene also provides a brilliant metaphor for forrest's life. like a feather, forrest goes through life without a care in the world for his future actions but makes it through without any harm. the movie is told with brilliant storytelling and visual imagery(don't forget about the top-notch soundtrack too), but is set apart by its valuable lessons. forrest gump is one of the greatest teaching movies. since forrest has a really low iq and comprehension of basic topics, many of the life lessons are simple and easy to understand. even though the words of wisdom forrest provides seem very basic, they effectively make the audience rethink their understanding life. for example, as forrest making his famous run across the country, he tells the audience how it is necessary to get over your past before you can move forward. even for a successful man like forrest, he needed to get over the past tragedies of his life like losing his best friend bubba in war, his mother dying of cancer, and losing his childhood love jenny. the value of true friendship is also demonstrated as forrest gives the half of the profit from his multimillion-dollar shrimping business to bubba's family since he wanted to keep his promise of sharing the profits. forrest's journey also teaches the audience that sometimes the best we can do is to just try our best and hope everything works out in the end. no matter what, he always supported jenny even though she put him through a lot of emotional trauma. in the end, their childhood romance is completed as they get married and forrest becomes a father. forrest's adventure is filled with models for how one should live their life, like finding what you truly love and being able to do that. what got him places in the first place was running, which allowed him to go to college so he could play football. after becoming a successful player, he became a war hero due to his ability to run. one of the most important things that stemmed from his love of running was when he got famous during his trips across america, which led him back to the love of his life jenny. although very unrealistic, it teaches the audience that sticking through the tough times and always working hard will result in a better outcome than what you started at. forrest's success can only be attributed to those simple lessons forrest was taught by his mother as a kid growing up. the effective storytelling of forrest's journey makes forrest gump of the most memorable films. filled with comedy, drama, and action, the movie surpasses expectations for storytelling as well as the visual effects elevating the film to a higher level. the movie effectively provides support for its audience, advising them how they can get through life successfully even if they start from the back of the pack like forrest. these three aspects are just a few of the reasons why forrest gump is one of the most iconic movies and why it won six academy awards. even if you are not old enough to relate to the events of the film, it serves as one of the most enjoyable and iconic movies ever created. forrest's journey provides the basis for what a movie should be, and what film directors should aspire to make.";15 October 2018;10;['misleading', 'true', 'good', 'forr', 'jelly', 'tasty', 'such', 'disgusting',

2670;waltersterns;so meet. forrest gump is an ideal cog in the system, incapable of understanding the laws of its functioning. at first glance, it seemed to me that the film tells about the absence of the need for a great mind for a full-fledged existence in modern society, as well as about the advantages of not understanding rotten human relationships and the fact that you are constantly used by outsiders in your goals. judging by the monologue at the end, the essence of the film comes down to humility in front of fate and hope for the best, regardless of your intelligence and the number of limbs. american standard, do not say anything. but if you run through the plot of the film, you can see that the film is about dedication and the search for its purpose. almost all the main characters of this story had their own dreams and goals. except forrest, naturally. and you know what? all of them caught a big bummer. they tried to use the system to the best of their consciousness, in the end the system had them and their dreams. forrest did not have the desires and skills of forecasting, which is why he was led by the system. since he had a couple of talents up his sleeve, the system accepted him very well, and everyone used it. moral plug for jenny, runner for school, cannon fodder in the army, propagandist on anti-war protest. in short, his whole life he needed a master who would indicate what and how to do it. the biggest host that characterizes this kind of film was a woman, jenny. after she left home, forrest, unable to bear the care of her mistress, ran senselessly for 3 years of her life (which i found funny, the system was able to use forrest here). so, we have a person who goes with the flow, whom life rewards with victories, money and well-being, which cannot be said about people who aspired to something. (their situation leveled off when they began to parasitize forrest, but this is unimportant). something wrong with the promise of the author, somewhere there is a catch? well, i am rounding out. true, one question remained: is forrest sr. the biological father of forrest jr.? that's a mystery ...;17 February 2019;9;['forr', 'ideal', 'incapable', 'first', 'great', 'fledged', 'modern', 'rotten', 'human', 'good', 'american', 'main', 'own', 'forr', 'big', 'good', 'forr', 'moral', 'anti', 'war', 'short', 'whole', 'big', 'forr', 'unable', 'funny', 'able', 'forr', 'forr', 'unimportant', 'wrong', 'true', 'forr', 'biological', 'forr'];0.2007936507936507
