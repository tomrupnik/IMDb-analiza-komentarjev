0;MartinHafer;while this movie is probably the most widely recognized film of the director kurosawa, it isn't my personal favorite--though it's close. but considering how many wonderful films he made and how this movie sparked the magnificent seven films, its impact and importance can't be ignored. and i would have to say that it deserves all the attention--it's just too bad that other films like yojimbo, sanjuro and the bad sleep well just haven't gotten all the attention this film has. actually, it['s strange that i am getting around to reviewing this film now--as i have seen it several times and thought i'd already reviewed it. the film begins in the feudal period in japan in a small town that is being terrorized by a gang. these thugs periodically come to strip the people of what little they have as well as their dignity--much like locusts. eventually, the gang's demands are so extreme that it appears they have no choice but to fight back when they next return--otherwise they face starvation. the problem is that these are simple peasants and they haven't got a prayer against ronin (i.e., samurai who have no master). eventually, townspeople get the idea to bring in some of their own ronin to fight against the evil gang. at this point, the film concentrates on the seven men--who they are, their motivations, etc. it is here that the film really excels. in fact, probably the least exciting portion of the film is the eventual battle between the forces. an excellent character study and a film with so much to love--great acting, direction and a dandy and exciting script.;2 August 2007;9;['personal', 'close', 'many', 'wonderful', 'magnificent', 'bad', 'other', 'bad', 'strange', 'several', 'feudal', 'small', 'little', 'extreme', 'next', 'simple', 'ronin', 'own', 'evil', 'exciting', 'eventual', 'excellent', 'much', 'great', 'dandy', 'exciting'];0.118125
1;TheLittleSongbird;as much as i do love ran, the hidden fortress and throne of blood, it was seven samurai that i love most of akira kurasawa's films. as with all kurasawa's films, it is incredibly well made with authentic scenery that would give meaning to the term epic and the camera work is truly spectacular. this is especially true in the final battle, with inspired use of moving and multiple camera, precise editing, telephoto lenses and variegated film speeds. as always with kurasawa, the direction is consistently brilliant. add to that a stirring score from fumio hayasaka and a thoughtful script and you have more reasons why seven samurai is so good. the story unfolds slowly, but never felt dull to me and is never hampered by the three-and-a-half-hour running time. plus seven samurai is interesting for being one of the first few to utilise the plot element of recruiting/gathering of heroes into a team to achieve a goal, seen especially with when the audience is first introduced kambei. the action is spectacular and looks even better with the use of multiple cameras from various angles, and any humanity seven samurai has, and it does have a lot, is shown in a poignant way. the cast are excellent, with takashi shimura and especially toshiro mifune the standouts. overall, of a resume of one of the greatest directors who ever lived, responsible for many wonderful movies(and i'd say that seven samurai and ran are among the best movies ever made) seven samurai stands tall. one of the easiest 10/10s i've ever given. bethany cox;9 June 2012;10;['hidden', 'most', 'authentic', 'epic', 'spectacular', 'true', 'final', 'multiple', 'precise', 'brilliant', 'thoughtful', 'more', 'good', 'dull', 'interesting', 'first', 'few', 'spectacular', 'well', 'multiple', 'various', 'poignant', 'excellent', 'great', 'responsible', 'many', 'wonderful', 'good', 'tall', 'easy'];0.3669642857142857
2;Leofwine_draca;"this japanese samurai film from akira kurosawa sets up a classic action template that would inspire everything from the magnificent seven to the seven magnificent gladiators and utilises the style of camera-work and direction that would inspire hollywood movies till this day. be warned, at three hours and ten minutes, this is a leisurely-paced film that takes its time to get to know the leading characters, and many fans of the type of slickly-edited, no-attention-span blockbusters that are made these days will find themselves struggling to sit through the film in one go. however, perseverance is worthwhile, because seven samurai is a very well made film despite the low budget. the direction and camera-work, as mentioned previously, are spot on and kurosawa reveals himself at home both in the crisply-shot action sequences and the character-fuelled drama. another big plus for the film is the cast, all of whom really add to the movie experience as a whole. best of all is takashi shimura as shimada, the chief samurai; taciturn yet friendly, strong yet understanding, he gives an outstanding performance. shimada's character is off-set by toshiro mifune's kikuchiyo, who has more of a scene-stealing part as a farmer's-son-turned-samurai; mifune brings vitality and humour to the movie and, while i'm sure his gurning and frenzied comedy will not be to all tastes, he certainly ups the excitement and fun of the film whenever he's around. the supporting characters are also great, especially the stern kyuzo and the youngster of the seven, katsushiro. the plot is simple yet is strong enough to have been rehashed countless times. elements of battle tactics and warfare are used sparingly but effectively, and the emotional punch is there; at the closing scenes, i felt like crying right along with katsushiro, due to all the unnecessary bloodshed and killing that immediately preceded that moment. seven samurai is best experienced by watching it appreciatively; of course it looks dated nowadays, and many of the plot elements have become cliched. appreciating what it did to cinema in 1954, though, reveals what a strong, expertly-made and influential movie it really is.";13 December 2016;8;['japanese', 'classic', 'magnificent', 'magnificent', 'hollywood', 'many', 'worthwhile', 'low', 'big', 'good', 'chief', 'friendly', 'strong', 'understanding', 'outstanding', 'more', 'sure', 'frenzied', 'great', 'stern', 'simple', 'strong', 'countless', 'emotional', 'unnecessary', 'many', 'cliched', 'strong', 'influential'];0.3609848484848485

5;claudio_carvalho;"in the sixteenth century, in japan, a poor village is frequently looted by armed bandits losing their crop of rice. their patriarch grandpa advises the villagers to hire a ronin to defend their village. four farmers head to town to seek out their possible protectors, but they just can offer three meals of rice per day and lodging for the samurai. they succeed in hiring the warming-hearted veteran kambei shimada (takashi shimura) that advises that they need six other samurai to protect their lands. kambei recruits the necessary five samurai and the brave jester kikuchiyo (toshiro mifune) and move to the village. after a feared reception, kambei plots a defense strategy and the samurai start training the farmers how to defend their lands and families for the battle that approaches. in order to celebrate the milestone of 4,000 reviews in imdb, i decided to watch again ""the seven samurai"", the most known masterpiece of akira kurosawa and among my top-10 movies ever. as far as i recall, this was the first samurai movie that i have watched and it is still my favorite despite many other excellent movies. ""the seven samurai"" is a perfect movie: the story and screenplay are amazing, dividing the dramatic story in the recruitment, reception, strategy, training, harvest, romance and the final battle of the samurai in such a way that the viewer does not feel the 207 minutes running time. the direction of akira kurosawa is perfectionist as usual, and the choreography of the battle in the rain is extremely realistic. the acting is top-notch, highlighting toshiro mifune in a great shape, climbing trees, jumping and fighting in the role of a funny character. the cinematography, set decoration, costumes, lighting, everything is fantastic. in 1960, john sturges remade this masterpiece with the western ""the magnificent seven"". my vote is ten. title (brazil): ""os 7 samurais"" (""the 7 samurai"")";2 August 2009;10;['sixteenth', 'poor', 'armed', 'possible', 'other', 'necessary', 'brave', 'feared', 'kambei', 'known', 'first', 'favorite', 'many', 'other', 'excellent', 'perfect', 'amazing', 'dramatic', 'final', 'perfectionist', 'usual', 'realistic', 'top', 'great', 'funny', 'fantastic', 'western', 'magnificent'];0.2924242424242424
6;classicsoncall;"apparently it took a second viewing for me to really appreciate this film. the first time around i must have been distracted to the point of being inattentive and today i'm glad i gave it another shot. what particularly struck me this time was the gorgeous cinematography, which hooks you right from the start with the menacing ride of the bandit clan upon the seemingly deserted village. though filmed in black and white, the images are crisp and clean, elevating the result to a true work of art. in fact, the effect is hypnotic at times, and one must concentrate to stay with the story that unfolds. thinking back on my first experience with the picture, i tried to figure out what might have prevented my viewing pleasure. yes the film is long and there is a tendency for kurosawa to keep the camera stationary for an inordinate length of time to establish mood and a point of view. perhaps it also had something to do with the motion of the villagers who appear to react erratically, almost as if they were self consciously forcing their activity. now obviously those elements have not gone away, but it's just that i saw it all in a different light with this viewing. director kurosawa does take his time building to the action. the entire first half of the film is used to introduce his characters and set up the framework for defending the village. when the village is finally assaulted by the marauding bandits, the samurai follow a methodical plan devised by their leader kambei shimada (takashi shimura), whereby one or two of the outlaws are allowed entry into the village while the rest are kept at bay, allowing the villagers to defeat their foes systematically and decisively. the villagers resemble a swarm of bees each time they descend on a fallen enemy. through a diverse mix of personalities and temperaments, kurosawa explores various character traits of the samurai, among them honor, loyalty, selflessness, courage and even humor. the comic relief offered by kikuchiyo (toshiro mifune) when attempting to ride the horse for the first time came just at the right moment to break the unrelenting tension faced by the warriors. kurosawa even delves into matters of the heart with the relationship of katsushiro and shino, unfavorably received by the obsessive behavior of shino's father. all in all, i'm glad i gave this picture a second chance.

8;jboothmillard;i read the description of this film given in the book 1001 movies you must see before you die, i was surprised to find out that it was remade into the magnificent seven, so naturally i wanted to see the original source, from director akira kurosawa. basically, set in the 16th century of japan, a poor mountain village in the country is constantly being robbed, looted and made fearful by an armed gang of marauding bandits causing them to lose their rice crop. the villagers have finally had enough and decide that they need outside help to both defend themselves, and get rid of the thieves once and for all. warm-hearted veteran samurai kambei shimada (bafta nominated takashi shimura) is approached by young samurai katsushiro okamoto (isao kimura)to be hired to defend the village, and he gladly accepts. together, along with two of the town's farmers, under the advice of kambei, they leave the village to find six other samurai warriors to protect the lands. they successfully find and recruit four skilled fighters and swordsmen, gorobei katayama (yoshio inaba), shichiroji (daisuke kato), heihachi hayashida (minoru chiaki) and kyuzo (seiji miyaguchi). they had originally planned to leave with just these four men, but they spot clownish but skilled samurai kikuchiyo okamoto (bafta nominated toshiro mifune), and with everyone's encouragement, katsushiro is secured as the seventh samurai. with the promise of three free meals a day the seven samurai look forward to their arrivals, but when they get back to the village with a fearful reception, but don't worry, things settle. kambei gets to work immediately on the battle strategy against the gang of thieves, and the other samurai start training the people in the village to be ready for any incoming attack or raid. there are forty bandits in total, and the first attack gets underway, with a good amount of the opposite side being brought down, but of course there has to be a casualty. gorobei was shot and killed in the first attack, kikuchiyo's friend yohei (bokuzen hidari) was also killed in action, but the samurai and villagers are determined not to be beaten in the second bandit brawl. kyuzo suffered the fate of the second attack, and the final attack finishes off the gang of thieves, with kikuchiyo being the final samurai to meet their maker. in the end, the three surviving samurai, kambei, katsushiro and shichiroji look over the villagers looking happy planting their new crop, and the graves of the other four warriors. also starring kamatari fujiwara as manzo, yoshio tsuchiya as rikichi and yoshio kosugi as mosuke. being three hours and ten minutes long i was expecting to doze off and have to rewind at some point, but with great acting, the training and fight sequences, historical detail, humanism, the final battles, but also clever editing and speed techniques, this black and white is a masterpiece of foreign cinema, a brilliant classic action drama. it was nominated the oscars for best art direction-set decoration and best costume design, and it was nominated the bafta for best film from any source. very good!;8 December 2010;9;['surprised', 'magnificent', 'original', 'poor', 'fearful', 'armed', 'enough', 'outside', 'warm', 'hearted', 'young', 'other', 'skilled', 'gorobei', 'seiji', 'clownish', 'skilled', 'seventh', 'free', 'fearful', 'other', 'ready', 'incoming', 'first', 'underway', 'good', 'opposite', 'first', 'second', 'second', 'final', 'final', 'happy', 'new', 'other', 'mosuke', 'great', 'historical', 'final', 'clever', 'black', 'white', 'foreign', 'brilliant', 'classic', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'good'];0.1969507575757576

entertaining . kurosawa's vintage pic set in 16th century japan , a small farming village beset by marauding attackers hires 7 professional samurai to rid of the scourge. as a group of villagers go to the nearly town where find kambei : takashi shimura , who has carried out a risked rescue of a baby taken hostage by a nasty bandit . as kambei walks towards town a young samurai, katsushiro : kimura , asks to become his acolyte. then the farmers ask kambei to help defend their village; to their great joy, he accepts. kambei, with katsushiro's assistance, then enlists four samurai more from the city, . kambei initially decides that seven masterless samurai , ronin , would be necessary to recruit , and time is running short . the villagers beg him to take katsushiro also and, with some prodding by the others, he agrees . a clownish samurai named kikuchiyo : toshiro mifune , whom kambei had rejected for the mission, follows them to the village at a distance , ignoring their protestations and attempts to drive him away. the team gradually come together and 7 samurai , at last , one by one, each with distinctive skills and personality traits ; all of them to help a poor village against savage thieves .as kambei and his buddies , each of whom comes for a different reason , must free a village attacked by heinous outlaws who are devastating the small location . all of them get a chance to redeem themselves . later on , the bunch develops a plan to secure the villagers defend it against enemy attack . this is a magnificent picture by akira kurosawa starred by his ordinary actors toshiro mifune , and takashi shimura , being his international breakthrough one . sweeping , dramatic , complex human drama with all the ingredients : suspense , action , comedy , character studio and many other things . seven samurai , the picture blends drama , violent fights , emotion , slaughters with high body-count and results to be pretty entertaining as well as thought-provoking . it is incredibly detailed vision in its own right , as the impact of the action and combats on this trail-blazing adventure film opened the floodgates for the huge numbers of samurai films and subsequent spaghetti westerns that made fortunes for their producers in the sixties and early seventies . dramatically staged sword-plays occur on and off throughout the plot . the story is classic and traditional , following its interesting premise in subsequent remakes , rif-offs and sequels , including customary misfit band formed by an eclectic gang with diverse characters as well as speciality . kurosawa took an elemental western issue good guys against bad guys plot and turned it into a breathtaking classy which is still probably the best-know and one best samurai film to come from japan . at the time of its making it got a big success at the boxoffice around the world . kurosawa's pacing is immaculate and allows for periods of calm in which to establish roles punctuated by viscerally thrilling burst of action . these culminate in the overwhelming climatic battle between the bandits and the samurai which ranks among the very nicest combat scenes ever put on movie . it is followed by several reboots and imitations . standing out the magnificent seven by john sturges . unlike sturges' remake in 7 samurai the roles grow originally from the action and they are not conveniently established by star-casting , like in the american film formed by big actors as yul brynner , charles bronson , james coburn , robert vaughn , brad dexter , elli wallach . very good acting by toshiro mifune as a valiant samurai , as he is a harebrained but courageous young dominating warrior , as well as takashi shimura as the intelligent and brave leader of the fabulous samurai . this one made an international star out of toshiro mifune . this fiercely-charging , uncompromising picture was compellingly directed by akira kurosawa and being exhibited with subtitles or dubbed .after working in a wide range of genres, kurosawa made this awesome film . and available in a big number of versions of varying length , all too long . kurosawa's previous and subsequent years saw the low-key , touching living (1952) , this great epic the seven samurais (1954), the barbaric , fascinating shakespeare adaptation throne of blood (1957) , a macbeth's version , a masterful rendition that transports the story to medieval japan , and a fun pair of samurai movies yojimbo (1961) and sanjuro (1962) , and rashomon , often credited as the reason the academy created the ""best foreign film"" category. when this film was released internationally to rave reviews, many speculated that akira kurosawa was influenced by citizen kane (1941) in the element of flashbacks that ultimately provide conflicting accounts of events. however, kurosawa didn't even see orson welles's film until several years after . rashomon won the top prize at the venice film festival, and first revealed the richness of japanese cinema to the west.yet , there was a quieter side to kurosawa's nature , expressed most succinctly on living , the lower depths and especially the medical drama red beard . after a lean period in the late 1960s and early 1970s, though, kurosawa attempted suicide . other important movies were : the idiot based on feodor dostowieski , drunken angel , scandal , a quiet duel , tiger's tale , high and low . he survived, and made a small, personal, low-budget picture with dodes'ka-den (1970), a larger-scale russian co-production dersu uzala (1975) an epic tale of adventure in turn-of-the-century siberia and , with the help of admirers francis ford coppola and george lucas, the samurai tale kagemusha (1980), which kurosawa described as a dry run for ran (1985), an epic adaptation of shakespeare's ""king lear"" . he continued to work into his eighties with the more personal akira kurosawa's dreams (1990), and madadayo (1993) and rhapsody in august . kurosawa's films have always been more popular in the west than in his native japan, where reviewers have viewed his adaptations of western genres and authors with suspicion , but he's revered by american and european film-makers, one of his least well-known films but most agreeable pictures is the bad sleep well , a transposition of an ed mcbain detective novel , being remade many his pictures such as the seven samurais (1954), as the magnificent seven (1960),the hidden fortress (1958), as star wars (1977)as yojimbo (1961) as for a fistful of dollars by sergio leone (1964), in fact kurosawa's style was the biggest single influence on the spaghetti western sub-genre ; as his samurai 'western's were copied not only in america but also in italy . rating : 7.7/10 . better than

21;StevePulaski;"countless reviews, analyses, essays, thinkpieces, and even full-length novels concerning the sheer genius and magnitude of akira kurosawa's masterful seven samurai have been published, so a very lengthy analysis from me is unnecessary, given there's probably very little to say that hasn't already been said (the inherent struggle of reviewing beloved classics). however, in the midst of this, the obvious elements of the film ostensibly get lost in the shuffle, due to the focus being placed on analyzing themes and character motivations in the film (a somewhat essential, but sometimes distracting element to film criticism, leaving important focal points like shooting techniques, cinematography, and pacing in the dust). i'm prepared to extract seven samurai's more surface attributes, in addition to affirming why this film has etched itself into being one of the greatest films ever made. for a film over three hours in length, the plot is incredibly simple, as it concerns a group of japanese farmers are experiencing an intrusion of bandits during the sengoku period in japan. the tight-knit group of villagers are finding their peaceful and harmless way of life the target of violence and theft of their minimal goods, such as rice, beans, and sake. powerless, and largely pacifist, the farmers have little way to defend themselves, so they call on seven samurais to defend them in their time of need. led by kikuchiyo (toshiro mifune), though his samurai roots fraudulent, the samurais and farmers unleash a battle for the ages against the ruthless bandits. kurosawa was given unprecedented creative freedom by the studio toho, which was about to strike gold with ishiro honda's godzilla months later for the same reason, so seven samurai feels uncommonly original and fresh; a product of kurosawa's rather than passive studio heads. like artists before him who obtained the rare luxury, kurosawa took this creativity and ran with it, first and foremost, establishing newfound storytelling elements that would become something of a standard in films to come. plot elements now viewed as cliches such as the inferior team calling on the superior team for help in time of need, a star-crossed romance in the midst of wartime and violence, and finding sympathy and love for the underdog were all debatably pioneered in seven samurai. on a technical level, seven samurai is a marvel for a plethora of reasons, as well. it was one of the first films to use telephoto lenses, shooting grandscale battle scenes from multiple different angles, maintaining continuity and giving the film fluidity. kurosawa would set up three different cameras, each capturing different, often unique, angles of the battle scenes late in the film, in order to plunge the viewer in the center of the action rather than making them feel like they were lost in a cacophony of madness. this choice undoubtedly hails from kurosawa's view of the traditional american western, which he claims had a certain ""grammar"" and poetry to their storytelling and their visuals. with that, kurosawa creates an immaculately detailed picture, filled with characters that take time to unfold and showcase their complexities as humans. there's rikichi (yoshio tsuchiya), a villager with a short fuse and a big plan to give anybody who messes with his villagers hell, manzo (kamatari fujiwara), a man who's prime concern in the midst of all this violence is his beloved daughter shino (keiko tsushima), who meets and falls in love with katsushiro (isao kimura), one of the seven samurais. my personal favorite character was yohei (bokuzen hidari), a feeble and sensitive elder of his village, shocked and dismayed at what it has become in the wake of violence. his facial expressions speak volumes as loud as the wails of bandits far and wide, and his sensitivity provides the film with some of the sadder elements of the film. kurosawa paints these characters in a way that's humanizing and the liberal runtime allows for us to get to know these characters and their weaknesses rather than looking at them as faceless characters plunged into a long, rowdy setpiece. ultimately, it's the richness and the overall density of what is uniformly a simple, straight-forward picture that makes akira kurosawa's sprawling, expansive epic so memorable. he combines heartbreaking drama, serious suspense, horror, light-hearted comedy, and credible pathos over the course of three and a half-hours and rarely slows down in his desire to create a film that's immersive and groundbreaking. all of this is encapsulated in a film that has a plot that virtually anyone can follow and a character most can relate to or sympathize with. seven samurai is powerful cinema in the first degree; a film more than fifty years old that feels distinctly modern, making a statement and leaving us with a lot of content and insights to chew on, before, like a cowboy in a traditional western, riding off and letting us soak in what we just saw as if we're perched directly under the hot, debilitating sun. starring: toshiro mifune, takashi shimura, keiko tsushima, isao kimura, bokuzen hidari daisuke kato, seiji miyaguchi, yoshio inaba, minoru chiaki, kamatari fujiwara, kokuten kodo, yoshio tsuchiya, yukiko shimazaki, and eijiro tono. directed by: akira kurosawa.";10 September 2015;10;['countless', 'full', 'sheer', 'masterful', 'lengthy', 'unnecessary', 'little', 'inherent', 'beloved', 'obvious', 'essential', 'important', 'focal', 'prepared', 'more', 'great', 'simple', 'japanese', 'peaceful', 'harmless', 'minimal', 'such', 'powerless', 'little', 'fraudulent', 'ruthless', 'unprecedented', 'creative', 'about', 'same', 'original', 'fresh', 'passive', 'rare', 'newfound', 'storytelling', 'such', 'inferior', 'superior', 'technical', 'first', 'multiple', 'different', 'different', 'different', 'unique', 'traditional', 'american', 'certain', 'detailed', 'short', 'big', 'prime', 'beloved', 'personal', 'favorite', 'feeble', 'sensitive', 'facial', 'loud', 'wide', 'sad', 'liberal', 'long', 'rowdy', 'overall', 'simple', 'straight', 'expansive', 'epic', 'memorable', 'heartbreaking', 'serious', 'light', 'hearted', 'credible', 'half', 'immersive', 'groundbreaking', 'powerful', 'first', 'more', 'old', 'modern', 'traditional', 'hot', 'seiji'];0.1281982942430703

'seven samurai (1954)' may be three-and-a-half hours long (and literally the longest film i've seen to date), but it moves at a lick. of course, it's not edge-of-your-seat exciting right the way through, but it's not supposed to be. it moves towards a well-documented 'finale' that, essentially, takes up around half of its run-time. the actual gathering of the eponymous seven is a relatively breezy affair; much more time is spent on the planning and execution of the war-like village-defence that most pictures would relegate to their final set-pieces. here, however, the prolonged battle is just that: prolonged. it's violent, messy and drawn-out, lacking any real semblance of heroism or clear cut 'good guys'. obviously, we want our focal characters to succeed. nobody is perfect, however. the seemingly innocent farmers have dark secrets they go to great lengths to conceal and the samurai themselves use a number of seemingly underhanded, if necessary, techniques in their quest for victory. even the largely villainous bandits are presented as just order-following counterpoints to the samurai, echoes of the soldiers our heroes once were. they're, ostensibly, separated from the seven only by their position in the attack-defence equation. such is the very nature of the feature, its narrative shaded in as much grey as the celluloid itself. in that, it finds a very unique, somewhat downbeat perspective. when all is said and done, was it worth it? it's a question that the piece doesn't so much seek to answer as dare to pose, rounding off a nuanced experience that isn't afraid to leave its audience unfulfilled. it spends as much time on its smaller, more personal moments as it does on its larger, more technically-impressive ones. the latter may be what everyone, collectively, remembers but the former are what make this a landmark in the genre. each core player has something significant to do, even if they don't necessarily undergo an overall arc. some of the main seven do begin to bleed into one another, but even the most generic of the lot have something that allows them to stand out. plus, the focus is placed on a few key components and these are explored incredibly well. by crafting characters that seem so complete you could almost swear they were real, the movie creates a tremendous connection with the audience. you care about pretty much everyone on-screen, which leads to a great deal of tension when their lives are on the line. the unceremonious nature of every single death lends itself to an almost greater sense of loss, too; anyone could die at any moment. the affair isn't overly dark, though. it has an excellent handle on its tone, providing moments of real levity to balance out its sombre segments. when the action comes, it's as entertaining as you'd expect. it's actually tinged with a certain sadness - which makes it all the more distinct and, even, compelling - but the fantastic choreography is a sight to behold. this all results in an adventure unlike almost any other. it's a masterclass of film-making that should keep you engaged for its entire, mammoth-sized duration. 8/10";5 August 2019;8;['slow', 'meticulous', 'long', 'exciting', 'actual', 'eponymous', 'breezy', 'more', 'like', 'most', 'final', 'prolonged', 'violent', 'messy', 'real', 'clear', 'good', 'focal', 'perfect', 'innocent', 'dark', 'great', 'underhanded', 'necessary', 'villainous', 'such', 'very', 'much', 'unique', 'downbeat', 'worth', 'much', 'nuanced', 'afraid', 'unfulfilled', 'much', 'small', 'personal', 'large', 'impressive', 'former', 'significant', 'overall', 'main', 'generic', 'few', 'key', 'complete', 'real', 'tremendous', 'great', 'unceremonious', 'single', 'great', 'dark', 'excellent', 'real', 'sombre', 'entertaining', 'certain', 'distinct', 'compelling', 'fantastic', 'other', 'entire', 'mammoth', 'sized'];0.1978470111448834
24;ElMaruecan82;"1/ birth of modern cinema : seven samurai, of unequal skills and experience, are hired for a dangerous mission : saving a village from bandits who plan to attack after the harvest. that very premise fathered almost every action movie for the next fifty years, from its remake ""the magnificent seven"" or ""the dirty dozen"" to ""inglourious basterds"" or ""the expendables"". quoting ebert, the film also introduces the first samurai kambei (takashi shimura) while he rescues a young boy by disguising as a monk, which foresees the narrative device of introducing the hero through an unrelated mission. another interesting trivia is that the original script counted on six samurai, with toshiro mifune playing seiji myagushi's role as kyuzo, the taciturn master swordsman. but then kurosawa had a strike of genius. 2/ every group needs a scene-stealer : among the six, you have the zealous rookie katsushiro (isao kimura) the amiable although less-skilled heihachi, played by another recognizable face : minoru chiaki (the tallest one), the wise and experienced leader, the stone-faced stoic bad-ass, and other competent lieutenants. that gallery, that was to be reproduced in several films, was incomplete. as interesting and relatable as they were, kurosawa understood that they would be boring without the obligatory scene-stealer, and how do you steal the thunder of serious and no-nonsense ronin? simply by playing it in the most exuberant, flamboyant, noisy, showoff, in fact, the toshiro mifune way. as kikuchiyo, mifune is the spice, the soul of the film, much more with an attitude that never feels gratuitous. 3/ characterize them through action : indeed, not only each of the samurai is given recognizable traits, but the personalities are revealed through action, never wasted on pointless dialogue. mifune is obviously desperate to show his skills as a samurai, wearing the most visible armors, the longest spears, overcompensating obviously. it's only later that kanbei understands he's a farmer's son himself. and he's not the only character to have a secret, the hot-headed farmer rikichi (yoshio tsuchiya) holds a terrible one and the young katsushiro lives a romance with a villager's daughter played by the inevitable keiko tsushima. the village becomes the arena of another battle between classes and egos. ronin, perceived as lustful, dangerous or greedy individuals are feared by villagers even though they're supposed to help them. but as bandits attack the weak, and samurai protect them, villagers have no other chance than trusting the samurai and getting along with them. 4/ three-act structure : a school-case on that matter : hiring the team, preparing the battle and fighting. the sequences of equal length are handled with methodic and realistic patience. we know the samurai's value for they accept to fight in exchange of hospitality, millet and also some consideration, but it takes more to build sympathy. as it takes time for villagers to learn how to fight, the occasion of a few comedic scenes involving kikuchyo and the poor cowardly yohei (bokuzen hidari). and there's the battle, an even more heart-pounding sequence because it doesn't happen in once. it's made of preemptive strikes where they discover that the enemies have three muskets, which are like bullets from one-gun movies (kurosawa's noir- masterpiece ""stray dog"" to name one) each one plays a role, each death is memorable, that's the emotional reward of 'slowness', just as kambei who takes his time counting the number of bandits killed. 5/ know how to use time and space : ""seven samurai"" is shot in exterior, not in studio because kurosawa wanted to give the film the most authentic feel, regardless of the costs or delays in productions, he followed his instinct of a filmmaker. therefore, the setting plays a pivotal role, kambei inspects the zone and orders the construction of ditches around the village, later; groups of villagers would welcome any intruding bandit with spears.. the stratagem works as it allows them to capture bandits or kill them one by one. but bandits learns to overcome them and enter the village during a climactic downpour during which water and mud slow down every movement and make the battle more chaotic and the thrills more breathtaking, and the ultimate confrontation more emotionally satisfying. 6/ master director, editor and storyteller : kurosawa directed these battle scenes with a remarkable craftsmanship, swinging between large panoramic shots with standard classics like the enemy peering from over a cliff and horsemen riding it down, to more close-ups of swords clinching each other. watching the film, i was left with the impression that kurosawa didn't take chances but on the contrary, the most different and awkward angles he could, and thanks to a painstaking dedication to editing, he got this magnificent result. kurosawa was a great director because he mastered two things : editing and storytelling. 7/ legacy : so, if there ever was a center of cinema's universe, no one could be as influential for modern film-making as the japanese master. ""rashomon"" was the first movie to use the unreliable narrator device and alternate views of the same reality, and ""hidden fortress"" and ""yojinbo"" would later influence two of the most popular movie series : ""star wars"" and leone's spaghetti westerns. but for all they're worth, these legacies are nothing compared to the milestone directed in 1954, that title preceded by its reputation, perhaps the most famous japanese movie : ""seven samurai"". and there are reasons why ""seven samurai"" is so grandly regarded, at least, seven.";24 July 2015;10;['modern', 'unequal', 'dangerous', 'very', 'next', 'magnificent', 'dirty', 'inglourious', 'first', 'young', 'narrative', 'unrelated', 'interesting', 'original', 'taciturn', 'zealous', 'amiable', 'skilled', 'recognizable', 'tall', 'wise', 'experienced', 'stoic', 'bad', 'other', 'competent', 'several', 'incomplete', 'interesting', 'relatable', 'obligatory', 'serious', 'exuberant', 'flamboyant', 'noisy', 'more', 'gratuitous', 'recognizable', 'pointless', 'desperate', 'visible', 'long', 'only', 'terrible', 'young', 'inevitable', 'ronin', 'lustful', 'dangerous', 'greedy', 'weak', 'other', 'equal', 'methodic', 'realistic', 'more', 'few', 'comedic', 'poor', 'cowardly', 'more', 'preemptive', 'memorable', 'emotional', 'authentic', 'pivotal', 'climactic', 'chaotic', 'breathtaking', 'ultimate', 'satisfying', 'remarkable', 'large', 'panoramic', 'standard', 'close', 'other', 'different', 'awkward', 'painstaking', 'magnificent', 'great', 'influential', 'modern', 'japanese', 'first', 'unreliable', 'alternate', 'same', 'hidden', 'popular', 'worth', 'famous', 'japanese', 'least'];0.1185531135531135
25;gbill-74877;it's hard to heap more superlatives on this film given all those that it's received from countless critics and viewers over the years. it's certainly worthy of them. the story is perfect. the characters and acting are memorable. director akira kurosawa has a fantastic sense of pace, and even at three and a half hours, every scene seems important. we're transported to 16th century japan, a time when bandits terrorize the countryside and a village of farmers, but the film's themes are timeless. as epic as the movie is, with a samurai team of six assembled one by one by its leader (takashi shimura), it would not have been the same without the seventh, a samurai-wannabe played by toshiro mifune. he's brash, exuberant, funny, brave, foolish, and heartfelt. he's in many brilliant scenes, but my favorite is when he describes what tricks the farmers may be up to, and we gradually understand that he himself was a farmer's son, with a tragic past. his performance is right up there with brando in terms of intensity and honesty. kurosawa is smart in so many ways here, one of which is to orient the viewer to the village and its surroundings by showing the leader of the group plan its defense. in addition to mifune's character, he also lightens the mood with the forbidden love between the young samurai apprentice (isao kimura) and a young woman masquerading as a boy (keiko tsushima). their scene in the woodland flowers is gorgeous. i love how the samurai are as tough as nails, but know they don't need to show it, and instead exude a sense of calm, playfulness, and understanding. with the exception of an extremely skillful and solemn swordsman (seiji miyaguchi), they smile in many scenes, and all of them accept the difficulty and danger of their fate. despite their skill, they do not seek out violence. they are calm in moments of peace, intelligent in planning for battle, and brave and unflinching under attack. while the film and these character types have been emulated many times over the years, the difference between these samurai and western action heroes is still stark, and refreshing. in this little village and the situation it faces, we see a microcosm of the world. we see all of the very natural reactions to pressure, and despite the mythic quality of a small outnumbered band of heroic samurai, the film has an authenticity to it. we see all of the very natural reactions to pressure. there are themes you might expect: honor, duty, discipline, and that sort of thing, but at its core, the message is the need to stand up to evil, and the great debt that we owe to those who have done so.;10 March 2018;10;['hard', 'more', 'countless', 'worthy', 'perfect', 'memorable', 'fantastic', 'important', 'timeless', 'epic', 'same', 'brash', 'exuberant', 'funny', 'brave', 'foolish', 'heartfelt', 'many', 'brilliant', 'tragic', 'smart', 'many', 'young', 'young', 'woodland', 'gorgeous', 'tough', 'calm', 'skillful', 'solemn', 'seiji', 'many', 'calm', 'intelligent', 'brave', 'many', 'western', 'stark', 'refreshing', 'little', 'natural', 'mythic', 'small', 'outnumbered', 'heroic', 'natural', 'great'];0.2687067562067561

30;Platypuschow;i've been on a toho binge for a while now and for the most part the films have been enjoyable, especially those by kurosawa. the earlier films were dark, bleak and unsettling viewing and therefore going into seven samurai i was of two minds. first i expected more of the same, in both quality and tone but then on the flipside at time of writing this is ranked as the 19th highest rated movie on imdb which is incredible. my expectations were that it would be good, but that's about it. seeing takashi shimura in the credits also confirmed my logic that this was going to at least be an entertaining three and a half hours. i was mistaken, seven samurai is not good............it's outstanding. wonderfully crafted, perfectly scored, incredibly choreographed, well acted and beautifully written this is well deserving of it's high place and i would consider it nothing short of a masterpiece. if you check out my imdb rating distribution it's very clear to see that getting anything higher than an eight is a rarity, this deserves it on so many levels. i didn't expect this level of quality further as generally i don't tend to agree with titles in the imdb top 250, this however i do i thoroughly unconditionally agree. a masterpiece and essential viewing, i don't even need to give the premise of the movie in this review and must simply stress that this is film making mastery at its finest. the good: takashi shimura very well shot for its time perfectly crafted the bad: nothing springs to mind things i learnt from this movie: akira kurosawas should be a household name, not bruckheimer or bay! i'll put money down now that none of the remakes or movies heavily influenced by seven samurai comes close in quality;17 August 2018;9;['most', 'enjoyable', 'early', 'dark', 'bleak', 'unsettling', 'more', 'same', 'high', 'incredible', 'good', 'least', 'entertaining', 'mistaken', 'good', 'outstanding', 'choreographed', 'deserving', 'high', 'short', 'clear', 'high', 'many', 'essential', 'fine', 'bad'];0.1811111111111111

35;eddie_baggins;changing the landscape of cinema forever, seven samurai is a monumental film for the industry, with akira kurosawa's meticulously crafted action epic setting the tone not only for how films were shot moving forward but also setting up the now well-worn trope of groups banding together for a common cause, that allowed beloved favorites such as the dirty dozen, western riff the magnificent seven and even the avengers to be born into existence. shot over a grueling 148 day period and finalized far over its initial budget, samurai was a mammoth undertaking not only by the standards of the day in which is was made but by modern day standards also, as kurosawa would leave no stone unturned in creating his dream project that harked back to his own families heritage to the samurai warriors and his nations rich history of conflicts and over comings. set mostly in a stunningly made set that recreated the rural setting of japanese farming life in the 1500's, samurai embeds us into the lives of a group of farming families who are fearful of their lives at the hands of marauding bandits that threaten their otherwise peaceful existence, so much so that they come to the conclusion they must seek the help of skillful samurai to protect and defend their village and put a stop to the reign of terror that has engulfed their daily routines. paced without an ounce of rush or hurry (the film clocks in at an intermission held 3 hours and 27 minutes), kurosawa takes his time establishing each and every one of the eventual seven able bodied men that band together as one to help train and protect the village people, with the film giving that rare chance for all of its core characters to have their moment in the spotlight as we learn to understand their various motivations and traits as the film builds towards its more action packed final hour that features some of the era's most memorable set-pieces and directional choices. heralded as a favorite of many directors that we know and love today (star wars master george lucas credits the film as his favorite of all time), samurai's handling of its ensemble, lead by scene stealing kurosawa partner in crime toshiro mifune as the loud-mouthed kikuchiyo and takashi shimura as the yoda like master of the group kambei shimada, the way in which events transpire throughout samurai's simple but also layered plot are ground-breaking for the time and while lesser in impact and nature today thanks to so many years of film following in its wake, still make for mostly gripping viewing throughout. there are elements of the film that haven't aged as well as other components, some of the supporting performances are prone to overacting that was prevalent in the time period and there is a sense at times that a tighter cut of certain scenes could've helped the flow of the film but with its stunning cinematography courtesy of asakazu nakai (so many shots of this film could be transported straight to a painting/image on your wall), beautifully crafted surrounds designed by production designer takashi matsuyama and art director so matsuyama, kurosawa's ageless piece of art is deserving of its reputation as a grandfather of the cinema we now devour and love today. final say - it may not be the perfect film but seven samurai is the work of a once in a life time master who pushed the boundaries so that others who followed in his wake had a rule-book on how cinema could be done and worlds crafted to ones endless imagination and inspiration. 4 1/2 rice balls out of 5;15 July 2020;9;['monumental', 'epic', 'common', 'beloved', 'such', 'dirty', 'western', 'magnificent', 'initial', 'mammoth', 'modern', 'unturned', 'own', 'rich', 'set', 'rural', 'japanese', 'fearful', 'peaceful', 'skillful', 'daily', 'eventual', 'able', 'bodied', 'rare', 'core', 'various', 'more', 'final', 'memorable', 'directional', 'many', 'loud', 'mouthed', 'simple', 'less', 'many', 'other', 'prone', 'prevalent', 'tight', 'certain', 'stunning', 'many', 'ageless', 'final', 'perfect', 'endless'];0.1698299319727891

38;jamesrupert2014;desperate farmers hire a team of seven swordsmen to defend their poor village from marauding bandits. akira kurosawa's first, and arguably best, action-jidaigeki is the archetypal 'team of heroes' film and has been revisited in the old west, in ancient rome, in outer-space, and elsewhere in unofficial remakes of variable qualities. the cast is great, especially takashi shimura as the experienced but down-on-his-luck team leader kambei shimada, and although some people may get a bit tired of his antics, japanese super-star toshiro mifune (kikuchiyo) adds some levity to the lengthy drama. apparently given the ok to portray the character however he wanted, mifune plays the samurai-wannabe is an endlessly posturing, scratching, joking, lovable-goof, a counterpoint the other six generally stern heroes (especially the po-faced master-swordsman kyuzo (seiji miyaguchi)). legend has it that yul brynner, the head gunfighter in john sturges' famous western remake 'the magnificent seven' (1961) complained about co-star steve mcqueen, who he accused of 'scene-stealing' by constantly moving around in such a way as the catch the audiences' eye. if true, mcqueen certainly could have taken some tips in attracting attention from mifune's kinetic faux-ronin. another story about the western version was that when asked for permission to shoot parts of the film south of the border, mexican authorities agreed on the condition that the 'peon' villagers looked 'clean' - perhaps one of the decision-makers had seen kurosawa's original: most of the japanese peasants are filthy and some are down-right decrepit looking. there is not much to add to the abundance of material written about this film, its genre, director, and stars - suffice to say that it is entertaining, very well made, and the 200+ minutes pass by surprisingly quickly.;16 April 2020;9;['desperate', 'poor', 'first', 'good', 'archetypal', 'old', 'ancient', 'outer', 'unofficial', 'variable', 'great', 'experienced', 'tired', 'japanese', 'super', 'star', 'lengthy', 'lovable', 'other', 'stern', 'seiji', 'famous', 'western', 'magnificent', 'star', 'true', 'kinetic', 'western', 'mexican', 'clean', 'original', 'most', 'japanese', 'filthy', 'right', 'much', 'entertaining'];0.2014285714285714
39;Movie_Muse_Reviews;"""seven samurai"" should truly be regarded as a classic. compared to what little i have seen that came out of the 1950s, the storytelling here is truly epic. however, unlike many classics, this film didn't hit me like i expected from one of the consistently most highly rated films of all time. while there is great camera-work, great characters and engaging action, the film lacks the intimacy that a three and a half hour film ought to have. to its credit, the film is not too slow except for the beginning at times, but to say this film has a wide and trans- generational appeal is a stretch. the premise alone is classic and clearly oft-repeated. a village of poor japanese farmers go out to hire samurai to defend their village from bandits. the first portion of the film is finding the samurai and introducing the main characters, planning and training the villagers. why exactly the samurai agree to help these farmers is the film's deepest question. it would have been nice if that question really hit harder than it did. among the memorables in the cast are takashi shimura as kambei, the first of the samurai and toshiro mifune as kukichiyo, the wild and outspoken one who is technically not a samurai at all. director and writer akira kurosawa has these characters well-developed in terms of their personality and demeanor, but not as much in the sense of the audience identifying strongly with them (except, and notably so, kukichiyo). kukichiyo is a stellar character. you find yourself at odds with him at times and beside him at others--he's very admirable. these two mentioned characters, however, are the strongest in the way they are part of the theme. kurosawa certainly should not be shorted in credit as a great director. every scene is very precisely planned and executed and tastefully so. the action sequences are also entertaining. while i hate to make a comment like this, the lack of blood (due likely to budget issues) hurt the film for me. it doesn't have the same effect on me to see someone get stabbed or shot and not really see that. graphic violence in this film would have really helped me to feel the impact of the situation and the true nature of the life-or-death scenario the villagers were put in. their unruly behavior was helpful to that end, but it just didn't strike a chord. still, the film raises some great questions, namely the aforementioned simply put question of ""why?"" each samurai seems to have his own reason for wanting to defend a village that has nothing to offer him. the issues of class and moral conflict of selfishness vs. selflessness really do show in the film, just not pervasively. everything was there in this film, just not the lasting emotional impacting, that resonating feeling a film like this ought to have. perhaps that was due to length, though i think that only played a minimal role. i can't disagree with the majority that absolutely loves this film, but personally i didn't feel it. maybe you will.";8 June 2008;8;['little', 'epic', 'many', 'great', 'great', 'half', 'slow', 'wide', 'generational', 'classic', 'poor', 'japanese', 'first', 'main', 'deep', 'nice', 'first', 'wild', 'outspoken', 'much', 'stellar', 'admirable', 'strong', 'great', 'entertaining', 'due', 'likely', 'same', 'graphic', 'true', 'unruly', 'helpful', 'great', 'aforementioned', 'own', 'moral', 'emotional', 'due', 'minimal'];0.1806818181818181
40;Anonymous_Maxine;akira kurosawa's ambitious seven samurai is a film that has been emulated and duplicated and imitated in almost every medium you can think of, probably most in books and movies, as in the cases above. it is a classic story of protection and thinly disguised revenge that has tremendous satisfactory power, but kurosawa knows enough to avoid over-simplifying the impact of his film by introducing fault into the characters being protected. it is never really proved whether or not kikuchio's (toshiro mifune, a kurosawa veteran) assertion that the farmers were not nearly as poor (and therefore unable to pay them) as they let on is actually true, but it introduces doubt as to whether they are perfect victims. this is, of course, a movie about people, not about two dimensional characters, and any forward thinking village is going to try to save up whatever wealth or food that they can compile in order to ensure their own survival. i won't pretend to understand completely what compels samurai to do what they do, to risk their lives for such little (if any) reward, but i know that it is something that is almost universally accepted by samurais, and if i'm not mistaken, the samurai that abandon that code are known as ronin, a not very enviable title. the movie is definitely something of a commitment at three and a half hours, but it flows smoothly and it takes the time to get to know its characters, which allows it to present the real world so much more clearly, and i was surprised to find that one of the most powerful scenes in the entire film took place in the last minute or two of the movie. this is an intense anti-war film that allows you to identify with three different sides in battle, the victims, the protectors, and the oppressors (although that third not quite as much), and i think that one of the most important things that it does is that it provides a look into an ancient japanese culture and makes an assertion about what may have happened that allowed for more flexibility in their culture rather than a strict adherence to established traditions, much like chinua achebe does in his novel things fall apart, but i digress. one of the things that is introduced very early in the film is the fact that samurai are not entirely trusted by the villagers, and it is strictly forbidden that they mix with their culture, they are treated almost as subhumans, but their battlefield prowess is intensely desired. when a conflict arises about a local man's daughter becoming involved with a young samurai who is there to protect the village, he demands action and retribution, but the well-being of the rest of the village is deemed more important. there is a lot going on in the movie in terms of societal roles in japanese culture, which affects the way things pan out in the movie (although kurosawa was known for rebelling against such expectations, particularly later in his career), and like so many of kurosawa's films, there is so much going at so many levels that multiple viewings of the film will reveal more and more things going on that went unnoticed on the first time. argued by many to be kurosawa's greatest film, the seven samurai is certainly one among many.;1 February 2006;10;['ambitious', 'classic', 'tremendous', 'satisfactory', 'poor', 'unable', 'true', 'perfect', 'dimensional', 'forward', 'own', 'such', 'little', 'mistaken', 'ronin', 'enviable', 'real', 'surprised', 'powerful', 'entire', 'last', 'intense', 'anti', 'war', 'different', 'third', 'much', 'important', 'ancient', 'japanese', 'more', 'strict', 'much', 'novel', 'local', 'young', 'important', 'societal', 'japanese', 'such', 'many', 'much', 'many', 'multiple', 'more', 'more', 'unnoticed', 'first', 'many', 'great', 'many'];0.2142361111111111
41;freemantle_uk;seven samurai is seen as classic film which is highly rated: i am not going to disagree with that analysis. it is a milestone film in japanese cinema history and considered by some to be akira kurosawa's best film. it is influential, being remade as a western, the magnificent seven, and it cinematic tricks being used in other films, e.g. the star wars films. the story of the film is early modern japan is in a state of civil war. bandits roam the countryside and raid villages for food. one village decides to fight back, and hire seven ronins (masterless samurais) to help defend their village. the film is told in three major acts: recruit, training and the battle itself. each part lasts just over an hour. it is a combination of a serious drama, history and moments of light-hearted comedy. seven samuari looks a number of themes, including sexual politics, fear, the village politics, issues of appeasement and war, star-crossed lover, poverty, rural life and japanese history. seven samurai is very well written, looks into the issues of being noble or being plain merecanies. kurosawa's is great shows why he was one of the best in the business. it had good acting and you do care for the characters. i also didn't mind the moments of comedy. the fights scenes were also particularly brilliant and very well done. i personally feel that japanese cinema give us some of the best films around and i do like japanese culture. seven samuari is a must see for anyone who enjoys films, regardless.;27 July 2008;10;['classic', 'japanese', 'good', 'influential', 'magnificent', 'cinematic', 'other', 'early', 'modern', 'civil', 'major', 'serious', 'light', 'hearted', 'sexual', 'rural', 'japanese', 'noble', 'plain', 'great', 'good', 'good', 'brilliant', 'japanese', 'good', 'japanese'];0.2981107660455487
42;ebiros2;"this movie is made on a different vein even for akira kurosawa. kurosawa made movie to explore his inner artistry, and each movie was a different exploration of his approach to movie making. shichinin no samurai was different even for kurosawa as he explored the limits of realism in movie at the time, and has not been surpassed since then by any japanese movies. in this movie kurosawa limited other experimentation to maximize realism, and also didn't include the twist in plot he preferred like in rashomon or dive too deeply into personal issues like in norainu. this is probably the reason why movie stands so well after half a century, and have such universal appeal. for instance, kanbei's character is very believable even today as opposed to character of chris in the magnificent seven which was based on this movie. it was different even for kurosawa, and maybe the only actor who didn't understand it was toshiro mifune who've starred in kurosawa's movies many times. he acts just as he does in other of kurosawa's movies which he's played and distracts slightly from the realism. the tone of the movie is very realistic and focus on survival, as opposed to having a real war lord or a samurai. the samurai characters in this movie are actually ""ronin"" who are out of jobs and are wandering the landscape to find a lord who would hire them. so there are really no hero character in this movie (something of kurosawa's preference). the tone is somewhat noir but the difference is, every lines are sharp and beautiful in this movie. plot shows the agenda of each parties and person, and revolves around that. the focus is on people, and the issues and needs are immediate. there were other japanese movies of the time where the focus were on people (such as ozu jinpachi's tokyo monogatari), but none had the immediate need of people in the central focus as in this one. these are the things that separates shichnin no samurai from the rest of the pack. the movie was very experimental for its time, and it succeeded. nobody else was able to follow kurosawa's craft as history shows, no other samurai movie achieved the kind of realism this movie did. kurosawa himself went on to explore other areas of his artistry and never returned to this format. which makes this one of a kind movie and a master piece from one of the great director of 20th century.";1 July 2008;9;['different', 'inner', 'different', 'different', 'japanese', 'other', 'personal', 'such', 'universal', 'believable', 'magnificent', 'different', 'only', 'many', 'other', 'realistic', 'real', 'ronin', 'sharp', 'beautiful', 'immediate', 'other', 'japanese', 'such', 'immediate', 'central', 'experimental', 'able', 'other', 'other', 'kind', 'great'];0.1540229885057471
43;dee.reid;"...there was ""seven samurai"" (1954), famed director akira kurosawa's towering martial arts action epic of mythical proportions. action-packed with a wry sense of humor, the plot concerns seven ronin (master-less samurai) who are assembled by the distraught, desperate villagers of a small farm community to fend off the bandits that have been terrorizing them. ""seven samurai"" is the second film of kurosawa's i've seen within the last year, the first being ""yojimbo"" (1961), which also featured a strong, centralized performance from acclaimed actor toshiro mifune. ""seven samurai"" is seen as the movie that helped shape western action films, even though kurosawa himself was said to be heavily influenced by american westerns. ""seven samurai"" was eventually remade into ""the magnificent seven"" (1960), itself a popular movie in the united states but lacked the flair of its inspired source material. the actors, including lead takashi shimura as kambei, are flawless, as well as the many supporting players who were the farmers. my personal favorite is mifune's kikuchiyo, who absolutely steals the show as a humorous, loathsome troublemaker with a dirty mouth, but earns his heroism in an honest, self-sacrificing fashion. the bandits themselves remain mostly faceless, ghostly figures on horseback, though it's easy to compare them somewhat to the portrayal of native-americans in american westerns. although it's over three hours long, the centerpiece of ""seven samurai"" is its climatic siege, which eats up nearly the remaining hour. it's agonizing, grueling combat where many die and you are left questioning the title. but, instead of giving us one long, drawn-out sequence, kurosawa made the genius choice and has the battle broken up into several skirmishes, with moments of contemplation and anguish between.

47;smatysia;this is a pretty good movie, but not the best ever, as so many seem to think. what struck me, were the many deviations from samurai culture, something japanese audiences would be extremely cognizant of, since this culture was only finally crushed in the war ending just nine years before this film. one was at the beginning, when kambei 1)shaved his topknot to pass as a priest, and 2) did so to save a non-samurai child from a kidnapper. a samurai would have little, if any, concern for such a child. also kikuchiyu passing himself as samurai when not born into it. samurai was a hereditary caste and it would be unthinkable for any japanese to claim a status he was not entitled to. also, even the main plot about defending the farming village from bandits. i realize these men were ronin, meaning samurai not in service to a particular liege lord, but even so all of these things would have been dishonorable, and samurai would rather die than behave as such. kurosawa had to be acutely aware of these things, so it was obviously deliberate. it likely had to do with japanese politics and mores of the time, which escapes me as a westerner.;10 August 2015;8;['good', 'good', 'many', 'many', 'japanese', 'cognizant', 'non', 'samurai', 'little', 'hereditary', 'unthinkable', 'main', 'ronin', 'particular', 'dishonorable', 'such', 'aware', 'deliberate', 'japanese'];0.2288194444444444
48;kluseba;i hesitated checking out the japanese epic samurai drama seven samurai because i made the mistake to watch kurosawa akira's ran a few years ago which turned out to be stiff, predictable and overlong and didn't live up to its excellent reputation. i'm relieved to realize that seven samurai indeed deserves the praise it gets. ironically, it's not the best movie of the year, not even the best japanese film of that year which was honda ishiro's groundbreaking godzilla which shows how great movies were back in those days. still, seven samurai is a timeless classic whose plot, duels and characters have been copied in numerous films such as the magnificent seven. the first thing i liked about the movie is its atmosphere. it has a quite gloomy touch as the fearful peasants and seven brave samurai have to be constantly prepared for the raids of an elevated number of ruthless bandits. as opposed to hollywood movies, one never knows who is going to survive the next attack which builds up quite a lot of despair and tension until the very end. this atmosphere is perfectly supported by the sinister black and white cinematography and the simplistic yet fitting soundtrack. the settings are also carefully chosen. the village has a raw and simple charm but can turn from a little piece of paradise into a muddy hell rather quickly. it's definitely a very difficult battlefield. the romantic scenes in the fields of flowers in the middle section are contrasted by the torrential rain during the epic final battle that ends the movie on a high note. the characters are fascinating and fleshed out. each of the seven samurai has different character traits. the most impressive ones are the aged leader kambei with his strong moral compass, the hopeless young romantic katsushiro and the savage outsider kikuchiyo. even the villagers are quite unique. the elder miller and village patriarch gisaku who refuses to evacuate, the hotheaded rikichi who hides a sad secret and the emotional farmer's daughter shino are only some of these fascinating characters. the acting performances make the characters even better. shimura takashi's performance as intellectual leader is absolutely believable and one can understand why the other characters follow his commands despite risking their lives. mifune toshiro is brilliant as tough guy with a soft core who constantly tries to improve his reputation which leads to some brutal, desperate but also humorous scenes not unlike eli wallach's performance as tuco in the iconic the good, the bad and the ugly. on the other side, miyaguchi seiji contrasts the young and emotional characters with his performance as calm, disciplined and serious swordsman. the actors and actresses aren't only convincing on their own but complement one another perfectly. their diversity is a strength in this film. the directing has to be pointed out as well. despite its colossal length, the movie never felt boring because it found the right balance between the main plot and numerous efficient side stories that add depth to the different characters. the camera work is calm and precise and on a much higher level than contemporary action movies with shaky cameras. on the other side, the use of wipes to change between scenes gives the movie a more fluid pace at times. the mixture of calm cinematographic techniques and a few more dynamic elements is perfectly balanced. in the end, i have only positive things to say about this movie. if you like action films, this groundbreaking film is an iconic milestone. if you prefer dramas, you will find plenty of it in the complex relationships between the different characters. if you like period films, this movie brings the life in sixteenth century japan to life in a brilliant way. seven samurai is a movie that anybody who truly likes cinema should watch at least once in his lifetime.;17 September 2018;9;['japanese', 'epic', 'few', 'stiff', 'predictable', 'overlong', 'excellent', 'good', 'good', 'japanese', 'groundbreaking', 'great', 'numerous', 'such', 'magnificent', 'first', 'gloomy', 'fearful', 'brave', 'elevated', 'ruthless', 'next', 'very', 'sinister', 'black', 'white', 'simplistic', 'fitting', 'raw', 'simple', 'little', 'muddy', 'difficult', 'romantic', 'middle', 'torrential', 'epic', 'final', 'high', 'fascinating', 'different', 'impressive', 'aged', 'kambei', 'strong', 'moral', 'hopeless', 'young', 'romantic', 'savage', 'unique', 'elder', 'hotheaded', 'sad', 'emotional', 'fascinating', 'intellectual', 'believable', 'other', 'brilliant', 'tough', 'soft', 'brutal', 'desperate', 'humorous', 'tuco', 'bad', 'ugly', 'other', 'miyaguchi', 'young', 'emotional', 'calm', 'disciplined', 'serious', 'own', 'boring', 'right', 'main', 'numerous', 'efficient', 'different', 'calm', 'precise', 'high', 'contemporary', 'shaky', 'other', 'fluid', 'calm', 'few', 'dynamic', 'balanced', 'positive', 'iconic', 'complex', 'different', 'sixteenth', 'brilliant', 'least'];0.0569497135655672

52;davidmvining;if tasked with finding the ideal script for an action spectacular, i think you'd be hard pressed to find a better example than akira kurosawa's seven samurai. the steady build of situation, characters, and, finally, action create a grand entertainment that steadily, but never slowly, unfolds over three-and-a-half hours. the precise construction of the story allows for the time to get to know the rather large cast of characters, invest in them emotionally, and feel real tension as the action plays out. the film sets out the basic situation really quickly. within ten minutes we are introduced to the remote japanese farming community, our main representatives of the denizens of the town, and their conflict, waiting for bandits to return to their town to steal their barley harvest after having stolen their rice harvest a few months before. faced with the prospect of dying of starvation, their elder, the old man, recommends that they hire samurai to defend the village and fight back. they send out four villagers to the city, and their search for samurai begins. it's a quick setup in terms of basic plot mechanics that quickly gives way to an extended period that establishes character. out of the four villagers, the two most important are manzo who has an attractive, young adult daughter shino, and rikichi who gets really touchy when anyone talks about his not having a wife. they lead a search that seems fruitless at first. all the samurai they meet are haughty, vainglorious men who will not debase themselves to work for only food from farmers and risk their lives. they begin talking about simply going back home defeated when they encounter a curious scene as kambei shimada, a samurai, walks up to a pool of water, has a monk shave his head, takes the monk's clothes, and then uses the outfit in a deception to free a child from the threat of a cornered thief in a barn. his act of bravery and selflessness inspires the villagers to approach him and ask for his services. with a young, wannabe disciple in tow, katsushiro okamoto, kambei hears their issue out and decides to help them when he sees the depths of their poverty, highlighted by the fact that they do not eat rice, saving it for the samurai they approach, and instead eat millet. led by kambei, they find the next five samurai, katsushiro, shichiroji, heihachi hayashida, kyuzo, and gorobei katayama. each one is distinct and unique visually and in terms of their strengths, for example, kyuzo is a stoic with only any interesting in testing his skills to their limit while heihachi is impoverished, cheerful, and jocular. the seventh samurai ends up being toshiro mifune's kikuchiyo. barely dressed with rags, carrying the longest sword seen in the film over his shoulder, and being quite the physical presence, crouching, jumping, and running around in shots trying to get attention from kambei. after he reveals a stolen set of documents meant to prove his status as a member of the samurai class that would prove him to be thirteen years old, he becomes an object of ridicule among the other six. he ends up tagging along on the journey back to the village, refusing to be left behind, and eventually just accepted into the fold due to his persistence. all of this opening takes an hour, and it never drags. we get interesting scene after interesting scene of introduction, evolution, and even some action to help introduce and establish each character, firmly setting a strong character-based foundation for what's to come. the samurai arrive in the village, and the villagers are wary to the point that they do not come out to greet their liberators. there's a heavy class element in seven samurai. it's apparent early with the treatment of the villagers by the first samurai, but it comes to the forefront once the seven reach the village itself. the feudal system in place in japan at the time was extremely stratified to the point where antagonism between the different classes, for example the peasant and samurai classes, bred nothing but contempt. there's a bit of backstory in the film where the villagers had previously hunted down and killed wayward ronin, samurai without masters, for their armor, food, and other belongings. kikuchiyo came from a farming family before he started pretending to be a samurai, and he holds them in contempt, the class he is trying to rise from. he speaks negatively of them, accusing them of overstating their troubles, hiding stashes of food and goods, and being generally distrustful. when it comes out to the samurai about the villagers' previous attacks on other samurai, the six are angered to the point of most likely thinking of leaving, but kikuchiyo outlines the abuses of the samurai class on the peasant class, both damning and justifying the villagers' actions at the same time as he chastises the samurai for how poorly the samurai class (and probably by extension the six themselves) had treated peasants in the past. that conflict between classes ends up being the thematic heart of the film, centered on two of the samurai, kikuchiyo and katsushiro. kikychiyo's part should be obvious. he's nominally of both classes, born into the peasant class but trying to dishonestly attain a station in the samurai class. katsushiro's part comes when he catches the eye of shino whom manzo had cut her hair and hidden away as a boy to protect her from the samurai's predatory ways. katsushiro and shino fall in love, but their love can't really be acknowledged by anyone out in the open. the samurai tend to think of it as just a conquest, a bit of fun, while manzo goes mad when he discovers the affair, knowing that there can be no mingling between the classes and that shino is now damaged goods for someone she can marry. skipping to the end, it's left an open question about whether the two can actually be together. i think the implication is that they can't, that katsushiro will do as kambei predicted and live a solitary life in pursuit of martial greatness and that shino will live her life doing the backbreaking and thankless work of a farming peasant. coming from kurosawa, a man who was actually of the samurai class, this is an interesting take on his part, feeding into the mixture of cynicism and humanism that had steadily come to define his work, most fully in his previous film ikiru. going back to the film's strengths as an action spectacle, the middle section of the film is dominated largely by the samurais' efforts to prepare the town for the inevitable attack. kurosawa takes his time to show us the village as a whole, the different points of attack, and how kambei and katayama work together (with katsushiro constantly in tow) to plan and execute the defense including fences, flooding a field, and creating a sole, safe entry point to offer up to the invading attackers, to direct them where kambei wants them to go. it's very good in terms of clearly outlining what is to come while, at the same time, the rest of the samurai take up training the villagers in basic forms of warfare. now, when seven samurai gets mimicked, this is where things tend to get silly. i remember bits in the shows firefly and the mandalorian that tell similar stories where the heroes have to train the villagers in defense, and within a few seconds of a training montage, they're all operating phalanxes with surprising alacrity. even with a full hour to prepare for the attack in movie time, the villagers never get to that point in seven samurai. they're barely functional. when the attack begins they don't move as one, instead barely following the samurai who lead them and breaking into smaller groups that barely come back together at the behest of their leaders. i'm saying that this portrayal of quickly learned martial discipline is surprisingly believable in the context. the attack begins, and it steadily develops, just like the rest of the movie. there's probing by the attacking bandits, a count of the bandits that kambei keeps, crossing off circles as each one dies, and even a raid on the part of three of the samurai to the bandit lair that reveals the fate of rikichi's wife. there are three medieval era guns to deal with, daring acts of bravery by kyuzo and kikychiyo that are received very differently by kambei, and a tense night of waiting before the final attack. there's rain and mud and blood and death, and the long effort to build up the characters pays off with real tension in who will live and who will die, especially since one of the seven died near the halfway point of the film. the victory of the end ends up being met with melancholy. the samurai have lost brothers. the villagers' lives and livelihoods have been saved, but they must go straight back to work. the bonds between the two classes instantly begin to fray once again. it's a victory, but a hard one to take. the rock on which this movie is built is shimura as kambei. shimura, fresh off of his magnificent performance as watanabe, the pathetic but determined bureaucrat in ikiru, commands the screen and the men around him as he embraces the role of general in this small battle. the heart and soul of the film are the childlike kimura as katsushiro and mifune as kikychiyo. kimura embodies this open-eyed wonder at the world he doesn't quite understand, marveling at the daring and skill of kyuzo while falling in love with a poor peasant girl at the same time. mifune, as should be expected, is a manic ball of energy as kikychiyo, but he also carries a remarkable sadness and anger within him that fits the character perfectly. the three of them together make the emotional center of seven samurai. kurosawa is in command here, though, and he commands confidently, allowing this three-and-a-half hour story to unfold naturally and gracefully, creating an engaging story from beginning to end that is, to no surprise, often quite beautiful to look at. this is popular entertainment at its best.;24 March 2022;10;['ideal', 'spectacular', 'well', 'steady', 'grand', 'precise', 'large', 'real', 'basic', 'remote', 'japanese', 'main',

53;valleyjohn;"one of favourite movies of all time is the magnificent seven and when this has been mentioned from time to time i have been asked if i had seen the film that it was based on - seven samurai , so i finally decided to give it the valleyjohn treatment thanks to a request from one of my myspace friends and i can only thank that person for persuading me to watch this memorable movie. akira kurosawa's epic tale concerns honor and duty during a time when the old traditional order is breaking down. the film opens with master samurai kambei posing as a monk to save a kidnapped farmer's child. impressed by his selflessness and bravery, a group of farmers begs him to defend their terrorised village from bandits. kambei agrees, although there is no material gain or honor to be had in the endeavour. soon he attracts a pair of followers: a young samurai named katsushiro who quickly becomes kambei's disciple, and boisterous kikuchiyo , who poses as a samurai but is later revealed to be the son of a farmer. kambei assembles four other samurais, including kyuzo , a master swordsman, to round out the group. together they consolidate the village's defences and shape the villagers into a militia, while the bandits loom menacingly nearby. soon raids and counter-raids build to a final bloody heart-wrenching battle. i'm not a big fan of old black and white movies . i used to watch many as a kid but as i have got older i have found i have not really got the patience for them. because of that , seven samurai was always going to be a difficult film for me to watch. not because of it's content but because of the length - three hours and nine minutes! so to stop me drifting i decided i would watch the movie in two parts and because of that decision i really enjoyed this epic movie. you can see many comparisons with the magnificent seven . the samurai all have distinctive characters and you can see the comparison to the yul brynner and robert vaughn roles from the 1960 film but despite the comparison's they are very different movies. seven samurai is a far more brutal movie than the western version but it also has some very poignant moments. none more so than the very last scene where the surviving samurai are standing at the gravesides of their fallen comrades. the performance from takashi shimura ( kambei the samurai leader ) and toshiro mifune ( the crazy samurai) are very memorable and at times i completely forgot i was watching a film that was made 54 years ago. although film purist's will rate this higher than the john sturges remake i still prefer the cowboy v mexican version but i grew up watching that film so that is to be expected. seven samurai is definitely going to be one of those films that will be embedded on my brain for the rest of my life and the split viewing was well worth it in the end. i will leave you with the thoughts of kikuchiyo - ""what do you think of farmers? you think they're saints? hah! they're foxy beasts! they say, ""we've got no rice, we've no wheat. we've got nothing!"" but they have! they have everything! dig under the floors! or search the barns! you'll find plenty! beans, salt, rice, sake! look in the valleys, they've got hidden warehouses! they pose as saints but are full of lies! if they smell a battle, they hunt the defeated! they're nothing but stingy, greedy, blubbering, foxy, and mean!"" nothing changes does it!";27 October 2008;9;['favourite', 'magnificent', 'valleyjohn', 'memorable', 'epic', 'old', 'traditional', 'kidnapped', 'terrorised', 'material', 'young', 'boisterous', 'other', 'final', 'bloody', 'big', 'old', 'black', 'white', 'many', 'old', 'difficult', 'epic', 'many', 'magnificent', 'distinctive', 'different', 'brutal', 'western', 'poignant', 'last', 'memorable', 'high', 'mexican', 'worth', 'foxy', 'hidden', 'full', 'stingy', 'greedy'];0.0925555555555555

55;Steffi_P;"this is kurosawa's best known and most beloved film, and rightly so. seven samurai has been called the first modern action movie. that's a matter perhaps more of definitions than anything else, but whatever the case this is certainly a film in which literally physical action is important. kurosawa's use of movement, always an important element in his pictures, is here brought to perfection. actors pop in and out of the frame, dynamic edits are used for emphasis, and scenes often begin with a burst of action. for kurosawa this type of construction is not just about creating an exhilarating action picture; the movement is also symbolic of life, vitality and irrepressibility and this is central to the picture. kurosawa constantly dealt with the conflict between an individual's true value and the constraints of their social status. one of his greatest achievements is revealing the humanity in the most unassuming of people. in ikiru (1952) kurosawa had done this as a single character study, turning a middle-aged fuddy-duddy into a hero, but seven samurai is an even fuller statement of the notion. first off we have peasants who refuse to accept nasty, brutish and short lives. then we have the samurai. jobless ronin, already considered the scum of feudal japan, who accept the ultimate humiliation in being employed by peasants rather than a lord. both peasants and samurai are changed by their experiences, and shown to be greater people for it. and at the centre of this humanist theme is kikuchiyo a man of peasant stock who pretends to be a samurai. nothing can change the lowlyness of his birth, but he becomes one of the seven by the way he acts. it's also worth remembering that kurosawa was a maverick in japanese cinema, and if he was pointing the finger of one hand at social ills, he was generally pointing the finger of the other hand at his contemporaries in the industry. just as seven samurai tears into japanese conventions of hierarchy and duty, it also attacks the romanticised, portrayal of feudal loyalty and honour that ran through the samurai genre. by the way, some knowledge of japanese culture is helpful in understanding the significance of all this, particularly the status of the jobless samurai, but it is not a necessity to enjoy the film. in the way that his goal is to humanise his characters, kurosawa is much like his idol john ford, and seven samurai in fact shares a lot of ground with ford's stagecoach. what really strikes me about seven samurai however is the depth of characterisation. it is typical in japanese cinema for there to be around ten central characters, as opposed to three or four in the average western film. but these characters are not simply pieces in a jigsaw puzzle each has their own issues and their own journey to go on. kurosawa takes his time in introducing the samurai characters, with each getting their own very memorable first scene. the four or five peasant characters that we get to know are no less well-rounded and complex, but the way they are presented to us is very different. they instead gradually emerge from the mass of identical looking farmers. by the end we have as much respect for rikichi and yohei as we do for kambei and kyuzo. there really is no single weak link in seven samurai. there is another great musical score fumio hayasaka, which manages to capture the diversity of tones in kurosawa's narrative. the acting performances are all good, and the casting is spot on. toshiro mifune really gets to show off the breadth of his range. at times he is snarling beast like in rashomon, but he later displays a deep humanity, ranting emphatically, making children laugh and breaking down in tears on more than one occasion. it's clear though that it was kurosawa who really brought out the best in mifune if you compare this to his performances in, for example, hiroshi inagaki's samurai trilogy (made around the same time), which are merely adequate. i'd also like to briefly mention my favourite scene. it's the one where the peasants who live outside the village try to split from the program because their houses will be lost, and the samurai stop them. it's the very heart of the film for me. firstly, it explains the importance of working together. it also shows for the first time how the peasants have changed in comparison to those opening scenes. they have gone from a frightened rabble to being confident and organised. the final seconds of this scene are absolutely incredible in their framing and timing we see the peasants standing proudly in line, the music swells up, kikuchiyo straightens out the one crooked spear, the music reaches a climax, a gust of wind blows across the scene and fade out. brilliant. seven samurai is a classic because it is one of the fullest, roundest and deepest films ever made. it is one of the few films that scores on every level excitement, emotion, storytelling and sheer technical quality. it's a great achievement in itself to produce a three-hour plus film that is endlessly watchable and never dull. it represents the first peak in kurosawa's career, and a high point for cinema as a whole.";25 March 2007;10;['beloved', 'first', 'modern', 'more', 'physical', 'important', 'important', 'dynamic', 'symbolic', 'central', 'true', 'social', 'great', 'single', 'middle', 'aged', 'duddy',

56;ShootingShark;"in feudal japan, bandits threaten to raid a small village. the farmers resolve to try and find samurai to protect their crops and families. but how will they do this, and can they trust those hired to defend them ? kurosawa is arguably the top director in all cinema, and this is perhaps his greatest film, although personally i like yojimbo and ran even more. it epitomises what makes many of his movies so powerful; it is a both a supremely entertaining story, full of action and humour, but at the same time a riveting, thought-provoking, intelligent drama on the most basic and profound level - life, death, love, honour and morality. so many films are either low-brow mass-market chores or high-brow pretentious bores, it's wonderful to see any movie which succeeds on all levels as both art and entertainment. the story is terrific and beautifully unveiled, the characters are vibrant and dynamic, giving us a choice of people to identify with; the noble and philosophical kambei (shimura), the idealistic but naive katsushiro (kimura), the noisy comic blowhard kikuchiyo (mifune), the quiet but lethal kyuzo (miyaguchi), even the short-tempered villager rikichi (tsuchiya), whose story is one of the most moving amongst a rich tapestry of overall tales woven skillfully together. all these performances are rich, funny and moving, but it's mifune's showstopping tour-de-force which lingers most in the mind, full of sound and fury, heartbreaking honesty and great physical prowess. the scene where the weapons cache is found and he chastises the samurai for their bigoted moral superiority packs an incredible emotional punch and for my money is one of the most moving and touching moments in all cinema. the entire film though is packed with great scenes; the standoff with the robber in the barn, kyuzo's duel, the arrival at the deserted village, the fire at the bandits' hideout, kikuchiyo holding the baby next to the burning mill, the horses rearing and slipping in the mud, the tragic ending. it's simply outstanding visual storytelling from start to finish. exceptionally well written by kurosawa, shinobu hashimoto and hideo oguni. remade very successfully by john sturges in 1960 as the magnificent seven (which kurosawa liked so much he gave sturges a samurai sword), and its influence casts a huge shadow over hundreds of films, from da uomo a uomo to three amigos. if you have any interest in the history of either japanese cinema or action films generally, this is an absolutely unmissable classic by a master director at the height of his prowess.";27 March 2012;7;['feudal', 'small', 'top', 'great', 'many', 'powerful', 'entertaining', 'full', 'same', 'riveting', 'intelligent', 'basic', 'profound', 'many', 'low', 'mass', 'high', 'pretentious', 'wonderful', 'terrific', 'vibrant', 'dynamic', 'noble', 'philosophical', 'kambei', 'idealistic', 'naive', 'noisy', 'comic', 'quiet', 'lethal', 'rich', 'overall', 'rich', 'funny', 'moving', 'full', 'great', 'physical', 'moral', 'incredible', 'emotional', 'moving', 'touching', 'entire', 'great', 'deserted', 'tragic', 'outstanding', 'visual', 'oguni', 'magnificent', 'huge', 'japanese', 'unmissable'];0.265

61;SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain;what can one say about the legend that is akira kurosawa's 'seven samurai'? well it is my favourite film of all time. if i'm asked for my opinion, i would have to say it is quite perfect. kurosawa pretty much invents the modern action film we are all familiar with. he brings together a team of highly skilled hard-men, each with their own distinct characteristics. they are hired by a small village, in order to protect them from bandits who will soon come and steal the harvest. the samurai arrive in the town, being promised a place to stay and three meals a day. they start to work out tactics and train the farmers. the beauty of this film is first present by the fact that it is over three hours long but flies by faster than many films that struggle to make two hours. watching 'seven samurai' never feels like a chore. kurosawa also perfectly mixes everything like a perfect recipe. there is hilarious moments of comedy, supplied by the brilliant toshiro mifune and the quick witted minoru chiaki. also a very sweet romance blossoms, and never feels as though it is bringing down the rest of the film. kurosawa also makes sure to never show anybody as perfect, the victims (farmers) prey upon wondering samurai, like those they now need. the ferocious killing of one of the captured bandits is also quite disturbing as the samurai's are against the killing. each character is well explored and serves a specific purpose, the film clearly shows how the samurai would not be successful if they had any less men. the performances are nothing short of spectacular, with mifune as the eccentric and misunderstood hero, and takashi shimura as the reserved and warm leader. the film also has its fair share of brilliant action sequences, such as the early slow motion sword fights that reveal the samurai's skills. kurosawa paces the film perfectly, and uses the locales to his advantage. despite being in black and white the film seems as though it is in colour due to the clear spaces and use of scenery. the script is excellent, with each piece of dialogue being important to the story. sure the film could easily be less than two hours. villagers hire samurai, they train for a bit, and have a battle. however 'seven samurai' never feels like it is outstaying its welcome. the final battle is amazing and exciting with the rain pouring down, the numbers against the samurai, and the brilliant use of editing techniques thanks to kurosawa's multiple cameras. overall this film is beyond explanation, there is too much and it is simply perfect, fantastic, amazing. watch it, experience it, love it.;3 May 2005;10;['favourite', 'perfect', 'modern', 'familiar', 'skilled', 'hard', 'own', 'distinct', 'small', 'present', 'long', 'many', 'perfect', 'hilarious', 'brilliant', 'quick', 'sweet', 'sure', 'perfect', 'ferocious', 'disturbing', 'specific', 'successful', 'less', 'short', 'spectacular', 'eccentric', 'reserved', 'warm', 'fair', 'brilliant', 'such', 'early', 'slow', 'black', 'white', 'clear', 'excellent', 'important', 'less', 'final', 'amazing', 'exciting', 'brilliant', 'multiple', 'much', 'perfect', 'fantastic', 'amazing'];0.3359259259259259

64;winner55;"general statement of principle; i am sick to death of commercial filmmakers preying on the young by obscuring the fact that, as filmmakers, they have nothing original to say or do, by chewing up the past and spitting it out again with ""new, improved"" special fx. yet, judging from some of the reviews i read here the sad fact is that many young viewers are not only ignorant of film history, they earnestly wish to remain ignorant. what could possibly be gained by a surrender to one's own ignorance. an ignorant man has to be told what to do and what to think. simply rejecting the advice of one's elders does not constitute freedom of thought - it is exactly when we reach a decision contrary to that of our peers that we discover what it may mean to become an individual. this means, of course, that statistical arguments concerning the uselessness of history are wholly unconvincing. to say that 'most people agree with me on this point' doesn't say that the point is well-made; possible everyone in agreement with it is simply wrong. to assert one's independence and then turn around and say that the 'majority agree' is self-evidently contradictory. to abide by such statements despite evidence and reasonable disproof, is not simply exposing ignorance m- which can be corrected through education - it is simply stupid. furthermore, since an ignorant person has to be told what to think, it follows that such a person is a victim waiting for a crime to happen. such people seem proud of their ability to thumb their noses at people who reach out to help - but they easily and quickly fall victim to con-artists, who usually know how to make such people feel good about the victimization. knowledge of history means; not getting scammed for want of it. it means deepening one's awareness of the strengths and faults of those we admire. it means that we learn the tricks used to produce something of value, thus making it easier to find and judge value. in film it is also well to bear in mind that good film-makers are precisely those who have studied film history the most. this gives them a stock of film-techniques developed by others on which to draw for increased effectiveness of their own films. i find it unclear, why it is young viewers of today wish to remain in ignorance of where the contemporary film-maker draws inspiration. this fact blasts away the commonly proffered assertion, 'we do things better now than anything they did 'back when'. if that were true, then the film-makers of today would not need such inspiration; but they do. finally, it is simply a fact that those who profess ignorance - as a desirable quality - are simply incapable of saying anyone might be able to learn. they always get basic facts wrong. the seven samurai; is not an action film, it is a period adventure film with both action elements but also, and more importantly, elements of serious drama. i read one young reviewer say that the character development in the seven samurai is unimportant. obviously this person just doesn't like people; so i supposed he will eventually betray his friends or get betrayed. because the importance of the character development in the first half of this film is that some of us happen to like human beings and want to understand better what makes them do the things they do - and what makes some of their actions mistakes - sometimes fatal mistakes. as the remarks of the lead samurai imply, the biggest mistake this men made was becoming samurai. but that being the hand life has dealt them, they need to play it out as best they can - and as gracefully as they can. hemingway once remarked that what truly made a man was 'grace under fire' - and i seem to recall he admitted that he had heard of this as a volunteer with the italian army during the first world war, that this was the quality the italians admired most about americans. well, that's what this film is about - not the action, but the 'grace under fire' that the samurai learn about themselves, and also teach the villagers. or those villagers willing to be taught. when someone is not willing to be taught, that one is not worthy of teaching - in which case bandits can rape, rob, and slaughter them, and no one would care. finally one must point out the tasteless ignorance of insisting that a film is weak because - heaven forbid - it's not in color. that's sort of like saying 'your father's a fag because he hasn't gotten your mom pregnant in years'. - it is wholly irrelevant to any movie whatsoever, to be sure, a director can handle color well - but he or she can handle black and white lighting and composition equally well. there is no 'nature photography' in the seven samurai. there are stunningly beautiful and haunting images in black and white. if you care about film, you owe it to yourself to see the film; had it never been made, neither would any contemporary films that you enjoy today, or that you may enjoy tomorrow. and if that doesn't sink in - then, screw it - i've no patience for fools. still one of the best films in the history of cinema, and still a film necessary to see and appreciate.";1 August 2006;10;['general', 'sick', 'commercial', 'young', 'original', 'new', 'special', 'sad', 'many', 'young', 'ignorant', 'ignorant', 'own', 'ignorant', 'contrary', 'statistical', 'unconvincing', 'most', 'possible', 'wrong', 'contradictory', 'such', 'reasonable', 'stupid', 'ignorant', 'such', 'proud', 'such', 'good', 'easy', 'good', 'own', 'unclear', 'young', 'contemporary', 'true', 'such', 'profess', 'desirable', 'incapable', 'able', 'basic', 'wrong', 'serious', 'young', 'unimportant', 'first', 'human', 'well', 'fatal', 'lead', 'big', 'italian', 'first', 'willing', 'willing', 'worthy', 'tasteless', 'weak', 'pregnant', 'irrelevant', 'sure', 'black', 'white', 'beautiful', 'black', 'white', 'contemporary', 'good', 'necessary'];0.1035615899252262

66;Takethispunch;"seven samurai is a 1954 japanese epic historical drama adventure film co-written, edited, and directed by akira kurosawa. the story takes place in 1586 during the warring states period of japan. it follows the story of a village of farmers that hire seven ronin (masterless samurai) to combat bandits who will return after the harvest to steal their crops. since its release, seven samurai has consistently ranked highly in critics' greatest films lists, such as the bfi's sight and sound and rotten tomatoes polls. it has remained highly influential, often seen as one of the most ""remade, reworked, referenced"" films in cinema.";19 June 2016;10;['japanese', 'epic', 'historical', 'ronin', 'masterless', 'great', 'such', 'rotten', 'influential'];0.18
67;sme_no_densetsu;"akira kurosawa's ""seven samurai"" is generally regarded as one of the crown jewels of world cinema. this epic (3 hour) film tells the story of a group of samurai recruited by poor farmers in order to defend their village against a group of bandits. seven accept the challenge, despite the promise of hard times and little reward. despite being over three hours in length, there isn't a wasted moment in the film. we're introduced to the bandit threat in the opening scene and the buildup to their return is filled with character development. by the time the conflict starts resulting in casualties, we've grown attached to these characters and hate to see them go. and once the real action finally does start, it's unrelenting. the cast is well assembled and includes japanese film legends toshiro mifune & takashi shimura. while i found mifune's portrayal of the brash kikuchiyo to be a bit over-the-top there's no denying that he has tremendous screen presence. shimura's performance is much more subdued as he provides an ideal personification of samurai values. other standouts include seiji miyaguchi as master swordsman kyuzo, yoshio tsuchiya as defiant villager rikichi and isao kimura as the young and inexperienced katsushiro. the direction by kurosawa is uniformly well handled whether in the heat of battle or in a more peaceful moment (though i can't say i cared for his use of slow motion). the film also boasts some nice cinematography which makes the most of costumes & sets that convincingly establish the period setting. meanwhile, the music of fumio hayasaka sets the right tone throughout. in the end, i would have rated this movie a bit higher except that i grew up with the western remake ""the magnificent seven"" and it remains one of my absolute favourite movies of all time. so, for me at least, while the original is a top notch movie, i can't help but compare it to the slightly superior (in my mind) remake. of course, this preference may or may not be completely objective.";19 February 2012;8;['epic', 'poor', 'hard', 'little', 'real', 'unrelenting', 'japanese', 'tremendous', 'subdued', 'ideal', 'other', 'seiji', 'defiant', 'young', 'inexperienced', 'peaceful', 'slow', 'nice', 'most', 'right', 'high', 'western', 'magnificent', 'absolute', 'favourite', 'least', 'original', 'top', 'superior', 'objective'];0.1799952380952381
68;pyrocitor;the term 'masterpiece' tends to be bandied around to a notoriously excessive extent in reactions to contemporary cinema, but if ever there was a film which unquestionably deserved the label, akira kurosawa's seven samurai would be it. anchored by a simple narrative of a troop of samurai banding together to protect and train a village of farmers from bandit raids, kurosawa's film extrapolates beyond the mere telling of a story to the foundation of a legend - it is easy to imagine a comparison between a community of audiences seated and enraptured throughout the better part of an afternoon or evening and an indigenous tribe, seated around a fire and passing down their foundational stories and history to a new generation. kurosawa's film is one which demands attention, but does so without pretension or contrived pitches for trite sentiment - in short, the rare picture which allows its peerless quality to speak for itself. the staple pitch for an 'epic' film of any sort of late is 'synergy between a grandiose scale and conflict and intimate emotional focus', yet kurosawa's film could have written the book on such a balance. thinking back over the experience shortly after finishing its exhaustingly tense and thrilling culminating battle (itself cementing the film as essential viewing), it is almost easy to forget how the film draws its primary focus from the exploration of and interactions between its characters, weaving a sumptuous tapestry of very real people and problems, a microcosm of conflict thickened by the noxious looming of the inevitable clash with the bandits. however, proving that spectacle and characterisation not need be mutually exclusive, kurosawa also delivers what is without doubt one of the most stunning combat films of all time, breathlessly allowing the audience to be privy to the samurai's battle plans and combat formations before allowing all hell to break loose with the cathartic thundering fury of the madness and ferocious joy of war. nonetheless, for a film largely painting in thundering broad strokes, the complexity, nuance and ambiguity of kurosawa's work is almost left in the shadows of the 'bigger' moments. it is telling that one of the most moving moments in a film littered with them takes place offscreen, almost an aside, and told with 'blink-and-miss-it' subtlety: reflecting on a barely thwarted bandit raid, the samurai notice the absence of one of their number, the live wire, loose cannon kikuchiyo (toshiro mifune). one samurai mumbles that kikuchiyo is numbly sitting next to the grave of a fallen comrade, an uncharacteristic show of sentiment revealing a previously unseen emotional side to the near deranged fighter. a conventional approach would show provide the image of a grieving kikuchiyo alone with the grave, yet kurosawa wisely elects to 'tell not show', thus both giving the viewer a sense of immersion into the plot, forcing them to gracefully respect kikuchiyo's privacy along with the other samurai and allowing the imagination to instill the scene with all the more power and surging emotion. to see such insight and delicacy of touch in a film boasting such overwhelming dramatic power is the mark of a true genius, and every aspect of kurosawa's opus is marked with so unique and knowing a flavour of quality, from the astonishingly gorgeous cinematography and composition of shots, the alternatively solemn and playful editing (any familiar with star wars' characteristic scene wipes will note kurosawa's influence),the immaculately recreated period costuming and sets, and fumio hayasaka's boldly dramatic musical score, perfectly blending the dignity and power of tradition with the quirkiness and fun of modernity. even if solely predicated as a character study of wild warrior kukushiyo, the film could regardless make its mark as an all time classic, as toshiro mifune's stunning performance is truly one for the ages. assigned an already compelling mix of triumph and disgrace, mifune amps up his charisma and eccentricities to the point of near insanity, not chewing the scenery as much as devouring it. yet behind the simian hooting and hopping and defiant snarl of laugh, there lies genuine yearning and pain behind kikuchiyo's eyes, and mifune is careful to never allow his character's repellent or sympathetic elements to outweigh the other, but instead blending them together with the result of a certifiable triumph and testament towards the impact of an actor's interpretation. the rest of the cast deliver unanimously stellar and often admirably colourful performances, headed up by the incredible serenity and coiled power of takashi shimura as the dignified lead samurai shimada. to retain an audience's interest throughout a three and a half hour film would be a feat in itself, yet the genius of kurosawa's film is not that it successfully campaigns for attention but rather that the viewer forgets they are watching a film at all, so utterly immersed are they from the chilling opening to bittersweet and sardonically joyful closing. seven samurai epitomizes the term masterpiece in every sense of the word, and should be considered essential viewing, if only for the sake of demonstration of the true potential and peerless power of cinema. -10/10;21 April 2010;10;['excessive', 'contemporary', 'simple', 'mere', 'easy',

69;Cosmoeticadotcom;"some films do get better with repeated viewings. akira kurosawa's 1954 black and white film seven samurai (shichinin no samurai) is one of them. it was well deserving of winning the 1954 venice film festival's silver lion, as well as the two academy awards it won for best art/set decoration and best costume design. on a first view it's simply a great action film, but with subsequent viewings the finer points of characterization come through in each moment, seeping into the mind subliminally and purposefully. the story, at nearly three and a half hours in length- including a five minute intermission, is never weighted down with fat, as all of the many subplots bear fruit- so unlike most films made in hollywood today. it became an international sensation, and the highest grossing japanese film of its day. yes, there are remnants of the stale samurai genre, such as the wise man kambei shimada (takashi shimura), and the 'boy on the verge of manhood' in katsushiro okamoto (isao 'ko' kimura), and his romance with farmer manzo's daughter shino, but the central human dilemma of the 16th century farmers who are helpless against the depredations of the bandits, who abound during the civil wars of the era, raises the film above mere cliches. we only see the bandits at the beginning and end of the film. there are about two hours where the meat of the tale takes place, and not a bandit is in sight. how many films do away with their bad guys for so long? how many could afford to? since we do not know any of the bandits' names, they are more like a singular character, or a sheer force of nature. why do they keep coming to attack the villagers, even as their forces are successively thinned with each failed raid? they must realize that the once helpless villagers have hired defenders? there is no darth vader among the bandits, despite george lucas's latter-day attempts to cite this film as an influence for his banal and downright puerile star wars saga. we also learn that the villagers are neither as poor nor innocent as they portray. there are murderers amongst them, who have killed samurai before. they also seek to lowball and underpay their protectors. it is a truism that almost all great directors have at least one great collaborator. with ingmar bergman it was his cinematographer sven nykvist. with federico fellini it was his musical scorer, nino rota. but with kurosawa it's not only great stars like mifune and shimura, but his co-writers, shinobu hashimoto and hideo oguni- part of a rotating staff of writers that muted some of kurosawa's own admitted over the top tendencies in storytelling, and brought the tale down to a human level. without them the film may have been little more than a greatly stylized genre film, rather than a great film, period. the cinematography asakazu nakai, and score by fumio hayasaka are also very good, although this is an actor-driven vehicle. nakai's deep focus techniques- at the time cutting edge, are every bit as good as those in citizen kane. especially, look at the complexity of the many crowd scenes, where many little stories play out as we watch the foregrounded action of the samurai. things like this are only gotten on repeated viewings, and with my second viewing i picked up much more than on a first glance, especially while not having to read the subtitles. and look at how jungle twigs seem to leap out at the viewer, as does mifune's huge phallic sword as he slings it over his shoulder. the whole film was shot in a 1.33:1 aspect ratio, so one wonders what kurosawa would have done with this film in widescreen. there's no doubt that seven samurai is a great film, and with its length and complexity it will only grow in my estimation as i view it more and more over the years. of that i'm sure. but, that said, i do not think that it is kurosawa's best film. i'd still lean toward ikiru for that honor- for it's simply the more deeply human tale, and shimura is even better in his role as watanabe the doomed bureaucrat than as kambei the indefatigable warrior. however, this is the granddaddy of all great action films, from sam peckinpah's the wild bunch to even james cameron's films like aliens or the terminator series, as well as a great bildungsroman for katsushiro. it also struck me, as the film opens to drumbeats, how reminiscent this film's opening is to that of my beloved godzilla- a film that was released in the same year, with the footfalls of the monster dominating a black screen filled with credits. while godzilla is nowhere in a league to seven samurai as a film, it is the second most influential japanese film of all time. that both rely on such primal sounds in their openings makes one wonder if there's a connection. yet, the thing that seven samurai has that few other films do is its incredibly detailed richness. from the bad skull caps the male characters wear, to the ambush tests kambei devises to recruit his cohorts, to the old woman who goes to kill a hobbled bandit with a farm instrument- to avenge her son's death, and many others; all of these and more make repeated viewing a necessity to truly appreciate this film, for all of these things are non-essential to the basic plot, even as they heighten the realism of this unreal tale. let me end by stating that seven samurai is every bit as good, and great, as its greatest champions claim, and i ask you, how rare a thing is that?";17 September 2008;10;['well', 'black', 'white', 'deserving', 'good', 'good', 'first', 'great', 'subsequent', 'fine', 'fat', 'many', 'most', 'international', 'japanese', 'stale', 'such', 'wise', 'central', 'human', 'helpless', 'civil', 'mere', 'many', 'bad', 'many', 'singular', 'sheer', 'helpless', 'latter', 'banal', 'poor', 'innocent', 'great', 'great', 'musical', 'great', 'own', 'top', 'human', 'little', 'more', 'great', 'nakai', 'good', 'deep', 'good', 'many', 'many', 'little', 'second', 'more', 'first', 'huge', 'phallic', 'whole', 'great', 'sure', 'good', 'human', 'well', 'kambei', 'indefatigable', 'great', 'wild', 'terminator', 'great', 'reminiscent', 'beloved', 'same', 'black', 'second', 'influential', 'japanese', 'such', 'primal', 'few', 'other', 'detailed', 'bad', 'male', 'kambei', 'old', 'hobbled', 'many', 'non', 'essential', 'basic', 'unreal', 'good', 'great', 'great', 'rare'];0.2544444444444443

72;TheUnknown837-1;"at the time i wrote this review, akira kurosawa had recently, and very quickly, become one of my all-time favorite directors. i had only seen four of his films and given each and every one of them my highest rating. his greatest, and undoubtedly his most popular film was in 1954 epic seven samurai, which was the top-selling movie out of japan for the year and won the japanese academy award for best picture. today, it's ranked one of the greatest motion pictures ever. and it rightfully holds that title. this is a spectacular film. full of wonderful characters, spectacular scenery, and great performances all around, it is kurosawa's fantastic story about a poor farming village in 16th century japan being consistently placed under attack by marauding bandits. facing starvation if the bandits raid them again, the peasants fearfully and reluctantly turn to seven unemployed samurai to defend themselves. there is no weak element to seven samurai. one of its greatest aspects is its characters. every single one of them, farmer or samurai, is given tremendous development, making them memorable. this is one of those films where if a character gets killed off, you suddenly find yourselves missing their presence on film because you got to know them so well. i will not name him, but there was one ill-fated character in the film when, after he died, i felt kind of cheerless because i had come to respect him as a human being instead of an actor performing in front of a camera and reading out scripted dialogue. if you were to ask me which character was my favorite, i would be tied between two of them. the characters played by takashi shimura and toshiro mifune, two of the finest japanese actors who ever lived. another thing i admire in seven samurai is the feeling of authenticity. the feeling that it all could have really happened. there are very few moments where the unbelievable occurs, as most action movies tend to succumb to. one thing i admired was the antagonists of the film: the bandits. unlike most hollywood movies where the bad guys have names and are introduced as characters to make them effective, the bandits in seven samurai all go without names. we only know them as ""the bandits"" and that is appropriate because that's all the characters know them as. just marauding, murdering bandits who must be killed off as soon as possible. kurosawa was undoubtedly one of the most influential directors of all time and that is clear in this film. many of the transitions and techniques that motion pictures today seem to follow on a conventional level were inspired by this film: slow-motion, a ""fade"" wipe between scenes like what you see in the star wars movies, using the weather to affect emotion and atmosphere, a team forming to take on a larger enemy, the list goes on. the movie was so influential that it was remade here in the united states as the magnificent seven (1960), which i consider one of the greatest remakes ever. not as good as its original sourcenot by a long shotbut considerably effective and noteworthy. in regards to the movie's soundtrack, it's a success. the music was composed by fumio hayasaka and it's wonderful. we seldom hear any of it, when we do, its an efficacious presence of impact. the opening score is very effective and the music that plays when the farmers are searching for samurai in the town remains one of my favorite soundtrack pieces today. there is one thing in the film that might warn off some viewers. it is long. at over three and a half hours in length, some people will be cautious before sitting down to view it and some will lose their patience, but to those who can sit down and enjoy a movie no matter how long it lasts, it will be realized as fast-moving storytelling. like the ten commandments (1956), even the long takes and the slow pacing seems fast because it is so well-written and so masterfully directed by kurosawa. one of the greatest masterpieces of all time. and now that it's been released in a wonderful three-disc collection here in the united states, its audience will continue to expand and its legacy will live on. that's the only kind of fate a masterpiece should have.";24 December 2008;10;['favorite', 'high', 'great', 'popular', 'epic', 'good', 'great', 'spectacular', 'full', 'wonderful', 'spectacular', 'great', 'fantastic', 'poor', 'unemployed', 'weak', 'great', 'single', 'tremendous', 'memorable', 'human', 'favorite', 'fine', 'japanese', 'few', 'unbelievable', 'most', 'most', 'hollywood', 'bad', 'effective', 'appropriate', 'possible', 'influential', 'clear', 'many', 'conventional', 'slow', 'fade', 'large', 'influential', 'magnificent', 'great', 'good', 'original', 'long', 'effective', 'noteworthy', 'wonderful', 'efficacious', 'effective', 'favorite', 'long', 'cautious', 'long', 'slow', 'fast', 'great', 'wonderful', 'only'];0.3376923076923076
73;mstomaso;"the great akira kurosawa's epic action masterpiece ""seven samurai"" is an entertaining and thoughtful war epic set in 19th century japan. replete with colorful well-realized characters, and sensitively portrayed social and class analysis, kurosawa's film entertains on all levels. although not as visually engaging as many of kurosawa's later efforts, seven samurai's cinematography is still masterful, and well above most contemporary films. a farmer overhears some bandits talking about raiding his village as soon as the next harvest is ready and approaches an older samurai master who is on the verge of retirement for help. the elder samurai, recognizing the humility of the request and the dignity of the proposed work, takes up the cause and begins recruiting others for the defense of the village. he recruits five samurai and takes on a young apprentice and a drunken, angry would-be samurai avenger (toshiro mifune ... kikuchiyo) as the sixth and seventh members of his newly established militia. the samurai live among the villagers for most of a growing season, teaching them defense and discipline. in turn, the villagers - as fearful of the samurai as they are in awe of them, hide away their daughters and some of their stores. as the inevitable crisis ensues, these two widely disparate classes of people learn to live and fight together to defend their homes and their crops. kurosawa's film is as much social realism as it is martial historic fantasy. their is also a steady supply of humor and an entertaining romance - both of which are relatively rare in this genre. in summary, seven samurai is one of those rare works of art which takes on a vast scope and sustains it with apparent facility. highly recommended.";29 July 2008;9;['great', 'epic', 'entertaining', 'thoughtful', 'replete', 'colorful', 'social', 'many', 'later', 'masterful', 'most', 'contemporary', 'next', 'ready', 'old', 'eld', 'young', 'drunken', 'angry', 'sixth', 'seventh', 'most', 'fearful', 'inevitable', 'disparate', 'much', 'social', 'martial', 'historic', 'steady', 'entertaining', 'rare', 'rare', 'vast', 'apparent'];0.1839285714285713

75;gftbiloxi;"clocking in at just under four hours with not a scrap of filler, kurosawa's the seven samurai is every bit as legendary at its enthusiasts would have you believe. the basic story is extremely simple. in a period of social chaos, a small farming village learns it will once more be attacked by a band of thirty bandits after the harvest. at first the farmers despair, but village elder gisaku (kokuten kodo) recalls that in his childhood a similar village met a similar situation by hiring samurai to defend them. the villagers accordingly send representatives to the city, where they are able to convince samurai kambei shimada (takashi shimura) to undertake the defense. if the plot sounds familiar, it should: hollywood would translate it into the extremely popular 1960 western the magnificent seven--but fine though that film is, it pales beside the seven samurai, which effectively turns an action film premise into a character study of the first order and endows the story with both tremendous simplicity and artistry. much of this is due an extraordinary ensemble cast, which includes the celebrated toshiro mifune (who would later appear in kurosawa's throne of blood and yojimbo); above this, however, is kurosawa's remarkable vision that draws upon the visual motif of the circle. the circle is a powerful presence in samurai. the village is presented as a roughly circular pattern of houses; the farmers meet in circles; in due time the samurai enter the circle and stand at the center of the circle, directing the defense--and indeed the circle will become the defense, as shimada works to find means to draw the bandits into the circle and to their doom. the motif will be elaborated: tied to the cycle of seed time, growth time, and harvest; tied to the cycle of life; and ultimately showing the quiet bitterness of life for those who operate outside the circular codes of community: the ""ronin,"" the samurai who have no master and no community, and whose lives are not valued by the community except for aid at a moment of crisis. shot in simple black and white, as much (if not more) a detailed character and culture study as it is an action film, the seven samurai is extremely simple and yet extremely subtle, and ultimately one of the most powerful films it has been my pleasure to review. the quality of the criterion dvd transfer is very good, but by no means flawless--although it survives well, the film has not been digitally restored, and artifacts are frequent. there is little in the way of bonus material, but the commentary by michael jeck is quite fine. strongly recommended. gft, amazon reviewer";1 April 2005;10;['legendary', 'basic', 'simple', 'social', 'small', 'eld', 'similar', 'similar', 'able', 'familiar', 'popular', 'western', 'magnificent', 'fine', 'first', 'tremendous', 'much', 'due', 'extraordinary', 'ensemble', 'celebrated', 'remarkable', 'visual', 'powerful', 'circular', 'due', 'quiet', 'circular', 'ronin', 'simple', 'black', 'white', 'much', 'more', 'detailed', 'simple', 'subtle', 'powerful', 'good', 'frequent', 'little', 'fine'];0.2134523809523809

79;FilmOtaku;"akira kurosawa's film 'seven samurai' is another one of those films that most people recognize as one of the greatest ever, without ever even seeing the film first; just solely based on its reputation. admittedly, i was one of those people, so i was delighted to find that, when finally seeing this film, i finally have the experience to back up my opinion. 'seven samurai', written and directed by kurosawa, tells the tale of a small village in japan in the 1600's that is plagued by bandits who take their food supply, not leaving enough for the villagers to survive on. when they discover that the bandits will strike again after their rice crop is harvested, they decide to take the few possessions they own and employ samurai to defend the village. seven samurai are eventually recruited, and they help the villagers learn to defend themselves, while dealing with clashing values, traditions and perceptions. my synopsis of the plot does not begin to do justice to this incredible story. kurosawa spins a rich and intertwining tale that is at times dramatic, and at others, hilariously funny. while i have no idea who 90% of the actors are, kurosawa's 'muse', i was thrilled to see toshiro mifune playing a samurai who is a loose cannon and all around nutcase. having seen mifune in only serious roles, most notably in kurosawa's 'high and low' it was a very entertaining surprise. in terms of the film itself, kurosawa's direction is nearly flawless. despite its three and a half hour run time, the pacing was perfect and there were no points where the film lagged. while the film is about samurai, and the perception of the general public in recent decades may have changed since the 1950's, 'seven samurai' is mostly story and not a lot of hard action (of course, look at the decade we're also dealing with), although there was one really slick fight scene when kurosawa filmed a shot in slow motion that made me howl. there is really no comparing the remake of this film, 'the magnificent seven' because while the story is similar, just about everything else is different. however, after watching 'the magnificent seven', then 'seven samurai' (both for the first time, on the same night) i was struck by how much more emotional i was during several scenes in 'seven samurai' than their equivalent scenes in the former film. both in terms of dramatic acting and dialogue, and the respectful and beautiful framing of shots by kurosawa, 'seven samurai' packed a much bigger emotional wallop for me. every time i watch a film off of the imdb 250 or the afi 100, i take an admittedly ridiculous amount of time to examine its merit in its place on the list, or whether it deserves to be on the list at all. obviously, the films closest to #1 get the most scrutiny, and 'seven samurai' was the only film in top 20 that i hadn't yet seen. while i don't agree with several of the films in the top 10 being placed ahead of my personal favorite film, 'citizen kane', after seeing 'seven samurai' i believe it should solidly be placed exactly where it is. it is a groundbreaking film that stands up fifty years later. whether or not you have seen the film, try to catch it on the criterion dvd i have seen clips of the film before, and unfortunately the prints were damaged and scratched. the criterion transfer is absolutely gorgeous, so seek it out. --shelly";27 September 2004;9;['most', 'great', 'delighted', 'small', 'few', 'clashing', 'incredible', 'rich', 'intertwining', 'dramatic', 'funny', 'thrilled', 'loose', 'serious', 'high', 'low', 'entertaining', 'flawless', 'half', 'perfect', 'general', 'recent', 'hard', 'slick', 'slow', 'magnificent', 'similar', 'different', 'magnificent', 'first', 'same', 'emotional', 'several', 'equivalent', 'former', 'dramatic', 'respectful', 'beautiful', 'big', 'emotional', 'ridiculous', 'close', 'most', 'only', 'top', 'several', 'top', 'personal', 'favorite', 'groundbreaking', 'gorgeous'];0.2188350055741359
80;charlytully;having recently rented both the magnificent seven (the american remake of seven samurai) and ran (7s director akira kurosawa's later take on shakespeare's king lear), it is somewhat tempting to compare 7s to both. however, i will restrain myself and restrict my comment to perhaps the more apt comparison: seven samurai vs. the magnificent seven. action: the japanese original wins here hands down. in 7s, the villagers attack and destroy the bandits' hideout between bandit attacks on their village, motivating the surviving 33 bad guys to plausibly fight to the last man, which they end up doing. since 7s relies more on hand-to-hand combat than m7 (which is dominated by gun play), the earlier film is much more gritty and believable in its more extensive battle scenes. musical scoring: this one is a tie. both movies feature exceptional scores. while m7 has one of the most hummable themes ever, 7s has a strong samurai motif in its own right, plus great use of portentous percussive rhythms from the opening credits onward. comic relief: another tie, though this one is likely to find many viewers choosing the movie from the cultural tradition in which they are most comfortable. romantic interest: here, a cursory glance would perhaps award a nod to m7, since the youngest samurai seems to be (figuratively) miles away from the village lass he'd earlier compromised by the time the closing scene rolls around, while m7 ends with the comparable gunfighter not only in his lover's arms, but preparing for a life in agriculture. however, i would give the edge to 7s, which would have lost much credibility for an m7-type close, given its historical setting in feudal japan. a bigger factor in s7's superiority here is the pathos evoked by the story of farmer rikishi and his wife, which begins in mystery (to the viewer, as well as the samurai) and ends in tragedy. not every love story can have a happy ending, particularly in believable action movies. summary: these are just a few of the reasons why i rated seven samurai (at 10 out of 10) 25% higher than director john sturges' 1960 remake, the magnificent seven.;22 July 2009;10;['magnificent', 'american', 'tempting', 'apt', 'magnificent', 'japanese', 'original', 'bad', 'last', 'early', 'gritty', 'believable', 'extensive', 'musical', 'exceptional', 'hummable', 'strong', 'own', 'great', 'portentous', 'percussive', 'comic', 'likely', 'many', 'cultural', 'comfortable', 'romantic', 'young', 'comparable', 'much', 'historical', 'feudal', 'big', 'happy', 'believable', 'few', 'high', 'magnificent'];0.2898387096774193

84;elvircorhodzic;seven samurai is an unusual and exotic movie. this movie, to me, has one of the best scenes of battles in the history of cinema. drama, adventure and tragedy are not the point of this film. the point is related to the role and duty of every person in the society through which reveal the human strengths and weaknesses. set is in japan in 1587, and in the sengoku period when the country devastated army mutually warring feudal clans and bandit gangs. the protagonists are seven poor samurai without masters (ronin), which the inhabitants of a village to hire as they tried to protect them from the gangs that loot every year. the story is great and rich details perfectly describe all the characters. characterization is phenomenal. scenery is simply superb. throughout the movie, the permeate incidents, or physical calculations which are accompanied with strong emotions. the thrills are constant. all the protagonists can be divided into three groups. the peasants, samurai and the bandits. three different cultural beliefs and three different relationships to the community and the conflict eventually come to the same - raw survival. interestingly, the samurai is part of strict japanese tradition, and again in this film are the most humane and flexibility. the traditional aspect is evident from the relationship. villagers are equally afraid of the samurai and the bandits. i will not say that the samurai performed their duties (which are paid with a handful of rice). in this film they made a precedent. looking in that direction, in the film there are two major incidents. very brave and even more crazy son of a farmer who presents himself as a samurai and love between a young samurai and village girl. this is simply the nature of society. this can be observed at the end of the film. the villagers return to their daily routine, the village is saved, and for them the samurai no longer exist. the acting is strong and emotional in this film. takashi shimura as kambei shimada is a true leader, a wise and persistent in order to do the job .... and more. modesty and organizations are virtues. toshiro mifune as kikuchiyo again in the mad performance. exceptional power, emotion and temperament are his qualities. he is the link between the samurai and peasant. his racket has its own purpose. in addition, he is the funniest character in the film. keiko tsushima as shino is young and extremely beautiful. visibly frightened, but very passionate and brave peasant girl. the daughter who issued a father for the sake of love. i'll admit, seven samurai is one of my favorite movies.;16 November 2016;10;['unusual', 'exotic', 'good', 'human', 'feudal', 'poor', 'great', 'rich', 'phenomenal', 'superb', 'permeate', 'physical', 'strong', 'constant', 'different', 'cultural', 'different', 'same', 'raw', 'strict', 'japanese', 'humane', 'traditional', 'evident', 'afraid', 'major', 'brave', 'crazy', 'young', 'daily', 'strong', 'emotional', 'true', 'wise', 'persistent', 'more', 'mad', 'exceptional', 'own', 'shino', 'young', 'beautiful', 'frightened', 'passionate', 'brave', 'favorite'];0.2260272846811308

87;tomimt;it might be silly to write another review of this great film, but what can one do? it's so darn impressive film. seven samurai tells a story of a small village, which is in the firm grip of a band of brigands, who steal their harvest and rape their women. the villagers are fed up and they head out to big city to hire a samurai to protect them. they soon hire kambei (takashi shimura), who helps the villagers to hire six more samurais. soon the band of seven head to the village and they begin to plan their defence. the movie is long, over three hours, but interestingly enough there are no unnecessary scenes in it. kurosawa takes his time to tell the story just the way he want's to tell it. there actually isn't much of action in the film, when you think about it: action is part of the story, but only in a narrative sense. there is no unnecessary violence. i could recommend this film to everyone, but i've found myself, that you need to acquire a taste towards japanese acting, as it often is more theatrical than in western movies (thought before 70's it often was very theatrical in all movies, not just japanese ones.). but after you've done that, there's nothing to stop you enjoying about this film.;24 November 2005;9;['silly', 'great', 'darn', 'impressive', 'small', 'firm', 'big', 'more', 'long', 'enough', 'unnecessary', 'much', 'narrative', 'unnecessary', 'japanese', 'theatrical', 'western', 'theatrical', 'japanese'];0.0411764705882353
88;mahmus;this three and a half hour long movie feels both epic and small in scale, and it's soo good that despite it's very long runtime, it feels like a two hour long movie. akira kurosawa brings to life a cast of characters that you immidiately get attached to, especially kikuchiyo (toshiro mifune in probably his best role) who is by far one of my favorite movie characters of all time. this movie is something else. i love it so much.;28 June 2020;10;['half', 'long', 'epic', 'small', 'good', 'long', 'long', 'good', 'favorite'];0.1592592592592592

91;LoneWolfAndCub;shichinin no samurai (seven samurai) is probably akira kurosawa's most loved movie. shichinin no samurai is also my first akira kurosawa movie. after hearing so much about it i went out and rented the original full length version. not once did i get bored. although it takes 30 minutes to be introduced the first samurai, it's not boring. the fighting doesn't even happen until near the end of the movie. but not once was i bored. a village is being terrorised by a group of bandits. a villager overhears when the bandits will attack next. so three of the villagers go out in search of a samurai that will help protect them. this samurai feels pity for them and answers their call. he gathers another six samurai to help defend the village and train the villagers. this movie helped inspire an entire genre, the western. where do you think the magnificent seven came from?? akira kurosawa is a brilliant storyteller. this story unfolds beautifully and at a steady pace. the characters are all developed so that we care for them all. this movie a bit of everything. it has bits of humour, it has drama and it has plenty of action. the battle scenes are engaging and at times suspenseful. this movie is recommended for everyone, as it is a brilliant piece of cinema. 5/5.;15 July 2006;10;['first', 'original', 'full', 'bored', 'first', 'boring', 'bored', 'entire', 'western', 'magnificent', 'brilliant', 'steady', 'suspenseful', 'brilliant'];0.156547619047619

93;johnnymonsarrat;"let's get something straight: i'm an action movie guy. i like it when stuff blows up, and i don't have much tolerance for arty films or drama. primarily, i don't have the refinement or the film school training to enjoy one aspect of the film (music score, costuming) when the rest of the movie is awful. so, like most people, i avoid the classics because most classics are b-a-d. but being an action movie buff, i checked out the seven samurai and it was pretty good. it was accessible to me, and while i can't at all agree that it's the best action movie of all time (a lot of stuff has blown up in the 50 years since this film came out), it was worth the risk. who should see this film: -- drama / arty types who need to flesh out their ""seen it"" credentials -- action movie types who have nothing better to do on a rainy day. it will take a little willpower to get through, sort of like getting through those cheesy cop buddy flicks from the 1980s, but you can do that, right? i'll give ""the seven samurai"" a 5 out of 10.";30 March 2002;6;['straight', 'much', 'awful', 'most', 'most', 'good', 'accessible', 'good', 'worth', 'well', 'rainy', 'little', 'right'];0.2373214285714285
94;dragokin;i liked seven samurai better than rashomon (1950) by the same author, probably because it has a plot. the approach is similar, though, leading to more than a third of the movie being excess footage. a two-hour director's cut would most likely had been a watchable piece of cinema, but we'll never be able to verify my claim. the question remains why is this one of the best movies by one of the best directors of all times, apart from a lot people telling you so. decades of repeating led this mantra to becoming an unquestionable truth, but i'd like to point out that critics might be wrong, after all. one of the more recent examples is sofia coppola's somewhere (2010). you watch it and wonder why the accolades... but i guess the critics always need something to talk about, even when it puts some of the viewers to sleep.;5 May 2013;3;['same', 'similar', 'more', 'excess', 'watchable', 'able', 'good', 'good', 'unquestionable', 'wrong', 'recent'];0.2375

97;braddugg;"the greatest japanese film i have ever seen. firstly, i must admit that i have seen very few japanese films. but i must admit that in grandeur and magnanimity, very few will match this film. akira kurosawa the master director made this magnum opus which i believe set a precedent in terms of various themes. recruiting men for a purpose. a recruit romancing a local woman. a team taking up a task and accomplishing successfully with few sacrifices. these are just a few to name. this i believe is a film that has major influences from the far east to the far far west. though made in japan, there was a film called ""magnificent seven"" which was the remake of this film. that film was setup in the far far west where the samurai were replaced by gunslingers. after watching this film, i can clearly understand what influences kurosawa had on the likes of the film makers of later years from steven spielberg to francis ford coppola to many indian film makers. the themes in this film are subliminal to the extent of conflict. the conflict is even greater and is perhaps one of the earliest conflicts that spans for more than an hour. the whole fight between bandits and the villagers lasts for as many minutes as you can see. yet, there are many things that happen in that and is almost made a war-like situation. i really doubt even in war movies, real war was shown for this long and with such intensity. the passion shown by kurosawa is surely unmatched. in terms of set-design, casting of actors, choreography of the conflict, the cinematography with so many cameras and the finesse in editing that shows each frame beautifully. he is one of the few asian directors who had that zeal and had that invested their whole lives in film making. too much to learn from the first watching of this film and i am sure, i will revisit this film time and again to understand the composition of frames and many many things. from the beginning to the end this film is high on drama and has less comic content, except for the maverick toshiro mifune (kikuchiyo), but the high volume drama almost left me breathless and kept me engaged all the way. the writing is immaculate and the detailing is something that has inspired many film makers and will continue to do so. a 5/5 for one of the greatest films ever made.";8 September 2014;10;['great', 'japanese', 'few', 'japanese', 'few', 'magnum', 'various', 'local', 'few', 'few', 'major', 'far', 'magnificent', 'far', 'later', 'many', 'indian', 'subliminal', 'great', 'early', 'more', 'whole', 'many', 'many', 'like', 'real', 'long', 'such', 'unmatched', 'many', 'few', 'asian', 'whole', 'first', 'sure', 'many', 'many', 'high', 'comic', 'high', 'immaculate', 'many', 'great'];0.2335416666666666
98;StanleyStrangelove;considered one of the greatest films ever made the seven samurai is akira kurasawa's 16th century samurai epic. shimada (takashi shimura) is an experienced samurai who is approached by a group of peasant farmers and asked to protect them from bandits who continue to attack and steal their food. shimada is honorable and sees their need and he also needs to know where his next meal will come from so he agrees. he knows he can't go up against the bandits alone so he recruits five real samurai to help him. crazy kikuchiyo (toshiro mifune) insists on tagging along even though he doesn't seem to be a real samurai. shimada and his group of warriors train the villagers in the art of self defense and they are housed and fed. the film ends with an astounding battle when the village is attacked by the horde of bandits. the seven samurai is a long movie with subtitles and needs to be seen multiple times to get the most out of it. it's not an easy movie but it's an unforgettably moving experience. the american western version was the magnificent seven.;3 September 2005;10;['great', 'experienced', 'honorable', 'next', 'alone', 'real', 'crazy', 'real', 'astounding', 'long', 'multiple', 'most', 'easy', 'magnificent'];0.3483333333333333

101;MattBrady099;"let me ask you a quick question: when you're watching a movie, what's the first thing you notice or look for? acting? lighting? color? shots? shapes? all of these are just naming a few great elements of what makes a movie so special, as there's plenty more out there that i probably left out, but those are mostly the key ones that some film makers choice when making a movie. but when i watch a movie, the first thing i look for is hidden quality, storytelling by the characters movements, acting, lighting, and the use of silence to add emotion to a scene. and yes, this movie absolutely has all of those things i love in movies and much more. i think i died and went to movie heaven. sometimes when i talk about a beloved movie that many film makers and critics out there consider a ""masterpiece"", i think it's very important for me to talk about the actual film making and what makes it so great, as this gives a better thought of what i see when i watched the movie. i mean, it's much better than saying what you like or didn't about a film without talking about the film making itself. oh and this also my first akira kurosawa movie i've watched and reviewed, so there's that. i've heard nothing but amazing things about kurosawa movies and how every famous director has put him up there as the best director that has ever lived, and i totally understand why, because akira kurosawa is one of the most stylish, influential, and one of the most tremendous film maker that has ever lived. from start till finish, i was completely in awed from what i was watching and it's still fresh in my mind as i'm writing this. for kurosawa's film career, he has made over 30 films and a few tv movies, but ""seven samurai"" seems to be the one movie that everyone knows about (even if there haven't seen it). and i understand why, as everything with the camera work, editing transitions, and the use of mother nature as an emotional trigger for the audience, is everything that an audience can emotional relate to and draw their eye to. because the choices of weather used in scenes that basically sums up what kind of mood a character or a scene itself is feeling. wind, sunshine, and rain, really do add a lot to the scene, as you can tell what you're suppose to be feeling. akira kurosawa was quite famous for how he wanted to get the weather perfect in his scenes. over a course of a year, he shot this movie for 148 days and it was often him waiting for the weather for the next scene. and that's not all, kurosawa told his actors to chose a gesture for their character and stick with it. that way, we know exactly what kind person their are and how they're feeling. it's bold film making like this is what made akira kurosawa a massive influence to cinema today. another thing i loved about this movie is the characters, as i actually did care for them and their struggle. i sometimes find it very hard to have a full emotional attachment to characters in movies, but here, it amazes me how i know so much from the characters just by their movements that really dose say a lot without them saying anything. all the praise has to go to the actors for this, as it was them who had to deliver and they absolutely do. i'm unaware with all of these actors, but then again, i don't watch that much black and white japans movies these days. all of the cast were all superb in their roles and most have been a very different cult challenge to pull off, because it's not easy as it looks, but all of them nailed it. the camera work in this movie is so impressive, so unique, and freaking glorious. the way the camera moves tells a story of itself that doesn't require any character to spill out the story or what's going on. i could show any scenes from this movie to someone who hasn't see the movie themselves and even they will have a full grasp on whats going or how someone is feeling without knowing nothing about the movie itself. that's how brilliant this movie. overall: seven samurai is a epic masterpiece with flawless imagery and a unique style of violence and battles. i can not wait to see kurosawa other movies, as i have a feeling i'm going to love them.";30 April 2016;10;['quick', 'first', 'few', 'great', 'special', 'key', 'first', 'more', 'beloved', 'many', 'important', 'actual', 'great', 'well', 'well', 'first', 'amazing', 'famous', 'good', 'stylish', 'influential', 'tremendous', 'awed', 'fresh', 'few', 'emotional', 'emotional', 'famous', 'perfect', 'next', 'kind', 'bold', 'massive', 'hard', 'full', 'emotional', 'unaware', 'much', 'black', 'white', 'most', 'different', 'easy', 'impressive', 'unique', 'glorious', 'full', 'brilliant', 'epic', 'flawless', 'unique', 'other'];0.3240683229813665
102;PCC0921;in the year 1586 a japanese village is constantly attacked by bandits, who plague the inhabitants' village and take whatever they want from the terrified villagers. one day after an attack by the bandits the villagers seek the wisdom of an elder, who tells them even though they cannot afford weapons, they can find men with weapons, samurai, who will fight for them, especially if they find samurai who are down on their luck and wondering where their next meal will come from. they find a very experienced samurai with a good heart who agrees to recruit the rest of the team of samurais for them. he selects five genuine samurai and one who might not be. the seven return to the village to protect it from the forty plus bandits and the battle lines are drawn. this film is mesmerizing. it's like reading a great novel and with each turn of the page another mesmerizing one opens up. it is epic in its design and has many interesting, likeable characters. this film moves along like a beautiful japanese melody. sure, the length is almost four hours long, but it is a nicely paced film and moves along quickly. i mean if you want a film to feel like an epic novel and an excellent read, what better way to do it, but with a japanese film masterpiece, subtitled in english that moves along like a fine song. the leader of the group, shimada, played by takashi shimura, is the perfect choice for this role. his ability to express a kind-hearted elder persona and combine it with the ferocity of a ronin is impeccable. shimura was one of the biggest actors in japan at the time. he appears in numerous films in the 1950s and 60s. among some of the legendary great films he did were, rashomon (1950), ikuru (1952) and the hidden fortress (1958), just to name a few. he also took part in a little film, near to my heart, called gojira (1954). shimura would become a huge part of special effects master, eiji tsuburaya's godzilla universe (if you will), and appear in at least seven of toho studio's science fiction monster classics from 1955-1965, ever enshrining him to international fame and a respect from film fans all over the world. his character, shimada, from the seven samurai is the rock that holds everything else together and his facial expressions are amazing. he can show you fear and concern and in the next scene express happiness and joy. his signature rubbing of his head when he needs to think or when his emotions are about to change is one of the best parts of the movie, because, with you, half the time, he too isn't sure what to make of the villagers and the other six samurai. it is one of the best ways i have seen in a film to show what is going on in someone's mind without uttering a single word. as with many of the classic japanese films of this era, much of the rest of the cast is less notable. you probably recognize the faces from various other films and may know a little bit about them depending on your knowledge, but do not be fooled by this. the acting and execution of the scenes is as perfect as can be and even though they are not huge stars, their impact on this film is tantamount to the finished piece. of course, kurasawa would hire a lot of extras to be the villagers, so much so, that he hired real villagers to make things even more believable. one of the three villagers that come to enlist the samurai is played by an actor named, yoshio tsuchiya. in my estimation, out of all the other secondary characters in the film, yoshio tsuchiya is one actor who americans might recognize. for he too, like takashi shimura, would join with eiji tsuburaya and appear in over ten of the japanese, science fiction, monster films of the 50s, 60s and 70s that were produced by toho studios. he is the main character in godzilla raids again (1955) and returned eventually in 1991 for godzilla vs. king ghidorah (1991). there is another name in the cast that does stand out, even more so than takashi shimura. this man would gain even a larger piece of the international stardom pie, for he would go on and appear in many great films in japan and around the world. a guy named toshiro mifune. mifune would end up doing over 160 feature films in his career, most notably in the united states in the film midway (1976) as admiral isoroku yamamoto, even though his voice had to be dubbed by a guy named paul frees. it was not a problem. his facial expressions are all you need. he also appeared in the 1980 nbc television mini-series with richard chamberlain called shogun. in the seven samurai, mifune plays kikuchiyo. kikuchiyo is a complex character and if it wasn't for mifune and kurosawa's masterful ability to tell stories, without losing the audience, this character would be tough to sell. he is the one who provides most of the comedy-relief in the film. his character is the one that helps draw the contrast between samurai and peasant. his character can do what any of the other samurai's can, even though he is nuts and drunk half the time. his character is the one that produces the most mystery and the most resolve. akira kurosawa was one of the pioneering directors of classic cinema, who helped build the modern day action film. if it wasn't for him we might not have the major blockbuster action movies that we see today. true, the lessons learned from kurosawa seem to be lost on today's emotionless and plastic action films, but the influence is there and in some cases are used in today's films, albeit sparingly. he was able to take his characters and scenes and convey through the screen the tension and urgency felt on either side. he would show you the hero and at the same time show you the death of the bad guy. that was the emotional response that he wanted to convey. that, even though we need to see our hero in action it was equally important to see the consequences of the hero's actions. that death and killing is not a silly video game, but something deeply personal that made the viewer more part of the whole experience. he knew back in the 1950s how things should be portrayed in film. he was a forward-thinking, visionary. he knew the only way to win over an audience was to keep them enveloped inside the tension on the screen and he knew he needed to get an emotional response from the audience or his job was not complete. kurosawa was a pioneer in using certain camera and editing tools to get his point across. sure, there were other pioneers, in other countries, doing things like this before him, but he was the one to use it for story-telling and character development and it paid off, if you consider his now-legendary status. his tools of the trade, especially as it applies to this film, was incorporating telephoto lenses for close-up shots, quick jump-cuts to enhance the action and slow motion to enhance the consequences and finalities of death and killing. this truly is like an epic novel unfolding in front of you. the length of the film is long, but in this case the success and execution of this film comes with the patience needed to get a point across. it is pure beauty. japanese composer akira ifukube, who pretty much would end up being one of the most popular composers in japanese film history, especially from a westerners point of view, because of his work with toho studios and the godzilla franchise, might not have been the most famous composer if it wasn't for another japanese composer, named fumio hayasaka. hayasaka was a great friend of kurosawa's and would work on a lot of his films leading up to the seven samurai. his haunting melodies crossed with traditional japanese folk music was the perfect sound that akira kurosawa was looking for. so much so, that his music would help influence how kurosawa made his films. it was here that kurosawa realized that music in films should be used more as a counter-point than a complement. that music has the ability to strengthen the visual scene. it was here that hayasaka was able to contribute to the visual style seen throughout the film. what derailed the legendary status of hayasaka? unfortunately, the following year, after the release of the seven samurai, hayasaka was struck down by tuberculosis at the young age of 41. it is interesting watching this film, in the fact that, being a fan huge fan of the american remake, the magnificent seven (1960), this film helps to give a more detailed explanation of the back-story on certain characters and scenes found in the magnificent seven, and answers many questions that actually help make the magnificent seven even more enjoyable and understandable on repeat viewings. what you eventually have here is something that comes full circle. kurosawa said that he was influenced by the american western filmmakers of the 30s and 40s, such as john ford. and, to have american filmmakers follow up with the magnificent seven, based off of the seven samurai, makes one think that this is the outcome that should have happened. it all comes full circle. kurosawa was a fan of the magnificent seven (1960), after he saw it. this film has so many messages, philosophies and lessons. it is an important film to me, because i am a huge fan of japanese culture and history, plus it is an earthly film, because it deals with the human element and the natural world around us. there is nothing mystical about this film. there is no need for special effects or fantasy-inspired scenes. it is all real. it is all part of being human. it is part of human history, even though it is told through artistic interpretation. there is no need to be curious in the legitimacy of it. it shows the desolation and impact the horrors of the world can put onto a human being. it reminds us of how lucky we are to be living in the 21st century and not having to make deals and use unscrupulous means just to get something to eat. it shows us how far we have come as a society, when it comes to respect for women issues, the elderly, sick and poor. 9.8 (a+ mygrade) = 10 imdb.;1 February 2022;10;['japanese', 'terrified', 'next', 'experienced', 'good', 'genuine', 'great', 'epic', 'many', 'interesting',

103;lagudafuad;nothing beats a well thought of plan to ward off bandits. samurai movies always show cases the best of swordsmanship, but this movie shows that a well thought strategic plan is better than a battalion of armed soldiers. this japanese adventure drama film was co-written and directed by akira kurosawa. the film takes place in 1587 and it follows the story of a village of farmers that were constantly being raided by bandits who steal their crops during the time of harvest. the villagers then decided to go source for help, they hired seven masterless samurai (ronin) to come help defend their village. the movie is long, and it takes its time to build up to the defence of the city, but if you can manage to keep awake till then, what you will notice is mastery in camera footage, the cinematography is flawless, the editing can use a bit of touch up here and there, but the cinematography was just exceptional. my favourite shooting will be in the time when the rain was coming down and you will see how akira managed to make the best of camera tricks to pass the message of a messy battle. the movie though made in 1954, has some wonderful display of acting, well i would advise if you have 3 hours to spear get the dvd, just try to stay awake till the last 40mins it is worth it.;1 October 2012;6;['good', 'strategic', 'well', 'armed', 'japanese', 'co', 'masterless', 'ronin', 'long', 'awake', 'mastery', 'flawless', 'exceptional', 'favourite', 'good', 'messy', 'wonderful', 'awake', 'last', 'worth'];0.4116666666666666

106;avik-basu1889;seven samurai is one of the most widely acclaimed films of all time. this film comes up time and again on numerous great films lists of critics as well as fans. seven samurai has had a monumental impact in the action film genre, it was a film way ahead of its time and it has since been remade (the magnificent seven) and the concept of a group of heroes coming together to fight against the common enemy has also subsequently been replicated time and again. seven samurai might bluntly be an action film, but the underlying themes of the film i believe are poverty and class distinction. the poverty of the poor farmers is an indictment of how people can reach rock bottom and how helpless the poor can be under the reigns of toothless rulers and governments. they are forced to take a stand. this film also talks about class distinction in society. the farmers and the samurai belong to different classes of society and although they are forced to fight together, there are some farmers who just can't accept this merger. kurosawa also makes a touching statement about how the samurai were slowly being sidelined in society and how they were gradually losing importance after the civil wars in japan. kurosawa through a monologue actually conveys that the animosity between the farmers and the samurai existed due to the faults of both parties thus showing how no one party can be blamed for it. the ending to the film has a touch of melancholy to it, due to the fact, that even after all the effort, the end result didn't thematically achieve what it was supposed to. technically, the film is a masterpiece. i just couldn't believe the quality of the action scenes from a film made in 1954. the set pieces, the camera movements, the choreography of the fighting seemed so brutally convincing and realistic. these sequences are fascinatingly directed. there are some reservations that i have for this film. they are regarding the acting. the acting at times is too over the top by mifune and some others. the film is also not as layered and deep thematically as kurosawa's other efforts as far as i am concerned. the cinematography is breathtaking with absolutely haunting stills and picturesque shots. i still think that seven samurai is one of the most important films of all time in the course of the evolution of action films and cinema as a whole from a technical standpoint. but thematically i like rashomon, high & low and ikiru more,;20 April 2015;8;['numerous', 'great', 'monumental', 'magnificent', 'common', 'poor', 'helpless', 'poor', 'toothless', 'different', 'touching', 'civil', 'melancholy', 'set', 'convincing', 'realistic', 'layered', 'deep', 'other', 'picturesque', 'important', 'technical', 'high', 'low'];0.1438541666666667
107;peefyn;i love the acting in this movie. mostly it's really good. even minor characters feel very much like a part of the universe they're in, almost as if kurosawa just found a village and started shooting. at the same time, and this might be due to difference in cultures, all of the characters feel super real, because everyone is shouting all the time, they're always running, and they usually react as a group, moving together like it was all choreographed. it's also quite extraordinary how thorough this movie is leading you through the events in what is essentially a battlefield. it goes as far as having the characters literally ticking check boxes for each death. it shows you the plans before the action starts, and then have the characters actions show you how the plans are progressing. it's an impressive feat, considering it all feels natural. but still, had it been made today, i am sure the filmmaker would not have dared to risk boring the audience with the same attention being given to details. and while it is interesting to many to have the battle shown this way, i am sure a modern audience would prefer to just have it all happen, perhaps opting for montages instead. it's hard to say one is the better option over the other, but the way kurosawa did it is not bad. it might just not be what modern audiences would prefer. another odd bit, that have not aged that well, is that pretty much every comedic moment (in which the characters are laughing), it's almost always at the expense of someone. they're laughing at people in a way that today would probably not be that accepted.;8 October 2016;7;['good', 'minor', 'same', 'due', 'real', 'extraordinary', 'thorough', 'impressive', 'natural', 'sure', 'same', 'interesting', 'many', 'sure', 'modern', 'hard', 'well', 'other', 'bad', 'modern', 'odd', 'comedic'];0.1800925925925926
108;malkane316;kurosawa's most famous film, and arguably the most famous film ever to come out of japan over 50 years after its release. endlessly influential, often touted as the first action movie, and full of rich cinematography, brilliantly constructed set-pieces, humour, sorrow, and some timeless characters portrayed by excellent performances. the seven samurai is still seen today by fans and critics alike as one of the best films ever made, almost flawless in every department and still as appealing and relevant as it was 5 decades ago. the film begins by telling us that japan over 400 years ago was a place of fighting and poverty, with samurai and bandits wandering the countryside, some with honour, some stealing from the poor. we meet a group of 40 bandits who travel from village to village through the year ransacking and taking whatever they can find. in the past they have murdered farmers, raped their wives and daughters, and taken their livelihood. the decide to raid one village once it is time for the farmers to harvest. a few villagers over-hear this and tell everyone else so they can prepare. some believe they should fight, some say they should plead with the bandits, others say they should just give in as always or they will be killed. eventually their patriarch gisaku says they should go and hire some help, samurai who will help them in exchange for food. this seems like an outrageous plan as samurai are proud, but a small group of farmers led by rikichi leave with some food to find such samurai in the hope that their village will be saved, the alternative being worse. they struggle at first and we see how there is no pity for them, that most people are too busy with their own affairs. just as they give up hope they witness kambei, a samurai performing a selfless deed. they follow him and ask for help. joining kambei is a young apprentice samurai katsushiro who also saw kambei's deed, and following them is a fiery man who claims to be a samurai-kikuchiyo. kambei listens to them and eventually agrees, believing they will need a total of seven samurai. he and katsushiro make two, and they begin to look for and test others. kambei's old friend schichiroji who he believed was dead arrives making 3. a woodcutting, quirky samurai called heihachi joins as well as masterful swordsman kyuzo making 5, and a man nicknamed strongman makes 6. they leave for the village, followed by kikuchiyo who wants to be part of their group even though no-one believes he is a samurai. he proves himself and makes 7 when the villagers do not come to welcome their rescuers. we see how the samurai and farmers as two different kinds of people mix, and we see mistrust and fear. many emotions come out adding a depth so rarely seen in action films, there is a love story between katsushiro and shino, many twists, prejudices and hidden truths. as the bandits approach, the farmers are trained and a plan is made, but there will be many casualties. as so many books have been written on this film alone i can only offer a summary. each actor is excellent, with mifune standing out. shimura, miyaguchi, tsuchiya, and kimura all give emotive performances and when a character dies or feels sorrow we genuinely grieve with or for them. there is so much going on and so many story lines that we are completely pulled into the lives of each character. kurosawa's direction cannot be faulted, and although it is slow at times and the search for samurai takes up much of the film, we are captivated throughout. the action scenes, groundbreaking for their time still manage to create awe today simply because they are filmed so beautifully. this is an immortal story of winners and losers, of truth and honour, of love in all its guises, and of overcoming personal prejudice which will stay in the mind forever. 10 out of 10;3 May 2005;10;['famous', 'famous', 'influential', 'first', 'full', 'rich', 'timeless', 'excellent', 'good', 'flawless', 'appealing', 'relevant', 'poor', 'few', 'outrageous', 'proud', 'small', 'such', 'bad', 'most', 'busy', 'own', 'young', 'fiery', 'old', 'dead', 'woodcutting', 'quirky', 'masterful', 'different', 'many', 'shino', 'many', 'hidden', 'many', 'many', 'excellent', 'emotive', 'much', 'many', 'slow', 'much', 'immortal', 'personal'];0.2571759259259258

113;OttoVonB;i discovered 16 of kurosawa's best known films before returning to the one which is commonly thought of as his masterpiece. seven samurai is unlike any other grand classic ever produced. it's basic plot can be summed up in a single easy sentence, yet its refinement and execution rival any movie you've ever seen. the premise: in chaotic 16th century japan, as marauders threaten raid villages, one village hires samurai to defend it from a group of bandits. yet kurosawa (also co-writer) developed these characters in a way unheard of for what might pass as an epic action film. to its astonishing credit, through all of its 207 minutes running time, seven samurai never falters or bores. and if the script is a marvel in itself, the acting and production design than derive from it are nothing short of superlative. it is said that kurosawa forced the villagers (from supporting role to mere extra) to live together as a community during production and be their characters, each and every one of which he had drawn out specifically. this unusual technique gave seven samurai a feel of authenticity unparalleled in film history. the samurai themselves are so richly given life to in the screenplay that little more would have been needed to make them memorable characters, yet the main cast pay off at every turn, and though every one of the seven main actors give in perfect performances (never as i had feared before watching it do you confuse them, even in the chaotic battle scenes), two immortal roles have a particularly resounding effect: takashi shimura (kambei shimada), who plays the leader of the ragged band of samurai, gives his sage and venerable warrior a god-like intensity that makes the magnetic charisma of his character unquestionable. one of the easiest leaders to root for in all the history of film-making. stealing the show however, albeit by a very thin margin, is longtime kurosawa favorite coworker toshiro mifune (kikuchiyo) as the rogue seventh, the black sheep of the herd, giving the bravura ultimate performance of a lifetime paved throughout with great roles. the story follows them and the villagers, equally nuanced and developed, through their encounter, training, eventual bonding and the big inevitable fight for survival. unlike subsequent very successful remakes (i.e. magnificent seven), seven samurai transcended excellency by having many layers (nothing or no one is white or black: everything exists in shades of gray) and thus being very real and human. even without the menace, its interpersonal dynamics would have made it perfect human drama, subtle, balancing comedy, intensity, realism, drama and a deep philosophy with astonishing ease, yet the menace does materialize and thus seven samurai unleashes its violence in a series of action scenes crafted with such vision and ingenuity as has ever reached an action film (the frenetic battle scenes at the end rather evoke saving private ryan in their relentlessness). in the end, what made this into solid gold was, at the core, akira kurosawa, who would, despite directing many further masterpieces (throne of blood, yojimbo, red beard, dersu uzala, kagemusha, ran), would never top this one. throughout his life, kurosawa kept confirming his status as perhaps the greatest director ever. if so, seven samurai is the ultimate proof of that truth. one of the very best films ever made and personal all-time favorite.;8 January 2003;10;['other', 'grand', 'basic', 'single', 'easy', 'chaotic', 'unheard', 'epic', 'astonishing', 'derive', 'short', 'mere', 'unusual', 'unparalleled', 'little', 'more', 'memorable', 'main', 'main', 'perfect', 'chaotic', 'immortal', 'resounding', 'ragged', 'venerable', 'like', 'magnetic', 'unquestionable', 'easy', 'thin', 'longtime', 'black', 'ultimate', 'great', 'eventual', 'big', 'inevitable', 'subsequent', 'successful', 'magnificent', 'many', 'white', 'black', 'gray', 'real', 'human', 'interpersonal', 'human', 'subtle', 'deep', 'astonishing', 'such', 'frenetic', 'private', 'solid', 'many', 'further', 'great', 'ultimate', 'good', 'personal'];0.1883582502768549

(akira kurosawa) writing about kurosawa has always been a challenge for me. he's one of the greatest cinematic gods, and is the guru of japanese film for many of us. how can one describe his 'magnum opus', the greatest of all and the first actual samurai-picture. seven samurai is a grand, epic fresco about life and death, victory and defeat, glory and the loss of it; one can see that kurosawa was infatuated by the very same themes, the greatest playwright of all, william shakespeare was. dealing with his own culture's taboos characterized kurosawa's entire work but he drilled down deeper, neglecting historical or cultural limitations. he drilled down to pure emotion, to humanity and the depth of it. in the early 1950's japanese films came to europe for the first time, and its masters were instantly renowned for their unique style. french critic and film theorist, andre bazin wrote that the appreciation towards these films might just be first-time flush and fascination for exotic culture. but after he had seen about twenty japanese films, he was sure it wasn't just that. there was something more. in 1954, when akira kurosawa had just finished his most ambitious film, european audiences and critics were thrilled once again. this was something completely new and, different from everything they had admired about japanese cinema, for which we can give the credit to mizoguchi's lyricism. akira kurosawa made a japanese western; the very first samurai-film. it had the same elements american westerns did, and seven samurai can easily be compared with the finest films by john ford. 'samurai' comes from the word; 'to serve', and samurais were servants. they were a class of their own in feudal japan, and not until the end of the 17th century was the class removed. even that samurais were servants they were part of the upper-class; they were used, not only to serve but, also to smash small peasant revolts. samurais even had the right to kill a man who acted disrespectfully towards a representative of the samurai-class. sometimes, due to boredom and poverty, samurais had to take smaller jobs without gaining much money, and this is exactly what happens in kurosawa's seven samurai. but still the samurais do their job out of solidarity, with heart and talent. a group of bandits terrorize a small farmers' village due to which the village hires seven samurais to protect them. through hard work and precise strategies the samurais, together with the peasants, overthrow the forty bandits and villagers can grow rice in peace once again. the storyline resembles various westerns, for instance john ford's stagecoach (1939), but there is something more in seven samurai. the beauty of the simple plot has something that great novels by dostoevsky have. this japanese fresco is wider, more complex and manifold. to this simple story kurosawa has added depth and beauty through brilliant details which usually are the things that make the films by him so great. in the midst of the grand fighting sequences kurosawa has placed scenes which offer several humanely interesting and understanding characteristics of life and human nature. he offers lyric flashes of the beauty of nature and love; a flowing river, crying men, a woman throwing herself into a burning house because she has lost her glory, and the sparking love between one samurai and a farmer's girl. these kind of emotional scenes, kurosawa often seals with rain. the cleansing, but also melancholy, rain. after the violent final sequence, where the samurais and the farmers have to kill the last 13 bandits, the film returns to its calm rhythm. four of the samurais have died, and the last three look at the farmers planting rice. the samurais didn't win the war, they lost; they got their rice and were unemployed once again. life won the war, and the fearful peace-loving farmers got the reward; not the warlike but helpful samurais. there is so much to say about this timeless masterpiece which is impossible to process in one thousand words. seven samurai is a beautiful film about humanity and the depth of it. it's a complex and life-enhancing fresco. a gorgeous tale of the human nature and solidarity. just as john ford, so did kurosawa portray brave men but to him bravery wasn't all glory and fame; in seven samurai we see men crying, talking about emotions and what's on their minds. this was an unconventional theme for japan and it proves how much more humane seven samurai is compared to western masterpieces. this should not be interpreted as an insult towards westerns or john ford, not at all, he was one of kurosawa's biggest influences -- and bravery was never a shallow or simple theme for ford either. kurosawa's social and political ideologies are not hard to see but overall the lyricism and beauty of the ending indicate that humanism is the greatest ideal of all for him. i feel that it is only fair to end this review the way it started, by quoting the master himself. ""an action film can only be an action film. but how wonderful it is if it can also depict the human nature. it has been my dream ever since i was a co-director. for ten years i've wanted to deal with the ancient drama from this new perspective.""

119;GeorgeRoots;"akira kurosawa's first samurai film needs no introduction. it is happily perched high on any prestigious film lists and its influence on story, characters and battle sequences continues to be never ending. in terms of story it cannot be more simple, a village of poor people are under the threat of looming bandits who plan to pillage everything within the next few days. their only hope is dependent on the charitable services of fleeting samurai, in hopes that they will accept rice as payment. eventually through thick and thin an experienced ronin (takashi shimura) aids the villagers plea and assembles five other samurai, including a mischievous jester (toshiro mifune) who eventually proves his worth. originally known as ""six samurai"", kurosawa and the screenwriters knew they needed another character more off the wall. enter the iconic toshiro mifune, in his 7th appearance among the 16 productions he and kurosawa shared. largely improvised, his hapless and temperamental behaviour definitely stands out as the star of the show. the most expensive production at the time, the budget went overboard leading toho productions to shut it down twice. kurosawa remained ever calm, convincing toho to have faith and let him finish the picture. though its length hinders the pacing ever slightly, ""seven samurai"" is gold in terms of big classic adventure drama. that wonderful samurai march theme happily plays during innate and climactic scenes, and as always the weather plays a vital role in all of kurosawa's movies, none more so than here in it's fantastic finale (where mifune would comment he'd never felt so cold in his life). final verdict: the longest of kurosawa's filmography, and definitely one of the very best. it's 60 years old, shot and told beautifully and remains an iconic piece of japanese cinema. 9/10.";29 January 2015;9;['first', 'prestigious', 'simple', 'poor', 'next', 'few', 'only', 'dependent', 'charitable', 'fleeting', 'thick', 'thin', 'experienced', 'other', 'mischievous', 'iconic', 'hapless', 'temperamental', 'expensive', 'calm', 'convincing', 'big', 'classic', 'wonderful', 'innate', 'climactic', 'vital', 'fantastic', 'cold', 'final', 'long', 'good', 'old', 'iconic', 'japanese'];0.0979166666666666

122;Eternality;after more than half a century, seven samurai remains to be one of the greatest works of cinema. the man behind it is akira kurosawa, one of the greatest filmmakers ever. he is responsible for an unsurpassed body of work that has and still continues to inspire filmmakers young and old worldwide. few would disagree that seven samurai represents the definitive film of the legendary japanese director's luminous career. in a decade which is proud to establish some of the medium's most gifted practitioners including ingmar bergman, federico fellini, satyajit ray, and andrzej wajda, kurosawa is arguably the most influential. seven samurai exists in many cuts. the most rewarding is the original uncut version that runs more than 200 minutes. do not let the lengthy runtime put you off, because there is probably no other film as incredibly well-paced as seven samurai. it gains tremendous momentum, and is so thoroughly enjoyable from start to end that the intermission sequence halfway through feels like the film's only liability. repeated viewings get only better, allowing us to further appreciate kurosawa's technical prowess and artistic vision. the film's storyline is simple: a group of poor, helpless farmers hire samurai to protect their village from ruthless, marauding bandits who steal their rice. seven samurai is split into three major acts: first, the seven samurai are introduced. each is given time to develop a personality. ironically, the longest time is given to toshiro mifune's character, kikuchiyo, who needs little development for his presence immediately lights up every scene he is in. he gives the film's most entertaining performance as an impulsive, wild, and occasional clownish peasant masquerading as a samurai. in contrast, kambei (takashi shimura), the leader of the group, is honorable and caring, and is in my opinion the film's best-acted role. a young inexperienced samurai, a skillful samurai who is always practicing his craft, and three other samurai whose personalities are interchangeable make up the other quintet. the second act shows the integration of the samurai into the village of farmers who give them the cold shoulder by hiding in their shabby homes when they first arrive. after all, samurai are still fundamentally killers and their instinctive reactions are triggered by fear more than anything else. kikuchiyo makes himself useful by breaking the ice between the two social classes in perhaps the film's most hilarious set-piece. speaking of which, kurosawa sprinkles the film with many scenes of humor (especially those involving the bumbling kikuchiyo) that lightens the mood of the film, creating essential camaraderie amongst the characters. and in a subplot, kurosawa explores tradition and social stigmatism when one of the samurai forbiddingly falls in love with a daughter of a farmer. the third act showcases kurosawa at his skillful best: the climatic battle sequences. filmed in adverse conditions that include heavy rain, mud and strong winds, these scenes are brilliantly edited through the rapid inter-cutting of chaotic ground shots of hooves of horses and limbs of humans (farmers, samurai, and bandits) as they scurry about to kill or avoid being killed, together with distinct eye-level shots of the events that are happening. in one magnificent scene, a swarm of bandits on horses rush down from a hilltop to the village below in an uninterrupted sequence that has long been accepted as kurosawian. never for a moment when watching seven samurai do we seem puzzled. everything is laid out clearly by kurosawa. before the samurai meet the farmers, we already know most of their personalities. before the battle cry is sounded, the samurai have already taken us on a tour of the village's key defence points and their tactical strategies while training the farmers to defend themselves. with characterization and plot developments established so excellently, the joy of watching it all unfold is pure cinematic ecstasy. the art direction and costume design are exemplary. together with the incredible cinematography and haunting music, kurosawa effectively transports us several centuries back. in my opinion, kurosawa's most accomplished picture is ran (1985), a fabulously told tale of literally shakespearean proportions. however, seven samurai is arguably his most entertaining, a glorious triumph that is still the standard-bearer for bravura epic filmmaking. it represents not only a cultural turning point for japanese cinema (its western influences are obvious) but also an important milestone in the art of filmmaking. if there is ever a film to show to students of cinema how to write, direct, and edit a movie, this is it. score: 10/10

125;jose-cruz53;perhaps one of the most influential films of all time, seven samurai is also an excellent film. at over 3 hours long, it is also long and complex, with many different characters, each one developed as a complex and interesting individual. a story about a village in 16th japan trying to survive and protect its possessions against the aggression of bandits. based on past experience, the peasants decide to hire samurai to defend the village. even though they were only able to pay the samurai with rice. the first half of the film refers to the process of forming the group of samurai, when we gradually know each of the characters and by the middle of the film we are already well acquainted with each one of these characters. the second half of the film shows the detailed process by with the military knowledge of the samurai is used to prepare the village against the brutal siege executed by the bandits. the second half of the film is almost a documentary about a fictional battle rather than a character driven fiction. the film is generally excellent, given the technical limitations of filming in the early 1950s japan. however, it has several flaws: it is a bit formulaic, has a simple structure. the last half of the movie is basically: we killed 4 bandits in the last engagement, 23 to go, , now we killed another 7, 16 to go, . it gets a bit repetitive which reduces the tension. also, it is plain ludicrous that a gang of bandits would fight to the death just to get some grain from a poor village. it breaks my suspense of disbelief. and yes, it suffers from the technical limitations of its day and place: japan was a very poor country in 1954 and thus didn't have a large movie industry capable of producing movies to the same standard as hollywood did. a black and white film, with poor resolution and sharpness, simply reduces the quality of the overall experience. also, the soundtrack is not exactly inspiring. the rating i give does not show mercy to the technical limitations that kurosawa had to face as i only care about the pleasure derived from experience from seeing the movie and not its importance as a benchmark and influence to other movies. it was a very good movie, but not among the best i have ever seem. edit: upon second viewing i would upgrade my score to 10/10 for this masterpiece. it is indeed one of the best films ever made, despite its flaws.;20 September 2012;10;['influential', 'excellent', 'long', 'complex', 'many', 'different', 'complex', 'interesting', 'past', 'able', 'first', 'acquainted', 'second', 'detailed', 'military', 'brutal', 'second', 'fictional', 'excellent', 'technical', 'early', 'several', 'formulaic', 'simple', 'last', 'last', 'repetitive', 'ludicrous', 'poor', 'technical', 'poor', 'large', 'capable', 'same', 'black', 'white', 'poor', 'overall', 'inspiring', 'technical', 'other', 'good', 'good', 'second', 'good'];0.0964562569213732

""what a waste"" i believe shimada says during the attack. well, what can i say. he's right, but it was one professional waste, i can tell you. this is simply a masterpiece in all ways. it is a masterpiece in drama, romance, adventure and action. shimada's speeches are fantastic, every scene kyuzo is in is nothing to describe with words nor mifune's character kikuchiyo. this is an experience like no other! the romance in this movie, might have had nothing to do with the story, but it's one of the most realistic i've ever seen. the adventure in this movie, for me, is the preparation of the bandits. that's my favorite part. i sense suspense there, am i alone with this feeling? the action scenes are amazing. even more amazing when you realize that shichinin no samurai was made in 1954. this is simply a movie that i recommend to everybody! 10";5 July 2000;10;['favorite', 'perfect', 'shichinin', 'remarkable', 'psychologic', 'complex', 'human', 'powerful', 'big', 'strong', 'angry', 'shy', 'first', 'intense', 'hopeless', 'hopeless', 'hot', 'fine', 'bright', 'little', 'more', 'suspect', 'poulair', 'excellent', 'flawless', 'bad', 'rare', 'cocky', 'right', 'professional', 'fantastic', 'other', 'realistic', 'favorite', 'alone', 'amazing', 'amazing'];0.2579960317460317
132;lyubitelfilmov;"historical drama. the second picture of the famous, legendary and cult japanese director akira kurosawa, which is aimed at the eye of your favorite and most authoritative russian film critic (just kidding!). in fact, it's just a legendary picture that passed me by for quite a long time, until now i got to it, and here's my brief opinion - ronins against bandits. i will say right away that despite the cult status and a huge army of fans around the world, i still found flaws in this picture, and i will write them, no matter how fans try not to notice them, and of course i will not forget about the merits. therefore, sit back, pour strong tea, and enjoy the review of the legend of the world cinema. so, the advantages: 1. the story told - japan at the end of the sixteenth century. sengoku jidai - the era of the warring provinces. a civil war has been raging in the country for many years. blood is pouring everywhere, fields are turning into places of fierce battles, devastated villages are burning everywhere, bandits are in charge of the roads. inhabitants of one of the villages are harassed by a gang, and they are in despair, and for protection they hire seven ronin, who must end the gang. the script skeleton has been repeated many times in world cinema, the most famous and successful attempt is the american western ""the magnificent seven"" (which i watched, and the writers were able to perfectly adapt to the wild west, and not stupidly copied the scenes, as sergio leone did). the story does not shine with originality, but it catches with the elaboration of the characters and well-written dialogues that allow the viewer to feel the characters and begin to empathize with them. akira himself was again responsible for the script, and again he coped with this task perfectly. and while there are a few rustles in it, that doesn't diminish its overall quality. moreover, such a story could have happened in reality. if you like pictures with a good and thoughtful script, where you don't even want to find fault, then you definitely come here. 2. atmosphere - japan during the civil war, with its familiar attributes: samurai (here mostly ronin), their swords, feudal system, oppressed peasantry, horrors of civil war, and so on. the sets and costumes perfectly complement this unique and inimitable japanese culture. if you love this, you are welcome. 3. the relationship between ronin and peasants - at first it seems that the peasants are the most unfortunate people in the country (they are all oppressed, beaten, and no one cares about them as long as there is no need to collect taxes), and after twenty minutes i sincerely sympathized them (the actors literally got used to the role), but later, as the characters were revealed, i realized that both peasants and ronins are people in whom both good and bad are combined. there are no angels and demons here. some demons gave birth to others, some brought misfortune to others. through dialogues, we begin to understand this tumbling and gradually the history of this and similar conflicts in this country is revealed to us. and also the romantic line, which exacerbates these relationships and contradictions between peasants and ronins. 4. defending the village is not just about swinging ropes and sticking bamboo sticks into the bodies of hated bandits. rhonin use tactics and think strategically, which reduces the chances of bandits, although they have a large numerical superiority, to zero. fights and battles are dynamic, although it will be difficult to call them exciting. 5. humor - akira added a good humor to the script, which could make me laugh (and i'm sure not only me) completely sincerely and shamelessly. bravo akira! so the cons: 1. the finale - don't you think, it is logical and expected, and filmed just fine. one only embarrassed - the understatement, and exactly where it was needed. i understood the symbolism (not a fool), the conclusion is also clear, but for the understatement i personally will never forgive akira! 2. duration - three and a half hours - this is the timing of this picture. well, thanks for having an intermission in the middle. and don't get me wrong, long timing allows you to tell the story in great detail, without omitting details. but there are moments here that akira has clearly drawn out, especially the long and languid looks without words. this is symbolism again, but akira, could it be made shorter? after all, the tone of the picture practically does not change, and if you do not focus on the story, you can completely calmly fall asleep, and wake up only at the end. well, the battle itself cannot boast of the spectacularity of the battle today, but let's make a discount on the release time of the picture. a little about the main characters: 1. shimada kambey performed by takashi shimura is the leader of the ronin and the most experienced warrior of all, and also the ""brain"" of the entire defense. he shows himself as a good person and an experienced military leader who fights well himself. takashi perfectly embodied this image on the big screen. 2. okamoto katsushiro, performed by isao kimura, who has impudently become a student of kambey, whom the latter uses as an ""errand boy"" and protects in every possible way. he shows himself as a brave and brave warrior who intends to become the best samurai. isao played this role no less convincingly. 3. kikuchiyo performed by toshiro mifune is the most interesting and memorable ronin in the company. he behaves insolently, funny and very resourceful, more than once helping out the heroes. he is also a tragic character who hides grief behind the laugh. and his monologue in one of the scenes is just great, especially with emotions. toshiro was able to surprise me this time too. bravo toshiro! bravo! honestly, it would be better to call the picture ""seven ronin"", but then there would be consonance with 47 ronin. well, there is only one picture left ""dersu uzala"", shot by akira, joint production of the ussr and japan. as a result, we have an excellent historical drama of the legendary akira kurosawa, with an excellent script, great atmosphere and humor, costumes and sets and great acting work.";28 November 2020;9;['historical', 'second', 'famous', 'legendary', 'japanese', 'favorite', 'authoritative', 'russian', 'legendary', 'long', 'brief', 'huge', 'strong', 'sixteenth', 'civil', 'many', 'fierce', 'devastated', 'many', 'famous', 'successful', 'american', 'western', 'magnificent', 'able', 'wild', 'responsible', 'few', 'overall', 'good', 'thoughtful', 'civil', 'familiar', 'ronin', 'feudal', 'civil', 'unique', 'inimitable', 'japanese', 'welcome', 'unfortunate', 'good', 'bad', 'similar', 'romantic', 'rhonin', 'large', 'numerical', 'dynamic', 'difficult', 'exciting', 'good', 'sure', 'logical', 'fine', 'embarrassed', 'clear', 'wrong', 'long', 'great', 'long', 'languid', 'short', 'asleep', 'little', 'main', 'experienced', 'entire', 'good', 'experienced', 'military', 'big', 'latter', 'possible', 'brave', 'brave', 'good', 'interesting', 'memorable', 'funny', 'resourceful', 'more', 'tragic', 'great', 'able', 'well', 'joint', 'ussr', 'excellent', 'historical', 'legendary', 'excellent', 'great', 'great'];0.3148500309214595

134;antagonist117;"what ""seven samurai"" offers is not a mere slice of life, but a panoramic painting of it as it may have once existed in medieval japan. the screenplay depicts, in an entirely naturalistic and unforced way, the barriers of propriety and experience that seem to have separated classes, genders, and rural and urban societies in that milieu, as well as the mutual (and mutually resented) dependencies between these groups. most impressively, the movie shows how readily people might transgress the widely recognized and rigorously enforced boundaries, and what the consequences of such transgressions could be. the script is sympathetic with its characters, whose ambitions are validated even when they prove irreconcilable with the truths of the world kurosawa creates. one character, discontented with the life of a peasant, leaves his village and forges an identity as a noble warrior. but the real samurai, a hereditary position as much as an occupation, see through him instantly and accept him only as an amusing mascot. the imposter is of course kikuchiyo, the indelible figure brought to life by toshiro mifune. kikuchiyo is mifune's most complex role and his most powerful performance, more so even than his insane bandit in ""rashomon"" or his tormented macbeth (with japanicized name and backstory) in ""kumonosujo."" kikuchiyo, like many of mifune's characters, is animalistic and ruled by his emotions, but he has an irreducible dignity. it was this sense of dignity that led him to try to escape the hated, thankless life of a peasant, but his anger is also selflessly turned against those who would exploit the farmers whose identity he resentfully shares. as for the farmers, their struggles define the movie. troubled by bandits, they seek protection from their social superiors, the samurai. but to invite samurai to their village is to go hungry themselves so that the samurai might eat, and to risk the safety and honor of their daughters should the samurai prove immoral. there is even a degree of risk their own lives, should the samurai discover that the townsfolk have resourcefully found a way to profit from the deaths of warriors. it is therefore understandable that the farmers fear and resent the very people they beg for help. a local girl must transgress a barrier by taking on the appearance of a boy, and a young samurai transgresses at least class lines, if not lines of sexuality as well (doubtless there are readings of the film that explore that possibility), by falling in love with her. their elders, both samurai and peasant, oppose the relationship because they recognize the wide gulf between the two worlds. it is not spelled out, but it can be felt in the acting and in the distant parting shots, that the young samurai would burden the town and not be welcome there when his job is finished. the girl, after the brief romance, seems eager to resume the rhythms of rural life once the bandit crisis has passed. there is more. an aged man and woman have their own perspectives, resentments, and desires informed by their particular experiences. the precarious economic position of samurai, especially masterless and landless ones as japan's medieval period wound toward its bloody conclusion, receives nods. but to enumerate ""seven samurai""'s cultural insights does not do it justice. this is not only a history lesson, but great entertainment. it is the quintessential samurai film, with a perfect cast, strongly-defined characters, well-staged action, a pulsing score, and romantic locations. it is even perhaps the quintessential japanese film, although ozu's family dramas and miyazaki's animations are also required viewing. yet there is little even in those magnificent movies that kurosawa's epic does not touch on in some way, just as there is little in the great movies of modern western cinema that does not owe something to kurosawa's body of work.";14 March 2014;10;['mere', 'panoramic', 'medieval', 'naturalistic', 'unforced', 'rural', 'urban', 'mutual', 'resented', 'such', 'sympathetic', 'irreconcilable', 'noble', 'real', 'hereditary', 'amusing', 'indelible', 'complex', 'powerful', 'insane', 'tormented', 'japanicized', 'many', 'animalistic', 'irreducible', 'thankless', 'social', 'hungry', 'immoral', 'own', 'understandable', 'very', 'local', 'young', 'least', 'doubtless', 'wide', 'distant', 'young', 'welcome', 'brief', 'eager', 'rural', 'more', 'aged', 'own', 'particular', 'precarious', 'economic', 'masterless', 'landless', 'medieval', 'bloody', 'cultural', 'great', 'quintessential', 'perfect', 'romantic', 'quintessential', 'japanese', 'little', 'magnificent', 'little', 'great', 'modern', 'western'];0.1517441860465116

136;wumbi;a movie that waste no time in introducing its conflict but it uses every minute it has to build everything else, the setup to some of the story is amazing. rich of characters and is not void of any emotional depth. one character that really stands out is kikuchiyo, a wild reckless showoff that gives zero respect to anyone but later we learn more about the character, about who he is and why he does what he does and for me his arc is one the best thing in the movie. despite its 207 minutes runtime, it was an easy watch. kurosawa's smooth storytelling is one of the reason for it, there are so many well developed characters and the action scene is thrilling, the stake is clear and the sequences are easy to digest. while it was technically a violent movie it is not its main point, it touches on so many things about social caste, affection, humanism, empathy, and friendship.;21 November 2021;10;['amazing', 'rich', 'void', 'emotional', 'wild', 'reckless', 'more', 'good', 'easy', 'smooth', 'many', 'clear', 'easy', 'violent', 'main', 'many', 'social'];0.2694444444444445
137;MarcoParzivalRocha;seven samurai without a master (ronins) are recruited by villagers to protect a village from attacks by a group of bandits. it is considered by many critics and cinephiles to be the best samurai movie ever (i put it in my top 3). everything in this story flows perfectly, starting with the meeting of the seven warriors, their personal conflicts, their ambitions and motives and the way they face battles. it is a film full of symbology (example number 7), with an unpredictable and chaotic narrative, which leaves us glued to the screen during the 3h:30m (yes, it is a very well spent afternoon). visually it is a milestone in the history of cinema, using techniques and movements characteristic of kurosawa that until today few can match. i saw this film in a movie theater this week, and i can say it was one of the best experiences in my life regarding films.;22 September 2020;10;['many', 'good', 'personal', 'full', 'unpredictable', 'chaotic', 'characteristic', 'few', 'good'];0.2270833333333333
138;drunken_munki;"i love this movie, there is no doubt that many do. this is a masterpiece in every sense of storytelling. the characters define the archetypes that so many shows and films have used and used over the years. the archetypes work here, they are the core of the story. this is the 5th item out of 8 that i have given a perfect 10/10 score. what i admire is that the plot could be written on the back of a cigarette packet. yet what makes this so engrossing is the character development, the interactions, the dialogue, the stories of the samurai and ronin, and the villagers too. the bandits forced the villagers to ask for help. they are poor, so they claim, and they find help in some warriors of old. kurasawa is a master in telling a story; and with these characters he digs into their past, their ticks, their souls even. you learn about each of the seven warriors quite intimately. each has different motives to help the villagers, some share a past as soldiers, some are just looking for love. there are some outrageously good character interactions here, and the acting in particular from the amazing toshiro mifune is nothing short of mesmerising. this movie also sets another precedent in my opinion. the battle preparation trope used in so many films afterwards as the samurai attempt to prepare the villagers for a defensive battle. they set up traps, barriers, and chokepoints. the samurai position themselves to rally the villagers. they are all hopelessly outnumbered. and yet, with tremendous bravery, the battle is won with heavy costs. this story has since been repeated a thousand times since, and to be honest it will never get old. the story also tells another tale. that of the villagers being greedy and hiding their riches; used to pretending to have nothing. the tale of the samurai raiding and pillaging for their lords. the tale of everyone playing their part, and all they ever really have to show at the end of it is a death count. in some way this story asks us to look at ourselves, and what we are doing to ourselves and each other. the bandits are mostly voiceless and one dimensional... but they also play a part in this story. how did they become a bandit, why join them? it is interesting to think about, any one of the villagers or ronin could have easily become a bandit, given the conditions. the imagery is beautiful, the minuta stories told between all the characters are interesting in their own right. the movie is long but uses its time well. this is one of the early examples of cinema that has taught so many masters after it. that plot doesn't have to be fantastical, have twists, or be complex. all you need is good characters and good writing, and you can hopefully tell any story you want. kurasawa is a legend and has been missed by all since his passing. this is one of his greatest achievements, and i love it.";6 October 2020;10;['many', 'many', 'perfect', 'ronin', 'poor', 'old', 'different', 'good', 'particular', 'amazing', 'short', 'many', 'defensive', 'tremendous', 'heavy', 'honest', 'old', 'greedy', 'other', 'voiceless', 'dimensional', 'interesting', 'beautiful', 'minuta', 'interesting', 'own', 'long', 'early', 'many', 'fantastical', 'complex', 'good', 'good', 'great'];0.3435185185185184

140;robertguttman;the seven samurai is one of those movies that should be on every true film-lover's list of movies that they absolutely must see at least once in their lives. it is a true epic motion picture but, like all great epics, it's story is essentially a simple and universal one. a gang of bandits have been preying upon a village of defenseless japanese farmers. the farmers finally decide that they are not going to take it any more, and resolve to hire unemployed samurai warriors to fight for them. that is essentially all there is to the basic story although, naturally, there is a lot more to it. the seven samurai that the farmers manage to hire are all vividly delineated characters, all of whom decide to hire on for their own different reasons.the farmers are also finely-drawn characters, each with their own individual strengths and weaknesses. although set in 16th century japan, the story of the seven samurai is so universal that it resonates equally in all cultures. small wonder that it has been successfully remade as an american western. it could just as easily be remade in a setting of medieval western europe, ancient greece or rome, pre-colonial africa, medieval china, ancient india, pre-columbian america, as a science-fiction film set on another planet, or in any other setting that one might care to name. nevertheless, akira kurosawa's original japanese version is so good that it remains the best of all versions. yes, it is 3 1/2 hours long. yes, it is in japanese. yes, it is in black-and-white. nevertheless, despite the length, the foreign language and the lack of color photography, this movie never loses the viewer's interest for a moment. the seven samurai is one of the truly timeless classic movies that never gets old.;22 September 2016;10;['true', 'least', 'true', 'epic', 'great', 'simple', 'universal', 'defenseless', 'japanese', 'unemployed', 'basic', 'more', 'delineated', 'own', 'different', 'own', 'individual', 'universal', 'small', 'american', 'medieval', 'western', 'ancient', 'pre', 'colonial', 'ancient', 'pre', 'columbian', 'other', 'original', 'japanese', 'good', 'good', 'black', 'white', 'foreign', 'timeless', 'classic', 'old'];0.1325
141;simon_booth;"well, if you haven't seen seven samurai then you're not really qualified to call yourself a film fan, basically. one of the most influential movies of all time, that still holds up extremely well nearly 50 years later. akira kurosawa's epic tale of heroism and barbarism set the standard in so many ways it's hard to imagine that any modern film does not show its influence in some way or other. a great script, great characters, mostly great acting, splendid cinematography and action sequences that wrote the book about how these things should be filmed. even now, after so many have tried to imitate or beat it, seven samurai remains a totally gripping 3.5 hour experience. akira kurosawa is one of the gods of cinema - men who seem to have been born to make films, who have it in their blood. people like alfred hitchcock, stanley kubrick, king hu and steven spielberg, who make it look easy... who so obviously ""get it"". in this pantheon, kurosawa is perhaps the daddy of them all, however, and seven samurai is one of his finest moments. the scale of the production is remarkable - to undertake making such an epic in post-war japan was a feat in itself. the cast of dozens of inhabitants of a village specially built for the movie, the 40 bandits and their horses, all the costumes, the armour, the weapons. few directors could have brought all of this together and still paid such attention to the smallest of details in script and scene. credit must go to the team kurosawa worked with too, i presume the movie's setup became the template for many movies to follow, the most recentl example that comes to mind being the excellent korean period movie musa (the warrior), for example. a motley band of characters is assembled and placed in a situation where the odds are seemingly stacked against them, and each gets there chance to really shine, prove themselves and become something more than a normal man. kurosawa's samurai movies all share a little bit in common, which is the depiction of the samurai as some noble beast, different from the common and pathetic rabble of ordinary man. in seven samurai the farmers are a base lot, cowardly, selfish, vain, pathetic and treacherous. how he found actors with such miserable looking faces is a mystery in itself. in contrast, the samurai embody all the qualities that humanity would generally like to believe define it (us). brave, righteous, honest, strong and heroic. toshiro mifune's character stands in the middle and represents this difference - perhaps meant to suggest that mankind can strive to rise above his flaws, but mostly suggesting to me that the common man is basically a mess and we should learn to respect our betters. kurosawa was definitely not a socialist, unless i'm mis-reading him wildly. i'm sure many out there wonder, does a 50 year old black and white movie about samurai really have any interest or relevance to us in the 21st century? the answer is a definite ""yes!"". seven samurai shows us what cinema can be, what cinema is *meant* to be. it is moving picture as art in a way that the multiplex-fillers of today cannot possibly claim to be. it's a film that satisfies on many different levels, and still provides a bench mark which today's film makers could and should use to evaluate their own contributions. true, few out there will ever be able to claim they've made a film that rivals seven samurai in scope or beauty, but this *is* what every director should aspire to! the sad thing is, i just can't see a project like this ever coming out of the hollywood studio system, where art is just another commodity and marketing is the new god";31 January 2003;10;['qualified', 'influential', 'epic', 'many', 'hard', 'modern', 'other', 'great', 'great', 'great', 'splendid', 'many', 'alfred', 'fine', 'remarkable', 'post', 'war', 'few', 'such', 'small', 'many', 'recentl', 'excellent', 'korean', 'motley', 'more', 'normal', 'little', 'common', 'noble', 'different', 'common', 'pathetic', 'ordinary', 'cowardly', 'selfish', 'vain', 'pathetic', 'treacherous', 'such', 'miserable', 'brave', 'righteous', 'honest', 'strong', 'heroic', 'common', 'sure', 'many', 'old', 'black', 'white', 'definite', 'many', 'different', 'bench', 'own', 'true', 'few', 'able', 'sad', 'new'];0.1639772727272727
142;Ziya90;my favorite kurosawa film is throne of blood, hidden fortress follows it and the third is ran or ikiru. as for seven samurai, in imdb, the ratings higher than 8.5 are almost equal to 10 which means a masterpiece. i don't complain about the duration of the movies and if i feel sleepy or get bored (even if i get bored very rarely), i give up watching and watch the rest of the film the next day! however, the problem here is a bit different. the film was unnecessarily long for such a story. that causes it to lose its effect minute by minute. a group of farmers in a village decide to hire a few retired samurai to get rid of the racketeers. it would be great, if such a simple story had been told in 100 minutes. unfortunately, seven samurai is one of the longest movies of all time! i mean the dvd version, i guess that the number of the people who got a chance to see the international version is not many. i forgot the main story totally after a while, loosed my attention. the story was scattered. secondly, seven samurai is not artistic like other kurosawa movies, it is the most pale, the most plain kurosawa film ever. the content is so pale also, the story telling is pale. you watch, watch, watch and watch... by the way, some people say that seven samurai is an action film. there is only one action sequence in the whole film which takes place near the end!!! and it was pretty short. therefore mind!, don't expect an action movie or a real samurai movie. this is a drama about japanese farmers and a group of samurai. in ikiru, the last part had seemed me excessive or unnecessary either and made me think that sometimes, kurosawa extends the story unnecessarily, but then i realized that the part was the heart of the film (ikiru) so i changed my mind. however, i would not say the same thing for seven samurai. it was too excessive like its rating.;19 January 2010;6;['favorite', 'third', 'high', 'equal', 'sleepy', 'bored', 'bored', 'next', 'different', 'long', 'few', 'great', 'simple', 'long', 'international', 'many', 'main', 'artistic', 'other', 'pale', 'plain', 'pale', 'pale', 'whole', 'short', 'real', 'japanese', 'last', 'excessive', 'unnecessary', 'same', 'excessive'];-0.0169761904761904
143;emryse;i was surprised by how much i enjoyed this film. i had heard great things about it and i knew of how famous akira kurosawa was but i expected this film to have aged poorly, maybe i would be able to appreciate it for what it once was but would it really hold up almost 70 years later? yes, absolutely yes. the film is long, really long at 3h and 30m but every scene feels important to moving the story along. i split the film up into thirds and watched an hour and a bit each night over three nights so maybe if you watch it all in one go it will feel it's length but for me it could have been longer and i wouldn't have minded. the acting is all good, no matter how small the part, however, it is all quite over the top and theatrical. for some this could ruin the atmosphere this film is trying to set but for me, who doesn't understand japanese, it made it a lot easier to gauge how characters were feeling. the characterisation they all got was astounding for a film with this large an ensemble cast and kurosawa managed to use the different dynamics to comment on gender, social and class issues in a way that felt equally indicting of everyone, not just pointing a finger, something modern day film makers could learn from. the big shock to me was the cinematography and the score. usually when watching older films such as this i find these aspects age the most obviously but here they were both excellent. the camera quality obviously wasn't up to scratch but if you gave me a version of this filmed in 4k you could believe it had been filmed in the last 20 years which to me shows just how influential kurosawa has been. the score as well was incredibly well done, at first i wasn't very much into it but by the end i was really impressed, it made use of a lot of horns and, at least to my ears, sounded as if it could have provided some of the inspiration to john william's star wars scores. there is one part i think has aged badly and doesn't really stand up under a modern lense which is the action. the set pieces are all brilliant but they have that air of pretend that a lot of films from this period have, where spears bounce off of people when they are supposedly stabbed to death or someone is cut with a sword but no connection is made and they just fall over clutching their stomach. you see this a lot in westerns of the period when someone get's shot but instead of seeing blood they just grab their side and collapse, it's not a complete deal breaker but it is the only big flaw that i think the film has. still, as i said the set pieces themselves are creative and well thought out, never ruined by the limitations of the time. it's interesting watching this and seeing just how many filmmakers it has inspired. from sergio leone to george lucas, akira kurosawa has had a lasting effect not just on film in japan but global cinema. this film was superb in almost every sense of the word and well deserving of a 9/10, if you have any interest in film whatsoever i would recommend this highly and even if you don't you can probably enjoy it.;15 January 2022;9;['surprised', 'great', 'famous', 'able', 'long', 'important', 'long', 'good', 'small', 'theatrical', 'japanese', 'easy', 'astounding', 'large', 'ensemble', 'different', 'social', 'modern', 'big', 'old', 'such', 'excellent', 'last', 'influential', 'impressed', 'least', 'modern', 'set', 'brilliant', 'complete', 'only', 'big', 'creative', 'interesting', 'many', 'lasting', 'global', 'superb', 'deserving'];0.2841931216931217
144;guskeller;kurosawa's seven samurai is a foundational film. despite its age, it remains an ideal template for current blockbusters. it's rich with themes, defined characters, and meaningful action. first, the plot is a quintessential tale of heroes uniting for an honorable cause. marvel constantly mimics this trope, but the imitators are countless. meanwhile, characters are developed beyond warriors in battle. viewers learn their mindsets and motivations. each unique samurai adds to the story. thus, seven samurai is ripe with ideas like unity, morality, humility, accountability, and identity. however, despite the film's intellectual density, its relatability keeps it entertaining. next, seven samurai's filmmaking established every blockbuster fundamental. the music sets a daunting tone, the immersive production sells the era, the acting displays a cohesive range, and the effects are real stunts. lastly, defined by its fluent motion, seven samurai has iconic cinematography and editing. crowds, flames, and weather consistently motivate every shot and cut. each frame is wholly utilized for meaning. each edit expands on the action and its emotional weight. overall, kurosawa's vision makes seven samurai a concrete experience that carefully builds on itself. therefore, seven samurai remains the gold standard of modern epics. writing: 10/10 direction: 10/10 cinematography: 10/10 acting: 10/10 editing: 10/10 sound: 9/10 score/soundtrack: 10/10 production design: 10/10 casting: 10/10 effects: 9/10 overall score: 9.8/10.;21 January 2022;10;['foundational', 'ideal', 'current', 'rich', 'meaningful', 'quintessential', 'honorable', 'countless', 'unique', 'ripe', 'intellectual', 'entertaining', 'blockbuster', 'daunting', 'immersive', 'cohesive', 'real', 'fluent', 'iconic', 'emotional', 'concrete', 'gold', 'modern', 'overall'];0.2857142857142857
145;JaydoDre;"the story of the seven samurai is not a cliche but it is treading an existing type of movie, namely a type of movie in which the story builds to an important event. this event will test several characters, showing how they deal with the said event and with one another. normally, the formula to such a movie requires the first 80% of the movie to be devoted to showing the backstory of each character who will be present for the final event. this is necessary because you have multiple characters and you need to understand the backstory of each of them as well as the relationships between them in order to understand and fully appreciate their behaviour during the final event. seven samurai gives a little bit of an introduction for each character, but not much. not long after seeing this movie, i have completely forgotten 3 out of the 7 samurai. and i would only be able to describe the characters of 2 out of the 7 people, and only briefly. it is not a spoiler to say that some of the samurai are not going to make it out alive, but it's hard to care when the characters are so undeveloped. as for the acting in this movie, it is a matter of taste. the japanese sometimes have a really expressive line delivery, which is most evident in anime production. this delivery is aided by the fact that the japanese language, even when spoken at a conversational speed, can easily be made to sound more pressurised than western languages, with a lot of harsh ""zh"" and ""sh"" mushed together for effect. and in addition to that, older movies in general seem to suffer from overenthusiastic acting - a leftover from the theatrical era when it was actually necessary due to the distance between the performers and the viewers. perhaps as a result of all 3 of these factors, there is a lot of overacting in this film. specifically, toshiro mifune's character was given artistic license to physical improvisation by the director and toshiro ran with it all the way to cartoon-land. i felt a physical need to look away during some of the scenes because it just got too weird for me to handle. that is not to say that the acting is bad. it's great but very stylised. i read that the reason why toshiro was given the liberty to go nuts is because the director was worried that the movie would otherwise be too quiet and boring. he was sort of right, because when you remove toshiro's character and his contribution to the themes concerning the position and identity of the peasant class, the film is just a story about a few people coming together and then fighting off an attack. it moves slowly, at almost 3 hours long, and not all of the scenes feel necessary. the good part is that, despite of it all the shortcomings, the film remains entertaining. the scenes are shot with competence. i am just somewhat surprised to see all the overwhelmingly positive reactions to this film.";11 May 2018;7;['important', 'several', 'first', 'devoted', 'present', 'final', 'necessary', 'multiple', 'final', 'little', 'much', 'able', 'alive', 'hard', 'undeveloped', 'expressive', 'evident', 'japanese', 'conversational', 'pressurised', 'western', 'harsh', 'old', 'general', 'overenthusiastic', 'theatrical', 'necessary', 'artistic', 'physical', 'physical', 'weird', 'bad', 'great', 'stylised', 'nuts', 'worried', 'quiet', 'boring', 'right', 'few', 'necessary', 'good', 'entertaining', 'surprised', 'positive'];0.06436537999038

151;sandnair87;akira kurosawa's jidai-geki epic 'seven samurai' can be counted among the greatest of all battle movies - a majestic tale of heroism, sacrifice and death, that remains unmatched, even today. set in 1587, it follows the story of a village of farmers that hire seven master-less samurai to combat bandits who will return after the harvest to steal their crops. the displaced samurai - seven sword-swinging, bow-and-arrow footmen of varied courage and personality - put aside class differences in order to defend the village that has been the unfortunate target of the gang of marauding bandits for a long time. the first half where the lead samurai gathers his troops and journeys to the village, is fascinating, full of vigor and life. but the second half - where the samurai train the peasant villagers to fight and then take on the bandit horde, resisting wave after wave of horseback assaults with sword and rifle in the driving rain, the bandits battering against the improvised fortifications, trading deaths until the last rifle shot and sword-slash - is one of the most thrilling sustained passages of action cinema ever. on that simple framework and familiar storyline, director akira kurosawa plasters a wealth of rich detail, which brilliantly illuminates his characters and the kind of action in which they are involved. we feel the warfare so intensely because of his mastery of staging and editing the violence. but we also feel the film because the characters are so strong, especially the seven samurai themselves: heroes in the truest sense, but also convincingly idiosyncratic and human. the film's three and a half hour length is more than justified by the intricate character development of both the samurai and the villagers, as both groups let go of class biases to accomplish their mutual goal of fortifying the village. the legendary takashi shimura as the ageing, and oddly charismatic leader and toshiro mifune as the arrogant ronin looking to outdo his compatriots lead a superb cast, and kurosawa's kinetic camera keeps the adventure sizzling with energy and wit from start to finish. by the climactic showdowns against the bandits, a palpable anxiety is present due to the great affinity the audience feels for the characters. rich in detail, vivid in characterization and leisurely in exposition, seven samurai is bravura filmmaking. akira kurosawa synthesizes the traditions of the samurai narrative and the american western to create an intimate epic with deeply felt ground-level consequences. while doing so, he deflates the myth of the noble samurai without actually debunking it and sends a dark thrill through his audience with a touch of sensuous physical reality.;9 February 2016;9;['great', 'majestic', 'unmatched', 'less', 'varied', 'unfortunate', 'long', 'first', 'lead', 'fascinating', 'full', 'second', 'last', 'thrilling', 'sustained', 'simple', 'familiar', 'rich', 'strong', 'true', 'idiosyncratic', 'half', 'more', 'intricate', 'mutual', 'legendary', 'charismatic', 'arrogant', 'kinetic', 'climactic', 'palpable', 'present', 'great', 'rich', 'vivid', 'leisurely', 'american', 'intimate', 'noble', 'dark', 'sensuous', 'physical'];0.239655172413793

169;joshuafagan-64214;"the plot is simple. a village has been attacked by roving bandits, so they hire 7 samurai to protect them. and that's it; that's the movie. i doubt any western filmmaker, even the great david lean, could have put together an interesting four hour film about that without blowing it up to a grander physical scale. but here this film is. yes, it sometimes lags a bit, but it never stops being interesting. i understand this might not be everyone's cup of tea. if you're not the sort of person who can even tear yourself away from ninety minute romcoms to watch the godfather, this movie is not for you. but if you love film or history or philosophy or just seeing things done really well, this film is for you. it's one of those films where you remember the first time you saw it. mine was on a warm summer day in july, not long after my trip to costa rica. i started it an seven and finished around eleven-thirty (i took a short break to eat lunch). right after i saw it, i went with my mom to the grocery store. through that trip and all through that day, i never stopped thinking about this movie. it impacted me in the sort of way that is forever and profound and sunbright. i felt different, like i had just witnessed a transcendental event. which i guess i had. when you watch a film like this, both long and impossibly good, you feel so enriched and immersed in its world and characters that you feel like you've left planet earth. you don't feel like you're walking on clouds per se. it's too substantial for that. you feel like you've set foot on another planet and yours is just a faint twinkle in the magenta-green sky. okay, me. stop floating off into magnificent reverie and get down to film analysis. when this film and many of kurokawa's latter works were released, they were criticized for being 'too western.' this is absurd as a complaint; no respected film critic would drill an american movie for being 'too eastern.' but you can see their point. this film is more focused on individuality and rebelling; at least by japanese standards. it certainly isn't completely accurate to the values of the time; not that i'm complaining. to western audiences, it is probably a bit more satiable than, say, tokyo story, even with the four hour running time. nothing is without weight. even if you are not comfortable with watching a movie this long- and you really should make an exception for this film- you cannot deny that nothing is just pure filler. everything adds to the sprawling web of storytelling that they are trying to create. as a side note, can i say how weird it is that people are often unwilling to watch any movie that exceeds three hours, but are perfectly fine with sitting back and binge-watching ten hours of a television show on netflix. i'm not condemning this- if i were, i'd be straight about it- but rather intrigued by it. maybe i'll drop a piece about the differences between movies in television in that and many other regards. probably not. but it is nonetheless something worth taking a look in. anyways, the movie is pretty dark. not dark as in the gritty, angsty, post-apocalyptic, brownish connotations that word seems to take on here in america. but dark as in thematically dark; they don't show any heads being chopped off or collar bones flying through the air because they don't need to. not saying that it's the only right way to go; but it is a right way to go. they leave the explicit darkness to the very well-done script. there have been more than a few articles that call this the first true action movie; and i can see where they are coming from. i never have been much of a fan of action sequences; my brain kind of glosses them out (yes, i'm weird); but i can tell when they are done well and when they are, well, not. and this is the first and perhaps the only old film i've seen that did them well. while i myself am not comfortable calling it 'the first', as i don't make a business out of watching old movies unless i'm sure that they're really good, i will say that the action is good enough to make me forget i'm watching a movie from the early fifties. seriously; if you want a good laugh, go check out some of the other so-called action sequences that were being filmed around this time. all that action results in death; dirty, inglorious deaths. i'm not going to tell you who dies (that would a spoiler, something i try to avoid on these reviews), but i will say that enough people bite it to make the film's themes feel alive and resonant. there is never a sense that they are killing characters off just for the sake of killing them off. everything has power. perhaps the best comparison to this film is to those buildings in ancient japan that were created slowly, generation after generation, revealing an enormous accomplishment that has continued to wow people in the millennia since. the west could never make either; perhaps even the modern east couldn't make them. but here they remain, a towering relic from a bygone era waiting to be embraced. p.s. stick it out to the end. the last fifteen minutes or so of this movie are some of the most potent and loaded and electrifying and well-acted i've ever seen.";20 November 2015;10;['simple', 'western', 'great', 'interesting', 'physical', 'interesting', 'first', 'warm', 'short', 'profound', 'sunbright', 'different', 'transcendental', 'long', 'good', 'enriched', 'substantial', 'faint', 'green', 'magnificent', 'many', 'latter', 'western', 'absurd', 'respected', 'american', 'eastern', 'focused', 'least', 'japanese', 'accurate', 'western', 'satiable', 'comfortable', 'pure', 'weird', 'unwilling', 'fine', 'many', 'other', 'worth', 'dark', 'dark', 'gritty', 'post', 'apocalyptic', 'brownish', 'dark', 'dark', 'only', 'right', 'right', 'explicit', 'more', 'few', 'first', 'true', 'much', 'weird', 'first', 'only', 'old', 'comfortable', 'first', 'old', 'sure', 'good', 'good', 'early', 'good', 'other', 'dirty', 'inglorious', 'enough', 'alive', 'resonant', 'good', 'ancient', 'enormous', 'modern', 'bygone', 'last', 'potent', 'loaded', 'electrifying'];0.1528571428571428

173;MrVibrating;"this movie has been seen and loved by movie fans since it was made. it's so classic it's hard to imagine a movie world without it. it's one of few ""foreign"" movies to be in the top 250 of imdb, and if that's any measure of anything it's at least popularity. so what can i say that hasn't been said before? not much i'm afraid. still, i enjoyed seven samurai very much and i'd like to share why. it's one of the first action movies, and it set up ground rules followed by movies to this day. it's a rich story, at the time original, and it's got a magnificent cast of characters, each sympathetic and with their own depth. it's beautifully shot, with camera-work which is also copied to this day. the actors are great and really make the most of their well-written roles. takashi shimura plays a noble samurai who leads his group of fellow samurais to defend a small village. he's a good man, he's down to earth and caring. strangely enough, he looks exactly like morgan freeman in this movie. no doubt because mr. freeman has learned quite a lot of his acting from this character and from takashi's immense skills as an actor. the other six samurais are equally well portrayed, with the crazy and honour-seeking kikuchiyo and the young and enthusiastic katsushiro(who is ever-present in this kind of movie today) standing out as the two most memorable characters. the setting, old japan, is well-made and feels very real. the clash between old and new is also present, for example how the bandits bring three guns, and how they use them cowardly and unfairly. at very few points in seven samurai are you aware you're watching a movie. the acting, camera-work and the super-tight script lure you in, and by the time of the final battle, you care about the characters more than they care about themselves. recommended to anyone with a remote interest in movie history or just good movies in general. if you feel it's slow in the beginning, hang on! it's worth it.";28 July 2006;10;['classic', 'hard', 'few', 'foreign', 'top', 'least', 'afraid', 'first', 'rich', 'original', 'magnificent', 'sympathetic', 'own', 'great', 'most', 'noble', 'fellow', 'small', 'good', 'immense', 'other', 'crazy', 'young', 'enthusiastic', 'present', 'memorable', 'old', 'real', 'old', 'new', 'present', 'few', 'aware', 'super', 'tight', 'final', 'more', 'remote', 'good', 'general', 'slow', 'worth'];0.1704031385281385

186;madbandit20002000;"growing up, i thought of japan as the home of anime and giant monster films. then, while attending college, i saw ""the seven samurai"". i was proved wrong by this film, which is considered to be the magnum opus of celebrated filmmaker, akira kurosawa, by movie historians. they're right. 1587 is the year in japan and the story's setting. previously, the nation was ruled by a shogunate (the shogun being the imperial army's commander) with the emperor reduced to powerless figurehead. however, unavoidable civil wars came, caused by ambitious daimyo (local warlords), who wanted power, no matter what. in this epic tale (co-written by kurosawa, shinobu hashimoto and hideo oguni, all who worked kurosawa's ""ikiru""), a poor, humble farming village and its' residents are constant victims of a bandit clan. rice and sex are the group's goals, and they break carelessly the villagers' spirits. what to do? the local authorities are inept, and suicide, for a farmer, is giving up. ""we hire samurai,"" the village elder strongly suggests. a quartet of farmers, with a pillar of rice as payment, does that, employing seven individualistic but noble ronin (samurai without masters). there's kambei (takashi shimura of the original ""godzilla"" and other kurosawa works), the valiant leader; gorobei (yoshio inaba), a good second-in-command; shichiroji (daisuke kato), a battlefield acquaintance of kambei; heihachi (minoru chiaki), an optimist; kyuzo (seiji miyaguchi), a perfect killing machine; katsushiro (isao kimura), a green, wet-eared boy and the unforgettable kikuchiyo (famed kurosawa player toshiro mifune), a wild dog yet perfectly human goofball. together, they're a force of nature, bounded by courage, honor and self-sacrifice. if you don't like a foreign, subtitled, black and white, three hours and twenty seven minute film, which ""samurai"" is (and more), you need to be committed at once, post haste (i also adored ""grindhouse"", which is sixteen minutes less). under kurosawa's direction, the film has a jackrabbit's pulse, a wolf's ferocity and a lamb's serenity. it's fascinating that both camps (samurai and farmer) learn from each other while fighting the enemy. even two reps, despite their social standing (born in a role, die in a role) fall in love; the passion between katsushiro and shino (keiro tsushima), a young woman whose fool father has cut part of her hair to ""protect her from the samurai"", is subtlety passionate. as the resident clown, mifune's so idiosyncratically human, he's almost american, being no surprise that he influenced clint eastwood (the man with no name trilogy) and the late john belushi (the samurai skits on ""saturday night live""; the bluto role on ""animal house""). the battle scenes are fierce and kinetic; it's hard to distinguish whether this work is real or fiction, and that's what makes ""samurai"" brilliant. the actors, besides mifune, are great too, honest in their emotions. what more praise can i deemed upon ""samurai"", other than its' director has influenced the likes of leone, peckinpah, scorcese, lucas, rodriguez, miller, tarantino, cannell and others? it's just damn cool. the american western remake, ""the magnificent seven"", is reliable but comes short, if compared to ""samurai"", being star-studded and hollywood polished. peckinpah's ""the wild bunch"" is a better, if unofficial, remake. if you buy the three-disc dvd from criterion (expensive but worth it), you'll be forever enchanted. give some honor to ""the seven samurai"", and enjoy.";12 March 2008;10;['giant', 'wrong', 'magnum', 'right', 'imperial', 'powerless', 'unavoidable', 'civil', 'ambitious', 'local', 'epic', 'oguni', 'poor', 'humble', 'constant', 'local', 'inept', 'individualistic', 'noble', 'original', 'other', 'valiant', 'good', 'second', 'battlefield', 'seiji', 'perfect', 'green', 'unforgettable', 'famed', 'wild', 'human', 'foreign', 'black', 'white', 'more', 'fascinating', 'other', 'social', 'young', 'human', 'american', 'late', 'fierce', 'kinetic', 'hard', 'real', 'great', 'honest', 'more', 'other', 'lucas', 'tarantino', 'cool', 'american', 'magnificent', 'reliable', 'short', 'wild', 'well', 'unofficial', 'expensive', 'worth'];0.1326298701298701

194;gentendo;"filmmaker's purpose kurosawa seeks to examine the following messages: how god answers earnest prayers, takes mercy on his children as a result of their suffering, and provides strength for them to overcome their challenges. in the beginning, a village of distressed farmers is shown mourning in solemn prayer. they cry to the heavens, asking if there is a god who cares about them, and if so, why he would allow them to suffer as much as they were (i.e. land tax, forced labor, disease, starvation, and war). just when they are about to lose hope, the village patriarch becomes inspired to hire a band of samurai to protect them from a group of bandits who keep pillaging their land. to heighten this inspiration as direct revelation from god, there is a specific production design element known via mis-en-scene that helps draw the conclusion that the patriarch is acting under the influence of god's spirit. to explain, the patriarch represents the village's wisdomthe god-like figure. he is old, gray, mature, and lives inside of a sawmill. the mis-en-scene regards the sawmill in particular. a sawmill's purpose is to power the mill through collecting water from a nearby stream and in turn grind grain. in short, it is an empowerment tool that is enabled through natural means to sustain and feed a people. so to, then, the patriarch is also an empowerment tool used in the hands of god to enlighten the village on how to protect themselves from the banditshire samurai! it is in this way that the villagers are sustained and protected temporally. to conclude, it is in consequence of their suffering that god has taken mercy upon the small village. he answers their prayers (through revelation) by providing the necessary strength (samurai) for them to overcome their challenges (the bandits). character arc i'd like to focus on the villagers as a collection of personages as the lead character of this film. in the beginning, they are severely lamenting due to their afflictions (i.e. list above). there are those who complain because of their circumstances and those who do not. contention exists amongst the people as a natural consequence of them fearing death. it is the fear of death that must be overcome in order for the villagers to experience a rebirtha new hope for life and peace. just as all hope is about to be lost, the village patriarch becomes inspired to hire samurai to protect them from their enemies. through this revelation, the villagers work as though everything depended upon them as they venture out into the world to search for trained samurai; in particular, hungry trained samurai. it is only when they unify themselves together as a body of desperate souls that they discover their will to live. when they find all seven samurai, they both rejoice and fear simultaneously; rejoice because they feel protected from their enemies; fearful because they are afraid of their saviors. in a way, it is as if god himself has come to protect them. their natural instinct, though, is to fear god due to their unworthiness. though the samurai are at first welcomed as plagues, they are later worshipped as gods. there are two beautiful moments shown by contrast that help demonstrate the villagers will to overcome death. the first is shown between the two village men who argue over losing the rice which would otherwise feed the samurai. a delicate shot is shown of the older man picking up what few kernels of rice there are to be salvaged from off the ground. it is symbolic of their desire to live despite what meager circumstances they are under. the second is of the samurais training the villagers to unite unselfishly together to battle the bandits. even the women and children are taught to defend themselves. this sequence demonstrates the unity to overcome death, for it is said by one samurai, ""individuals will die, but groups will survive!"" in essence, they are training the villagers to hold together during their times of struggle. after defeating the bandits and surviving death (for the most part), the villagers are reborn with an attitude of jubilation and hope. they are seen plowing in their fields singing and dancing as the remaining samurai who trained them look onwards.";26 January 2008;8;['earnest', 'distressed', 'solemn', 'about', 'direct', 'specific', 'like', 'old', 'gray', 'mature', 'en', 'particular', 'nearby', 'short', 'natural', 'small', 'necessary', 'lead', 'natural', 'rebirtha', 'new', 'about', 'particular', 'hungry', 'desperate', 'fearful', 'afraid', 'natural', 'beautiful', 'first', 'delicate', 'old', 'few', 'symbolic', 'meager', 'second', 'most'];-0.0283459595959595

198;varundelpiero;i've long heard of akira kurosawa's legendary status, but this is actually my first foray into his world. upon first viewing seven samurai i have to agree with many by saying that kurosawa is simply a masterful storyteller. first off, let's clear the air here: the picture is in black-and-white and it's not very 'stylish' by today's standards. it is for these reasons that many people seem to pass this movie over. however, after seeing it for myself, i must say that those aforementioned reasons should serve as no deterrent to film enthusiasts anywhere. the story itself is brilliant in its simplicity. there are three well-known main parts to the movie, namely the search, the training and preparation, and the standoff. the movie itself is about 210 minutes long, which allows kurosawa to fully develop three of the samurai to the point where the viewer begins to care rather deeply for them. one of the other samurai is somewhat 'half-developed', while the other three are relatively under-developed, but still possess more character than many of the so-called stars of today's 'blockbusters'. i'll admit, 210 minutes is quite a long time to watch a movie. the film even has an intermission (about 5 minutes long) after the first 130 minutes or so, but the intermission itself serves as a nuisance rather than a relief. reason being: this movie is extremely engrossing, and the time just flies by. the samurai themselves cannot be seen as generic hero types, but possess an array of 'anti-heroic' qualities. indeed, most (if not all) of the samurai have some sort of character or personality flaw that allows the viewer to relate to them more. many of the scenes in this film consist of epic, ground-breaking (at that time) shots. the battles are well-thought and very well-choreographed. the strategies used by both parties are intelligent and genuine. i especially liked the way that kurosawa attempts to capture all seven samurai in the same shot, and this is evident in the epic final scene. this movie is definitely one for the ages, and belongs up there with the likes of citizen kane. as evidenced by literature, it would seem that fine storytelling indeed withstands the test of time. this film is a true classic in very sense. a fine and epic motion picture. it is difficult to give this film 4 stars (out of 4) simply because i can't recommend it to everyone. i believe that many viewers will find the movie boring and unappealing. regardless, i believe that this film should be seen at least once, and as such deserves the highest accolade. 4 stars (out of 4). 9/10. should enter my top 100 at 85 or so. strongly recommended.;23 October 2008;9;['legendary', 'first', 'many', 'masterful', 'black', 'white', 'stylish', 'many', 'brilliant', 'main', 'other', 'other', 'more', 'many', 'long', 'long', 'first', 'engrossing', 'generic', 'anti', 'heroic', 'most', 'many', 'epic', 'choreographed', 'intelligent', 'genuine', 'same', 'evident', 'epic', 'final', 'fine', 'true', 'very', 'fine', 'epic', 'difficult', 'many', 'unappealing', 'least', 'such', 'high'];0.2658547008547008

202;Dark Eye;movie buffs often spoke about this movie with much reverence. why is this movie so great? i guess seven samurai is one of those films that has a rare magical touch, or that kurosawa is simply a genius when it comes to telling stories. wherever i go, nothing but praises have been bestowed upon this film. i have seen it several times since i first saw it a few years ago, and a friend of mine who normally avoids subtitled films have changed his opinion after he saw it. be prepared to get attached to the film's main characters because they are really cool, like kyuzo's steel-cold attitude and kikuchiyo's bravery as well as hilarious antics (played to perfection by toshiro mifune). seven samurai is kurosawa's legacy that has changed american filmmaking forever. there's a good reason why many american film makers are heavily influenced by this movie, and countless clones have been made (like magnificent seven) but none of them were even close to kurosawa's original.;1 May 2001;10;['much', 'great', 'rare', 'magical', 'several', 'few', 'prepared', 'main', 'cool', 'cold', 'hilarious', 'american', 'good', 'many', 'american', 'countless', 'magnificent', 'close', 'original'];0.2744791666666666

205;FANatic-10;one of the most influential films ever made, and still great almost 50 years after its premiere. seven samurai is such a rich film, in so many ways, that a simple description really can't do it justice. the photography and editing are utterly magnificent, every scene beautifully composed and lit. if you want to know what makes a film artful, just compare this film and every other merely proficient action film - you can see it immediately. kurosawa gives each character detail and life, making them real and complex, even the smallest roles. and there's not a subpar performance in the lot. i admit i found toshiro mifune a bit excessive at first as the animalistic, buffoonish kikuchiyo, but the character gains in power as the film proceeds, and there's no denying mifune's incredible physicality and intensity. his famous monologue about farmers, delivered with helmet askew, is stunning - extraordinary acting. the famed battle scenes at the end are unforgettably harsh and noisy and dirty. what's really amazing is that no stunt men were used, but real arrows were! i love the kineticism of the scenes, shot using kurosawa's famous 3 camera technique. in all the scenes of people running, the camera seems to speed up also to kick up the film's adrenaline. kurosawa also memorably pioneered the use of slow motion in some scenes to underscore the moment brilliantly. he does an amazing job of orchestrating the flow of the action throughout. i also loved the scene with rykichi's wife - kurosawa takes less than a minute's worth of screen time to produce one of the most eloquent and eerie bits of silent acting since the days of lillian gish. lyrical, rough, hilarious, heartbreaking, eloquent - i could supply an endless stream of adjectives. this is just a film everyone who cares about movies should see. the only time i mind a movie's length is when its a bad movie - this is possibly the best movie ever made, and every minute you spend watching it is well worth it!;8 August 2001;10;['influential', 'great', 'rich', 'many', 'simple', 'magnificent', 'artful', 'other', 'proficient', 'real', 'complex', 'small', 'subpar', 'excessive', 'buffoonish', 'incredible', 'famous', 'stunning', 'extraordinary', 'famed', 'harsh', 'noisy', 'dirty', 'amazing', 'real', 'famous', 'slow', 'amazing', 'less', 'eloquent', 'eerie', 'silent', 'lillian', 'lyrical', 'rough', 'hilarious', 'heartbreaking', 'eloquent', 'endless', 'only', 'bad', 'good', 'worth'];0.1583333333333333

215;dragonshield;"like probably everyone else who haven't seen this movie, i also had huge expectations on it. this is one of those movies which i was ashamed of not seeing, as it's still a classic in the history of motion pictures and the one of akira kurosawa's films that is described as ""a must-see"" for every movie freak there is. having an 8.8/10 rating and standing on the mighty 9th place at imdb's top 250 movies of all time -list it's pretty hard to watch it without having those huge expectations. the movie tells a story about a village which is constantly attacked and robbed by bandits. the village's eldest wise man suggests that the villagers should hire samurais, respected warriors, to defend the village, so some of the villagers leave their home to find samurais for the job. it doesn't take so much time until they find the ones, and these samurais form the group of the seven samurais, who each have their own personalities and ways of interacting. first of all, you really have to relate to the time when the movie was produced. it's nothing near the movies these days, it's completely different, obviously. i've watched a lot of japanese movies in the past and this is no exception when it comes to this certain style of this specific tension seen from the screen. i wouldn't say it's boring, but it's somehow tedious. i mean, the movie requires this certain mood for the viewer, so you can't really watch it like any other film. the tempo is slow and sometimes the scenes seem like they're too lengthened, which needs a lot of concentration and nerves, yet it's all worth it after all. the tempo of ""shichinin no samurai"" has this nice way of speeding up towards the end, so it gets faster and faster all the time, though there are some of those slow scenes between. i can't really describe those scenes in any other way than ""slow"", as it's really hard to explain it after all. over three hours of one movie is always pretty heavy, no matter what the movie itself was. this is a heavy movie, but that doesn't mean it wouldn't be worth watching. the music is these dark and gloomy orchestrations, which really fit in the main theme of the movie so well and though it doesn't include relaxed or soothing compositions it still is overall a great experience, composed by fumio hayasaka it builds up tension in a flowing way and it's sort of adapted in the exactly right places. it definitely has that 50's feel to it, but it's still original. one thing that immediately crosses your mind when the movie progresses itself is how incredibly well it's made considering when it is actually made. if you look at the 50's, there weren't any computers so cgi was obviously out of question. this basically means that everything you see on the screen is actually the real deal, everything that moves actually moves and everything that happens actually happens. this is what you have to pay attention to when you're watching the movie, as then you finally realise why it truly was such a big hit back then and why it immediately formed itself as a classic. a born legend some could say. the cinematography compliments the whole credibility the film offers for the viewer. it is a little bit different than japanese cinematography nowadays, but there's still that same feeling and emotion. to me as a fan of japanese cinematography ""shichinin no samurai"" didn't disappoint me; wide endless landscapes, those beautiful boundless hills and lands, it's honestly always a treat for you. japanese also tend to use so much more still shots than any other nation and that is one of the things that form that certain well-known feeling and emotion. when you really relate to the time the directing doesn't disappoint you either. it's no wonder people have been buzzing about this film for ages as it is indeed akira kurosawa's masterpiece, a real specimen of skill. the thing that surprised me though was that the role performances can actually be compared to role performances these days, in japanese films that is. the acting in this movie still has that certain anger, that somehow believable incredibility, that japanese original way of acting, which also can not be compared to any other nation. japanese films live in their own time and hopefully that'll always be the case, as when you're bored of hollywood you can always change to a different perspective; the japanese perspective. ""shichinin no samurai"" is timeless. it doesn't matter if you'd watch it even after 100 years from its release, it's a movie everyone should see, though it does require certain age from the viewer. this is not a movie for children after all as it's pretty violent too. having huge expectations on a movie always gets me so stressed and to be really honest i thought the movie would have been better. but as a person in my 20's what can you really expect from a movie made in the 50's? it's like eating the same cereals years after years and then suddenly changing to porridge with sugar and milk in it. it's like drinking a long drink and then changing to whiskey. the difference gap is just so huge. ""shichinin no samurai"" is a brilliant film if you can relate to the time, though it is pretty long-winded it does get better after a few days when you've seen it. you don't really ""get it"" at first, but just give yourself some time to repeat the events occurred in the movie and soon you see yourself perceiving the whole meaning of the movie, what's it all about and what it tries to tell you, the whole purpose of it. magnificent indeed.";28 June 2007;9;['huge', 'ashamed', 'mighty', 'top', 'hard', 'huge', 'eld', 'wise', 'respected', 'much', 'own', 'different', 'japanese', 'certain', 'specific', 'boring', 'tedious', 'certain', 'other', 'slow', 'worth', 'nice', 'fast', 'slow', 'other', 'slow', 'hard', 'heavy', 'heavy', 'worth', 'dark', 'gloomy', 'main', 'relaxed', 'great', 'right', 'original', 'real', 'big', 'whole', 'little', 'different', 'japanese', 'same', 'japanese', 'wide', 'endless', 'beautiful', 'boundless', 'more', 'other', 'certain', 'real', 'japanese', 'certain', 'believable', 'japanese', 'original', 'other', 'japanese', 'own', 'bored', 'different', 'japanese', 'timeless', 'certain', 'violent', 'huge', 'stressed', 'honest', 'well', 'same', 'long', 'huge', 'brilliant', 'well', 'few', 'whole', 'whole', 'magnificent'];0.1121761204481792

217;Teyss;"""seven samourai"" has become a reference in action genre, but is much more: a finely crafted, multi-level masterpiece. because there have already been many analyses on different aspects of this movie, the following review will focus on just one of them: how apparently simple features are actually very elaborate. theatrical acting the exaggerated play of some actors can be disconcerting. we know upfront how characters feel: emotions precede action, not the opposite. kurosawa pays tribute to japanese traditional theatre (kabuki), where acting and makeup can be very expressive. to put this expressiveness into perspective, kurosawa frequently introduces representations, where a crowd watches an important event, precisely as in a theatre: <ul><li>kambei kills the child kidnapper.</li><li>kyuzo defeats a samurai in duel.</li><li>kikuchiyo mounts a horse.</li><li>women see the final battle from inside.</li><li>repeatedly, farmers and samurais watch the bandits, who watch them.</li></ul> additionally, characters constantly gaze at each other: it seems one is playing a role, looking at others playing theirs and checking how others look how one is playing it. <ul><li>kambei and kikuchiyo intensely stare at each other the first time they meet.</li><li>katsushiro looks at everybody.</li><li>three samurais watch the bandits inside their lair.</li><li>kikuchiyo gawks at women.</li><li>kyuzo sees the two lovers under the rain.</li></ul> varied characters if there is a central character, it is the crazy kikuchiyo. <ul><li>on the surface, he appears to be a simple comic relief. however he represents the link between the three opposed environments: he is at the same time a samurai and a former farmer, and we feel he could have turned into a bandit under different circumstances.</li><li>he performs key actions: he drives the farmers out of their homes by ringing the alarm; he discovers the hidden samurai armoury; he makes a convincing speech on farmers and samurais; he plants the sword on top of heihachi's grave (a figure that will be repeated, and that composes the last frame of the movie); he steals a musket; he defeats the bandit chief who uses a musket and thus could have killed other samurais.</li><li>hence kikuchiyo is more complex than he originally seems. the scene when he hugs the abandoned baby and admits he lived the same fate, is gripping. kikuchiyo embodies instinct and as such is opposed to kambei, the mind (a frequent theme in kurosawa's films).</li></ul> characters are archetypal: samurais each have a distinct feature; farmers are immediately recognisable. in contrast, bandits are an anonymous, irresistible force: kurosawa was inspired by westerns of the period. interestingly, his film in turn influenced numerous westerns and other movies (see its connections section on imdb). individual &amp; collective history ""seven samurai"" depicts medieval japan, with its harsh conditions, social classes and their contrasting codes: samurais, farmers, city dwellers, bandits. as said, everybody fulfills their roles. conflicts between these classes abound, but also within each: samurais (kikuchiyo versus kambei), farmers (many arguments), bandits (two deserters get shot). we feel this world is changing. the grand samurai tradition, notably, is fading. <ul><li>all samurais except kikuchiyo are based on historical persons.</li><li>they always show high moral standards, challenged by the bandits and the farmers (cowardice, treachery). when the samurais want to spare the prisoner according to their ethics, the old woman and the village chief (experience and wisdom) override their decision.</li><li>samurais have a strong fighting etiquette, of which sabre is the emblem. revealingly, all four samurais are killed not by a traditional weapon, but by a gunshot: technology is changing the spirit of warfare. in a stupefying yet logical move, kyuzo, the perfect professional, throws his sabre angrily just before dying.</li><li>eventually ""the farmers have won, not us"", kambei bitterly admits. honour, courage and solidarity had their purpose, now is time for production, abundance and life. farmers sing when they plant the rice; it is sunny as it previously was when they harvested it: they represent future and hope.</li></ul> tailored style kurosawa remarkably adapts style to the action. just two examples. 1. the love story between katsushiro and shino unfolds progressively to offset tension and provides ravishing scenes: with limited length and dialogues, kurosawa beautifies their feelings. the first scene is a jewel. it starts as a bright dream where four of the five senses are fulfilled: katsushiro sees white flowers and moving leaves (subjective shot); he hears the flowing stream; he smells the flowers; he feels them under his back. desire (shino) barges into katsushiro's juvenile environment: he will then become a man. in the following chase, they go down a dark hill: an opposition emerges between the delightful flowers and music (pure emotions) versus the dark, low, entangled branches (lust, social taboo). they meet again amid the flowers, then under the rain, and finally at night among fires: while their first meetings were under the sign of water (stream, rain), the night they make love is under the sign of fire (superb shots of flame reflections over their bodies). all these scenes are gems sprinkled in the movie. 2. the final climatic battle is a tour-de-force, ground-breaking for the period and never equalled since. it is raining hard. fighters move heavily, fall, crawl, make pathetic movements to save their lives. they are drenched, frightened, exhausted, covered with mud. bandits make a disgusting sound when they die. editing is convulsive, images are confusing: we have trouble understanding what is happening, just as the fighters themselves. it is total chaos. this realism is very far from the heroic fights of curtiz or the choreographed ultra-violence of peckinpah and tarantino. there is no better demonstration that war is dreadful. last, the score admirably illustrates the story. each character type has a musical theme: samurais, farmers, women, elderly, bandits. an idea that has since been used in various films. the movie lasts for 3h30 but at no moment feels long. action, epic, emotions, values, harshness, humour, beauty: it has it all.";6 October 2016;10;['more', 'multi', 'level', 'many', 'different', 'following', 'simple', 'elaborate', 'theatrical', 'exaggerated', 'upfront', 'japanese', 'traditional', 'expressive', 'important', 'final', 'other', 'other', 'first', 'varied', 'central', 'crazy', 'simple', 'comic', 'same', 'former', 'different', 'key', 'convincing', 'last', 'other', 'complex', 'same', 'such', 'kambei', 'frequent', 'archetypal', 'distinct', 'recognisable', 'anonymous', 'irresistible', 'numerous', 'other', 'collective', 'medieval', 'harsh', 'social', 'many', 'grand', 'historical', 'high', 'moral', 'old', 'strong', 'traditional', 'stupefying', 'logical', 'perfect', 'sunny', 'shino', 'limited', 'first', 'bright', 'white', 'subjective', 'shino', 'juvenile', 'following', 'dark', 'delightful', 'pure', 'dark', 'low', 'social', 'first', 'superb', 'final', 'climatic', 'de', 'pathetic', 'frightened', 'disgusting', 'convulsive', 'confusing', 'total', 'heroic', 'choreographed', 'ultra', 'well', 'dreadful', 'last', 'musical', 'elderly', 'various', 'long', 'epic'];0.0719569471624266
218;monsterhunt-94296;alright so today i watched seven samurai, probably kurosawa's most well-known film, and for good reason. if you're thinking about watching this movie, it can be daunting for modern audiences. first off, it's 3 hours and 27 minutes long, secondly it's black and white, and thirdly it has subtitles. this film was not disappointing. it was actually very entertaining, and although there were point where you did feel the run time, for the majority of the film i was thoroughly entertained. there's comedy, there's drama, there's action, this movie has everything you look for in a film. the framing is incredible, the way kurosawa constantly has something new entering the frame or something exiting the frame is great, the depth showing the size of this world is great, and overall the cinematography just immerses you in the film. all of the characters are done so well, every conversation has so much entertainment value, the characters just bounce off each other so nicely. the acting here is also amazing, i don't think there was a point in the film where i remembered that these are just actors. the story here is honestly pretty simple, but it has a lot of impactful moments and leaves you really satisfied by the end. let me talk about the action in this movie for a second, because despite the fact this is a 1954 film, it has some of the best and most intense action i've ever seen. this is due to the fact there's not just explosions everywhere like a modern film would throw at you, but the action dives deep into the strategy behind the battle as each and every enemy killed has huge significance. one thing that i really liked about this movie was how much time was dedicated to character moments and set-up. a modern studio would shred the run time by an hour and shove in more action scenes. this movie doesn't have that much action for the first 2 hours, but all of it is important and all of it is entertaining. the score here is also really good, and i thought it added some nice personality to the film. i honestly just had a really great time watching this movie. i can't think of anything else to say at the moment, so i'll leave it at that. 9/10.;13 October 2020;9;['good', 'modern', 'black', 'white', 'disappointing', 'entertaining', 'run', 'incredible', 'new', 'great', 'great', 'much', 'other', 'amazing', 'simple', 'impactful', 'satisfied', 'good', 'intense', 'due', 'modern', 'huge', 'much', 'modern', 'more', 'much', 'first', 'important', 'entertaining', 'good', 'nice', 'great'];0.3544332210998878
219;Sisiutil;the seven samurai is a film so rich that, like the greatest poetry, it takes more than one viewing to mine its depths. at first glance, it's a deceptively simple action film set in feudal japan. the plot concerns some peasants, whose village is threatened by bandits, engaging some warriors to protect them. but repeated viewings reveal great depths to this film. it raises questions about class relations, militarism, and the wages of violence. i also don't think it's stretching it to see veiled references to japan's post-war reconstruction and relations with the west. (it can't be a coincidence that all the sumurai who die are killed by guns--a super-weapon imported from the west--rather than by swords.) rewatching the seven samurai also allows you to appreciate its masterful, dynamic cinematography--which still compares favourably to current hollywood action films. modern audiences may find the initial pacing slower than they're used to--but kurosawa never wastes a shot, and everything's in there for a reason. many of those reasons only become clear later in the film, and repeated viewings allow you to enjoy the skilled set-up that much more. it's no wonder this film continues to influence film-makers to this day.;3 January 2002;9;['rich', 'great', 'more', 'first', 'simple', 'feudal', 'great', 'post', 'war', 'super', 'masterful', 'dynamic', 'current', 'modern', 'initial', 'slow', 'many', 'clear', 'skilled', 'more'];0.3269607843137255

222;rjyelverton;the story at the center of seven samurai has been told many times since the film's release: a small village continually hounded by evil bandits sends men to the city to hire defenders. the defenders will seem to be not up to the task and the villagers will learn to find strength within themselves. the story has been repeated in the magnificent seven, a remake of this film, the three amigos, and a bug's life to name a few favorites. it's a strong core story and works because the looming threat of the bandits' return and the questionable strength of the defenders make for surefire suspense. samurai examines a rigid class structure and how conflict can temporarily throw this structure out of alignment. the samurai, the honored warrior class, do not socialize with the relatively low on the totem pole farmers. they serve noble families and are paid well, but an ongoing civil war has destabilized 16th century china and increased the likelihood that there will be samurai looking for work and food. the uncertain times bring the noble mercenaries and lowly farmer temporarily together. young samurai apprentice katsushiro will not surprisingly have a romance with the farmer's daughter. we expect as much. they will hide this romance from the girl's father, but not merely because he will disapprove of his daughter's indiscretion, but because it is an insult to the sacrosanct class structure. when the samurai is discovered, is his shame merely that of a man caught in a hidden affair or is it also due to his being caught in a dalliance below his station? preparation for the coming fight makes up a large portion of the film. director kurosawa does an excellent job of laying out the geography of the village as the samurai survey the land they will defend and attempt to discover its weak points. these scenes give the viewer a sense of geography and allow us to participate fully in the film's epic closing battle. we are right in the thick of the action and have a grasp of the strategy taking place. the care taken in preparing the viewer for the battle is refreshing. modern action film-making more often than not give an impression of tense battle with quick cuts of explosions or swords clashing accompanied by a heroic theme. we understand that chaos is taking place on an epic scope, but have no sense of what exactly is happening. kurosawa carefully orients the viewer and never loses you in the mayhem. the skirmish at the climax of this film is very small in size, but kurosawa still manages to create the sense of an epic battle. forty armored bandits, a few with firearms, will take on about a hundred villagers. but the stakes are high. the villagers if they lose will surely die. they are not trained warriors and there are not nearly enough samurai to defend the village. the final battle is one of the best ever filmed. deaths are sudden and brutal, but kurosawa does not linger over them. he rushes us on to the next heated skirmish. the unskilled villagers fight badly, but fight with intense hatred. they swarm in large groups and thrust wildly and clumsily with their makeshift spears. terrorized for years by the bandits, they act out with great fury when in battle. cutting between wide shots of the village and close ups of hooves falling and spears thrusting, kurosawa places us in the midst of the battle. the entire effect is thrilling and frequently disturbing. all of this is accomplished with no visible bloodshed. kurosawa like renoir also employs long takes and deep focus to great effect. in early scenes when the villagers are trying to recruit samurai,the director uses a combination of deep focus and forced perspective to underline the villagers' poverty. (forced perspective is utilized in the lord of the rings films to make the actors playing hobbits appear much smaller than others on screen.) the villagers can only pay their potential saviors in rice and their small, but essential, container of rice frequently dwarfs the villagers. every shot in the film is carefully composed and full of meaning. we wonder at kurosawa's camera that both serves story, but also moves with grace and agility. he films movement with such urgency and clarity. the film is not only notable for the prowess of kurosawa's direction, but also for the performances. toshiro mifune--the inspiration behind jon belushi's choleric saturday night live samurai--first appears to be the film's comic relief. he desires to be a samurai, but lacks the necessary refinement and bearing. but he proves to be a valuable morale booster. as the story continues, mifune develops a darker side to his character as the reasons for his lack of refinement emerge. takashi shimura, playing the samurai leader kambei shimada, lends his character the necessary gravity while at the same time providing the film's moral center. he is a great leader, but also a humanitarian willing to work for food in defense of the needy. seven samurai is a black and white film and features subtitles which have kept it from reaching a broader audience. it has also been done the honor and disservice of being labeled a masterpiece which lends it the impression of being stuffy and humorless. the film is, however, is an extremely enjoyable and engrossing action film. some would say it is the action film. it is sure to please both the film snob and average viewer.;15 December 2008;10;['many', 'small', 'evil', 'magnificent', 'few', 'strong', 'questionable', 'rigid', 'honored', 'low', 'noble', 'ongoing', 'civil', 'uncertain', 'noble', 'lowly', 'young', 'much', 'sacrosanct', 'hidden', 'due', 'large', 'excellent', 'weak', 'epic', 'right', 'refreshing', 'modern', 'tense', 'quick', 'heroic', 'epic', 'small', 'epic', 'armored', 'few', 'high', 'enough', 'final', 'good', 'sudden', 'brutal', 'next', 'heated', 'unskilled', 'intense', 'large', 'makeshift', 'great', 'wide', 'close', 'entire', 'disturbing', 'visible', 'long', 'deep', 'great', 'early', 'deep', 'small', 'potential', 'small', 'essential', 'full', 'such', 'notable', 'choleric', 'comic', 'necessary', 'valuable', 'dark', 'necessary', 'same', 'moral', 'great', 'humanitarian', 'willing', 'needy', 'black', 'white', 'broad', 'stuffy', 'enjoyable', 'sure', 'average'];0.1083848614072494

225;yellowtail_tuna;"in medieval japan, a village has suffered from the routine robbery of the bandits. in desperate, they resort to hiring samurais to fight against them. at first, it seems hopeless since all they can offer to samurais is food, not money or position. fortunately, they happen to meet kambei, an experienced samurai, who sympathizes with them and agrees to help them. kambei figures out they need to hire seven samurais in total. this recruitment part is quite interesting, introducing each samurai's character. my favorite is heihachi, who is not skillful as a samurai but is frank and friendly, ""the type of man valuable in such a difficult time"". soon they succeed to recruit five, largely because of kambei's respectable personality. in a hurry, they give up the recruitment at only six and set off to the village. but a strange man kikuchiyo, who claims to be a samurai but apparently not, tags along. he is vulgar and humorous and they gradually feel amused by him. they finally accept him as the seventh samurai. interestingly, seven samurai is not just about heroes protecting people from villains. while badly asking the samurais for help, the villagers show distrust of them. here we see the class conflict between samurais and peasants. and this is where kikuchiyo's role becomes significant when the would-be samurai is revealed to be born a peasant. the villagers naturally find him closer than the other samurais. they are gradually getting cooperative in the preparation and training, and finally, the bandits' attack begins. as for the direction, what makes the film powerful is, as other kurosawa films, the energetic movement. characters walk and run swiftly, and the camera chases them. the scenes where the crowd frantically moves back and forth are especially impressive. the battle scenes are exciting. it is not a battle of well-organized armed forces but of the quickly assembled samurai team and peasants wielding bamboo spears and the unsophisticated bandits. most of them are amateurs, and each person of the battle scenes feels his or her own fresh fear or excitement. the screenplay is full of insight, wit, and humor. characters are simple but charming. the plot is straightforward and compelling. it is a 207 minutes, black and white, and 50s classic film, but you don't have to be intimidated. seven samurai is so entertaining that you can easily understand why it is widely seen as one of the best films ever made.";18 October 2020;10;['medieval', 'routine', 'desperate', 'hopeless', 'experienced', 'kambei', 'interesting', 'heihachi', 'skillful', 'frank', 'friendly', 'valuable', 'difficult', 'respectable', 'strange', 'vulgar', 'humorous', 'seventh', 'significant', 'other', 'cooperative', 'powerful', 'other', 'energetic', 'impressive', 'exciting', 'armed', 'unsophisticated', 'most', 'own', 'fresh', 'full', 'simple', 'charming', 'straightforward', 'compelling', 'black', 'white', 'classic', 'entertaining', 'good'];0.2458333333333333

230;Nothinggrandproductions;seven samurai is a massive, ambitious and influential film that made many common plot elements today what they are. but, does that mean it's actually a great film? in my opinion, no, not so much. a decent one and an important one that everyone should watch but not necessarily a great one. the movie is long. much too long in my opinion. it's three hours and twenty minutes about, and never does that time seem totally worth it. the characters aren't very compelling which makes me have trouble with actually getting attached to the story itself even if it is interesting. none of the characters for the most part go beyond a surface level of character development which leads me to not caring about a whole lot that is going on. that's not to say the movie is awful. the movie is ambitious and is incredible especially for it's release date, i'm sure almost nothing of it's kind existed beforehand. the movie is massive as i stated before and is filled with many action set pieces that still hold up fairly well today. it is a period piece as well, taking place in 1587 in the warring states period of japan and seems to do a good job portraying samurai which are pretty much cool and interesting by default but that doesn't mean the characters themselves are good. a village of farmers goes to hire samurai to protect them from bandits, they hire a total of seven, if it wasn't obvious enough for the title. the plot is interesting and compelling but again, it doesn't really matter. i don't care about the people in the movie, at least for the most part. and that remains to be my biggest issue. a movie like this needs characters that i at least sort of care about. probably one of my biggest comparisons to this movie is the thin red line, a terrence malick movie which i really like terrence malick for the most part. it's a war movie that barely focuses on the characters so i don't really care about anything that is going on. i felt pretty much the same during this movie. overall, seven samurai is still a very important film and a mildly interesting one but that doesn't mean it needs to be held as one of the greatest films of all time like it is, because frankly, it doesn't hold up as well as everyone thinks.;27 October 2013;7;['massive', 'ambitious', 'influential', 'many', 'common', 'great', 'much', 'decent', 'important', 'great', 'long', 'worth', 'compelling', 'interesting', 'most', 'whole', 'awful', 'ambitious', 'incredible', 'sure', 'massive', 'many', 'good', 'cool', 'interesting', 'good', 'obvious', 'interesting', 'compelling', 'least', 'most', 'big', 'least', 'big', 'thin', 'red', 'most', 'same', 'important', 'interesting', 'great'];0.2632478632478632

233;ThatAnimeSnob;akira kurosawa's epic tale of the seven samurai is great on many aspects. at first it appears to be only about a bunch of unemployed mercenaries doing their job by defending a village from bandits. it quickly turns to a rather complicating interaction of ideals, social norms, and internal conflicts. although the bad guys (the bandits) remain generic enemies all the way, the samurais and the villagers are shown to be a lot more than the simple stereotype they begin as. there are lots of minor side stories that flesh them out and enrich the setting with a lot of gray overtones. the movie is not afraid to kill its characters, despite presenting them in a most heroic way. the death toll is high and it is interesting to see how almost all of them are killed by a rifle and not by a petty bandit's spear, which is a double way to show how great they are with the sword, as well as how all your talent means nothing before modern warfare. at the same time it does not leave the villagers to be nothing but passive spectators throughout the battle, as they are given the task to participate. along the way they are shown to be far more than stunts, as even they have secret agendas and minor problems of their own. even as far as action goes, the movie is still great, with the swordsmanship and the invasion of the riders, or the ambush in the forest being very well orchestrated, with believable fighting moves that never feel shallow poser nonsense. even during the non-action parts, the characters are acting very dynamically and expressively, instead of just standing still and talking. even the ending is basically bittersweet, as despite the losses and victories life goes on but the sadness of the realization of a never- ending struggle is just overbearing. p.s. the same tale has been remade throughout the years, the most famous of which are the cowboy version the magnificent seven (1960) and the sci-fi anime version samurai 7 (2004).;19 March 2013;7;['epic', 'great', 'many', 'unemployed', 'social', 'internal', 'bad', 'generic', 'more', 'simple', 'minor', 'gray', 'afraid', 'heroic', 'high', 'interesting', 'petty', 'double', 'great', 'modern', 'same', 'passive', 'more', 'secret', 'minor', 'own', 'great', 'believable', 'shallow', 'non', 'action', 'bittersweet', 'overbearing', 'same', 'famous', 'cowboy', 'magnificent'];0.2124137931034482

247;lucasaq-1;the kurosawa masterpiece that was remade as a classic western and is often referred to as one of the best movies ever made. kurosawa did everything right with this film. he developed characters we came to care for, gave us gritty scenes of violence, and gave us a look at hard life of farmers. each of the seven samurai is given a characteristic for which we love them. with kikuchiyo (play with a fever by toshiro mifune) we love his courage, and occasional wisdom while overlooking his hotheadedness, and occasional fits of insanity. perhaps some of us see some of ourselves in his tortured character who is often striving to try and prove himself. i know i have on occasion jumped into a situation before thinking through the consequences, and he (kikychiyo) tends to do it to during the course of the film. but his mistakes tend to be larger and the consequences often cost his friends their lives. there are many other likable characters in this film, but i think the true triumph of this film is the humanity of it. we see how the higher class be it samurai or bandit assume to treat the lower class in this instance the farmers. we see the similarities between them and the differences. while this film may be long, depending on which version you watch (i strongly recommend the 207 minutes long version), it is an excellent film which you will enjoy whether you prefer drama, or comedy, or action, or just films in general.;3 July 2007;10;['classic', 'good', 'right', 'gritty', 'hard', 'occasional', 'occasional', 'tortured', 'large', 'many', 'other', 'likable', 'true', 'high', 'low', 'long', 'long', 'excellent', 'general'];0.1894444444444444

255;fa-oy;"kurosawa is one of my favorite directors, i can always watch one of his films knowing that it won't disappoint me. if you ask anyone about kurosawa's best film, they'll probably tell you seven samurai is his masterpiece. although it is true that it is indeed a masterpiece, it's not my favorite film from him. the first time i watched this film, i didn't like it, due to its length. it would take more viewings to really appreciate its greatness. so when i read reviews complaining about its length, i understand them. i encourage everyone, though (mostly to those who found it boring because of its length), not to give up on this film, it really requires more viewings. and if you don't like it, there's nothing wrong with it, after all, you just can't like everything. this film can be divided into three parts: 1- the search for the seven samurai the villagers, being oppressed by bandits, decide to stand up and fight this time against them, so they go in search for samurai to help them in that task. this is my favorite part of the film, the recruitment of the seven samurai is one of the best things i've seen in a movie. 2.- the preparation for battle (against the bandits) the villagers, with the help of the seven samurai, start their preparation to defend their village and fight against the bandits. this part is also outstanding, the defense planning of the village is something to behold. 3.- the battle the bandits finally decide to attack the village, the great battle between the villagers and bandits takes place. the battle sequences are really impressive here, the astonishing kurosawa's camera-work allows you to behold the battle without missing a thing; you can see everything that's happening in the battlefield (mostly when the bandits enter inside the village). i know i didn't get into much plot detail, but i just needed to review this movie and let everybody know that they may not appreciate this film in the first viewing, although there are many that liked it in the first one.";13 September 2011;10;['favorite', 'good', 'true', 'favorite', 'first', 'more', 'boring', 'more', 'wrong', 'favorite', 'good', 'outstanding', 'great', 'impressive', 'astonishing', 'much', 'first', 'many', 'first'];0.3777777777777777
256;garydiamond;"it took me a very long time to get around to watching seven samurai in full. i had the dvd for nearly a year before i tried tackling the whole thing head-on. it really is hard to get away from the conditioning of dolby surround sound, full colour non-subtitled 90 minute pictures we're so used to now. but when i did, i was glad of it. lets forget the fact that this picture, much like citizen kane before it, set the standards which would come to be developed upon and eventually rendered to the point of cliche in every movie of the genre that would follow. lets forget it may not have the conventional bells and whistles of most pictures these days. what it does have is stylish direction, breathtaking acting and identifiable characterisation in spades. indeed, after the first hour, the body language said so much i needed only glance at the subtitles to follow the plot. my personal favourite actor is the first of the seven to be recruited, the restrained and noble elder who goes on to mold his ragtag bunch into a streamlined fighting force. the scene where he arranges for each samurai a reaction test before even speaking to them, is a highlight of the first hour of the film. the pace doesn't feel sluggish or rushed. there are no moments of exposition that feel over-elaborate or forced; everything is revealed in good time. like all great directors kurosawa knows how to make you live and breathe the atmosphere of the characters. rather than making the samurai and the townspeople they defend seem all-holy forces of good he introduces conflict, making them imperfect yet with pure motives that may transcend any shortcomings. overall, this is one picture that you could spend as long describing as you could watching. some may argue it has dated badly. although not every scene has the same impact as it did upon release, every single one counts and contributes to what, 53 years later, still stands as one of the greatest achievements of 20th century cinema. i just hope we don't have to wait until 2053 to see something that matches it in majesty and scope. 8/10";11 March 2008;8;['long', 'full', 'whole', 'hard', 'full', 'non', 'used', 'glad', 'much', 'conventional', 'most', 'stylish', 'identifiable', 'first', 'personal', 'favourite', 'first', 'restrained', 'noble', 'streamlined', 'first', 'sluggish', 'elaborate', 'good', 'great', 'holy', 'pure', 'same', 'single', 'great'];0.2867424242424242
257;Davor_Blazevic_1959;"though its biblical connotation is not the happiest one (""seven deadly sins"") number seven, omnipresent in our (7 days a) weekly cycles, seems to have been a lucky number in the world of cinema. several very solid and some great movies have this number in their title, starting with gag-wise incredibly inventive seven chances (1925) from genius of silent era buster keaton, frank borzage's silent version of classic melodrama 7th heaven (1927), walt disney's first feature-length animated movie, snowhite and seven dwarfs (1940), recognized as an instant classic and remained so ever after, stanley donen's ear-pleasing, eye-riveting musical seven brides for seven brothers (1954), staged in western milieu, with the breathtaking barn-raising dance sequence, ingmar bergman's literally death-defying, answers-to-reasons-for-human-misfortune-seeking masterpiece, det sjunde inseglet (""the seventh seal"") (1957), billy wilder's seven year itch (1957), a clever and amusing first collaboration with incomparable marilyn monroe (a worm-up for their second, bigger if not decisive step in taboos-of-the-motion-picture-production-code-breaking, brilliant comedy some like it hot (1959)), up to newer examples like david fincher's disturbing drama se7en (1995), one of the finest hollywood movies of the 90's, as well as tsui hark's chat gim (""seven swords"") (2005), a stunner in the department of action sequences from the often under-appreciated genre wuxia, originating from chinese literature. however, even among such illustrious examples of movie-making par excellence, one movie holds a special place, shichinin no samurai (""seven samurai"") (1954) from the legendary japanese director akira kurosawa. this movie doesn't seem to lack anything that an avid movie consumer, in particular samurai genre admirer, might be wishing for. it is not easy to say anything new about the one of the most analyzed and scrutinized movies of the film history. nevertheless, and despite being eventually only repeated, it shall be mentioned that movie has a simple but very engaging story - a group of peasants, representing a village, periodically stormed by gang of bandits, looting their crops and other possessions, hires several wandering ronins (masterless samurai) to help them protect the village - not without lucid observations on the possibility of social interaction between members of different classes during the almost seven centuries long feudal history (1185-1868) of japan. characterization is excellent, and though having clear stand-outs in samurai's true leader, kambei (takashi shimura), a wise tactician of the exceptional valor, as well as in the exuberantly uncontrollable kikuchiyo (toshiro mifune), messy in its appearance and blustering in its manner, yet, a peasant descendant himself, making for a perfect link between the samurai and their employers, all other samurai are memorable, as well, sporting wide variety of personality traits. in joining the village protection campaign, hired for nothing more than a regular meal for as long as providing a service, thus primarily hoping to finally fill their starving stomachs, each one of them was driven by different additional motives, whether they were challenged to test their bravery, fighting skills and tactics, seeking for excitement and recognition, trying to regain pride and glory of the past days, just reaching out for that human touch (cross-class communication, even mere courtship promising relationship) they have been deprived of, or simply interested in its noble cause. together with true highlights in realistically choreographed battle scenes, showing all the pain and misery of excessive violence on the reverse of heroism, that even defenders cannot avoid resorting to, sadly announcing inevitable decline of the samurai and their ways exposed to new artless technology, unbecomingly dying ambushed by distant shots from the muskets, while ingloriously stuck in the village muds... it all makes for a compelling narrative. though triumphant in their common task to protect the village, unlikely alliance between samurai and peasants is ultimately doomed to fail. in the short run, it gives expected results, but in the long run, does not stand the chance. that is so loudly, although in fact silently, expressed at the end, when peasants don't even care to join the surviving samurai in their mourning over the fallen ones, not even giving the last well deserved respect to those who have helped them withstand fierce attacks, prevail and ultimately defeat bandits, and, in doing so, most of them given their lives. peasants simply continue with their daily chores, while surviving samurai have to leave the village, like they have never existed, sadly symbolizing their ultimate destiny: slowly but surely stepping off the future pages of the history books. seven samurai, the movie, is rightfully considered as the one that has redefined samurai film in its contemporary perception, and dawned almost two decades long string of successes, instantly becoming the brightest example of thus revived, uniquely provocative and entertaining sub-genre, unknown as such in the country of its origin, classified there within a broader genre, jidaigeki (a period drama, often describing events from pre-modern era of the edo period, marking the governance of tokugawa shogunate (1603-1868), relatively peaceful times for japan's long history of civil wars, as opposed to gendaigeki, films treating contemporary matters), and by imdb standards, as an action drama, occasionally historical, when based on real events. originating in the edo-era far east, it has inspired equally successful, star-studded (y. brynner, s. mcqueen, c. bronson, j. coburn, e. wallach, r. vaughn, h. buchholz, b. dexter) hollywood remake, the magnificent seven (1960), conveniently situated in the u.s. west of 19th century, as well as three lesser sequels, return of...

271;TheWillVega;and surprisingly enough, this film does not feel outdated in anyway (except for the audio). i can see where all the hype is now, this is the movie that started a trend that continues even today. the multi character development, the small romantic storyline, the extremely exaggerated goof-ball character, the stone face serious warrior...almost everything. it was all started here, a simple japanese film, that went on to influence people like george lucas and sergio leone (maybe more so with yojimbo with leone) into making the best films ever witnessed in the 20th century. even anime also, the japanese animation art form, seems to have been influenced in some way by this film. yet its simple at its core, what gives the movie its critical acclaim is not because introduced these now common place plot and film elements...its because they did them well, very well in fact. so well its still watchable for many people today, not just a select few who grew up in that era or are interested in old school cinema. two things that impressed me the most were the sophisticated camera shots (very ahead of its time for a movie made in 1954) and the incredibly engaging characters. especially the characters, this movie wouldn't have even been half as good if it wasn't for five of the seven samurai (i wished the other two were developed as well as the other five, but i guess you can't have it all sometimes).;19 September 2006;8;['outdated', 'small', 'romantic', 'exaggerated', 'serious', 'simple', 'japanese', 'good', 'japanese', 'critical', 'common', 'watchable', 'many', 'select', 'few', 'interested', 'old', 'most', 'sophisticated', 'engaging', 'good', 'other', 'other'];0.0674603174603174

286;driffma;"it is hard to know exactly where to begin when talking about a film of such utter quality. what must be said at the start is that ""the seven samurai"" is flawless. it's characters are brought to life by some of the finest and most committed acting i have ever seen. it is a compelling story of courage, duty, honor, respect and change. i could echo roger ebert's commentary, in which he noted that kurosawa's film set the standard for the modern action film. it was he notes the first film to assemble a team of hardened men to undertake a mission. but i say read eberts review if you want to get his take. i have watched the film several times and what is truly amazing about ""the seven samurai"" is the way in which kurosawa choses to tell his tale, which is, i think, truly innovative and subtle. growing up on action fare as we have ""seven samurai"" should really hold no magic for us. we have the formula (in many forms) before. countless times. however it is not old to us and magic it carries. i make the case (now anyway) that this comes largely from kurosawa's knack, his amazing gift, for photographic composition. most filmmakers today in the action genre have some flare for flashy cinematography. we get sharp angles, dramatic poses (most favorably lighted), and fast cuts. i guess this is to involve us in the high emotion of the situation. but kurosawa has patience and while i think he gave the blocking of his shots, and their composition a great deal of thought, it comes across as if he did not. his camera moves as though it were simply following the characters through the story. the camera work in ""seven"" is so much more subtle and so much more compelling than almost any action fare today. his camera allows, we the viewer, to be, at various times, all of the major characters in the film. toshiro mifune's emotional explosion at his ""fellow"" samurai is probably the most obvious example of this. he gets up and at first appears to agree with the samurai sentiment that killing all of the villagers is a good idea, but when he turns and his anger is directed at them the scene and our place in it change. we are no longer passive viewers watching heated exchange between two factions. the angry toshiro is yelling at us, looking down at us. for we are looking up at him as his fellow samurai would see him. by the end of his out burst he angrily leaves the room but before he goes he turns slightly to look at us, but we don't see his face, for now we are looking (in one of the great shots of the film) at his feet. the samurai are ashamed and so are we because we identified with them at first and kurosawa had the guts to show us that we are wrong to do so. i could go on, and on about his film, but i leave you with this, watch it.";31 August 2001;10;['hard', 'such', 'utter', 'flawless', 'fine', 'committed', 'compelling', 'modern', 'first', 'several', 'amazing', 'innovative', 'subtle', 'many', 'countless', 'old', 'amazing', 'photographic', 'most', 'flashy', 'sharp', 'dramatic', 'fast', 'high', 'great', 'subtle', 'compelling', 'various', 'major', 'emotional', 'fellow', 'obvious', 'good', 'passive', 'heated', 'angry', 'fellow', 'out', 'great', 'ashamed', 'wrong'];0.1506818181818182

293;Clockwork_Orange55;"this original akira kurosawa's classic which trampled upon its remakes, is indeed one of the greatest films ever made. in all film lists discussed by experts, agreeable or not, ""seven samurai"" had mostly made in the first 10 position. the fact postulated the idea that ""seven samurai"" is still vital to world cinema, and from its highly influential plot devices to its strong filmmaking, and to its haunting ending, it is all perfect in its facets. set during the civil wars in japan in the 16th century, conflicts led villages to be vulnerable and be overran by bandits. they are about to raid a village and the news quickly being raised up to the elder (chief), in which he advises the villagers they should hire hungry samurai to defend themselves against the onslaught of the thieves, specifically stating ""even bears come down from mountains when they're hungry."" (this refers to the seven samurai.). ""seven samurai"" goes into depth depicting philosophical ideas, human nature and genuine human emotions. one of the sequences explores ronin (masterless samurai) kambei shimada's (takashi shimura) background, in which he speaks about him ambitions in his early days, but to be unfortunate when he did realise that he had spent too much time chasing his dreams but achieves nothing. perhaps the character was being directed or written not to articulate his emotions clearly, but through experiences we could comprehend that he is remorseful for his failures. another haunting moment is its ending, where the surviving inhabitants of the village completely shown to disregard the samurai, notwithstanding the seven heroes being their primary support. the notion is further accentuated with the closing line: ""in the end, we lost the battle toothe victory belongs to the peasants. not to us."" earlier, the villagers could already be seen as cold when they refuse to greet the samurai upon their arrival to the village, thus giving a cold reception. but there might be another theory for this; the villagers are actually afraid of the samurai exploits, which explains on why they beg off to go out from their hiding place, and face the samurai. ""seven samurai"" is a great tool for film students to look into character development. seven great characters, played by seven great actors, are regurgitated for good. in it we could discover unalike personalities, and each of them being explored accordingly throughout. even the relationship between the villagers and samurai is well developed. other than its strong writing and performances, its editing, cinematography and directing are all solid. more than five decades after its release, ""seven samurai"" still comes unscathed to serious viewers; such is the quality of it. and with the rehash of it that we witness today (""the magnificent seven"" is the most obvious one), we can say it is one of the most influential works of cinematic art. its withheld influence would suggest that kurosawa might have had done this for posterity. call it entertaining, but ""seven samurai"" is the epitome of movie masterpiece, no more no less.

302;drewconnor;"every fan of movies should see a kurosawa, and this is (along with yojimbo) the most accessible of his many great works. the film is an artistic and technical masterpiece, but above all it is a rousing adventure story, gripping and emotionally involving from the start. the origin of the film lies in an idea for a story kurosawa had about a samurai who made a tiny mistake and went home and committed suicide. told this wouldn't work, he and his writing team began researching the 16th century, and became interested in the fact that villagers would hire samurai as night guards to protect them from bandits, the samurai receiving food and lodging in return. this evolved into seven samurai, kurosawa's greatest jidai-geki (period drama), about desperate peasants who turn to professional warriors when bandits repeatedly raid their harvest. kurosawa draws fantastic performances from his cast, most notably takashi shimura (as the samurai leader kambei, the living embodiment of the samurai code) and toshiro mifune (as the peasant turned warrior, kikuchiyo), and marshals the elements for an astonishing climactic battle scene in the mud and the rain. this ten-minute sequence has to be seen to be believed; the images have a painterly quality (kurosawa trained in western-style painting) but are also extremely realistic, perfectly capturing the chaos of the battlefield as figures wade through the mire, hacking at each other. i've heard it remarked that this sequence was in spielberg's mind when he conceived the omaha beach landing scene in saving private ryan; and indeed, the use of grainy film stock, the slightly speeded-up movement and fast editing, and the depiction of war as utter chaos all seem rooted in kurosawa. a final word: do not be put off by the 190 minute running time or the fact that it is subtitled. although kurosawa has the reputation of an auteur, he was also a brilliant and influential storyteller. this is perhaps the most entertaining great movie ever made.";10 November 2013;10;['accessible', 'many', 'great', 'artistic', 'technical', 'tiny', 'interested', 'great', 'desperate', 'professional', 'fantastic', 'astonishing', 'climactic', 'painterly', 'western', 'realistic', 'other', 'private', 'grainy', 'fast', 'utter', 'final', 'brilliant', 'influential', 'entertaining', 'great'];0.2681818181818182

327;Speedy_Lube;"having recently viewed and reviewed citizen kane, i found myself with the prospect of not liking a single black and white film. since my confidence in my ability to review films fairly shouldn't depend on the color of a film, i was anxious to review a black and white film positively. i have found such a film. seven samurai. i had heard of it before, but never seen it. now i am glad i did. akira kurasowa's ""classic"" is truly on of the great treasures of cinema. an amazing cast of characters in one of the greatest and most enthralling plots, often repeated, but never with quite the skill of this one (see a bug's life, magnificent seven). i find it odd that many people call this an action film. such a title discredits seven samurai, because the word action has become so derogatory in recent decades. it is true this is a kind of war sotry, with great action to boot. but the strength of the film is not in the awesome battles or the well choreographed and well filmed action sequences. it is the large group of characters, each of which the audience cares about. and although these days many of the characters would be called stereotypes or archetypes, it is important to remember, that this is the film that made them so. seven samurai is the original. and it should be no surprise that so many films have copied it. kurosawa and the cast are all geniuses who make this film what it is. every single actor in the film is believable, inspiring, entertaining, and at the same time, fits in to the puzzle perfectly, knowing when to be noticed and when to not. the not-so-obvious star of the film, kurosawa's amazing talent for frame composition, brings it all together in a way that no other could, or should. i have only one regret for this film, the fact that it is in black and white. what a beautiful film it would be in color, as every shot is an artwork itself. everyone should see this film. not just because it has ""action"" or because it is a ""classic."" just because it is seven samurai.";21 July 2002;10;['single', 'black', 'white', 'anxious', 'black', 'white', 'glad', 'great', 'amazing', 'great', 'enthralling', 'magnificent', 'odd', 'many', 'derogatory', 'recent', 'true', 'great', 'awesome', 'choreographed', 'large', 'many', 'important', 'original', 'many', 'single', 'believable', 'inspiring', 'entertaining', 'same', 'obvious', 'amazing', 'other', 'black', 'white', 'beautiful'];0.3062049062049062
328;azuremorningsky;i had heard of seven samurai long before i ever saw the movie, which is not very surprising, few movies have such a high international reputation as seven samurai. after watching the film it was easy to see how the movie got its reputation. seven samurai has one of the most powerful plots i have seen in a movie and the story is by far the best of any film i have seen. the movie registers strongly on the emotional level, able to get across the determination and sacrifice the samurai feel as they give their all to protect the village from bandits as well as the grief the farmers feel when confronted by the danger of being annihilated. although it is a good movie there are a few cosmetic things that i feel could of been done differently. for instance seven samurai is one of the few samurai films that doesn't do much with the swordplay. although i may feel this way due to being used to long choreographed fights. secondly, the film could have trimmed out a little of the peasants wailing. the peasants tended to be over-dramatic in the film. from the very beginning the first scene with the villagers shows them crying after they discover the bandits plan to raid the village. later when they cannot find a samurai to help them they cry, when the villagers lose the rice they were going to pay the samurai with they cry. these are just a few examples there are many more, i understand that the director has to show that the farmers are defenseless and totally dependent on the samurai but i also feel that there are too many scenes with the peasants wailing, i think that the movie could have been more powerful emotionally if there were less crying scenes. to be fair my feelings may be due to the cultural divide. if you enjoy this film i would recommend the magnificent seven and yojimbo.;10 May 2010;10;['surprising', 'few', 'high', 'international', 'easy', 'powerful', 'good', 'emotional', 'able', 'good', 'few', 'cosmetic', 'few', 'much', 'due', 'little', 'dramatic', 'first', 'few', 'many', 'more', 'defenseless', 'dependent', 'many', 'powerful', 'fair', 'cultural', 'magnificent'];0.2158999999999999

332;r-downey1;it was just last mouth that i saw seven samurai for my first time after reading hundreds of other good fan comments about it on this site, so in the end i became far too curious about the film and had to watch it for myself to see what the great fuss was all about and i of course got the dvd. the first time i watched this work of art i was blown away with joy and amazement due to just how super director akira kurosawa's masterpiece really was and i only wished i had listened to everyone else's comments on the imdb site much sooner. in fact seven samurai was so good i had to watch it again the next night to get all the brilliant scenes of this epic tale into my mind forever. then i watched it again last saturday and only after viewing it for the third time do i feel worthy enough to comment on this early 1950's classic. well to start, the story is wonderful, the acting is truly outstanding, the japanesse locations are beautiful and the script is super. kurosawa is without doubt one of the greatest directors that ever lived! the story: i'm sure you're all familiar with the plot in seven samurai so i'll try not to go into too much detail. in sixteenth-century japan a poor farming village under threat from an evil gang of ruthless bandits whose only desire is to steal their rice and barley crops every year decide to hire seven poor and hungry samurai to help train and protect them. this quest however does not seem an easy one due to having no real money to pay the fighters. then they hire their first warrior the old but brave samurai kambei shimada who soon helps them find the other six strong men that they need. the farmers then head off back home to their village to await the arrival of their new guests. the next hour or so is great as we get to see the relationship between the farmers and samurai changing as they come to like each other much better and start to understand each others' differences. at first they are strangers who do not get along very well due to either, fear or misunderstanding each others' way of life. great story lines here! the acting: the actors in this film were truly outstanding as they each brought their character to life in an unbelievable way, as they delivered to us viewers many different humorous moments, exciting and gripping sequences and some very touching and emotional scenes. my favourite character from the movie was kikuchiyo the wacky member of the warriors group who was not quite a real samurai but appeared it was his dream to become one as he insisted in coming back to the farmers village with the other six samurai to prove them wrong about him. his character changes dramatically through the film as when we first see him he appears to be a comical person who enjoys drinking and looking for adventure, then in later scenes we start to feel for him as we learn all about his past and how similar his background once was to all of the farmers, then we see him fight bravely in the battle against the bandits, so we then realise just how worthy he is of the name samurai and of the respect of the others. wonderful performances from all the actors! the locations: the japanesse landscapes in the movie are beautiful and create a peaceful scene to the story plus with the help from brilliant directing we get to see them from lots of different angles. one of the most beautiful pieces of kurosawa's directing talents is when the samurai are travelling to the village and stop by a waterfall where they look down and see kikuchiyo jump into the stream below to catch a fish for his dinner. the script and directing: the writing for this film was excellent and really made it easy for us to understand all the characters. akira kurosawa is one of the best directors ever who did some great movies in the past but after seeing seven samurai there is no doubt in my mind that this was his all-time masterpiece. it's quite sad that he will not be making any more brilliant productions like this ever again. he is well up there with all the other world famous directors. overall: this was truly the masterpiece of its time in the 1950's and is still by far one of the best films ever made even to this very day. seven samurai has stepped up from being a movie that i was curious about to my 2nd favourite film of all time and would suggest to all fans of classic films to see it. overall seven samurai deserves nothing less than a full 10/10 gold stars. watch it as soon as you get the chance to!!!!!;21 April 2005;10;['last', 'first', 'other', 'good', 'curious', 'great', 'first', 'super', 'good', 'next', 'brilliant', 'epic', 'last', 'third', 'worthy', 'early', 'wonderful', 'outstanding', 'japanesse', 'beautiful', 'super', 'great', 'sure', 'familiar', 'much', 'sixteenth', 'poor', 'evil', 'ruthless', 'only', 'poor', 'hungry', 'easy', 'due', 'real', 'first', 'old', 'brave', 'other', 'strong', 'new', 'next', 'great', 'other', 'due', 'great', 'outstanding', 'unbelievable', 'many', 'different', 'humorous', 'exciting', 'touching', 'emotional', 'favourite', 'wacky', 'real', 'other', 'wrong', 'comical', 'later', 'similar', 'worthy', 'wonderful', 'beautiful', 'peaceful', 'brilliant', 'different', 'beautiful', 'excellent', 'easy', 'good', 'great', 'sad', 'brilliant', 'other', 'famous', 'good', 'very', 'curious', 'favourite', 'classic', 'less', 'full'];0.270423644338118

335;connorveenstra;it's difficult to describe seven samurai because firstly it's a movie that is best experienced knowing nothing about it. secondly, because it's so packed with things to talk about it's difficult to know where to start. the slow beginning and ridiculously long run time might turn some viewers off, but with enough patience you'll be rewarded with a rich, nuanced experience that few other movies can match. the film uses this slow, deliberate pace to flesh out the characters and explore the world in which they live until you're completely sucked in and invested. the camera work is fantastic, with every single shot being perfectly blocked, composed and lit. the costume and set design are all so perfect that you think you've just stepped into feudal japan. the acting from the entire cast is amazing and the action scenes are superbly epic. the characters are all well fleshed out (some more than others) and you root for all of them throughout the film. the themes are heavy and dramatic: honor, romance, the selfishness of human nature, deconstruction of the samurai myth. the movie might also have the greatest climax of any film in history, perfectly paying off the last three and a half hours you just spent sitting in your chair. seven samurai is a masterpiece of filmmaking and is everything a movie should be: simple but complex. entertaining yet not shallow. funny and dramatic. action-packed, yet slow. it's one for the ages that should've be missed.;3 November 2017;10;['difficult', 'packed', 'difficult', 'slow', 'enough', 'rich', 'nuanced', 'few', 'other', 'slow', 'deliberate', 'fantastic', 'single', 'perfect', 'feudal', 'entire', 'amazing', 'epic', 'more', 'heavy', 'dramatic', 'human', 'great', 'last', 'simple', 'complex', 'entertaining', 'shallow', 'funny', 'dramatic', 'slow'];0.0195767195767195

337;bross3;"there aren't many movies made as long ago as this one that don't seem dated at all. it helps that the movie takes place in 16th century japan (so there aren't cues such as cars or clothing to tip you off as to when it was made), but there is really very little that could be done to make this movie any better. kurosawa had all the necessary tools at his disposal. if this movie were made by hollywood (today) it would've been crammed into about 120 minutes, had a lot of gratuitous scenes of men being impaled with bright red guts spewing out, and there would have been at least one ""explicit"" sex scene. but none of that is really necessary for this great film and it is probably better without them. the violence seems very real and not fakey like in some other older movies. despite its length, this film was very gripping. midway through the first half i felt like it was going a bit slow, but it soon picked up and held me through the end. the general formula has been used so many times before that i knew full well how it was going to end, but despite the lack of surprises i felt very involved and riveted to the screen. this really wasn't a dialog-driven film, and i didn't feel like conversations were all that impressive, but this may be mostly to do with the fact that i was reading the subtitles and not natively understanding the japanese. the actors all play their parts well, and it is surprising that i was able to keep track of so many characters and not feel confused at all. it didn't feel convoluted. the reason this film was great when it was made, it is great today, and it will continue to be great in the future is the fact that it keys in on universal themes that will always be present: the archetypal good vs. evil, honor, war, relations between men and women, parents and children, wives and husbands, individuals and their communities, and even attitudes that groups of professions hold for each other (military vs. farmers, for example). i'm sure you can find many other themes to add to this list as you watch. i watched the 208 minute vhs version and haven't seen any others. i can't imagine that the 141 minute version can feel like a coherent whole.";8 November 1999;9;['many', 'such', 'little', 'necessary', 'gratuitous', 'bright', 'red', 'explicit', 'necessary', 'great', 'well', 'real', 'fakey', 'other', 'old', 'gripping', 'first', 'slow', 'general', 'many', 'full', 'involved', 'impressive', 'surprising', 'able', 'many', 'confused', 'convoluted', 'great', 'great', 'great', 'universal', 'present', 'archetypal', 'other', 'sure', 'many', 'other', 'coherent'];0.2662878787878787
338;JiaQiLi;"unfortunately, i can give ten stars the most. i think that a 10/10 is an understatement of this film's excellence. kurosawa does not choreograph major fights until the end of the film. however, he marvellously develops the character of each samurai and the peasants. ""seven samurai"" is a sophisticated film and it goes much deeper than the battle against bandits. samurai and peasants were drastically different classes in ancient japan. they did not and could not interact with each other. interestingly, kurosawa brings them together in ""seven samurai"". peasants fought off bandits in order to survive. samurai helped the bandits in pursuit for virtue and justice. what happened eventually? the seven samurai and the entire class were the ultimate losers. it gradually went extinct in japan. some of them lost their virtues and characters, becoming bandits. some of them could not find a lord and live as ronin (wandering samurai). peasants were the big winners. they continued to live their routine as is. were the peasants good? i do not believe so. they robbed samurai and stole weapons from them. they were so selfish that they only care for themselves. peasants living in houses on the other side of the river bank refused to evacuate. they were so narrow minded and near sighted that they were incapable of considering the need of the entire village. i can keep on writing about ""seven samurai"" (particularly the symbol and the meaning of guns) but i shall stop here. this film is truly classic. its characters, plot, and themes are so meticulously developed and presented that i do not experience a boring moment. each actor (e.g. toshiro mifune, takashi shimura) and actress plays excellent roles too. yes, it is three and a half hours long but i love every minute of it. if you think that you are a cinema lover, you must watch it. this film is old and it is black and white. however, it is so brilliant in all areas that many colour films cannot match. i strongly recommend people to purchase the dvd. criterion releases a new edition this september. it is expensive but it is worth the money.";19 December 2006;10;['major', 'sophisticated', 'deep', 'different', 'ancient', 'other', 'entire', 'ultimate', 'extinct', 'ronin', 'big', 'good', 'selfish', 'other', 'narrow', 'minded', 'sighted', 'incapable', 'entire', 'classic', 'boring', 'excellent', 'old', 'black', 'white', 'brilliant', 'many', 'new', 'expensive', 'worth'];0.0539545454545454

343;Eddie C.;"many film critics cite ""citizen kane"" as the best film ever made. although ""kane"" is a very good choice, an astute film student can learn just as much about the art of cinema from watching ""seven samurai"" and enjoy a much more exciting movie. i have seen this film many times on videotape and laserdisc. (god willing, i hope to get the dvd later this month.) while there are many things to praise about this film, i am expecially impressed with kurosawa's attention to character. how many times in american blockbusters do we see cardboard characters that seem less like real people than stereotypes? in this film, not only are each of the samurai distinct individuals, but the farmers are also real people too. they aren't just victims that need to be rescued--they take an active role in the defense of their village, and once battle-trained, are just as brave and heroic as the samurai. because kurosawa gives us the time to get to know the characters, each death affects us all the more. a final word about the actor toshiro mifune. when he died in 1997, many commentators called him the ""john wayne"" of japan. mifune would have been honored, but he was more gifted and versatile than wayne ever was. in this film, his character first seems like a buffoon--you almost wonder if ""kikuchiyo"" is supposed to be a comic relief for the other ""real"" samurai. but as the action get more serious, ""kikuchiyo"" changes and ones appreciation for mifune grows. there is a speech mifune makes about the nature of farmers and samurai that is so moving, it should have won him an academy award if this had been an english language film. as it stands, the loss belongs to the academy, not to toshiro.";6 January 1999;10;['many', 'good', 'good', 'astute', 'much', 'exciting', 'many', 'willing', 'many', 'impressed', 'many', 'american', 'less', 'real', 'distinct', 'real', 'active', 'brave', 'heroic', 'more', 'final', 'many', 'gifted', 'versatile', 'comic', 'other', 'real', 'serious', 'english'];0.3420138888888888

346;Hannibal_Chigurh;akira kurosawa is perhaps the most important director of all time. his work has inspired future directors, writers, and even genres of film. among his many cinematic triumphs, seven samurai reigns supreme. kurosawa took his love of john ford westerns and mixed the ideals presented in those films with the samurai culture that he is descended from. rather than draw from the noble myths that surround samurai, he used historical fact. samurai after the fall of the feudal system became no separate from thieves, rapists, and bandits. this is a far cry from the romantic tales associated with them (the same holds true for knights in the old world). the opens with bandits coming across a village that they recently raided. in order to maximize their loot, they decide to come back once the peasants have had time to grow more crops. the farmers know that the bandits will come and a small group vow to fight back. they travel to a nearby city looking for ronin (masterless samurai) to recruit to lead the farmers. the samurai must be willing to work for only rice, for the farmers can't pay and no glory can be gained from this. the farmers hope to find four. instead, seven volunteer for this fight. the most important are kambei (the wise and experienced sage), katsushiro (the youngest of the bunch and the only one whose dreams have not yet died), and kikuchiyo (the off-kilter fighter who technically is not invited to join the group). kikuchiyo is played by the incomparable toshiro mifune, who gives the character a wacky zaniness mixed with a heartfelt desire to be accepted. it is he who breaks the tension between the samurai and the peasants. farmers have learned to fear samurai, while the ronin are outraged that peasants kill samurai if they get the chance. kikuchiyo knows that the peasants do this because of all the atrocities that samurai have committed over the years. the action sequences in the last third of the film were the most epic action scenes of their time. it has proved the foundation of the action genre with a grand battle to defend the village. mifune swings his sword with such passion that in some places if you pause the film the blade disappears. while the film is 3 1/2 hours long, kurosawa presents the story in such a way that time flies. i've never seen a film that long that felt so short. the character development that the three main samurai and the peasants go through is astonishing. you actually care when someone dies because you've seen them for so long and you've gotten to know the characters in and out. killer action, even better acting, and masterful pacing and direction make this one of the ten best films you'll ever see.;26 October 2007;10;['important', 'future', 'many', 'cinematic', 'noble', 'historical', 'feudal', 'separate', 'far', 'romantic', 'same', 'true', 'old', 'more', 'small', 'nearby', 'ronin', 'masterless', 'willing', 'only', 'important', 'kambei', 'wise', 'experienced', 'young', 'only', 'incomparable', 'wacky', 'heartfelt', 'outraged', 'last', 'epic', 'grand', 'such', 'short', 'main', 'astonishing', 'masterful', 'good'];0.2277777777777777

353;londonscot2003;"akira kurosawa made ""seven samurai"" because he wanted to make a real ""jidai-geki,"" a real period-film that would present the past as meaningful, while also being an entertaining film. kurosawa considered ""rashomon,"" the film rightfully credited with making the west aware of the japanese cinema, with being neither. but in his attempt to make a truly ""realistic"" film, kurosawa redefined the conflict at the heart of japanese films. before ""seven samurai"" this conflict was that of love versus duty, where the central character is compelled by fate to sacrifice what he loves in the name of duty. in ""seven samurai"" the focus remains on duty, yet the conflict is now between the real and the pretended. calling yourself a samurai does not make you one, something proved time and time again in the film, from the test of skill turned deadly between kyuzo (seiji miyaguchi) and the tall samurai to the first appearance of kikuchiyo (toshiro mifune), with his stolen pedigree. like katshushiro (ko kimura), the youngster who wants to learn from the master, kambei (takashi shimura), the audience is educated as to the true nature of the samurai. for me this film deals with the heroic, albeit in realistic terms. i have shown the film in world literature classes, after students have read homer's ""iliad"" and as they begin reading cervantes' ""don quixote."" within that context, compared to the brutal arrogance of achilles and the gentle insanity of quixote, the heroic qualities of the seven samurai become clear. their inspiration extends to some of the villagers. manzo (kamatari fujiwara) is crazed with fear over the virtue of his daughter, shino (keiko tsushima), and rikichi (yoshio tsuchiya) fights to avenge the disgrace of his wife and his precipitating the death of heihachi (minoru chiaki), but it is the comic yohei (bokuzen hidari), who finds within himself the ability to fight, a die a tragic death, who is the true barometer for what the samurai mean to the village. but the greatest tragedy is that despite this most noble effort and the bodies buried in honor at the top of the village cemetery, this has been but a temporary union between the villagers and the samurai. when kambei declares, ""we have lost again,"" he redefines the battles: it was not to kill all the bandits, it was to find a true place in the world. yet we should have already known this, for the painful truth was driven home when kyuzo, the master swordsman, is gunned down from behind. no better proof is needed in this film of the bitter truth that the world is not fair. mifune is the maniacal spirit of this film, as the faux-samurai kikuchiyo, the dancing whirlwind whose emotions overwhelm everything including himself. but it is shimura as kambei, who embodies the mentor mentality with a minimum of effort, evoking more by rubbing his hand over his shaved head or giving a single piercing look than by any spoken dialogue. even in a strong ensemble these performances stand out, for clearly different reasons. to fully appreciate kurosawa's mastery in ""seven samurai"" you need to watch the film several times to better appreciate the way he constructs scenes, using contrasting images, evocative music and varying the length of cuts to affect tempo. for example, look carefully at how the early scene of the farmers searching the streets for samurai and the later sequence where katsushiro watches kyuzo and kikuchiyo waiting for the bandit scouts to return to their horses. both of these scenes are superb primers to kurosawa's style. for years we had to put with the 160-minute version of the film that was made for export, which was actually called ""the magnificent seven"" until john strugis's western remake. fortunately, ""seven samurai"" has been restored to full 208-minute glory, saved from being a lamentable cinematic tragedy on a par with ""greed,"" ""the magnificent ambersons,"" and ""ivan the terrible."" there is a sense in which ""seven samurai"" is truly my favorite film, because it was the one that instilled in me a love of cinema, of the craft and art of movie making, of compelling me to understand intellectually how kurosawa was skillfully manipulating my emotions. the final battle sequences, fought and filmed in a torrent of rain, exhausting characters and audience alike with its increasingly relentless tempo, is given its potency because of the human elements that have been established in all that has taken place before hand.

357;Danarella;"seven samurai opens with a group of bandits picking out a small village to rob and destroy. the village has been suffering and they do not have the capability to defend themselves. after much deliberation, some villagers insist that they need to hire samurai in order to survive. most of the men in the village are opposed, if only out of fear that their women will be stolen. director akira kurosawa does a fine job of creating the tension in the village and showing that they have no way out of their dilemma. he also does an interesting job of introducing the characters. the samurai are introduced one by one as the men beg for help. this section of the film is a little too long; because since the film is titled seven samurai, we know that the men are going to be able to get seven samurais to help them. after the samurais go to the village, they begin to train the villagers to protect their village and to forget about their individual belongings. this section is very well done and builds discord for the anticipation of the attack from the bandits. when the bandits finally attack in the last third of the film, the audience has connected with the characters. the problem with the characters is that some of the samurai look alike and their names are similar if you are unfamiliar with japanese names. the most notable part of the film is the set and costume design. the film seems to actually take place in a 15th century village. overall the film creates a fantastic plot arc with interesting character archetypes. there is a small love story underneath the main action story. seven samurai truly defines the term epic.";10 May 2010;10;['small', 'much', 'most', 'fine', 'interesting', 'little', 'long', 'able', 'individual', 'last', 'similar', 'unfamiliar', 'japanese', 'notable', 'set', 'fantastic', 'interesting', 'small', 'main'];0.1716145833333333
358;moviesdirectorarmy;akira kurosawa's infatuation for japanese culture is undeniably palpable, the majority of his films are period pieces that of which are usually based on tales of the samurai. in seven samurai kurosawa creates a rather simplistic story of domestic turmoil and the relations of men. akira kurosawa has firmly established himself as one of the most vital film makers in the history of cinema and seven samurai is not only his triumph but also a film that's constantly observed both by critics and directors alike as a reference on how an epic should be told. as grand as the battles are in seven samurai it's the character's eccentricities that will leave the viewer with a vicarious sense of subconscious ecstasy. my conclusion of seven samurai is this, a film of true beauty one that delicately balances it's tragic notion on post war with humour and subtlety in addition to that seven samurai speaks a universal language and deciphers the message of the foundations of friendship and courage.;20 September 2006;10;['japanese', 'palpable', 'simplistic', 'domestic', 'vital', 'grand', 'vicarious', 'subconscious', 'true', 'tragic', 'universal'];-0.03

361;cutsman-2;"is there any movie more epic than this? clocking in at three and a half hours, kurosawa's tale of samurais assisting a ""helpless"" village is a masterpiece. the story itself is rather simple but doesn't lack depth. it serves as an entrance into the lives of the people you will spend the next 3 and 1/2 hours with. a village of farmers is continually attacked by a group of bandits, robbing them of their crops. the villagers get the idea to hire samurai to protect them from the bandits. they cannot pay much, a place to stay and a bowl of rice a day, but a group of samurai still go to help the village, seven to be exact. there they create plans of attack and train the villagers. when the bandits do finally show up it is a battle to the death. now there is a bit more going on here, but if you're going to invest in the film you don't want to be spoiled. the story is like a classic western, which of course we all know it was remade into the magnificent seven, but unlike earlier westerns during hollywood's golden age, this samurai's have depth. each individual warrior has his own motivations, personalities, and outlooks on life. which is important because this film is rather pessimistic. there is an air of distrust that lingers throughout the movie, a feeling of unwelcome from both the villagers and the samurai. this was probably on purpose as kurosawa was likely showing the strains in class during that era. the action sequences in the film are outstanding; they have a kinetic energy to them but flow. flow like poetry, unlike the jarring jump cuts of today's films, kurosawa lets the camera linger and you get the sense of training and mastery of the samurai. one slight problem is that the film's best action sequence is in the first thirty minutes, leaving you waiting the rest of the film for a sequence that matches it. overall, there really shouldn't be any doubt that you need to see this movie. if you love film, you must watch seven samurai.";1 May 2010;10;['epic', 'helpless', 'simple', 'next', 'much', 'exact', 'classic', 'magnificent', 'early', 'golden', 'individual', 'own', 'important', 'pessimistic', 'unwelcome', 'outstanding', 'kinetic', 'jarring', 'slight', 'good', 'first'];0.28

370;zoemadson;"let me ask you a quick question: when you're watching a movie, what's the first thing you notice or look for? acting? lighting? color? shots? shapes? all of these are just naming a few great elements of what makes a movie so special, as there's plenty more out there that i probably left out, but those are mostly the key ones that some film makers choice when making a movie. but when i watch a movie, the first thing i look for is hidden quality, storytelling by the characters movements, acting, lighting, and the use of silence to add emotion to a scene. and yes, this movie absolutely has all of those things i love in movies and much more. i think i died and went to movie heaven. sometimes when i talk about a beloved movie that many film makers and critics out there consider a ""masterpiece"", i think it's very important for me to talk about the actual film making and what makes it so great, as this gives a better thought of what i see when i watched the movie. i mean, it's much better than saying what you like or didn't about a film without talking about the film making itself. oh and this also my first akira kurosawa movie i've watched and reviewed, so there's that. i've heard nothing but amazing things about kurosawa movies and how every famous director has put him up there as the best director that has ever lived, and i totally understand why, because akira kurosawa is one of the most stylish, influential, and one of the most tremendous film maker that has ever lived. from start till finish, i was completely in awed from what i was watching and it's still fresh in my mind as i'm writing this. for kurosawa's film career, he has made over 30 films and a few tv movies, but ""seven samurai"" seems to be the one movie that everyone knows about (even if there haven't seen it). and i understand why, as everything with the camera work, editing transitions, and the use of mother nature as an emotional trigger for the audience, is everything that an audience can emotional relate to and draw their eye to. because the choices of weather used in scenes that basically sums up what kind of mood a character or a scene itself is feeling. wind, sunshine, and rain, really do add a lot to the scene, as you can tell what you're suppose to be feeling. akira kurosawa was quite famous for how he wanted to get the weather perfect in his scenes. over a course of a year, he shot this movie for 148 days and it was often him waiting for the weather for the next scene. and that's not all, kurosawa told his actors to chose a gesture for their character and stick with it. that way, we know exactly what kind person their are and how they're feeling. it's bold film making like this is what made akira kurosawa a massive influence to cinema today. another thing i loved about this movie is the characters, as i actually did care for them and their struggle. i sometimes find it very hard to have a full emotional attachment to characters in movies, but here, it amazes me how i know so much from the characters just by their movements that really dose say a lot without them saying anything. all the praise has to go to the actors for this, as it was them who had to deliver and they absolutely do. i'm unaware with all of these actors, but then again, i don't watch that much black and white japans movies these days. all of the cast were all superb in their roles and most have been a very different cult challenge to pull off, because it's not easy as it looks, but all of them nailed it. the camera work in this movie is so impressive, so unique, and freaking glorious. the way the camera moves tells a story of itself that doesn't require any character to spill out the story or what's going on. i could show any scenes from this movie to someone who hasn't see the movie themselves and even they will have a full grasp on whats going or how someone is feeling without knowing nothing about the movie itself. that's how brilliant this movie. overall: seven samurai is a epic masterpiece with flawless imagery and a unique style of violence and battles. i can not wait to see kurosawa other movies, as i have a feeling i'm going to love them.";25 November 2021;10;['quick', 'first', 'few', 'great', 'special', 'key', 'first', 'more', 'beloved', 'many', 'important', 'actual', 'great', 'well', 'well', 'first', 'amazing', 'famous', 'good', 'stylish', 'influential', 'tremendous', 'awed', 'fresh', 'few', 'emotional', 'emotional', 'famous', 'perfect', 'next', 'kind', 'bold', 'massive', 'hard', 'full', 'emotional', 'unaware', 'much', 'black', 'white', 'most', 'different', 'easy', 'impressive', 'unique', 'glorious', 'full', 'brilliant', 'epic', 'flawless', 'unique', 'other'];0.3240683229813665
371;Imaginist;"synopsis: ""seven samurai"" is the story of seven samurais (duh) who are hired by poor farmers to protect their village from pillaging bandits. this is akira kurosawa's finest film and it is probably the first modern action flick ever made. the film begins quite slowly as we watch several farmers recruit samurai warriors to come to their aid. this takes up the first half of the three hour long movie, and at times it can become a bit boring. however, this phase of the film is absolutely necessary. it allows kurosawa to introduce each of his beloved characters and flush them out in full detail. as soon as the viewer starts to wonder where all the supposed ""action"" is, he is delighted to find that the last half of the feature is an extravagant battle between the forces of good (the samurais and villagers) and evil (the bandits). it is here that kurosawa really shows his skill. he invents the ""final climatic battle sequence"" that we see in every action film made after this one. the battle is a rush, and because we know and love the characters we can truly appreciate the conflict; we worry about their well-being. as one might have guessed, the heroes are successful and the small village survives the siege, but it is not without a heavy price: there are many who die. of course, we only care for the heroes who die, not for the villains. we scarcely know these marauding bandits; they are simply nameless enemies. at first, one might see this as a weakness in the story. it appears to be a simplistic way of looking at the world: only the good guys are human and the evil folks are just mindless minions. however, i believe that this is an appropriate choice on kurosawa's part. although it is true that the people we often label as villainous or evil have a good side to them, this film's purpose is to focus solely on heroic individuals. this is kurosawa's tribute to the selfless and perhaps reluctant hero. ""seven samurai"" is a cinematic masterpiece. kurosawa masterfully blends characters, story, camera techniques (every shot is carefully constructed and adequately done), and music to create one of the most influential films ever conceived. kurosawa is a true master of his craft and this is his tour-de-force.

374;Shnorg2342;seven samurai is one of the best epics ever made, and some consider it to be the first action movie. while that may not necessarily be the case, it definitely invented many stereotypes now common in action films, such as the wide old leader, the brash rogue, the funny one who lifts the teams moral, the silent skilled one, and so on. this film was a pioneer in terms of story structure, character structure, cinematography, and editing. the film is about a village, and their solution to one of the citizens overhearing bandits plans to attack them come harvest season. plagued with this issue, the member of the village consult the village elder. he tells them that in his time, the villages that were able to afford samurai protectors survived. the village is very poor, and can only pay the samurais in food and shelter. this means they have to rely on those samurai kind enough, or starving enough, to risk there lives for food. they end up with seven samurai, as the title suggests. 4/7 are very inexperienced. after the samurais train the villagers in the art of war, a few battles commence. during these battles many bandits, villagers, and 4 of the samurai lose their lives. it is a grim tale. 2 of the samurai are old friends, who fought in the army together. it is mentioned at the beginning of the film that they never won a battle, but somehow they both managed to survive. the movie ends with one of these two's grim realization that the same has happened here. only the 2 war buddies and one's apprentice survived. it is also realized that while many villagers won, the samurai were doomed to lose either way.;24 November 2019;9;['good', 'first', 'many', 'common', 'such', 'wide', 'old', 'funny', 'moral', 'silent', 'skilled', 'able', 'poor', 'inexperienced', 'few', 'many', 'grim', 'old', 'grim', 'same', 'many'];0.0380952380952381

381;talexander12599;seven samurai is a japanese historical drama from 1954. it was written and directed by akira kurosawa (yojimbo, rashomon, ran). it was also written by shinobu hashimoto (rashomon, ikiru, throne of blood) and hideo oguni (ran, tora! tora! tora!, ikiru). it stars takashi shimura (ikiru, rashomon, throne of blood), toshiro mifune (rashomon, yojimbo, throne of blood) and isao kimura (high and low, ikiru, stray dog). seven samurai is about the samurai (takashi shimura, toshiro mifune, isao kimura) hired to protect a small village from oncoming raiders and how they prepare the town and ultimately fight for it. akira kurosawa is one of the most famous of all foreign directors for a reason. he has a way of composing his shots that is like no other. every image in this film is a painting. his ability to truly put you in 16th century japan is far superior to the hollywood directors attempting to make an epic period piece. watch this film if you want to see what japan used to not only be like but felt like. i feel if takashi shimura wasn't japanese but american and had the same amount of talent he would be spoken in the same breath as jimmy stewart, paul newman and many other incredible 50's actors. it's a shame he isn't that recognized because his talent is incredible. i don't speak japanese but this man transcends language. in this film, you believe every aspect about him and all of his small mannerisms. he truly feels like a real person. why i do think this is a really good film and everybody should watch it, i feel as if it is slightly overrated. many filmmakers declare this as one of the best films of all time, i wouldn't consider it in the top 50. it is a bit too long (3 and a half hours), and could definitely use some cutting. this doesn't mean it is necessarily boring and maybe i just don't fully understand it and will take a few more viewings to understand. however i do still highly admire this film and you should spend a day and watch it.;5 October 2015;8;['japanese', 'historical', 'oguni', 'high', 'low', 'small', 'oncoming', 'famous', 'foreign', 'other', 'superior', 'epic', 'japanese', 'same', 'same', 'many', 'other', 'incredible', 'incredible', 'japanese', 'small', 'real', 'good', 'overrated', 'many', 'good', 'top', 'long', 'boring', 'few', 'more'];0.179074074074074
382;Kanadiz;"the seven samurai is an example of film making at its highest level. it is the first film i've seen of akira kurosawa; i saw it for the first time in my first year of college. it's also the first film that comes to mind when i think of kurosawa and not to mention akira kurosawa is one of my all-time favorite directors. it is also the film that at he will be remembered for. the story begins in japan in the early 1600's with a poor town being robed, raped and murdered by bandits. the bandits then come to the town again but decide to visit the town when the barley has fully grown. one of the town members finds out it's going to be robbed again and of course tells the town the disturbing news. the town of course is absolutely terrified and are in a state of panic and don't know what to do. some wish to just give the bandits their food and beg them to leave them enough food to last them the winter. some wish to kill themselves since they cannot stand this life of sorrow and pain. but a few wish to take a stand and fight back. they then take it up with the eldest member of the town and agrees to fight back but since they are farmers and do not know how to fight, he tells them to hire samurai. but the town is a very poor town so he tells the people to find 'hungry' samurai, samurai that will work for a sum of three meals a day. this film is so exquisitely made that it ranks as possibly one of the greatest films ever made. it has such superb scenes especially the final battle scenes in the heavy rain, such beauty on screen words cannot describe. there is also another beautiful sad scene where the two leading actors kambei & kikuchiyo (takashi shimura & toshiro mifune) find a mother who has been murdered but she has saved her new born son and kikuchiyo holds the boy and starts to cry ""this is me this is exactly what happened to me!"" that scene always brings tears to my eyes. like many other kurosawa film, it has inspired other films such as he terrific western remake of this film (the american version of 'the seven samurai') called 'the magnificent seven' from 1960 which is also a great film. it stared yul brynner and the great steve mcqueen in the role that made him a star. the film also to some extent influenced 'the 13th warrior' as well as it also shares the main idea of hiring men to save a town, in this case, vikings and one arab. i have also heard that steven spielberg, one of our finest directors who gave us such masterpieces as 'schindler's list', 'raiders of the lost ark' and many others watches this film every time he sets out to make a film of his own, along with three other great films, 'lawrence of arabia', 'the searchers' & 'it's a wonderful life'. it's a script like this that makes a film like this a real treasure in any genre and it's directors like akira kurosawa that turn a film into something worth cherishing the rest of your life.";11 June 2008;9;['high', 'first', 'first', 'first', 'first', 'favorite', 'early', 'poor', 'disturbing', 'terrified', 'enough', 'few', 'eld', 'poor', 'hungry', 'great', 'such', 'superb', 'final', 'heavy', 'such', 'beautiful', 'sad', 'new', 'many', 'other', 'other', 'such', 'terrific', 'western', 'american', 'magnificent', 'great', 'great', 'main', 'fine', 'such', 'many', 'own', 'other', 'great', 'wonderful', 'real', 'worth'];0.2251174242424242
383;KiltsMcGee;"you want samurai? we've got seven of them and they're all recognisable and nuanced in their own memorable way. as a side-note, i literally just looked up what the plural of the word samurai was because i just wasn't sure. the embarrassing thing is that i really should have been sure considering i spent three and a half hours watching a film whose title has the pluralised form of samurai displayed for the world to see. clearly, i am not an observant person. i am not opposed to films being long as long as all the scenes within them at least seem necessary to the plot and characters. when your film has a black screen that says, 'intermission' on it, it's safe to say that you are pushing it a little. with a run time of 206 minutes kurosawa's epic lives up to that weighty noun. while i could criticise it for being over-bloated, almost all the scenes were necessary to making the film what it is. the film has three long phases. the first phase is the formation of the titular samurai boy band of death in their quest to protect a village of farmers from a barrage of bandits. each of the characters has ample screen time devoted to them (which considering the amount of time available to assign). they are all full to brim with character; an important trait when considering the film is pre-colour. with the power to use colour to immediately recognise the characters stolen from the film, it is forced to use physical mannerisms to show which character is which at a glance that and silly hairstyles. i have never really understood japan to its full extent and hopefully never will. throughout the film, the statuses, jobs and relationships of farmers and samurai are given. it was made very clear exactly the context of these historical occupations and how they interact with one another. i always thought that samurai were the knights of feudal japan. it seems, however, that they are more akin to today's mercenaries. the way that the contextual statuses are woven within the film adds to how believable the film is. i was taken by how little these characters seemed like actors playing roles and rather actual samurai. it is important to mention the runtime once more. i know i may be lingering slightly but so did the movie so take it up with akira kurosawa. i you were using this review as a recommendation and weren't expecting a gargantuan epic; i honestly couldn't recommend this film to you. while it was an enjoyable story, it is not a film that i will ever willingly return to. there are huge pacing issues making the film often drag a black and white cinematic parachute. i would recommend you watch this film once. mainly so that you can show off that you watched a 3+ hour film that isn't any of the hobbit films (this is a much better film than any of those). the characters are some of the best put on film in history and the story is dense with plot. however, it did very well to deter me from a second viewing.";17 May 2015;7;['recognisable', 'own', 'memorable', 'sure', 'embarrassing', 'sure', 'pluralised', 'observant', 'least', 'necessary', 'black', 'safe', 'little', 'weighty', 'necessary', 'long', 'first', 'titular', 'ample', 'available', 'full', 'important', 'pre', 'physical', 'silly', 'full', 'clear', 'historical', 'feudal', 'akin', 'contextual', 'believable', 'little', 'actual', 'important', 'gargantuan', 'enjoyable', 'huge', 'black', 'white', 'cinematic', 'well', 'good', 'dense', 'second'];0.1648989898989899

392;kelshawd;"in 16th century japan, civil war has broken out and farm land is under siege by bandits. the farmer cries out: ""is there no god to protect us?"" the farmer is born to suffer. fed up, they seek advice from the old sage of the village, ""grand dad,"" and he advises seeking help from samurai and gaining retaliation against the bandits. the samurai hired are men of a certain attainment of character, which is obvious, since the farmers have so little to offer as recompense. in spite of their faith in the samurai, the safety of the village women is suspect in the presence of these seven men. traditionally, as warriors, they are rumored to enamor women, seduce them, and then leave. when the warriors come to town, they are introduced to the patriarch. one sneaks off to sound a false alarm of intrusion to expose the double sided agenda of the towns people. they want protection, but cannot entirely trust these men. even as the samurai train the village men in the ways of warfare, there is an outburst from one farmer about the prevailing class differences between peasants and the seven who are of noble descent. kikuchiyo, the one warrior of somewhat questionable motive (as evidenced by his flagrant disrespect toward others and disregard for the traditional somber wisdom a warrior must carry himself with, and lack of documentation attesting his pedigree nobility,) discovers the women the farmers have tried to hide. eventually, all are preparing for war. three bandits scouting the village are captured and the leader of samurai unsuccessfully tries to stop the villagers from torturing them, once again illustrating the sentiment for humanity that the samurai class was said to be lacking. three samurai warriors and some farmers then case the bandits' camp, and rikuchi (who has heretofore been tight lipped about his personal life) is discovered to have a spouse who is living with the villains. this foreshadows other emotional scars soon to be revealed. kikuchiyo declares he is like the orphan baby he holds among the mill house ruins, a victim of the same criminal element when he was a child. he disguises himself as a bandit, infiltrates their forces and steals a weapon, just as another warrior did. but he is chastised for it, once again revealing the double standard between nobility and peasant class. manjo, who's daughter, shino has fallen in love with a warrior, insults them by disowning her once he discovers she has had relations with katshuro, the youngest. al last, the farmers and samurai win the battle. but in the end, ""the winners are the farmers, not us."" the samurai, who were historically denounced from noble class status, were exploited as a police force for the weak, bearing the prejudice from their own past abuses toward their society. kurosawa's storyline is elemental. it is superficial and holding to only its essential dramatic elements without the depth and weight of symbolism he is known for in later films. why? he makes room for developing the various and sundry political statements he only pointed at in roshomon. the film is sociology (the caste of noblemen vs. peasants), feminism (a woman disguising herself as a male out of her father's false pride for her honor,) and cultural relativity (the good guys have some bad in them and the bad guys have some good,) all in one. the farmers are the victims and the samurai are the heroes at arm's length, until the heroes beat the villain. then the farmers are the victors and the samurai are again set aside. it's pulp compared to throne of blood and ran. i give it a 6.5";26 September 2006;7;['civil', 'old', 'grand', 'certain', 'obvious', 'little', 'suspect', 'false', 'double', 'sided', 'noble', 'questionable', 'disrespect', 'traditional', 'somber', 'pedigree', 'personal', 'other', 'emotional', 'same', 'criminal', 'double', 'young', 'noble', 'weak', 'own', 'elemental', 'superficial', 'essential', 'dramatic', 'later', 'various', 'sundry', 'political', 'false', 'cultural', 'good', 'bad', 'bad', 'good'];-0.0002112135176651

396;The_Fear;"seven samurai is widely considered one of, if not the greatest film of all time. recently, i purchased the 3-disc criterion dvd set and am very pleased with it, but i'll get into that briefly in a little while. the film is 207 minutes (as you can see above) and that may seem like a daunting ""task"" for some and i myself was worried that it would be overlong, packed with fluff and at times, boring. man, was i ever wrong. in foreign films it is often hard, at least in my opinion, to gauge how well an actor performs because we do not speak the language. so much of the performance is in the delivery of the lines that the effect is sometimes greatly lowered. not here though, the performances are so great that it doesn't matter whether or not you understand what they are saying. everyone is very good here, but the main praise has to go to our seven samurai. everything they do, every emotion they give is 100% believable. you really grow to care about them through the movie, which is very important in any movie. the farmers are good as well. some not as good as others but there isn't anyone that was bad or bogged the film down in any way. the music is really great. sometimes it seems like it doesn't go well with the scenes (it can be a little funky at times but you will realize that is goes perfect with the scene. later in the movie, the ""funkiness"" dissipates and the music is subtle at times and loud at others but it always is perfect. fumio hayasaka should be very proud of what he did (well, if he were still alive that is. sadly, he died just one year after this movie was released). now, normally black and white movies, as i've found, don't have veryinteresting cinematography to say the least. it's normally point and shoot. now, i'm sure that isn't the case with all black and white movies, but the ones i've seen are just plain. this however, is amazing. there is always something going on. be it a stream flowing, horses moving, people walking, flags waving or water wheels moving, there is always something moving and it makes the movie that much more interesting. everything is filmed in such a beautiful way and the black and white image just enhances it. i personally feel that it would be impossible for this movie to be as great as it is if it were to be in color. now, the dvd is from criterion and it is my first dvd from them. from what i hear, they make the best dvd's. they make them for film buffs. everything about them is as perfect as they can be. that said, this is an amazing first criterion dvd. the image is absolutely stunning, even though it was made in 1954 and wasn't preserved all too well. there is little grain to be found, even in the dark night scenes (the black levels are superb). the sound is as good as your going to get but the picture will floor you. the set comes with a great booklet and some features i haven't yet had a chance to check out. this is a superb dvd set and i cannot recommend it enough, even at $35, which some people might balk at (shame on you!). what else is there to say about seven samurai that hasn't been said yet over the 53 years since its release. three and a half hours may seem like a long time to be watching a movie, but the movie couldn't have gone on long enough. i was completely engrossed in this world and this is a movie experience i will never have again, at least not a first time. as i stated earlier, many people consider this to be the greatest film put to celluloid. i happen to be in that camp. it blends every genre to complete perfection. there are breathtaking action scenes (the rain fight at the end is utterly amazing, but don't think that this is an all out action movie, action doesn't really start until a while into the film but it doesn't matter, it keeps you captivated throughout), hilarious comedy bits that still hold up after all these years (hence the ""hilarious"" bit), suspense, drama and even a hint of romance (not a ton though). while it is not my favorite film of all time (it's sure as hell way up there though), it is quite simply the greatest film i have ever set my eyes upon.";24 February 2007;10;['great', 'pleased', 'little', 'worried', 'overlong', 'boring', 'wrong', 'foreign', 'hard', 'least', 'much', 'great', 'good', 'main', 'important', 'good', 'good', 'bad', 'great', 'little', 'funky', 'perfect', 'subtle', 'loud', 'perfect', 'proud', 'alive', 'black', 'white', 'least', 'sure', 'black', 'white', 'plain', 'amazing', 'interesting', 'beautiful', 'black', 'white', 'impossible', 'great', 'first', 'good', 'perfect', 'amazing', 'first', 'stunning', 'little', 'dark', 'black', 'superb', 'good', 'great', 'superb', 'long', 'least', 'first', 'many', 'great', 'amazing', 'hilarious', 'hilarious', 'favorite', 'sure', 'great'];0.2853532396565183
397;butler-britney;wow what an epic. it was a little difficult to get over the 207 minutes of the film and the slow pace of it. once that barrier was broken the film was extremely entertaining. akira kurosawa was definitely a visionary that created an influential film. kurosawa was often looked at for delivering the vision of classic japanese culture, and it was done through his films. shichinin no samurai (seven samurai, akira kurosawa, japan 1954, 207 min.) is a film that achieved success on so many levels. seven samurai is about a poor town that hires seven samurai to protect them from bandits. each samurai represents an archetype which allows for almost every audience member to identify with at least one character. my personal favorite was the sword master kyuzo played by seiji miyaguchi. throughout the entire movie japanese culture is beautiful illustrated with stunning visuals and comedic dialogue. i am actually extremely impressed with the director of photography and editor of the film. the long shots, and the extended amount of editing that had to occur for that length of a movie is beyond extraordinary. there is no doubt in any mind that has seen this film, that seven samurai is very literally an epic film that will continue influencing cinema gloabally throughout time.;4 May 2010;9;['little', 'difficult', 'slow', 'entertaining', 'influential', 'classic', 'japanese', 'many', 'poor', 'personal', 'seiji', 'entire', 'japanese', 'beautiful', 'stunning', 'comedic', 'impressed', 'long', 'extended', 'extraordinary', 'epic'];0.1477941176470588

421;bryan-mconnor;so many words come to mind in describing akira kurosawa's epic action drama seven samurai. this is filmmaking at its very best. this is an expertly crafted film that is grand in scope and delivers the ultimate viewing experience for the cinema buff. the plot is simple, yet the execution is immaculate, with great directing, wonderful pacing and great action scenes. the film combines elements of a drama and action film very well and there's enough going for this film to make it stand out as a definitive classic of cinema. akira kurosawa is a master of cinema, one of the greats and he has proved that with this outstanding work. this film is not for everyone as it is nearly four hours long and it focuses more on telling a compelling story than focusing on action. with that said, seven samurai is a beautiful picture that some great performances and is among the best foreign films ever made. what is surprising about this film is that director kurosawa is able to pull off such a grand film using such a simple idea. the result is outstanding. filmed in beautiful black and white, seven samurai is an epic picture that would influence films for many years to come. with this picture, akira kurosawa created new ideas that would be seen in many future releases. the reason that this film is so good is because the film relies more on performances and storytelling to entertain the viewer and it does that in spades. if you're not into epics or hate slow-paced movies, then this is not a film for you. however if you want to watch one of the defining works in cinema history, regardless, seven samurai is definitely essential viewing. this for me is one of the first grand epics of the 1950's and other would soon follow such as the ten commandments and ben-hur. seven samurai is long, granted, but you can't deny its impact on cinema, and with that said, it's a masterful picture that is breathtaking from start to finish.;14 December 2013;10;['many', 'epic', 'good', 'grand', 'ultimate', 'simple', 'immaculate', 'great', 'wonderful', 'great', 'enough', 'definitive', 'outstanding', 'long', 'compelling', 'beautiful', 'great', 'good', 'foreign', 'surprising', 'able', 'grand', 'simple', 'outstanding', 'beautiful', 'black', 'white', 'epic', 'many', 'new', 'many', 'future', 'good', 'defining', 'essential', 'first', 'grand', 'other', 'such', 'long', 'masterful'];0.3623604465709728
422;aerovertice;"seven samurai is an artistic action flick, if that makes any sense. it is made by one of the most revered and legendary film-makers of all time: akira kurosawa. kurosawa is one of those rare film makers who can strike a wonderful balance between art and entertainment, and no movie of his displays that fact better than seven samurai. seven samurai is the story of a group of seven samurai (maybe not exactly seven) who are hired by farmers to defend their village from the marauding bandits. it is set in 16th century japan, period in history when feudalism was breaking apart, and many of the formerly employed samurai were out on the streets, roaming around as free ronins. many samurai adopted the role of bandits and took to pillaging villages. it is against this backdrop that seven samurai is set, and as a result, it is able to touch upon a lot of the issues of social conflict between the farmers and the samurai; as it ironically turns out, the samurai are both the perpetrators and the protectors of the villagers. although set against a serious social backdrop, the movie is, nevertheless, filled with humor and thrilling excitement. the plot is extremely involving; as an audience member, you feel as though you are right there with the others, as though you are the eighth samurai, taking part in all the mapping and the planning. the characters are all very diverse and complement each other perfectly. the star of the show, however, is kikuchiyo, played by toshiro mifune, who lights up the screen with his clownish antics; although a seeming lunatic, he turns out to be the string that binds all the elements together, not just within the groupof samurai, but also within the entire village. running at a whopping 3 hours, the length may discourage some from viewing seven samurai, but trust me, as you watch this movie, time will fly by.";3 May 2010;10;['artistic', 'revered', 'legendary', 'rare', 'wonderful', 'well', 'many', 'free', 'many', 'able', 'social', 'serious', 'social', 'eighth', 'diverse', 'other', 'clownish', 'groupof', 'entire', 'whopping'];0.3185897435897435

""what military strategist tells his/her army to drink sake and have sex the night before the final battle?"" this is a soldier having to lead nonprofessionals in combat - townsmen who have become aware that tomorrow's battle may be their last. to deny this of them would be to make a mockery of their whole existence; and the samurai is their to affirm their existence. ""how omnipotent the samurai were to foresee all the enemy's activities so completely....all except the last soldier making it into the barn with all the women folk?"" i remember absolutely no attempted demonstration of ""omnipotence"" in this film. the samurai leader is making reasonable strategic and tactical presumptions; that's what strategy and tactics are all about. what military strategist would not know this? and what human being is so perfect as to avoid mistakes? ""they could construct spears and elaborate fences, but not more bow and arrows?"" bow fighting in rapid combat is an art; it takes time and patience to learn. when we watch the one samurai who uses the bow and arrow in the final battle, notice how much care he has to take - and yet he's supposed to magically transform the villagers into expert archers in a few days?! - please. ""did they not know to kill or maim the horses underneath the bandits rather than reaching way up to hit the soldiers themselves?"" if you had paid attention to the movie, you would have noticed that everybody but the bandits walk. horses were not plentiful at this time in japanese history, they were worth their weight in gold; killing them would be a folly. riding rapidly is also an art; the scene where the captured horses are used demonstrates this clearly. thus capturing all the horses (besides requiring a bloody battle in and of itself) would have been futile, since only a handful would know how to ride, and only the samurai would know how to ride in combat. ""did the bandits not know how to cut their losses and look for the next easy-pickings village for plundering?"" maybe - if they weren't literally starving - a point made twice in the film. the samurai agree to defend the village for a few bowls of rice - this tells us that japan is in a sorry state economically in the era of this setting. alainsane wants this film to be a bogus action fantasy, where all human elements have been reduced, where all that matters is hack-'n'-slash and pretty girls and the latest hunk flexing muscles. instead, what kurosawa has given us is a magnificent historical commentary on desperate people in desperate times - even the bandits earn a little sympathy, if only for their tenaciousness and bravado in the face of death. this is a film about people - not about cartoons. it's about real history, not about some pubescent fantasy of power. it's about choice, and the ability to remain true to one's self - to learn who one really is, and to live that person to the fullest, even with death near at hand. this about life well-lived, regardless of the trouble and sorrow that brings. a work of heroic dimensions; viewers open to it will feel the richer for it.";28 October 2006;10;['little', 'historical', 'military', 'final', 'aware', 'last', 'whole', 'omnipotent', 'last', 'reasonable', 'strategic', 'tactical', 'military', 'human', 'perfect', 'elaborate', 'rapid', 'final', 'much', 'expert', 'few', 'plentiful', 'japanese', 'worth', 'bloody', 'futile', 'next', 'easy', 'few', 'sorry', 'bogus', 'human', 'pretty', 'late', 'magnificent', 'historical', 'desperate', 'desperate', 'little', 'real', 'pubescent', 'true', 'full', 'heroic', 'open', 'rich'];0.0684684684684684

428;Nuada7;"seven samurai is easily one of the greatest epic movies you can find on shelves today, and that's before you consider the fact that it is (as of this commentary) half a century old. one of this film's biggest claims to fame in western society is that the spaghetti western ""the magnificent seven"" was based completely around it, which is saddening as this is truly one of akira kurosawa's best works. a classic among classics, one must keep several things in mind when watching this movie to fully grasp how good it is. first of all, don't forget that this movie was made in the 1950's. don't expect flashy special effects, explosions, blood and gore, or a huge symphonic opening number in thx. they didn't have computers to help editing go perfectly, and fancier transitions (wipes, fades, dissolves, etc.) had to be done by hand, cutting the film up and putting it all back together. it's not up to today's standards, but it is by no means poorly or carelessly done. next, remember that this was filmed in japan less than a decade after the end of world war ii, with the country having been decimated by the most destructive weapon ever actually used in war. the japanese economy wasn't exactly at its peak. the film didn't have the multi-millions of dollars that are budgeted for action movies today, but it is still seamlessly beautiful. lastly (off the top of my head)--and most important of all these--don't go comparing this movie to others you may have seen and think ""oh, they got that shot from such-and-such"". no they didn't. this is a true original, and various camera angles, filming styles, scenery setups, plot traits, character traits, and many, many other details of cinema are still mimicked after this film. this is, at least in part, the very foundation for a huge portion of spaghetti westerns, late westerns, and action movies. a rare and beautiful 10/10. watch this movie.";1 October 2003;10;['great', 'epic', 'old', 'big', 'western', 'western', 'magnificent', 'good', 'several', 'good', 'flashy', 'special', 'huge', 'symphonic', 'fancy', 'less', 'destructive', 'japanese', 'multi', 'beautiful', 'important', 'such', 'such', 'true', 'original', 'various', 'filming', 'many', 'many', 'other', 'least', 'very', 'huge', 'late', 'rare', 'beautiful'];0.2196927803379416

442;fakeatbeingasnob;what can i say? it's one viewed as one of the best films of all time for a reason. honestly the movies biggest weakness is the reputation it has gathered. very few films are as revered as this one so people go in with expectations so astronomically high they walk out disappointed. just read some of the lower reviews. however i am happy to say that seven samurai was able to live up to the hype for me. it is beautifully shot and acted. i cared about every single one of the characters. each samurai is distinct and memorable and you sympathize with the villagers. it is a movie i believe i will enjoy more and more with each subsequent viewing. the movie is long at 3 1/2 hours but i was able to watch it in one sitting no problem. the movie is also surprisingly heartwarming and had many great comedic moments. the chemistry between the actors was great and the way kurusowa handles the films themes is respectable. now then, why didn't i give this a perfect 10 out of 10. well a few factors went into play. the first being that there were some moments of overacting. this takes place mostly in the beginning. for the most part, the acting was spectacular and even the scenes that were a little over the top did not take me out of the film. however that does not change the fact that those scenes exist second, the stabbing does look rather fake. you cannot really blame the movie for this considering when it was made. the choreography was spectacular. better than a lot of movies today. but when people were stabbed it did not look very real. and that is it. those are my only problems with the movie and i should add that they really did not bother me at all. i found it very easy to forgive them considering the time the movie was made, how much the movie did right, and because i was so hooked start to finish by the story that i quickly forgot about them. alot of people complain that they felt the run time of the movie. while this wasn't an issue for me i could totally see how others can be put of by the long run time. even people that loved the movies just struggle sitting down for long periods of time and there is nothing wrong with that. i watched this movie on hbo max and they kept the intermission which takes place an hour and a half into the movie. so if you are a person that struggles with long run times just know that there is an intermission. that should help you focus your attention on the movie instead of clicking of to see how much time is left. you can take a break or just come back and finish it the next day. do not listen to snobby a-holes who say there is only one way to enjoy the film. the most important thing is for you to walk in with reasonable expectations. i am not saying for you to be easier on the film because it was released in the 50's. this is the case for all films. how many recent films have you seen that you were disappointed because it didn't live up to the hype? if you are able to do that, i have a hard time imagining that you wont love this movie?;3 February 2021;9;['good', 'big', 'few', 'high', 'disappointed', 'low', 'happy', 'able', 'single', 'distinct', 'memorable', 'more', 'subsequent', 'long', 'able', 'many', 'great', 'comedic', 'great', 'respectable', 'perfect', 'few', 'first', 'most', 'spectacular', 'little', 'second', 'fake', 'spectacular', 'well', 'real', 'only', 'easy', 'much', 'hooked', 'run', 'long', 'long', 'wrong', 'long', 'much', 'next', 'important', 'reasonable', 'easy', 'many', 'recent', 'able', 'hard'];0.2157225913621262

446;russian-movie-fan;so whats all the hype about this movie? i've watched literally thousands of movies in my life and decided to see this one. well, in 2008 its dated and very quaint. there are two impressive things about the movie that today's audiences will appreciate. 1) the use of camera close-ups on faces to accentuate plot points and tense scenes. 2) the use of camera to film action sequences in the last 30 minutes of the movie. those are the best things in the movie and were revolutionary in its time. so for historical purposes, one can argue that this was important. however, these two novel techniques don't overshadow the fact that the movie is slow in its pacing, runs much too long with quite a few irrelevant scenes (the girl-boy in the woods scenes are out of place). in fact, another problem with this movie, is that for western audiences much of the context surrounding the life of the samurai and japanese life are simply absent. without any historical knowledge one is left w/many questions about the actions of the characters in the movie and the motives behind them. in short, it is a good movie that you should watch once for its historical significance, but there is not much that you can take away from it (as a modern viewer). there are too many action movies that have come along that are much better filmed and more captivating than this movie. like a one-shot wonder resting on his laurels, this movie keeps getting more famous as the years go by for some novel features that it introduced. although captivating for its time, by today's standards this piece of cinema is simply good but not great.;22 May 2008;8;['dated', 'impressive', 'close', 'tense', 'last', 'good', 'revolutionary', 'historical', 'important', 'novel', 'slow', 'long', 'few', 'irrelevant', 'western', 'much', 'japanese', 'absent', 'historical', 'w', 'many', 'short', 'good', 'historical', 'much', 'modern', 'many', 'captivating', 'famous', 'good', 'great'];0.222463768115942

451;django822;"clocking in at just under four hours with not a scrap of filler, kurosawa's the seven samurai is every bit as legendary at its enthusiasts would have you believe. the basic story is extremely simple. in a period of social chaos, a small farming village learns it will once more be attacked by a band of thirty bandits after the harvest. at first the farmers despair, but village elder gisaku (kokuten kodo) recalls that in his childhood a similar village met a similar situation by hiring samurai to defend them. the villagers accordingly send representatives to the city, where they are able to convince samurai kambei shimada (takashi shimura) to undertake the defense. if the plot sounds familiar, it should: hollywood would translate it into the extremely popular 1960 western the magnificent seven--but fine though that film is, it pales beside the seven samurai, which effectively turns an action film premise into a character study of the first order and endows the story with both tremendous simplicity and artistry. much of this is due an extraordinary ensemble cast, which includes the celebrated toshiro mifune (who would later appear in kurosawa's throne of blood and yojimbo); above this, however, is kurosawa's remarkable vision that draws upon the visual motif of the circle. the circle is a powerful presence in samurai. the village is presented as a roughly circular pattern of houses; the farmers meet in circles; in due time the samurai enter the circle and stand at the center of the circle, directing the defense--and indeed the circle will become the defense, as shimada works to find means to draw the bandits into the circle and to their doom. shot in simple black and white, as much (if not more) a detailed character and culture study as it is an action film, the seven samurai is extremely simple and yet extremely subtle, and ultimately one of the most powerful films it has been my pleasure to review. the quality of the criterion dvd transfer is very good, but by no means flawless--although it survives well, the film has not been digitally restored, and artifacts are frequent. there is little in the way of bonus material, but the commentary by michael jeck is quite fine. strongly recommended.";15 January 2014;10;['legendary', 'basic', 'simple', 'social', 'small', 'eld', 'similar', 'similar', 'able', 'familiar', 'popular', 'western', 'magnificent', 'fine', 'first', 'tremendous', 'much', 'due', 'extraordinary', 'ensemble', 'celebrated', 'remarkable', 'visual', 'powerful', 'circular', 'due', 'simple', 'black', 'white', 'much', 'more', 'detailed', 'simple', 'subtle', 'powerful', 'good', 'frequent', 'little', 'fine'];0.2197303921568627

462;sdfsdfsdf;seven samurai is an over-hyped film that doesn't deserve to be in the top 10 imdb movies. i'm astounded by the number of people voting 10 ?! that aside, i can certainly recommend it for viewers interested in historical battles, eastern culture and hollywood free entertainment. i can't agree with other reviewers that it's an action movie, it's more of an adventure with action sequences. the strong points of the movie include great cinematography, good casting, nice locations. everything looks authentic and real. the main story is interesting as well, although this brings me to the execution of the main idea, the biggest weakness of the movie: the script. in the script, logic is often sacrificed for style: <ul><li>not all samurai have convincing motivations for joining the quest (gorobei and especially kyuzo)</li></ul> <ul><li>the bandits should have withdrawn after incurring heavy casualties, but that of course doesn't make a great dramatic ending...</li></ul> <ul><li>none of the bandits kill anyone with a sword which is strange, but could be an underlying message ?</li></ul> <ul><li>too quick reload times for a medieval gun</li></ul> editing issues: <ul><li>gorobei's death isn't shown</li></ul> <ul><li>the pacing is sometimes slow, many scenes could have been shortened, some cut (eg. farmer scenes in the town at the beginning, shino-katsushiro scenes)</li></ul> technical issues: <ul><li>it is painfully obvious that no one is really ever stabbed or cut</li></ul> <ul><li>most peasants wore headpieces instead of actually shaving</li></ul> miscellaneous issues include occasional overacting, eastern-style juvenile attempts at humor (like in most kung fu films). all in all an enjoyable adventure that tries just a bit too hard to be an epic of some sorts. 7/10;20 July 2005;7;['top', 'astounded', 'interested', 'historical', 'eastern', 'free', 'other', 'more', 'strong', 'great', 'good', 'nice', 'authentic', 'real', 'main', 'interesting', 'main', 'big', 'heavy', 'great', 'dramatic', 'strange', 'underlying', 'quick', 'medieval', 'slow', 'many', 'shino', 'technical', 'obvious', 'most', 'miscellaneous', 'occasional', 'eastern', 'juvenile', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'hard'];0.2284946236559139

464;salfamily;"the archetypal action film, seven samurai is also one of the richest works to ever be committed to celluloid. each of its characters is extraordinarily realized; each has his or her own arc, his or her own vital part to play in the film's slow progression towards its dramatic finale. typically, kurosawa has put the film together using an exceeding degree of artistry; each and every shot, each action sequence, is exquisitely composed; and yet none seems contrived or out-of-place within the overall fabric of the work. everything is beautifully conceived and in focus, both literally and figuratively. when watching seven samurai, movie lovers will immediately recognize that several of its key elements can be readily detected in countless similar films made during the last half-century. the audition scenes, in which several samurai are recruited for the difficult task of defending a farming town from a group of bandits, strikes a particularly familiar chord, as do those showing the samurai training the lowly villagers to fight and use weapons. indeed, the theme of a highly experienced group of ""tough guys"" taking up the cause of the disenfranchised has become something of an action film cliche, portions of which echo throughout the american western, as well as its progeny (think the dirty dozen, the road warrior or even television's the a team). but what really stands out in seven samurai are its characters. they run the gamut, from elder teacher to hopeful youth, stoic warrior to undisciplined brigand. kurosawa even finds room for a youthful romance, not to mention the mix of poor and beleaguered townspeople he depicts within the setting of the town. perhaps its no wonder the enemy bandits are virtually faceless-- there is so much conflict and passion present within the group of protagonists, the villains need not be more than a vague threat. through it all kurosawa never forgets who these people are and where they stand in comparison to one another. obviously, the samurai are, for the most part, samurai, while the townspeople are merely peasants, lacking even in funds to pay their noble defenders. kurosawa deftly illustrates these class differences by having one peasant fear horribly for the honor of his daughter, who he suspects will be lured by the wealth of the samurai; and also by giving us one samurai who is no samurai at all, but merely a peasant himself whose own farming village was in his youth destroyed by marauding warriors. the film thus wraps a a portrait of class conflict in a cloak of solidarity. the samurai unite to defend the poor peasants, but the ending is not exactly happy for them. nor are the peasants completely honorable. we learn, for instance, that they have in the past murdered defeated samurai and looted their bodies, and it becomes apparent late in the film that their claims of poverty are perhaps not as truthful as at first seemed apparent. so why do the samurai defend them so valiantly? for honor? for love of adventure? the answer to this question is left intentionally vague; it is up to each viewer to draw his or her own conclusions. it is to the film's credit that it forces such questions upon us while never allowing them to cause the motivations of its characters to seem untrue. modern viewers will find the action sequences of seven samurai to be restrained. there are, for instance, no ""gladiator"" or ""braveheart"" moments in which limbs are visibly hacked off, blood flies and speakers pound with booming audio. but the action is wonderfully filmed and there is some early use of slow motion to accentuate key moments. the 3 1/2 hour running time may also deter some, but i find the length to be one of the film's charms; it takes its dear sweet time in exposing its riches, and no single moment feels underdeveloped or awkward. don't miss it. 10/10";29 July 2001;10;['archetypal', 'rich', 'own', 'own', 'vital', 'slow', 'dramatic', 'contrived', 'overall', 'several', 'key', 'countless', 'similar', 'last', 'half', 'several', 'difficult', 'familiar', 'lowly', 'experienced', 'tough', 'american', 'dirty', 'eld', 'hopeful', 'stoic', 'youthful', 'poor', 'beleaguered', 'much', 'present', 'more', 'vague', 'most', 'noble', 'own', 'poor', 'happy', 'honorable', 'apparent', 'truthful', 'apparent', 'vague', 'own', 'such', 'untrue', 'modern', 'braveheart', 'booming', 'early', 'slow', 'key', 'dear', 'sweet', 'single', 'underdeveloped', 'awkward'];0.0474344776670358

472;flamboyanza;as a critically acclaimed kurosawa movie, this social drama circa 1587 japan is a vivid example of why the classic are for an eternity. starting from culture to detailed emotions, the movie captures and delivers each of its set with precision. the characters have been well chosen to manifest traits such as wisdom, panic, foolishness, desperation, humor, love, longing and rebellion during times of war. although quite long- close to three and half hours- compared to modern movies, seven samurai doesn't fail to arrest my attention for the whole time. the plot centers around a quiet village, abode to farmers vulnerable to bandit attacks. the consistent threat upon their annual harvest finally provokes them to seek external ally in form of samurais although they had little to offer in return. it is a fresh change from movies in the western setting where the peasants' life is very much different from those in an eastern setting.;21 March 2015;8;['social', 'vivid', 'detailed', 'such', 'half', 'modern', 'whole', 'quiet', 'vulnerable', 'consistent', 'annual', 'external', 'little', 'fresh', 'western', 'different', 'eastern'];0.0436111111111111
473;Musashi94;"what can be said about seven samurai that hasn't already been said at this point? ever since its release in april of 1954, it has been considered one of the greatest films of all time. and deservedly so in my opinion. i must admit that i am biased: seven samurai is my favorite movie of all time and i consider akira kurosawa to be the greatest director of all time. that being said, i have tried to keep my review from being too effusive even though i would give this film the strongest possible recommendation. while i do not believe a ""perfect"" film exists - nor do i believe will one ever exist - i believe seven samurai is as close to perfect as a film can get. the film is set in the 16th century and japan has been devastated by decades of political instability and almost constant military conflict. as a result, bandits roam the countryside unchecked, wreaking havoc on whatever small farming villages they encounter. aware of a forthcoming bandit raid, one village decides to hire the titular seven samurai to lead the defense of the village and train its inhabitants in the ways of war. sure enough, the bandits arrive, setting the stage for a decisive battle that will decide the fate of the village. while fairly straightforward as far as plot summaries go, the film's narrative is extremely engrossing and rich in subtext. seven samurai is one of the few films with an epic duration (almost three-and-a-half hours) that uses its runtime to its advantage. not only does the film explore each of the seven samurai in depth, it also takes the time to highlight some of the villagers, giving its cast of characters the kind of depth rarely seen in standalone films. because of the time spent getting to know these characters, the audience naturally grows to empathize with them and become more invested in their story. the class differences and accompanying social inequality between the samurai and the villagers, who are all poor farmers, is also a major focus throughout the film. when the samurai first arrive in the village, the inhabitants hide in their homes and refuse to meet their new protectors, afraid that they have exchanged one oppressor for another. even after the villagers become more comfortable with the samurais' presence, there is palpable sense of uneasiness to their interactions. it is later revealed that the villagers hunt down and kill samurai from defeated armies in order to take their equipment. the samurai are infuriated until one of their number - a peasant masquerading as a samurai - points out their hypocrisy. the villagers may be treacherous and cowardly, but they are the way they are due to centuries of oppression by the samurai, the ruling elite in 16th century japan. in fact, many of the bandits terrorizing the village are themselves samurai whose clans have been destroyed. even at the end of the film, with the bandits defeated and the villagers joyously planting their fall rice crop, the social divide still remains. the samurai have defended the village, but only three of them have survived and they grimly realize that the victory does not belong to them for their code prevents them from adopting a farmer's lifestyle; they are doomed to wander the countryside until they find a new master to serve or a new cause to take up. written by kurosawa, shinobu hashimoto and hideo oguni, the story manages to be epic while retaining a focus on detail. this keeps seven samurai from feeling bloated or overlong; each section of the film feels necessary in telling the overarching story and each scene feels like it illuminates either a character or a major theme such as class, duty, or identity. this also grounds the narrative and avoids the common pitfall of epic movies by overwhelming the audience with the vastness of the story it's trying to tell; inundating them with too many characters and events to keep track of. kurosawa's direction is bold and dynamic, displaying his trademark mastery of movement and blocking. even static shots are interesting to look at due to his excellent use of mise-en-scene or mood lighting. of course, when discussing his direction, i would be remiss not to point out the battle scenes which are staged in a way that conveys the chaos and confusion of armed conflict while being shot in a way that the audience can still follow what is happening. acting wise, we get the usual trope of kurosawa collaborators. the legendary toshiro mifune plays kikuchiyo, a fiery and turbulent samurai pretender whose character serves as the emotional heart of the film. in a sense, he is the link that keeps the samurai and the villagers together due to his innate understanding of the later and his desperation to be considered one of the former. ironically, for one of his most iconic roles, mifune is actually playing against type somewhat. typically, the characters he played were laconic and stoic, ruled by a strong sense of justice. kikuchiyo is loud, obnoxious and impulsive. this freedom of expression gives mifune's performance a sense of energy some of his more typecast roles would lack, and i find it to be the strongest performance of his career. takashi shimura plays the leader of the samurai, shimada kambei, and gives the character a sense of gravitas while also displaying great humility and empathy. mifune as kikuchiyo might be the emotional heart of the film, but it just wouldn't work without shimura's stalwart persona. amongst the supporting cast, the highlights are seiji miyaguchi as the formidable kyuzo, the most skilled of the seven, and yoshio tsuchiya as the impassioned rikichi, the farmer in charge of recruiting and hosting the samurai. miyaguchi - relegated to minor roles for most of his career - gives an understated delivery that helps kyuzo feel authentically badass. tsuchiya plays his part with a boldness that belies desperation, owing to the fact that his character's wife has been abducted by the bandits. the score is provided by fumio hayasaka. while i generally prefer the work of composers who worked with kurosawa later in his career such as masaru sato and toru takemitsu, hayasaka's score is a personal favorite of mine. it perfectly encapsulates the melancholy yet stubbornly hopeful mood of the picture, particularly with its haunting main theme. asakazu nakai also does an excellent job with the film's cinematography, particularly with regard to depth of field and shadows. as was always the case, kurosawa edited his own film and manages to synergize his expert direction of motion with his editing, creating a kind of rhythm that keeps the film moving at a brisk pace. kurosawa has sometimes been called the greatest editor who ever lived and seven samurai is a testament to that accolade: it's a three-and-a-half-hour film that has never felt like a three-and-a-half-hour film when i've watched it. rounding out the miscellaneous aspects of the film, the production design is fantastic. the sets and costumes look authentically lived in (in fact kurosawa had several cast members wears their costumes prior to filming to achieve this effect) which greatly aids in the believability of the setting. this feels like pre-modern japan and not just a facsimile of it. in conclusion, seven samurai deserves its reputation as the one of the greatest films of all time. i cannot recommend kurosawa's magnum opus enough to anyone interested in film whatsoever. regardless, of whether your interest in film is based on its artistic aspects or on its ability to entertain, the film delivers on almost every level. in the film, the victory may belong to the farmers; in reality, the victory belongs to all of us for having the privilege of being able to watch it.";18 May 2019;10;['great', 'favorite', 'great', 'effusive', 'strong', 'possible', 'perfect', 'close', 'political', 'constant', 'military', 'unchecked', 'small', 'aware', 'forthcoming', 'titular', 'decisive', 'straightforward', 'rich', 'few', 'epic', 'standalone', 'social', 'poor', 'major', 'new', 'afraid', 'comfortable', 'palpable', 'treacherous', 'due', 'many', 'social', 'new', 'new', 'oguni', 'epic', 'bloated', 'overlong', 'necessary', 'major', 'such', 'common', 'epic', 'many', 'bold', 'dynamic', 'static', 'interesting', 'excellent', 'remiss', 'armed', 'usual', 'legendary', 'fiery', 'turbulent', 'emotional', 'innate', 'later', 'former', 'iconic', 'laconic', 'stoic', 'strong', 'loud', 'obnoxious', 'impulsive', 'more', 'strong', 'great', 'emotional', 'stalwart', 'seiji', 'miyaguchi', 'formidable', 'skilled', 'impassioned', 'minor', 'most', 'badass', 'such', 'personal', 'melancholy', 'hopeful', 'main', 'excellent', 'own', 'expert', 'brisk', 'great', 'half', 'half', 'miscellaneous', 'fantastic', 'several', 'pre', 'modern', 'great', 'magnum', 'interested', 'artistic', 'able'];0.2353679653679653

486;tymothy;"lots of great movies stand the test of time. seven samurai simply doesn't. you're lying and deceiving yourself if you consider this to be a great movie. why do people rate this so highly? 1. it's in japanese 2. it involves samurai 3. it's old 4. kurosawa 5. relative obscurity all of these factors allow people to like something non-mainstream and thus profess superiority. look, no doubt this is a relevant film in understanding the evolution of moviemaking. but historical significance alone doesn't make for a great film. while various action shots might have been ground-breaking for the time and stunning to audiences in the 50s, they simply don't hold up decades later. the movie is extraordinarily long- well clearly, we must get a great character development of the samurai then? nope. hardly anything. fantastic dialog? nope. perhaps the subtitles weren't great, but discourse is extremely shallow most of the time. a real emotional involvement? a sense of urgency? excitement? nope. aside from fleeting moments in the first two hours and a little later on, you get almost nothing. there's a persistent and constant malaise as characters slog through the plot. instead the movie lags and relies on portraying mediocre sets and ""action"". i'm sure audiences in the 50s would consider the film almost immersive into various landscrapes. as a modern movie goer, a few fake trees with a backdrop isn't engaging by itself. a character falling into a pile of fake flowers shot in blakc and white does nothing for me. so yes, if you watch this you'll see the development of interesting camera techniques that would become staples of work to follow. but as a movie, bleh, terrible pacing, shallow characters and a work that falls flat emotionally. and that's the opposite what good movies are supposed to be- entertainment through delivery of a compelling story. if you want to see a kurosawa film that still holds up, look at ""only the bad sleep well"", which has some absolutely fantastic camerawork, an engaging plot and delivers a gripping story.";4 September 2018;3;['great', 'great', 'japanese', 'old', 'relative', 'non', 'mainstream', 'profess', 'relevant', 'historical', 'great', 'various', 'stunning', 'great', 'fantastic', 'great', 'shallow', 'most', 'emotional', 'fleeting', 'first', 'little', 'persistent', 'constant', 'mediocre', 'sure', 'immersive', 'various', 'modern', 'few', 'fake', 'fake', 'interesting', 'terrible', 'shallow', 'flat', 'opposite', 'good', 'compelling', 'bad', 'fantastic'];0.1277380952380952
487;Oblivious93;created by acclaimed director akira kurosawa, seven samurai tells the story of a small farming town that is under the threat of bandits in feudal japan. if the farmers resist the bandits, they will be killed, but if they stand by and do nothing, all of their food and money will be stolen. and so the poor farmers decide they must stop the bandits by hiring a group of seven very different samurai. each samurai has a distinct personality and reason for helping the farmers, and the film takes it's time (3 hours and 27 minutes time) to explain each of them. however the runaway star is kikuchiyo, played by actor toshiro mifune. he is the black sheep of the group, a crazed and energetic man who almost seems like a little child. but throughout the course of the film, you see his other side, and by the end you've got one of the most developed characters ever to appear on the big screen. seven samurai is considered by many to be an action movie, but shoving it into one genre is unfair. the movie seamlessly combines moments of comedy, drama, romance, adventure, action, and even tragedy. it is a movie of all trades. words cannot sum up the experience you have while watching seven samurai. it makes you laugh at the antics the samurai bring, cheer when the village accomplish a goal, bit your fingernails in suspense when bandits appear, and cry at the tragedies that occur in life. if you have yet to see this movie, find it and watch what is without a doubt in my mind, the greatest movie ever made.;23 April 2009;10;['small', 'feudal', 'poor', 'different', 'distinct', 'runaway', 'black', 'crazed', 'energetic', 'little', 'other', 'big', 'many', 'unfair', 'great'];0.0392361111111111

496;jh_reaper;this film is not complicated by any means but is done with true brilliance. the story is simple > a band of samurai are hired by a poor farming community to fight off bandits which have been stealing their crops and starving them. akira kurosawa has shown me time and time again that he's easily one of the best directors to have ever walked this earth. i dare one to show me any film much better than seven samurai, rashomon, throne of blood, ran, dreams or red beard just to name a small number of his dozen or so true masterpieces of cinema. back on topic to my review of seven samurai. seven samurai is something that everyone can relate to and deals with general topics like trying to help your fellow man when he's down. the film may be 3 and a 1/2 hours in length but it flows with such a pace that you are never left bored even for a moment and when it's all done with you don't think of how long you just sit for, but of how great of a film you just sit through. this is helped by how it blends in some of the most true emotional moments you'll ever see along with some very intense (especially for it's time) battle scenes as the samurai and the bandits are battling it out in the climax. you feel each moment and there are quite a few that bring you to the screen like a magnet as well as many that almost bring one to tears thanks to some of the best actors that japan can offer and the best possible performances that anyone could possibly expect from each, which most notably includes the legendary toshiro mifune (whom kurosawa often worked with) as kikuchiyo. the script is superb and manages to not be complicated but yet avoid the disaster of becoming too plain or mundane. the acting is some of the finest that one will ever witness. the film is beautifully shot. the action is done as it should be and the emotion feels real and is truly there. last but not least akira kurosawa's direction brings everything together like a true perfectionist. i am not the best at reviewing but to sum up my feelings toward this movie i must say i've currently seen it four times and it has never let me down. each time i've experienced this film i've truly been enthralled with each moment and i've really cared for each character and toshiro mifune's performance has both put a smile on my face and a tear to my eye. i honestly believe this is the finest film that has ever been made regardless of country, length, age or genre. i will continue re-watching this film till the day i die. i have very much respect to kurosawa for creating some of the most amazing films i've ever seen, same goes to mifune for his acting. for those new to akira kurosawa's film work i would highly recommend going and immediately getting copies of red beard, rashomon and ran or pretty much any film he directed for that matter. seven samurai very deservingly receives a 10/10 in my opinion and is one of the greatest films ever made.;5 April 2007;10;['true', 'simple', 'poor', 'good', 'well', 'red', 'small', 'true', 'general', 'fellow', 'bored', 'great', 'true', 'emotional', 'intense', 'few', 'many', 'good', 'possible', 'legendary', 'complicated', 'plain', 'mundane', 'fine', 'real', 'last', 'least', 'true', 'good', 'fine', 'much', 'amazing', 'same', 'new', 'red', 'great'];0.1840232683982684
497;gocanes146;the samurai themselves are so richly given life to in the screenplay that little more would have been needed to make them memorable characters, yet the main cast pay off at every turn, and though every one of the seven main actors give in perfect performances (never as i had feared before watching it do you confuse them, even in the chaotic battle scenes), two immortal roles have a particularly resounding effect: takashi shimura (kambei shimada), who plays the leader of the ragged band of samurai, gives his sage and venerable warrior a god-like intensity that makes the magnetic charisma of his character unquestionable. one of the easiest leaders to root for in all the history of film-making. stealing the show however, albeit by a very thin margin, is longtime kurosawa favorite coworker toshiro mifune (kikuchiyo) as the rogue seventh, the black sheep of the herd, giving the bravura ultimate performance of a lifetime paved throughout with great roles. the story follows them and the villagers, equally nuanced and developed, through their encounter, training, eventual bonding and the big inevitable fight for survival. unlike subsequent very successful remakes (i.e. magnificent seven), seven samurai transcended excellency by having many layers (nothing or no one is white or black: everything exists in shades of gray) and thus being very real and human. even without the menace, its interpersonal dynamics would have made it perfect human drama, subtle, balancing comedy, intensity, realism, drama and a deep philosophy with astonishing ease, yet the menace does materialize and thus seven samurai unleashes its violence in a series of action scenes crafted with such vision and ingenuity as has ever reached an action film (the frenetic battle scenes at the end rather evoke saving private ryan in their relentlessness). in the end, what made this into solid gold was, at the core, akira kurosawa, who would, despite directing many further masterpieces (throne of blood, yojimbo, red beard, dersu uzala, kagemusha, ran), would never top this one. throughout his life, kurosawa kept confirming his status as perhaps the greatest director ever. if so, seven samurai is the ultimate proof of that truth. one of the very best films ever made and personal all-time favorite.;11 February 2012;10;['little', 'more', 'memorable', 'main', 'main', 'perfect', 'chaotic', 'immortal', 'resounding', 'ragged', 'venerable', 'like', 'magnetic', 'unquestionable', 'easy', 'thin', 'longtime', 'black', 'ultimate', 'great', 'eventual', 'big', 'inevitable', 'subsequent', 'successful', 'magnificent', 'many', 'white', 'black', 'gray', 'real', 'human', 'interpersonal', 'human', 'subtle', 'deep', 'astonishing', 'such', 'frenetic', 'private', 'solid', 'many', 'further', 'great', 'ultimate', 'good', 'personal'];0.2140151515151515

502;macbug-1;this movie should be seen by everyone who ever considers going into the film making business. akira kurosawa has created an true epic motion picture that is not only historically perfect down to the smallest detail but has presented a moral philosophical film with many layers of messages. for later contemplation. this is my personal all time favorite movie. the quality is so intense that colorization would ruin this film, every scene is nuanced, and full of subtleties that escape most western viewers so one must carefully watch this film several times, it is worthy of a full semester of study in any film school. my favorite scene is a dual in the early stage of the movie that was copied in the magnificent seven film but in the seven samari kurosawa shows us a slice of the interactions of the samari class of 17th century japan. another great message in the film is how fire arms and technology have poisoned conflict and warfare. i mean in the film kurosawa displays the training nobility, courage, and skill of the samari against overwhelming odds. yet since the bandits have firearms they are able to kill them without every showing themselves in a very cowardly manner, in fact you never see them firing and killing any of the samari, you only hear the report and you see a brave noble man fall. no more is strength, nobility, training, dedication, honor, sacrifice and commitment important, now it is who has the most money to buy guns. kurosawa is the master film maker who has taught spielberg, lucas and all following filmmakers who take their craft seriously. by slowly consuming this film you journey into the mind of a true genius, beyond cleverness, or big budgets, you can see kurosawa's finger prints on many of our most populars films.;21 August 2005;10;['true', 'epic', 'perfect', 'small', 'moral', 'philosophical', 'many', 'later', 'personal', 'favorite', 'intense', 'full', 'most', 'western', 'several', 'worthy', 'full', 'favorite', 'early', 'magnificent', 'samari', 'great', 'overwhelming', 'able', 'cowardly', 'brave', 'noble', 'important', 'most', 'true', 'big', 'many', 'most'];0.3543010752688171

511;caerlas;contains spoiler i'd heard about this film for a long time. i am glad i finally saw it. this is the story of a village of people in post-feudal japan who hire a ronin, kambei, to defend their village from an annual raid by bloodthirsty bandits. out of charity and a lack of purpose since the fall of the feudal lords he helps them find 6 other ronin to defend the village. these 6 other ronin are just as indifferent about their lives as the first and decide to take on the challenge of defending this village as well. among the more compelling characters are katsushiro, a young untrained son of a samurai who wishes to be a disciple under kambei. kikuchiro, played with flair by toshiro mifune is a scoundrel who poses as a samurai. despite kikuchiro's lack of discipline or honor, and his constant vulgar outbursts, he becomes one of the most endearing characters throughout the course of the movie because of his slyness and unstoppable bravery. also look out for heihachi, a fiercely disciplined ronin who has made the perfection of his swordsmanship the one remaining meaning in his life. the movie is a whopping 3 1/2 hours long. strangely enough i didn't have a real problem staying up till 4 a.m. to watch it. this movie is an arena film in the truest sense of the word. the story is not about one character but an entire circle of people both of the village and of the samurai. their stories are very separate in some ways but intertwined in their will to fight and survive. throw in kurosawa's usual talent for well arranged shots, dark humor, and moments of brilliant direction of his actors, and you have a heck of a good show. the movie lagged in areas especially closer to the beginning. the movie is truly made after the intermission when the build-up has ended and the real conflict begins. one key scene in the first half makes it all worth it when toshiro mifune gives a stunning monologue criticizing the samurai for their hatred of the farmers after discovering the past murders of other wandering ronin by the farmers. toshiro up to this point plays a reprehensible and un-compelling character who mainly serves as comic relief, but afterward is discovered to be a spirit of truth amidst a personality filled with pain and chaos. the ending is bittersweet much like yojimbo. the samurai, mission completed, still have no lord and no purpose, so onward they travel perhaps only to die in another challenge. nonetheless, there is something very fulfilling about the end that i often don't feel from most movies. overall, i highly recommend this film. if you like things in small bites then watch each half a day at a time.;26 July 2003;9;['long', 'glad', 'post', 'feudal', 'ronin', 'kambei', 'annual', 'bloodthirsty', 'feudal', 'other', 'other', 'indifferent', 'first', 'compelling', 'young', 'untrained', 'constant', 'vulgar', 'endearing', 'unstoppable', 'whopping', 'real', 'true', 'entire', 'separate', 'usual', 'dark', 'brilliant', 'good', 'real', 'key', 'first', 'worth', 'stunning', 'past', 'other', 'wandering', 'reprehensible', 'un', 'compelling', 'comic', 'bittersweet', 'most', 'small'];0.124074074074074
512;Skull_Thunder;"shichinin no samurai, or ""seven samurai"" was a slog to get through when i first watched it. i remember thinking that it was really weird to call it just plain ""seven samurai"" rather than ""the seven samurai"". i was also quite annoyed that i had made myself watch a 3-hour movie. now that i'm not bitter anymore, i can probably be a little more charitable to what is widely considered akira kurosawa's most influential movies. seven samurai falls into a category of movies that i would consider just slightly overrated to a degree. for the time it was made, this movie can just be credited as creating the ""meet the team"" trope and nothing else. while i particularly enjoy that idea above certain other ones, i think that in it's current state, this so-called magnum opus of filmmaking leaves 2 major things to be desired. the first is that someone gets off before the climax (not saying who to make this review spoiler-free). it's quite annoying, and i think that part sucked. that's probably just me. the second is that i couldn't tell the main samurai characters apart easily. seriously. the only way to tell two of them apart was through the ""distinguishing feature"" of one having a bald spot. this could honestly be easily fixed. i think that this movie could benefit from color. just making each samurai have a different colored robe would really make them stand out just a little more. in all honesty, i think that with just some quick and tiny tweaks to the story, this movie would really benefit from a remake. i say remake, because they wouldn't have to change much. they could still keep it 3 hours long. it benefits from the length. i think that if they sort of remade the action scenes to have a slightly quicker pace, and just sort of indicated the difference between the samurai, this movie could probably live up to my high nitpicky standard (that was slight sarcasm) overall, i'd still call this a masterpiece. it's actually quite good. i could consider this movie to be one that a lot of people should watch once in their lives.";7 November 2021;8;['weird', 'plain', 'annoyed', 'bitter', 'little', 'charitable', 'most', 'influential', 'certain', 'other', 'current', 'magnum', 'major', 'first', 'free', 'annoying', 'second', 'main', 'only', 'bald', 'different', 'colored', 'little', 'more', 'quick', 'tiny', 'much', 'quick', 'high', 'nitpicky', 'slight', 'good'];0.0591987179487179

517;Fellowship Films;"the seven samurai is a genuine epic notable for the simplicity of its plot and action and the complexity of the character development. in 16th century japan and in the age of upheaval and civil disorder, seven, as it were freelance, samurai warriors are employed by desperate villagers to protect them from the annual raid on their crops and produce by a group of bandits. this is the stuff of westerns and was remade as the respectable ""the magnificent seven"". but what the american film lacked was the code and honour of the samurai- qualities unknown to employed gunfighters. by emphasising these things along with the japanese caste system and thus revealing the paradox of samurai warriors fighting and dying for peasants, people whom normally they would treat with disdain, kurosawa presented a story that was simultaneously familiar and alien. the climatic, rain-soaked, mud-spattered battle scene with the camera swooping and wheeling between samurai, peasants and bandits is brutally realistic. the overall blend of savagery and nobility, subtlety and broad humour makes what is essentially an action/adventure movie into something quite magnificent.";26 March 2002;10;['genuine', 'epic', 'notable', 'civil', 'desperate', 'annual', 'respectable', 'magnificent', 'american', 'unknown', 'japanese', 'familiar', 'alien', 'climatic', 'spattered', 'realistic', 'overall', 'broad', 'magnificent'];0.2102777777777777

no, rather is its dramatic storyline and subplots, as well as very likable leads. kurosawa's script (also a writer here) doesn't play this up as a period piece, thankfully refraining from anachronisms, and it says fresh in 2012 (although it was probably re-subtitled with the dvd release a few years ago). it also shows the japanese humor that kurosawa eagerly portrays in some scenes--genuinely funny, i might add--even if not full on comedy quality (it is a drama after all). after the opening credits, which features great drum based music, showcasing japanese culture and the action element of seven samurai, we see a group of bandits about to pillage a village positioned in a basin with sides made of mountains, frequently demanding that the villagers pay them to keep them safe. a farmer from this small farming town overhears their conversation to come back when the harvest is over. a leader from the village suggests hiring samurai to protect them, ones that will take rice and shelter as compensation. so we see a down-on-his-luck veteran-samurai negotiating and freeing a child from harm, and a representative from the village asks for help. after much persuading the samurai accepts, but says the job will require at least seven. next, we track down four more, a good natured one that is often the source of comic relief, and a master swordsman, who's quiet, yet well spoken, with philosophical lines. a villager is accepted to the brotherhood. finally, a clown of a man, seldom not drunk at the beginning, who begs to come along, and they reluctantly accept. after this rich exposition, the committee tasked with finding the samurai return victorious, and you next expect a great celebration, possibly even a feast (this is a town where the villagers seldom eat rice out of season, only millet). much to the chagrin of the seven, there is no outpouring, not even people in the streets. the men with daughters and/or wives, are protecting them from who they think are going to rape them. the rest are simply afraid. so the wild card, the fool among masters, sounds the alarm bells in the village square. after all the peoples fear the worst and come out to defend themselves, the samurai delivers a wonderfully pointed speech about how they did not come to be feared and hated by the townspeople, but to provide a great service for below minimal payment scolding them for indecency and generalizations, and more than anything, whining about it, too. the next half hour or so, is showing the village and collected samurai readying for defense (traps, positioning, and the like), and teaching the villagers how to defend themselves with a sword or spear. and a lovely romance too scandalous for public approval, this is the only part that would gain a significant amount if in color. the picturesque setting with its wonderful fall setting, with leaves on the ground, a small stream and presumed cherry blossoms for this great love story: technicolor would have just made your heart sing. but of all the things in this movie that are good, nothing beats the last hour, an all out battle: bandits versus the magnificent seven (yes, this is where that came from). i can't overstate it enough, of all the movies i've seen with battles or even wars in it, nothing, not even the brilliant western shootouts from the good, the bad, and the ugly, can top this, not one second could be beaten by almost any other fights in the history of cinema. you may not like the long, suspense and plot building drama that precedes it, but no one can deny the masterpiece that is this battle. as a stand-alone movie, it would still be pretty good (and probably not too short, either). long movie short, akira kurosawa's rich character development and perennially likable personalities (it seems as though a different person wrote each part, they're really that built up), along with what is the all time greatest battle i've ever seen, easily and gracefully earns shichinin no samurai a high place in anyone's movie collection. http://woltzpictures.wordpress.com/";10 July 2012;10;['feudal', 'true', 'historical', 'many', 'exotic', 'much', 'tiny', 'epic', 'dramatic', 'likable', 'fresh', 'few', 'japanese', 'funny', 'full', 'great', 'japanese', 'about', 'safe', 'small', 'much', 'more', 'good', 'natured', 'comic', 'quiet', 'spoken', 'philosophical', 'drunk', 'rich', 'victorious', 'great', 'afraid', 'wild', 'bad', 'great', 'minimal', 'more', 'next', 'half', 'lovely', 'scandalous', 'public', 'only', 'significant', 'picturesque', 'wonderful', 'small', 'great', 'good', 'last', 'out', 'magnificent', 'brilliant', 'western', 'bad', 'ugly', 'second', 'other', 'long', 'alone', 'good', 'short', 'long', 'short', 'rich', 'likable', 'different', 'great', 'high'];0.1891525423728813

537;saronix;"seven samurai directed by akira kurosawa is the quintessential action flick. however, simply citing it as an action film is to discredit the comedy, tragedy, drama and humanistic qualities it possesses. it is the blue-print for any film that assembles a team of heroes with a common goal. it has an extensive run-time that flies by and rewards those that were not intimidated by a 3 hour and 30 minute film. this time is well utilized to flesh out the characters and there is not a single scene that felt like ""padding."" despite there being an array of characters, many of these characters are fleshed out and well developed and their struggles and successes evoke strong emotions from the viewer. the strength of this film lies in the characters. for instance, we have kambei (takashi shimura), the noble and wise leader of the troupe. kambei is approached by a representative of the village asking for help in protecting the village from bandits that constantly raid them for resources. despite the village offering a pittance for this service, kambei is empathetic and decides to take on the job but is now faced with the difficult task of assembling other warriors that would risk their lives for little monetary value. each character has their own motivations for joining this rag-tag group and many of them have a character arc that develops them. these are no one-dimensional 'face-less' warriors that are characteristic of many films. in contrast, the bandits are an ever present ominous threat but are not developed in any significant way. they are a concern to the village but ultimately they are a device which sets in motion the foundation of assembling this rag-tag group. this allows the focus to be on the protagonists, their relationships to each other and how they react when faced with adversity. the bandits are given no more development than a natural cause; such as an earthquake or tsunami. they are an ever present threat but are a product of the environment for a small defenceless village composed of peasants and farmers. this is for the betterment of the film; as ultimately the film is about the villagers and seven samurai - not about the bandits. each character was well acted and enjoyable. however, i have to acknowledge takashi shimura and toshiro mifune for their performances as the characters kambei and kikuchiyo respectively. these characters had excellent chemistry with others on screen and contrasted each other well. in summary, this is a must watch film. the run time may intimidate some viewers although you will be rewarded with one of the most humanistic and ingenious films ever made that does justify the length, utilizes it, and turns it into a strength.";18 March 2017;10;['quintessential', 'humanistic', 'blue', 'common', 'extensive', 'single', 'many', 'developed', 'strong', 'noble', 'wise', 'empathetic', 'difficult', 'other', 'little', 'monetary', 'own', 'many', 'dimensional', 'characteristic', 'many', 'present', 'ominous', 'significant', 'other', 'more', 'natural', 'such', 'present', 'small', 'defenceless', 'enjoyable', 'kambei', 'excellent', 'other', 'humanistic', 'ingenious'];0.1842049319727891

540;noahmed;seven samurai, is a japanese film from 1954. it's a black and white film, and is considered a classic. i don't see this as a classic. i see this as a film that was possibly great in its time, but did not age well. time has not been kind to this film/ i personally do not feel that the average movie goer, would get pass the first hour. let's talk about what i liked. first off, the acting is good. each actor fits their character and thats fine. the direction is good. that's really it. this film has a lot going against it for today's age. and that is how i am going to conduct this review, from a viewer in today's age. what i didn't like is majority of the film and its aspects. let's start with the big one, the movie is three and a half hours long. when it does not need to be. the first hour alone could be cut in half and it wouldn't take away from the main story. which brings me to my next grievance. the plot of the movie doesn't come into play until an hour of the movie. i was sitting waiting for something relevant to the plot to happen and by the first hour when it happens. i have lost all interest in the movie. another factor is the pacing is awful. the movie is 3 hours and 27 minutes, it felt like 4 hours or more. i was constantly checking how long i had left. one last thing is you really don't know whose who. you have these characters that are thrown into a scene and it's never really explained who they are or what their purpose is. i had such high hopes for this film because i heard it was great. but, i was given nothing but what was a great film in it's prime that lost it's meaning and watchability over time.;20 August 2020;1;['japanese', 'black', 'white', 'great', 'kind', 'average', 'first', 'good', 'fine', 'good', 'big', 'first', 'main', 'next', 'relevant', 'first', 'awful', 'more', 'last', 'such', 'high', 'great', 'great', 'prime'];0.2381159420289854
541;lazarr;first of all, this movie gave us an enormous look at kurosawas talented filmmaking mind he was. when i watched the film i realized there are seven ways this movie definitely works. 01.multiple camera technique this puts us in the mood the atmosphere, and we can see multiple things that are great about this movie (excellent starting in my opinion). 02.the music one thing that took my mind away was the opening music. the song is so simple, yet so heart pounding, fumio hayasaka really made a score to remember and gave something new to this film. sometimes easy, sometimes very difficult to understand, that is the reason why the music is so beautiful and iconic. 03.the actors the thing about actors is, they with their performances make us believe that they were real people and then again when we realize that they are just actors why still love watching them do things that often seem difficult or deadly, like fighting 40 bandits with peasants, grieving for the fallen, but still fighting until the ending. that is way actors like toshiro mifune and takashi shimura really stood out in this epic. 04.the plot now we are getting serious. the fact of the already amazing plot is that it first seems so simple, but at the very end you realize those 3 and a half hours of fighting and toshiro mifune goofing around, you see the bigger picture, realizing that this movie has a higher message (which i will let you find out for yourselves). 05.the timeline i am not a history expert, but the fact that this movie is taking place in 1586, during the sengoku period makes it more difficult to grasp what this movie is about. samurai being proud and evil with peasants, can gives a shadow of a doubt that there is no hope for them. but when kambei comes in and rounds up samurai, hope rises and the movie stars to make sense. 06.the prologue and the epilogue this movie has (at least in my opinion) an interesting prologue and epilogue. the prologue begins with the bandits approaching the village, before sparing the peasants of suffering. the peasants are not happy that they are spared. they instead cry because they now they will come back soon for them. without hope they ask for help from their oldest and wisest man. he says they need samurai. epilogue ends with a victory, almost. kambei realizes that they are the ones who lost this battle and that the peasants are the ones who won. if that is not something then i will stop writing this review. 07.the fact that it is so popular all around the world seven samurai is a film to be admired. all the things i said before, and it has its own popularity, everywhere. those things make for a star wars like experience which needs to be seen at least once in a lifetime. with all this i just listed, i can proudly say that seven samurai is the ultimate samurai film, the best film in japan, and one of the best films in movie history (that is why i gave it 10/10 rating).;11 November 2016;10;['enormous', 'talented', 'multiple', 'great', 'excellent', 'simple', 'new', 'easy', 'difficult', 'beautiful', 'iconic', 'real', 'difficult', 'deadly', 'serious', 'amazing', 'simple', 'very', 'big', 'high', 'difficult', 'proud', 'evil', 'least', 'interesting', 'happy', 'old', 'wise', 'popular', 'own', 'least', 'ultimate', 'good', 'good'];0.2256891495601173
542;samar_bhattacharya;i have seen the original japanese edition with english subtitle. the film is shot on black $ white mode. the story covers up a profile of peasants in japan in short but detailed cuts. but it also lays out few more profiles not generally common outside japan, the samurais. the story starts with a danger of inevitable raids to be conducted by the bandits of mountain on a village what was looted before and the farmers know the terrors already. they come to know the possible fear of attack and decide to hire protectors, here samurais who fight for earnings, individual business soldiers. they ultimately hire six samurais and one stranger who claim as a samurai but was a farmer's son in origin thus constitutes the group of seven. the leader decides the plan of defense in three corners of the village and opens a side unpatrolled to invite the intruders, in his words that was a shape of good fort with an opening to let attackers in. soon the battle started among forty bandits and seven samurais leading and guiding rest willing villagers to form phalanx with fighting strategy. they kill bandits by events to reduce the strength to thirteen and the last decisive battle finishes the rest and also four samurais. the peace sets in the village. according to the storyline, the movie shows the agony of hopelessness of the common old villagers and spark of revenge between young ones. the samurai's war-strategy is detailed by the leader, the exceptional swordsman in the team showing his skill without glamour and always reaches to perfection. the once-farmer's son describes the general hatred of villagers to samurais, their ladies are kept aside not to be attracted by samurais and still a unique love story was built with great background humming sound when a young samurai met a village girl whose father tried to shape her as a boy to the eye of samurais but failed. the love found its own way naturally. i am not going to name any of the persons in the film as this should be a mystery to the viewers have not seen yet and who have seen it not a mystery any more. the picturization is unique in terms of the focusing the camera to the actors' faces, every deep expression, whether sad or joy was shot cleanly close to make the audience feel the same. the make-up sometimes was felt to be seen but not at all poor one. the dialogues are short most of the time yet powerful. the battle scenes are taken with great deal of accuracy where bandit archers and horse riders are attacking in ranks and villagers resisting them with courage. in all cases, the long movie gives us: clean story, battle, war strategy, love story, social picture and suspense. hats off to kurosawa. though made in 1954 with less modern equipments and far ahead sharpness which are still absent in today's movies generally.;26 August 2005;10;['original', 'japanese', 'english', 'black', 'white', 'short', 'detailed', 'few', 'more', 'common', 'inevitable', 'possible', 'individual', 'unpatrolled', 'good', 'willing', 'last', 'decisive', 'common', 'old', 'young', 'exceptional', 'general', 'unique', 'great', 'young', 'own', 'unique', 'deep', 'sad', 'close', 'same', 'poor', 'short', 'most', 'powerful', 'great', 'long', 'clean', 'social', 'less', 'modern', 'absent'];0.1412393162393162

556;bobcdawg;"this movie is considered one of the greatest movies of all time and was certainly groundbreaking in many ways. however, for this viewer, there were too many flaws or distractions to allow me to rate it higher than a 7. yes, the story is well told, but the movie is too long. some scenes drag on longer than necessary to make the point. there is a lot of setup to get to the more entertaining action scenes in the last third of the movie. some things that particularly bothered me and detracted from the movie for me were the incredibly obvious skull caps that many of the main characters wore. it was close to comical with some actors and that immediately distracted me and weakened the movie for me. next, while kirasawa is famous for his attention to detail and cinematography in the battle scenes, there were real weaknesses there. while the villagers had very long spears, they did not seem to use them to maximum effect, when simply ramming the riders with the spears would have been enough in real life to knock them off their horses immediately or kill them outright. they also would have used them against the horses themselves in a real battle. then, in most cases after riders fell from their horses, even when surrounded they almost always were able to crawl away briefly before being stabbed. next, despite the great potential for exciting sword fights between the samurais and the bandits, this was almost or entirely nonexistant. the samurais never really got to show their skill, other than single swipes at the riders or simply stabbing the bandits. a complete waste of cinematic excitement! finally, while presumably the bandits were in it to fight to the death, this is only hinted at and it just seemed idiotic for their forces to get weaker and weaker and yet they continue to attack with no hope for success or even a plan to win. i could not help but focus on how stupid they were and that it was obvious they were going to lose badly. the film tries to build up the drama for the ""climactic"" battle, but it is completely ridiculous. last, while the bandits have their ""fort"" destroyed by fire, they never think to use fire to defeat the villagers. this, again, makes no sense at all and was so obvious a solution that it was very distracting. another annoying factor was that the villagers were portrayed as completely pathetic, actually crying hysterically many times in the movie. they came across more as losers than people deserving of sympathy. i just didn't get the purpose of the excessive crying. also, a few times the screaming of various characters seemed excessive and made them less realistic to me. so, in conclusion, these were significant flaws to me that brought my rating of the film down. i consider it worth watching and overall entertaining, but just not a great film.";15 February 2020;7;['great', 'many', 'many', 'high', 'long', 'necessary', 'entertaining', 'last', 'obvious', 'many', 'main', 'close', 'comical', 'famous', 'real', 'long', 'maximum', 'enough', 'real', 'real', 'most', 'able', 'great', 'exciting', 'nonexistant', 'other', 'single', 'complete', 'cinematic', 'idiotic', 'weak', 'weak', 'stupid', 'obvious', 'climactic', 'ridiculous', 'last', 'obvious', 'annoying', 'pathetic', 'many', 'more', 'excessive', 'few', 'various', 'excessive', 'realistic', 'significant', 'worth', 'overall', 'entertaining', 'great'];0.0965978835978835

572;fearsomez;"""shichinin no samurai"", also known as ""seven samurai"", is a film by akira kurosawa released on 19 november 1956. it was a japanese film about a small village that was having trouble with a group of forty armed bandits. the village hires a samurai to help defend the village. the samurai kambei shimada (takashi shimura) determines that he will need six other samurai to defend the village. the total of seven samurai trains the village how to defend themselves. they end up using a cunning strategy to cut some of the bandits off from the others to take out several at a time. at the same time there is an underling story of romance. this film is a very interesting film that uses filming techniques and quality far beyond its time. akira kurosawa was one of the first to use multiple cameras to get different angles. it has the action needed to catch the viewer with an underling story of love. it shows seven people who got together to help a village in need, which created a bond together that will last a lifetime. the village had a great victory defeating the bandits, but the samurai lost, in that they lose several of their new found friends. for me, this movie is a very inspirational film, which shows how friendship can be formed in even extreme times. it has the quality needed and the length to have a well formed plot that is difficult to see with many of the shorter films that they have now. many films try to catch the viewer with special effects and attractive people, but this film did not have that option and had to use the plot and amazing filming techniques to attract the viewer.";13 July 2009;6;['japanese', 'small', 'armed', 'other', 'cunning', 'several', 'same', 'underling', 'interesting', 'first', 'multiple', 'different', 'underling', 'great', 'several', 'new', 'inspirational', 'extreme', 'difficult', 'many', 'short', 'many', 'special', 'attractive', 'amazing'];0.1792502951593861

587;kspit-1;"no spoilers below - plot discussion was avoided. akira kurosawa is considered one of the finest directors who ever lived, and the seven samurai is his epic masterpiece. this is a remarkable claim, and this movie undoubtedly lives up to its reputation. in my opinion, the success of seven samurai lays on three main pillars: cinematography, script and acting. other features such as the score are functional but are in no way the centre of attention. from a cinematographic point-of-view, this movie is flawless - one of those rare gems in film history. the angles are chosen carefully and kurosawa makes brilliant use of zooming in/out, as well as showing a mastery of the moving camera. perhaps the greatest achievement is photography - countless set-pieces are memorable, especially during scenes of conversation between the samurai and the peasants. the scenes of the selection of the samurai are another must-see, and must-hear. it's a pity that the movie was shot in black & white, but perhaps colour wasn't good enough yet. when kurosawa did colour, his films were among the most colourful ever made anyway! (see kagemusha or ran). i don't understand japanese, so i don't have access to the original script. however, if criterion's translation is correct, then seven samurai's script stands out. the dialogue is thoughtful and well-written, unlike most other movies, especially those made recently the dialogue at key moments is what shines most. however, dialogue would be useless if the movie didn't have the right actors to fill in the carefully-created roles. and seven samurai surely has: above all takashi shimura (kambei) and toshiro mifune (kikuchiyo) - kurosawa's favourites. shimura portrays the old, wise and gentle samurai leader flawlessly while mifune - as usual - steals the show in the scenes he is in. to me, the ""speech"" scene by mifune is easily one of the most memorable in film history. mifune, after all, is a true specialist in anger. lastly, to note is that japanese actors adopt the ""noh"" style rather than the ""realistic"" hollywood style. actors do not try to be natural and realistic - their main focus is to show emotion through facial expression, body movement and speech - which might seem ""over the top"" for many. the ""noh"" style of acting resembles more western theatre rather than western film-making. the other actors, most of them participating in various other kurosawa pictures, are also brilliant - there is no acting flaws in this movie...from the facial expressions of the peasants to the valorous movements of kyuzo. seven samurai is a brilliant package of acting, style and cinematography and no-wonder this formula was copied and re-copied by countless other pictures. this movie is a treasure to behold dearly: a masterpiece fully deserving its reputation as one of the greatest pictures ever made.";26 February 2005;10;['fine', 'epic', 'remarkable', 'main', 'other', 'such', 'functional', 'cinematographic', 'flawless', 'rare', 'brilliant', 'great', 'countless', 'memorable', 'black', 'white', 'good', 'colourful', 'japanese', 'original', 'correct', 'thoughtful', 'most', 'other', 'key', 'useless', 'right', 'old', 'wise', 'gentle', 'usual', 'memorable', 'true', 'japanese', 'noh', 'realistic', 'natural', 'realistic', 'main', 'facial', 'many', 'more', 'western', 'western', 'other', 'most', 'various', 'other', 'brilliant', 'facial', 'valorous', 'brilliant', 'countless', 'other', 'great'];0.249028182701652

643;Grigore-D;"akira kurosawa had recently, and very quickly, become one of my all-time favorite directors. i had only seen four of his films and given each and every one of them my highest rating. his greatest, and undoubtedly his most popular film was in 1954 epic seven samurai, which was the top-selling movie out of japan for the year and won the japanese academy award for best picture. today, it's ranked one of the greatest motion pictures ever. and it rightfully holds that title. this is a spectacular film. full of wonderful characters, spectacular scenery, and great performances all around, it is kurosawa's fantastic story about a poor farming village in 16th century japan being consistently placed under attack by marauding bandits. facing starvation if the bandits raid them again, the peasants fearfully and reluctantly turn to seven unemployed samurai to defend themselves. there is no weak element to seven samurai. one of its greatest aspects is its characters. every single one of them, farmer or samurai, is given tremendous development, making them memorable. this is one of those films where if a character gets killed off, you suddenly find yourselves missing their presence on film because you got to know them so well. i will not name him, but there was one ill-fated character in the film when, after he died, i felt kind of cheerless because i had come to respect him as a human being instead of an actor performing in front of a camera and reading out scripted dialogue. if you were to ask me which character was my favorite, i would be tied between two of them. the characters played by takashi shimura and toshiro mifune, two of the finest japanese actors who ever lived. another thing i admire in seven samurai is the feeling of authenticity. the feeling that it all could have really happened. there are very few moments where the unbelievable occurs, as most action movies tend to succumb to. one thing i admired was the antagonists of the film: the bandits. unlike most hollywood movies where the bad guys have names and are introduced as characters to make them effective, the bandits in seven samurai all go without names. we only know them as ""the bandits"" and that is appropriate because that's all the characters know them as. just marauding, murdering bandits who must be killed off as soon as possible. kurosawa was undoubtedly one of the most influential directors of all time and that is clear in this film. many of the transitions and techniques that motion pictures today seem to follow on a conventional level were inspired by this film: slow-motion, a ""fade"" wipe between scenes like what you see in the star wars movies, using the weather to affect emotion and atmosphere, a team forming to take on a larger enemy, the list goes on. the movie was so influential that it was remade here in the united states as the magnificent seven (1960), which i consider one of the greatest remakes ever. not as good as its original sourcenot by a long shotbut considerably effective and noteworthy. in regards to the movie's soundtrack, it's a success. the music was composed by fumio hayasaka and it's wonderful. we seldom hear any of it, when we do, its an efficacious presence of impact. the opening score is very effective and the music that plays when the farmers are searching for samurai in the town remains one of my favorite soundtrack pieces today. there is one thing in the film that might warn off some viewers. it is long. at over three and a half hours in length, some people will be cautious before sitting down to view it and some will lose their patience, but to those who can sit down and enjoy a movie no matter how long it lasts, it will be realized as fast-moving storytelling. like the ten commandments (1956), even the long takes and the slow pacing seems fast because it is so well-written and so masterfully directed by kurosawa. one of the greatest masterpieces of all time.";17 March 2009;10;['favorite', 'high', 'great', 'popular', 'epic', 'good', 'great', 'spectacular', 'full', 'wonderful', 'spectacular', 'great', 'fantastic', 'poor', 'unemployed', 'weak', 'great', 'single', 'tremendous', 'memorable', 'human', 'favorite', 'fine', 'japanese', 'few', 'unbelievable', 'most', 'most', 'hollywood', 'bad', 'effective', 'appropriate', 'possible', 'influential', 'clear', 'many', 'conventional', 'slow', 'fade', 'large', 'influential', 'magnificent', 'great', 'good', 'original', 'long', 'effective', 'noteworthy', 'wonderful', 'efficacious', 'effective', 'favorite', 'long', 'cautious', 'long', 'slow', 'fast', 'great'];0.3311999999999999

647;echoplxx;the seven samurais is indeed one of the greatest movies ever made. kurosawa has done brilliant work especially with the perfection in fight sequences which every director today wants to achieve but does not even get close to him. further i would like to comment on the style that kurosawa adopts while he plans out and details each character in his film. every character has his/her style and depth that they are able to pull out in the movie which i don't think every director can demand and attain from his/her cast. a lot of symbolism is used in the film which not only limits itself to the characters in that time or space but each one of those characters who are related to that particular situation or scene. i believe a lot of movies draw inspiration from kurosawa's style of film making and the future movies will continue to do so.;9 April 2008;10;['great', 'brilliant', 'close', 'able', 'particular', 'future'];0.4733333333333333
648;Pattman;"slow to start, black and white, subtitled. some may see these as faults, but i have a different opinion. kurosawa takes his time to set an utterly fantastic scene in a japan torn by bandits. the villagers cannot defend themselves, nor afford to pay for mercenaries. and yet they take a chance and go in search of aid. the peaceful silences enhance the somber atmosphere at times while also showing the deep thoughfulness of each samurai that lends a hand to the cause. the lack of colour only increases that atmosphere. at no point is there much celebration and so the black and white further adds to the morbidity of it. you may think that this makes it depressing, on the other hand, while certainly not a joyful film, there is still a sense of success despite all that goes on. gripping; masterful; emotional, what more needs to be said. in my view, one of the 5 greatest films ever. purely fantastic.";26 October 2002;10;['slow', 'black', 'white', 'different', 'fantastic', 'peaceful', 'somber', 'deep', 'much', 'black', 'white', 'depressing', 'other', 'joyful', 'masterful', 'emotional', 'more', 'great', 'fantastic'];0.1244791666666666

665;d-thatcher;i am just commenting on my insights. the director of this movie akira kurosawa, and this movie in particular, influenced george lucas to create the star wars movies. it has also been the basis for the magnificent seven, return of the magnificent seven, guns of the magnificent seven, the magnificent seven television series, battle beyond the stars, a bug's life, the 13th warrior, shane, pale rider, high noon, the road warrior, galaxy quest, woman in the dunes, yojimbo, and many others. it is a movie of courage and the power of temptation. it is not so much about the samurai coming to the aid of a community as it is of human nature within a small group of law men. in reality, it can serve as an example to military and officers of the law, that they can be corrupted, but that if they can stand above reproach, the rewards are the in the means themselves.;24 April 2004;10;['particular', 'magnificent', 'magnificent', 'magnificent', 'magnificent', 'pale', 'high', 'many', 'much', 'human', 'small'];0.4366666666666667

669;jamiesnas121;"i've been meaning to watch this film for some time now but have put it off, mostly due to its length, it being in black and white and it also being subtitled and as someone who is just starting to get into more world cinema, especially from the east, this seemed like a bad place to continue right now. in fact, i thought this film was going to be tedious to watch. so, when i put it in my dvd player (or ps2, take your pick) at half ten last night, i decided to finally sit down and watch akira kurosawa's ""masterpiece"" knowing that it won't be finished until half 1 in the morning. when the last scene finished, one word was left in my head, perfect. this film is nothing short of perfection. and it wasn't the action that impressed me the most; it was the character interactions in the scenes leading up to the climax. each samurai (i won't name them as my spelling and memory of the names is anything short of terrible) has a fair amount of screen time, story and overall character. it became easy to distinguish one character from the next as their behaviour was so unique. three samurai's stood out to me through. one was the young rookie who fell in love with the daughter of a farmer. i felt that this was the samurai we were meant to relate to. in fact, out of all 7, i would say he is the most different; his skills aren't as well polished as the others. the second is the samurai who commands the village the most, looking like both a leader and a father figure to the young samurai. the last was the samurai who seemed like the heart of the small army. he was not only funny but also had some emotional depth to him. in fact, i will say when he leaves his post and dresses up as a bandit, that it when we see the biggest development in his character as he see witnesses the effect of his actions. the story was very simple, a village are being attacked by bandits and they need the help of samurai. all they can afford to pay this with is three meals every day. it's the way it's handled however which makes the film stand out among the crowd. it would be rather easy to make this an action orientated film. but it's split into three episodes. they are; 1. the gathering of samurais 2. the preparation for the attack 3. the attack each episode plays out slowly, giving us time to see some character development while the story progresses. in fact, my favourite of all three episodes has to be the first. it was a joy to see who they will get to aid them in their battle. while watching this part, i felt i was there and seeing these other samurais where like meeting up with old friends. the atmosphere in these scenes feels very authentic. while most films will condense the first two acts so they become an hour altogether, this film spreads them out to build tension for the third act. in fact, the film feels like a journey. we are seeing these characters improve their relationships with each other over the course of the film so that the final episode will be as emotional and as action packed as we should expect. i could go into even greater lengths in saying how good this film is, but i will just be repeating what others have said. in fact, to talk about the whole film would fill books and i just don't have the time to do so. however, something i do feel the need to talk about is the music, which is actually pretty epic and something i feel gets overlooked. the best part is when the farmer learns about his daughter and the young samurai, the music that plays and that moment just fits in way too perfectly. it gets the emotion just right and makes the event stand out the most throughout the film. without it, that one moment would have just passed away without a glimmer, but with that one soundtrack, all the tension building around that one sub plot had reached a glorious climax. now, spoiler alert if you have not seen this, but i found the ending to be rather depressing. it stated that even through the villager's had won the battle, the samurais hadn't. this is a rather sad moment in the film as it told us that the samurais had become friends. now that four of them are dead, it's like their friendship has split. this was hinted earlier in the film when three of the samurai go and attack the house, one of the samurai says ""if we lose one, we lose the battle"" (or it was something along those lines) which gave further evidence the seven had indeed lost. overall, the film was one of the best i've ever seen. definitely it my top 20. while i can't recommend this to everyone (if you rate transformers as your favourite trilogy of all time, then i would say stay away from this) i would say give it a try. besides, it's easy to see that it had a huge influence on star war, even the wiping transitions are in here. easily a 10/10.";1 September 2013;10;['black', 'white', 'more', 'bad', 'tedious', 'last', 'last', 'perfect', 'short', 'most', 'short', 'terrible', 'fair', 'overall', 'easy', 'next', 'unique', 'young', 'different', 'polished', 'second', 'most', 'young', 'last', 'small', 'funny', 'emotional', 'big', 'simple', 'easy', 'orientated', 'first', 'other', 'old', 'authentic', 'most', 'first', 'third', 'other', 'final', 'emotional', 'great', 'good', 'whole', 'epic', 'good', 'young', 'most', 'glorious', 'depressing', 'sad', 'dead', 'further', 'good', 'favourite', 'easy', 'huge'];0.1312893081761006

674;verdant4ce;"the seven samurai has lived up to the hype. the anime fans and the internet recommended it. andrei tarkovsky recommended it, the great movie poet that he is. the barenaked ladies even recommend in a song. and now i recommend it. director akira kurosawa was well ahead of his time, even well ahead of our time. this 1954 epic has influenced countless westerns, war movies, gang movies, and hobbit movies, but it still hasn't been surpassed. the plot is straightforward. roving bandits attack a japanese farming village, so the villagers hire some roving warriors (samurai) to defend them. the samurai are noble and colourful creatures, who work for food and no money. we see the villager and samurai worlds collide as they prepare for the bandits' attack. three hours later, there is a majestic battle. some characters live and some die; it is all part of being a samurai. to call the film an epic fails to do it justice: the seven samurai is too gentle to be an epic. although it can be intense at times, the overall tone of the movie is light and friendly. ultimately, this movie is a small-scale story. seven title samurai, forty bandits, and a hundred villagers make up the whole cast, and the characters' actions and influences are confined to the one village. in some ways this is as important as the battle for middle earth or the battle for europe, but in other ways it is more harmless, more human. this the battle for some fields and horses. the simplicity makes it easier for audiences to identify with the characters, and for kurosawa to explore them. the film is humorous for an action movie. it does not have the flashy one-liners of a james bond movie, but it has the sort of light moments that are used in reader's digest magazines. an important secret is blown in a minute as people keep walking into the room. a crazy man poses in the enemy's uniform and steals guns. an old lady ""avenges"" her son's death by hitting a prisoner with a rake. these moments of strange humour catch us off our guard, much the same as the ""comic relief"" in shakespeare's plays. there is a time-out from worrying and everyone gets to be playful and human for a minute. of course, the opposite of humour is the ""visual poetry"", the delicate images in which our story is told. like humour scenes, breath-taking shots can change the pace of the movie, although they deliver a very different catharsis, an opportunity for peaceful reflection. kurosawa went to painting school, after all, and it shows here. here we see horses fall in the mud. here we see a man's face peering through some leaves. here two friends chat in the light of a camp-fire. here the view from a hilltop reminds us how small the village is. the actors are well-chosen for their expressive faces. jarring fast-motion battle scenes exist in the seven samurai, but so do languid japanese glimpses of nature. this movie runs the visual gauntlet without ever losing its flow. the movie follows a different structure from most action flicks: for the first two hours, we do not see the bandits. the samurai spend a long time planning for the enemy's arrival, and the battle itself lasts just a few harsh moments. this is a more accurate and interesting sort of war story than we usually see. the movie has an abundance of re-watching potential; i feel that there were many patterns and moments and silences that i missed the first time around. i felt like every line two or three meanings, and i was often tempted to rewind a scene and watch it more closely. the seven samurai deserves its place in movie history. i can now understand the endless praise it receives from great directors and cool people alike. although the film was made fifty years ago and it used only black and white, it is still an experience to watch. akira kurosawa has told this story so richly that it continues to be the benchmark for films today.";16 October 2005;10;['great', 'countless', 'straightforward', 'japanese', 'noble', 'colourful', 'majestic', 'gentle', 'intense', 'overall', 'light', 'friendly', 'small', 'whole', 'important', 'middle', 'other', 'harmless', 'human', 'easy', 'humorous', 'flashy', 'light', 'digest', 'important', 'crazy', 'old', 'strange', 'same', 'comic', 'playful', 'human', 'visual', 'delicate', 'different', 'peaceful', 'small', 'expressive', 'jarring', 'fast', 'languid', 'japanese', 'visual', 'different', 'most', 'first', 'long', 'few', 'harsh', 'accurate', 'interesting', 'many', 'first', 'endless', 'great', 'cool', 'black', 'white'];0.1493464052287581

687;scion-1;a perfect movie. i didn't find anything i wouldn't like about this movie. excellent directing from kurosawa. very good actors, especially toshiro mifune in the role of kikuchiyo. very good image and scenery. it is somehow emotional. the story might look simple but every character has a story of its own. the character that i liked the most was the one of kikuchiyo, a farmer's son that wanted to be considered a samurai. a very complex character, and a very interesting acting from behalf of toshiro mifune. at the end when just 3 samurai remain from the initial seven, you don't feel any joy for the victory of the villagers. worth seeing. stefan romania;29 March 2005;10;['perfect', 'excellent', 'good', 'good', 'emotional', 'simple', 'own', 'complex', 'interesting', 'initial', 'worth'];0.4090909090909091

""seven samurai"" is simply one of the greatest films ever made and one i've always been impressed and fascinated by. toshiro mifune gets star billing, and deservedly so as he turns in a powerhouse performance, but takashi shimura's character is the focal point of the film. i recommend his star turn in kurosawa's ""ikiru"" as well - a very different story. what makes ""seven samurai"" so special is how each character is so completely written and portrayed. hundreds of others have written much more eloquently about this film so i won't get into details about why i loved it ... except to say that my other favourite character is the farmer, yohei, a stock ""sad sack"" type who turns out to be so much more.";23 July 2005;10;['favourite', 'new', 'old', 'relevant', 'great', 'impressed', 'fascinated', 'focal', 'different', 'special', 'other', 'favourite', 'sad', 'more'];0.2668506493506494
689;villamota;"i watched ran, another kurosawa film, a couple of years ago, and although i enjoyed it i found it far too long... it seems that asian audiences used to be much more used to long flicks than the western. the pace in the seven samurai is, too, definitely slower than we're used to now in this frenetic matrix-esquire ere, but the film surprisingly maintains the interest all throughout. japanese people are quite different to westerners and for us it's a bit hard at the beginning to get used to reading their expressions and understanding their behaviours and reactions, but once you've managed to do it (the film gives you plenty of time for this) you start enjoying the fantastic depth of the characters and the situations. one thing i'd like to comment about is how subtly sensual the ""love sequences"" between the young samurai and the peasant's daughter are. the scene when they're alone in the wood and he fails to ""make a move"" is really erotic, although in an extremely non-explicit way.";23 May 2005;9;['asian', 'used', 'long', 'western', 'slow', 'frenetic', 'japanese', 'different', 'fantastic', 'sensual', 'young', 'alone', 'erotic', 'non', 'explicit'];0.0944444444444444
690;videoboy009;this is one of my favorite movies its a look at the real life of the samurai. they were human, they didn't have special powers or unreal strength. however when the time to fight came, the were much stronger then the rest, they held their head high. the movie takes its time but the plot keeps me interested the whole time. it a real samurai movie. i watched it one day when i was in film school i don't remember why but it was awesome. they really got into it, the story about how they come together and what they wanted from the job, and the politics, and deception, they movie had a lot to offer. the fight scenes are nothing to today audience but they still offer danger and a more realistic approach to a fight. its about how these people lived and what had happen. its awesome but not a date movie! its one of my top 5 favorite films. hell star wars was inspired by it so its cool.;21 July 2014;10;['favorite', 'real', 'human', 'special', 'unreal', 'strong', 'high', 'interested', 'whole', 'real', 'awesome', 'realistic', 'awesome', 'top', 'favorite'];0.4222619047619047

692;ViswanathI;"kurosawa was considered the most western of great japanese directors (too western, some of his japanese critics sniffed). ""seven samurai"" represents a great divide in his work; most of his earlier films, jeck observes, subscribe to the japanese virtues of teamwork, fitting in, going along, conforming. all his later films are about misfits, nonconformists and rebels. the turning point can be seen in his greatest film, ""ikiru"" (1952), in which a bureaucrat spends his days in the rote performance of meaningless duties but decides when he is dying to break loose and achieve at least one meaningful thing.there is also an instinctive feeling for composition. kurosawa constantly uses deep focus to follow simultaneous actions in the foreground, middle and background. often he delineates the distance with barriers. consider a shot where the samurai, in the foreground, peer out through the slats of a building and across an empty ground to the sight of the bandits, peering in through the slats of a barrier erected against them. kurosawa's moving camera often avoids cuts in order to make comparisons, as when he will begin on dialogue in a closeup, sweep through a room or a clearing, and end on a closeup of another character who is the point of the dialogue.";9 November 2015;10;['western', 'great', 'japanese', 'western', 'japanese', 'great', 'most', 'early', 'subscribe', 'japanese', 'later', 'great', 'rote', 'meaningless', 'loose', 'least', 'meaningful', 'instinctive', 'deep', 'simultaneous', 'empty', 'closeup'];0.1484162895927601
693;tsmith04;seven samurai tells the story of seven unemployed, 16th century samurai who are hired by a poor village under attack from a group of bandits. an uncomplicated story indeed, kurosawa directs his cast beautifully, mixing the individual abilities of his actors and the simplicity of his plot, and ends up with a work of artistic cinema considered by most critics to be among the greatest films ever made, and even by reviewers of the american film industry. this nearly 3 hour masterpiece is more an anthology of scenes of captivation. the epic battle scenes at the end of the film are climaxed by the bandits' final surge into the small, countryside village that is the centerpiece of the movie. the samurai of whom the leadership role is given, yohei, stands directly in the center of the town 'square' and grandly lets arrow after arrow soar from his bow towards his sworn enemies, all the while dealing with the immense 'buckets' of rain that seemed to be falling from the sky. it seems to be that samurai could very well be a ballad of waran illustrative dance. kikuchiyo, played by the famed japanese actor toshiro mifune, exemplifies this brilliantly through the antics in which he displays throughout the film. you nearly feel as if you're watching a 'ballet of war' when he dances around, boldly and bravely charging enemy bandits throughout the film. and he does provide for occasional comic reliefsomething you probably wouldn't expect in an older piece. kurosawa has directed many award-winning films in the japanese film circuit, and is considered among the best of the best of all the worlds' directors, but with seven samurai, he truly delivers the tour de force of his career, a piece worth its weight in gold, and a film that still awes us decades after its release.;17 June 2005;10;['unemployed', 'poor', 'uncomplicated', 'individual', 'artistic', 'most', 'great', 'american', 'epic', 'final', 'small', 'immense', 'waran', 'illustrative', 'japanese', 'occasional', 'comic', 'old', 'many', 'japanese', 'good', 'good', 'worth'];0.1912280701754386
694;freakinsweetkamehameha;as the offspring of a learned, cultured, if not a bit weird,dad. i was introduced to foreign films at an early age. i first saw 'the seven samurai' at around the age of six or seven. though i enjoyed the film- i hadn't realised its sheer brilliance until a later age. earlier this year, my dad received 'the seven samurai' on dvd as a gift. i watched it and was blown away. 'the seven samurai is an insight into 15th century (i think) japan and the way things work. the village around which the film is based is attacked every harvest by bandits. on overhearing when the bandits will attack next, the villagers come upon a plan of action. they are to hire samurai (skilled warriors, much like knights) to fight the bandits. what follows is the epic which has survived decades and is still seen as one of the greatest films of all time. with mind-blowing cinematography and a feudal soundtrack- the seven samurai is a must-see!;12 January 2006;10;['cultured', 'weird', 'foreign', 'early', 'sheer', 'later', 'skilled', 'great', 'feudal'];0.1107142857142857

(spoiler?:) the lines that most resonated are the words of the leader of the samurai to the young one when he is accepted into the group: ""i know, i know what you are going to say; i once was of the same age as you: hone your skills, go to battle, earn fame for your prowess, become the ruler of a state in a castle... but, while you are thinking that way... look here, your hair turns white like mine... but then, your parents, your family, your relatives are long gone..""";10 June 2005;10;['extended', 'many', 'japanese', 'possible', 'quiet', 'old', 'ronin', 'young', 'inital', 'unsurpassed', 'insignificant', 'real', 'young', 'same', 'white'];0.0944444444444444
