0;TheLittleSongbird;it is hard to describe the brilliance that is goodfellas. as good as raging bull and taxi driver are, i think goodfellas is martin scorsese's best film and is a textbook example of a great director at the peak of his talents. the film crackles with raw energy and enthusiasm, the film is superbly directed and the final sequence is nothing short of stunning. the script is also excellent with memorable quotes, the story is never less than compelling and the pop and rock soundtrack is winning. the cinematography and detail is immaculate, and the ensemble cast is one of film's finest. joe pesci won an oscar for his performance, and as good as he was, he is perfectly matched by robert deniro and ray liotta. all in all, it is a brilliant film and an instant classic no matter what time, day, week or year. 10/10 bethany cox;9 January 2011;10;['hard', 'good', 'good', 'great', 'raw', 'final', 'short', 'stunning', 'excellent', 'memorable', 'less', 'compelling', 'immaculate', 'ensemble', 'fine', 'good', 'brilliant', 'instant'];0.3642227564102564
1;bkoganbing;the gangster film has been redefined so many times in cinema history it will be interesting to see how it is redefined once again. goodfellas is a milestone film in that regard because just as public enemy and little caesar defined it in the thirties, the godfather trilogy in the seventies and eighties, goodfellas set the standard that all other films including martin scorsese similar casino try to meet. the interesting thing is that martin scorsese is young enough to redefine it again with another work. with ray liotta narrating his own life in crime in a flashback as real life criminal henry hill, martin scorsese offers us one fascinating glimpse of the criminal life in the eisenhower to reagan era. henry hill even as a child got sucked into the criminal life as a kid, as he said all he ever wanted to be was a gangster. tutored by both robert deniro and paul sorvino, liotta takes part in one of the biggest heists of all time of lufthansa airlines at jfk airport during the seventies. goodfellas is the story of the events from henry hill's perspective leading up to the heist and the aftermath. for myself i've never seen the gangster mentality better expressed on screen except maybe by sean connery in family business. liotta and connery operate from the same mindset. if you work hard and hope it pays off in success, you're a dope. if you want something, just take it. when you come right down to it, that's how criminals think, it's the rest of us who are fools. goodfellas was nominated for several oscars, but came away with only one winner, joe pesci in the role of crazy tommy devito. he's another criminal type, one who's driven by a terrible inferiority complex due to his short stature and does terrible things even to his own peers. and those peers don't forget as you see what happens to pesci in goodfellas. this turned out to be a career role for pesci. he's a multi-talented man who's got an incredible range and can play everything from the home alone comedies to stone killers like here in goodfellas or in casino. there's usually a contest in which scorsese fans argue whether casino or goodfellas is better. i happen to like casino, but without the success of goodfellas, casino would not have been made. for a fascinating look at the criminal mindset, goodfellas is an absolute must.;15 February 2007;9;['many', 'interesting', 'public', 'little', 'other', 'similar', 'interesting', 'young', 'own', 'real', 'fascinating', 'criminal', 'criminal', 'big', 'same', 'several', 'crazy', 'criminal', 'terrible', 'short', 'terrible', 'own', 'multi', 'talented', 'incredible', 'alone', 'scorsese', 'well', 'fascinating', 'criminal', 'absolute'];0.06875
2;Leofwine_draca;martin scorsese's unflinching portrayal of life in the mafia is a rightly acclaimed epic, at times funny, depressing but most of all frightening, all the more so because it's based on a true story. basically it's the story of ray liotta's character's rise and fall in the mafia, and the way his relationships change with the various figures there as times come and go. the acting is what makes this film so engaging, and ray liotta excels as the bright young man who eventually becomes a drug addict. his transformation is brilliant as he ages thirty years and the acting choice couldn't have been better. robert de niro is on hand to deliver some real class to the proceedings too, and he's as good as he ever was as the seemingly nice but deadly jimmy. however joe pesci steals the overacting awards with his portrayal of the foul-mouthed psychotic tommy, who spends the film shooting and beating those who offend him. pesci is both funny and frightening as a maniac who doesn't think twice about killing people, and his kinetic performance bursts off the screen in a blaze of fury. the rest of the cast, including liotta's wife and paul sorvino, also put in well-judged and realistic performances. while some people may be put off by the long running length, this is engrossing viewing, as the film charts the various gruesome demises of unfortunate characters (the opening body in the boot being a standout in sheer brutality), liotta's growing paranoia (the helicopter scenes are memorable) and eventual capture, and the characters' changing loyalties. goodfellas was really the final word about gangster life, at least until casino came along.;24 July 2016;10;['funny', 'depressing', 'most', 'frightening', 'true', 'various', 'engaging', 'bright', 'young', 'brilliant', 'well', 'real', 'good', 'nice', 'deadly', 'foul', 'mouthed', 'psychotic', 'funny', 'frightening', 'kinetic', 'realistic', 'long', 'various', 'gruesome', 'unfortunate', 'sheer', 'memorable', 'eventual', 'final', 'least'];0.0626666666666666

6;classicsoncall;"the first time i saw ""goodfellas"", i didn't realize it was based on the nichlas pileggi book 'wiseguy'. a lot of stuff seemed so familiar, and of course, the name henry hill was the tip-off, a non-italian in the world of mafioso high rollers and hit men. i read the book shortly after it came out, and the movie seemed to come out very quickly after. i don't remember a whole lot about the book now, but some of the things that stand out are the air france job, the lufthansa heist, and that bit about feeding a guy to a lion. oh yeah, and the burial, exhumation and reburial of billy batts. you have to admit, ""goodfellas"" has the best ba-da-bing opening of all time when tommy (joe pesci) goes berserk on batts in the car trunk and just keeps wailing. i've read a few of the other comments in the reviews section for this picture, and can only chuckle at a few of the naive posters who think that what happens on screen here is forced and not very believable. i can only surmise that they didn't grow up in new york or it's suburb environs, because mob rub-outs were a staple on the front pages of the new york daily news and the post throughout the sixties. usually they more closely resembled michael corleone's first hit in the italian restaurant in ""the godfather"", but nevertheless, this kind of brutality did occur. although i have to say, the way tommy whacked michael imperioli was a little over the top. i guess the most memorable scene in the movie for me was pesci giving ray liotta the business in that 'who's funny' routine. for first time viewers, you're not really sure where tommy's going to take things because he's such a loose cannon. then suddenly, pesci calls himself on it, and you know full well he was playing around with the new kid. the character pesci was portraying, real life mobster tommy desimone, was in fact a young aspiring gangster with psychopathic tendencies specializing in truck hijacking and stolen goods. so for those who think ""goodfellas"" is the best gangster flick ever, fair enough, but putting it up against the first two 'godfathers' is a little bit of a stretch for my money. i also prefer the coen brothers' take on crime in ""miller's crossing"". but this one's based on a true story, and you can't get more real than some of the outrageous things that happened in the life of wise guy henry hill. for an outsider, he could be a real goombah.";3 September 2011;9;['first', 'familiar', 'non', 'italian', 'mafioso', 'high', 'whole', 'good', 'few', 'other', 'few', 'naive', 'believable', 'front', 'first', 'italian', 'little', 'memorable', 'funny', 'routine', 'first', 'sure', 'loose', 'full', 'new', 'real', 'young', 'psychopathic', 'good', 'fair', 'first', 'little', 'true', 'real', 'outrageous', 'real'];0.1549807089462262

10;rmax304823;"a fine tribal study of modern gangsterism in new york city. there are one or two allusions to being a ""made man"" but the words ""mafia"" and ""cosa nostra"" never appear, though all the main figures are italian, observe italian moral codes, and occasionally lapse into the language of the old country. if you really want to be a member of the goodfellas, it's not enough to be simply part italian. you need to be all italian, with traceable ancestry to the motherland, preferably sicily. everyone except some federal agents are corrupt. the wives know what's going on and are often complicit, though they have little to say about business decisions. they're satisfied with the solidarity of the larger family, the special parking places, the secret entrances to the copacabana, the respect shown themselves and their well-groomed husbands, and the general opulence of their life styles. the girl friends enjoy many of the same privileges but are mainly the subject of jokes, which wives and children are not. well, some are madonnas and some are whores. the cops are partners in crime, whether the gangsters are on the streets or in prison. they become your major domos for a few cartons of cigarettes and an occasional big bill tucked into a shirt pocket. your first jail term turns into a rite of passage, and you're given a celebration before you're packed off. the men clap and cry out ""your cherry is broke now."" prison itself is not a bad place if you're a wise guy. no one would dream of trying to rape you. you live with friends and share elaborate dinners and good wines with them. there are only two problems; one is interactional, the other moral and economic. as for the interactional problem, you can never really tell whether someone will become a ""rat,"" not even if you've known him all your life. from the point of view of a protagonist like henry hill, whose story this is, it's very bad to be a rat instead of a stand-up guy. on the other hand, it's much better to be a rat instead of a dead guy. severe beatings are common, even for men who are no more than irritating or even for innocents like mailmen. and when an important deal is at stake, whacking is necessary. whacking is also applied to men who unwisely insult others, because this is a culture of honor. it's like the old west without wyatt earp. ""when you call me that, smile."" and sometimes smiling isn't enough. the derision must be clearly couched. half a couch may not do. personal affronts call for a passionate butchery, but business transactions are cold blooded and maximally effective. this social system is real enough. in certain bars in new york and new jersey i was unwise enough to make some joke about mafia hangouts and received warnings. and in little charlie's restaurant on kenmare street in little italy, two tables were always kept empty in case some local businessmen decided to drop in unannounced. the movie is told from henry hill's (ray liotta's) point of view and he narrates most of it. hill was half irish and married a jewish girl but was accepted, within certain limitations. that brings up the moral questions built into the film. these guys are friendly and generous to each other. but who pay for all that reckless spending? you and i. the gang isn't a charitable organization. every time we buy something or rent an apartment, it costs a little more because of them, and they contribute nothing except mutual support. it's an immoral subculture in which the goals of society -- respect, wealth, material satisfaction, friendship -- are accepted, but society's means of achieving those goals -- following the rules, upholding the law, respecting the rights of strangers -- are rejected. the sociologist robert k. merton called them ""innovators"" and that's what they are. they invent and follow illegal rules for achieving society's goals. from an ethical perspective, it's a much better story than francis ford coppola's ""the godfather"" series, which was an apologia for the mafia, portrayed as a neighborhood organization that simply fills certain control functions that the regular police will or can not. no one was killed in ""the godfather"" unless he was a coward and a traitor and deserved it. in ""goodfellas"", a kid gets shot through the foot for being slow in delivering drinks to a table, and the incident is treated as a stupid joke. no one even tries justifying the act. when the same kid is later slaughtered for a resentful remark, the dead body is treated as a nuisance. the acting is unimpeachable, and so is the production design. you can almost smell the cigars, the perfume, the marinara sauce cooking in the large pot on the stove. (everybody eats a lot in this movie.) you should definitely see it if you haven't already. it's naturalism is convincing and there is no marlon brando to sympathize with.";26 July 2012;8;['fine', 'tribal', 'modern', 'main', 'italian', 'italian', 'moral', 'old', 'enough', 'italian', 'italian', 'traceable', 'federal', 'corrupt', 'complicit', 'little', 'satisfied', 'large', 'special', 'secret', 'general', 'many', 'same', 'major', 'few', 'occasional', 'big', 'first', 'bad', 'wise', 'elaborate', 'good', 'interactional', 'other', 'moral', 'economic', 'interactional', 'bad', 'other', 'well', 'dead', 'severe', 'common', 'important', 'necessary', 'old', 'enough', 'personal', 'passionate', 'cold', 'blooded', 'effective', 'social', 'real', 'certain', 'unwise', 'little', 'little', 'empty', 'local', 'unannounced', 'most', 'irish', 'jewish', 'certain', 'moral', 'friendly', 'generous', 'other', 'reckless', 'charitable', 'little', 'more', 'mutual', 'immoral', 'illegal', 'ethical', 'well', 'certain', 'regular', 'slow', 'stupid', 'same', 'resentful', 'dead', 'unimpeachable', 'large', 'convincing'];0.0436939268461007

16;Quinoa1984;"""i'm an average nobody...i get to live the rest of my life like a shnook."" so says henry hill, in one of the truly amazing denouements in film history. here's a man who could've been easily killed off- at first by his wife, then by his own crew- and evaded it by sneaking out the 'easy' route. yet hill hasn't changed. he'll always complain about not having the good life anymore. the wrap-up makes totally clear what this saga is: the american dream realized as a given, and in the form of a corrupted mind-set. goodfellas is the ""if-you-put-a-gun-to-my-head"" favorite movie for me, and by that token appropriate as there are many a gun pointed at a head during the film, and sometimes with a big result (the most shocking when i first saw it, and still brutal on a big screen, is seeing sam jackson's brains splattered all across the room like it's some ritualistic slaughter). it's true bravura storytelling, without a single shot or moment that needs to be excised or missed. to say it's a 'perfect' movie might be overstating it; what is 'perfect', after all? scorsese does strive for- and arguably succeeds- a kind of perfection in balancing comedy and drama, like a tightrope walker going above a bed of hot coals with a rambunctious pesci threatening with scissors like the oklahoma kid. you're almost afraid to laugh, and a good many times (especially if you've seen the film dozens of times like myself) you almost feel apart of the group of guys laughing about stuff that *shouldn't* be funny. but then there's what could be the greatest shot of the film, where we see a first-person of all the small-time hoods introducing themselves (""what's up guy?"" ""i'm gonna get the papers, get the papers""), where it's like we as the audience are let into the clubhouse, following them along into the back-room as they unload coats...wait, he needed suits, not coats. it's endlessly watchable as a kind of raucous, dangerous pop entertainment, and it feels as though it's gone by in much briefer time than has actually passed in 146 minutes. maybe as part of a subjective thing i can kind of relate to many of the characters, not so much because of what they do in their criminal deeds or hill's mistress or feeding people to lions and whatnot, but the little ticks of behavior (a little note like when hill rushes out of his coked-up girlfriend's apartment, laughing maniacally, is like any given day with my brother). but a personal connection can only be so much to recommend this motion picture like no other. as one of the benchmarks of cinema of my generation it's got everything that many somewhat-to-big-time-sophisticated moviegoers look for: over-done classic scenes (""am i a clown"" is the ""you're talking' to me"" of the movie, and probably not even as great until the ""last week this prick asked me to christen his kid"" line), iconoclastic techniques with the camera and editing (everything from the freeze frames to the music and narration to the shots that have the intensity of coke or full on rage and adrenaline in beating a guy's face in with a gun), and performances that should be considered essential to see for anyone becoming an actor years and years from now. if there was ever an american film that could absorb, entertain, enthrall, and interest me on all fronts of style and substance as much as goodfellas does on every viewing.";12 January 2000;10;['average', 'amazing', 'own', 'easy', 'good', 'clear', 'american', 'corrupted', 'favorite', 'appropriate', 'many', 'big', 'shocking', 'brutal', 'big', 'ritualistic', 'true', 'single', 'perfect', 'perfect', 'hot', 'rambunctious', 'oklahoma', 'afraid', 'good', 'many', 'funny', 'great', 'first', 'small', 'up', 'back', 'watchable', 'raucous', 'dangerous', 'much', 'subjective', 'many', 'criminal', 'little', 'little', 'personal', 'much', 'other', 'many', 'big', 'sophisticated', 'classic', 'great', 'last', 'iconoclastic', 'full', 'essential', 'american'];0.1623015873015872

26;zardoz-13;"""raging bull"" director martin scorsese received his third oscar nomination as best director for ""goodfellas,"" starring robert de niro, ray liotta, and joe pesci, an engrossing epic about life in the mafia based on nicholas pileggi's bestselling biography about real-life gangster henry hill. this blue collar crime saga differs from mafia melodramas like francis ford coppola's ""the godfather"" because scorsese refrains from either eavesdropping on the upper echelons of organized crime management or depicting the actual logistics involved in its major heist. in other words, scenes concerning the hierarchy of mob bosses convening to resolve rivalries among their families or scenes about the actual heist are never shown. nevertheless, ""goodfellas"" is violent, profane, and unrelenting in its r-rated portrayal of crime and punishment. pesci won the best supporting actor's oscar, while ""goodfellas"" received oscar nominations for best picture, best film editing, and best screenplay based on material adapted from another medium. incidentally, kevin costner's ""dances with wolves"" trumped ""goodfellas"" for the oscar. essentially, scorsese's film traces the rise and fall of brooklyn-born, irish/sicilian american henry hill from working as a teenager at a mafia cab stand to his adult exploits as a full-fledged mafia soldier. scorsese glamorizes hill's life during the first hour as a crook, and the young hill wins sympathy as an underdog. everything turns to sour in the second hour, however, as the mutt mutates into a murderer. after several years of getting away with his crimes, our protagonist winds up in prison, gets paroled, resorts to selling cocaine, finds himself at odds with his own mafia types before he decides to participate in the justice department's witness protection program. incidentally, the title ""goodfellas"" refers to the mafia concept that when an individual works for the mob then he becomes one of mob. in other words, the family that slays and steals together stays together. the opening scene in ""goodfellas"" sets the tone for this grim film. jimmy conway (robert de niro of ""raging bull""), tommy devito (joe pesci of ""lethal weapon 2"") and henry (ray liotta of ""article 99"") are cruising down the highway at night when henry gets curious about a noise that sounds suspiciously like their sedan has had a flat tire. after henry pulls the car over, jimmy and tommy inspect the trunk where they have stashed the bloody body of a man swathed with sheets. tommy stabs the man repeatedly and jimmy blasts at the man with his revolver. the camera pushes in on henry watching jimmy and tommy kill the man sprawled helplessly in the trunk and then we hear henry utter in a voice-over, ""as far back as i can remember, i've always wanted to be a gangster."" intermittently, the liotta character addresses the audience, furnishing important information about the mafia milieu, until the last few minutes when the protagonist breaks the fourth wall and addresses the audience. ""goodfellas"" qualifies as a slam-bang crime thriller. this is not a film about set-pieces like you see in coppola's ""godfather"" movies or sergio leone's ""once upon a time in america."" scorsese infiltrates the audience into the mafia and shares many of the mob's secrets that have become familiar with film-going audiences in a way that seems fresh and off-the-cuff. initially, we sympathize with young henry (newcomer christopher serrone) who takes a job at tuddy cicero's cab stand running errands for the gangsters in the neighborhood. before long henry is earning more money than his hot-tempered father, and he loves the respect that the mobsters lavish on him. tuddy (frank delio of ""kiss of death"") lets him park cadillacs, sell contraband items, smash car windows and play fire-bug. unlike his working class irish father who takes a belt to him when he discovers that his son has quit attending school, the mobsters are more of a family to henry than his own kin. as an adult, henry becomes fast friends with jimmy, who henry assures us is ""one of the most feared guy in the city"" and pint-sized tommy who isn't afraid of anybody. this insider's look at the mafia follows these three mafiateers as they steal, rob, lie, cheat, and kill their way to the a fortune. when tommy cannot convince a girl to go out on a date with unless he finds a suitable fellow for her friend, tommy twists henry's reluctant arm. henry meets karen (lorraine bracco, later of hbo's ""the sopranos"") who becomes his wife. there is one scene when henry escorts karen to a popular nightclub that dazzles her because everybody showers them with respect and praise. although she doesn't know exactly how henry makes his living, henry tells her that he works for the union in the construction business. no sooner does henry marry karen and have kids than he starts cheating on her with whores that he sets up in nearby houses and karen initially believes him when he cannot come home for business reasons. one morning henry awakens to karen straddling him in bed with a snub-nosed revolver aimed between his eyes. this is a chilling scene. it is a testament to scorsese's skill as co-writer and director that the repugnant world of crime looks so compelling. jimmy and tommy are brutal, unrepentant thugs. a life of crime turns henry into a cold, calculating operator who enjoys all the advantages of mob living. like a movie made during the production code era (1934-1968) that dictated that crime should not pay, our protagonist gets his comeuppance. nevertheless, scorsese shows his sense of humor in one scene when tommy, jimmy, and henry awaken tommy's mother at his house and she insists on cooking a meal for them. scorsese never lets the momentum of ""goodfellas"" slacken and this crime drama boasts enough surprises to keep audiences on their toes. altogether, ""goodfellas"" rates as one of the top ten mob movies and its soundtrack of nostalgic tunes doesn't hurt it.";8 October 2009;10;['third', 'good', 'real', 'blue', 'scorsese', 'upper', 'actual', 'major', 'other', 'actual', 'violent', 'profane', 'unrelenting', 'oscar', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'irish', 'first', 'young', 'second', 'several', 'own', 'other', 'grim', 'lethal', 'curious', 'flat', 'bloody', 'important', 'last', 'few', 'fourth', 'many', 'familiar', 'fresh', 'young', 'long', 'more', 'lavish', 'frank', 'smash', 'irish', 'more', 'own', 'fast', 'sized', 'afraid', 'suitable', 'reluctant', 'popular', 'nearby', 'nosed', 'chilling', 'repugnant', 'compelling', 'brutal', 'unrepentant', 'cold', 'enough', 'top', 'nostalgic'];0.0625

30;AlsExGal;"after you see this movie, all other mobster movies you see or ever have seen will seem like garbage. they and their cast of characters will all appear cartoonish in comparison. of course, this is a movie about the mafia from the working man/gangster point of view, where ""the godfather"" was a mafia movie filmed from the viewpoint of the executive suite, so there really is no valid comparison there. ""goodfellas"" really does seem ahead of its time when you realize that the only artistic work about the mafia that compares to it in quality is the hbo series ""the sopranos"", which debuted nine years after this movie was made. ""goodfellas"" tells the real-life story of mobster henry hill, and it is largely true, although there are individual scenes that are out of sequence and others that were added for dramatic effect, such as karen hill flushing the cocaine down the toilet during the drug bust. also, tommy, the character that joe pesci played and the part for which he won an oscar, was actually a composite of two separate gangsters. other details are omitted completely, probably because they would have spun the movie off in too many different directions. for example, crime boss ""big paulie"" actually was having an affair with henry hill's wife, karen. when tommy tried to rape her and paulie found out, that was when he alerted the gambinos to the fact that tommy had killed their missing crew member, ""made man"" billy batts, nine years earlier. this is the true reason that it took so long for tommy to be killed over that incident. thus, masterful direction of the story by martin scorsese in what was probably his finest film is why the audience has a more cohesive view of the mobsters portrayed in this movie than if we had been told every last detail. what really makes this movie great is all of the personal details that enable you to see these mobsters living a largely suburban life, concerned about kids' birthday parties and getting the sauce just right for dinner, and all the while completely immersed in a completely amoral lifestyle in which murder and bribes solve everything- a lifestyle to which they would never voluntarily choose an alternative.";18 November 2009;10;['other', 'executive', 'valid', 'only', 'artistic', 'real', 'true', 'individual', 'dramatic', 'such', 'separate', 'other', 'many', 'different', 'big', 'true', 'masterful', 'fine', 'cohesive', 'last', 'great', 'personal', 'suburban', 'amoral'];0.1800925925925925

""cast and crew""(self-explanatory) and ""cop and crook""(the actual henry, and one of the feds who worked against the mob). all of it is worth the time. i recommend this to fans of gangster movies and/or authentic, biographical ones. just make sure you can handle it. 10/10";17 June 2009;10;['special', 'faithful', 'honest', 'good', 'bad', 'glamorous', 'brutal', 'funny', 'charming', 'bloody', 'intense', 'entertaining', 'excellent', 'incredible', 'memorable', 'quotable', 'interesting', 'strong', 'top', 'fantastic', 'same', 'single', 'perfect', 'marvelous', 'graphic', 'unrestrained', 'explanatory', 'actual', 'worth', 'authentic', 'biographical', 'sure'];0.3228479853479853

39;StevePulaski;"scorsese's goodfellas is an incorruptible masterpiece with morals, wit, black humor, and cringe-inducing material, some of which the most graphic and brutal the man himself has ever filmed. it portrays the life of organized crime over the course of three decades, showing the central character who grew up idolizing the mob before almost despising it towards the end of the film. the result is a slick, unmatchable look at the way mobsters spoke, operated, and functioned from the fifties to the eighties and is one of the most powerful pictures for not only scorsese, but for film itself in general. the story revolves around irish-italian henry hill (liotta) who, ever since he was a youngster, looked up to the mob in his home of new york city. he says he wanted to be a gangster more than the president, because the gangsters had an untold amount of respect and dignity. the job revolves around persistency, bravery, emotionless devotion where one bad choice could ruin every good one you ever made in your life. hill is taken under the wing of mob boss paulie cicero (sorvino) and his loyal team of jimmy conway (de niro) and tommy devito (pesci). conway operates as sort of an everyman mobster who is constantly watching his back, yet at times seems like he will crumble under all the pressure. while tommy, on the other hand, is animalistic, unapologetic, and simply shameless, reacting impulsively on violence if someone looks at him the wrong way. pesci's role as tommy devito earned him an oscar for best supporting actor, quite possibly the most violent character to ever win. while hill is working for cicero at a young age he learns two of the most important life lessons early on in his career; ""never rat on your friends, and always keep your mouth shut."" this begins hill's long, relentless career as a mobster, which involves stealing, plotting, scheming, and constant commitment to the job. he gets married at a young age, to the heart-stopping beauty karen (bracco), a jewish girl, much to the dismay of her mother. karen falls for hill's bravery, leadership, protection, and smarts early on, but realizes that once you married a mobster, you're now married to the job as well. that makes you a mob-wife; a position you can't refuse. throughout the film, we see how hill manages his mobster duties and his overall position. this is where the very scorsese aspect comes into play. if you've been exposed to enough of the genius director, you'll know what he does best; the stories of people who rise and fall, or endured a reasonable amount of glory in a specific point in their life. in casino, it showed a man named sam ""aces"" rothstein, played by de niro as well, struggle to run a vegas casino with a number of roadside distractions. he was at the height of his game once, but a few faulty decisions on his part ran him straight into the ground. in the aviator, one of scorsese's more recent films, we meet the unsung filmmaker and aviation expert howard hughes, portrayed by leonardo dicaprio. there, we dissect hughes' glory years from when he directed the most expensive film of all time, to when he plummeted into a sea of nothing, becoming a sheltered germaphobe for a good remainder of his life. in goodfellas, we see how a man can go from being a big shot to a self-indulgent, paranoid man consumed alive by his own greed, disrespect, and betrayal. another recurring element, in pretty much every film by scorsese, is we can see scorsese's undeniable fascination with the material. we understand why he took the project just by the way he shot the film. we can see he takes a stern liking to the mob lifestyle, and sometimes, we get the faint impression he admires them. on the surface, and if we were to make a broad generalization, untold riches, cute italian women, different ones every night, close friends, and fancy clubs and restaurants sounds divine to me. but they don't tell you that you must sleep with one eye open, and constantly avoid getting whacked. that part they left out of the manual. the performances, like in any film by the master, are simply divine - not a single one off pitch or even average. one performance that has gone overlooked is lorraine bracco. she is in the same position actress sharon stone would find herself in when playing ginger in casino, five years later. bracco is in the position to overact, but never does. she is constantly improving as time goes on, and handles her climatic instances well. not to mention, the male performances by de niro, liotta, pesci, and sorvino are all absolutely wonderful, always hitting the correct note in every place. goodfellas is an american classic. not a modern classic; a regular ol' classic. it is an enriching movie, with stylish writing (by scorsese himself and nicolas pileggi, who wrote the novel the film is based on, wiseguy), inevitably stellar performances, and an unforgettable score and setting that might leave you breathless at some points. the hardest part in any scorsese film is picking a favorite scene. i think i've found one. it involves one the best jump scenes in any film i've seen recently. along with evoking regret, naive instincts, and betrayal. it involves joe pesci. i will not say more. starring: ray liotta, robert de niro, joe pesci, paul sorvino, and lorraine bracco. directed by: martin scorsese.";23 March 2012;10;['incorruptible', 'black', 'graphic', 'brutal', 'central', 'slick', 'unmatchable', 'powerful', 'scorsese', 'general', 'irish', 'italian', 'more', 'untold', 'bad', 'good', 'loyal', 'other', 'animalistic', 'unapologetic', 'shameless', 'wrong', 'good', 'violent', 'young', 'important', 'long', 'relentless', 'constant', 'young', 'jewish', 'much', 'married', 'overall', 'scorsese', 'enough', 'reasonable', 'specific', 'few', 'faulty', 'recent', 'unsung', 'expensive', 'good', 'big', 'indulgent', 'paranoid', 'alive', 'own', 'undeniable', 'stern', 'faint', 'broad', 'untold', 'cute', 'italian', 'different', 'close', 'fancy', 'divine', 'divine', 'single', 'average', 'lorraine', 'same', 'climatic', 'male', 'wonderful', 'correct', 'american', 'modern', 'regular', 'stylish', 'stellar', 'unforgettable', 'hard', 'scorsese', 'favorite', 'good', 'naive', 'more'];0.0888784461152882

""goodfellas"" is one of the best films i have ever seen. it's a tour de force of breathtaking images, witty scriptwriting, superb acting and realistic violence. robert de niro gives one of his best performances -- ever -- as jimmy, even if he's not in the film as much as you might be lead to believe from the front cover. joe pesci is in this movie about as much as de niro, maybe a bit more or less. but when he's on screen there's no doubting he's on screen--he's very hard to miss. a short, deranged, loud-mouthed man with something wrong in his head. someone makes an insult toward him and he shoots them, and then laughs. it's quite disturbing. i am a huge fan of pesci, and i tend to love his characters, but he really makes you feel sick towards his character in ""goodfellas,"" while at the same time taking a strange liking to him. that just goes to show how good of an actor pesci is. ray liotta is perfect as henry hill. i can't think of a better actor to play him. he captures a sense of innocence yet at the same time a feeling of violence. i love the scene where he walks over to a man's house with a regular expression on his face. ""what do you want, f&*^&?"" the man asks. liotta continues walking, takes out a gun, and starts to continually beat the man in the skull with the butt of his gun. as henry walks back to his car, his face is disturbing and his expression stays with you for a long, long time. martin scorsese is a brilliant director and his work here is fabulous; it's been recreated by other directors (namely paul thomas anderson in ""boogie nights"") and there's a reason: it's great stuff. he totally deserved to receive best director in 1990, but of course he didn't. (rumor has it the academy frowns on scorsese's use of racial slurs in his work. oh boo hoo, get over it.) the movie is based on the true-crime memoirs of the real-life henry hill, whose novel with nicholas pileggi -- ""wiseguys"" -- was adapted into a screenplay by pileggi and scorsese. the book itself was fantastic and insightful; the screenplay is even better. the dialogue is incredible. anyway, ""goodfellas"" has to be one of the best films i've ever seen--a true modern classic that will be remembered for what it is: one of the greatest tales told on screen. it's an offer you can't refuse!";31 March 2003;10;['true', 'young', 'old', 'calm', 'steady', 'wild', 'serious', 'mental', 'other', 'unfortunate', 'more', 'good', 'witty', 'realistic', 'good', 'lead', 'front', 'less', 'hard', 'short', 'loud', 'mouthed', 'wrong', 'disturbing', 'huge', 'sick', 'same', 'strange', 'good', 'perfect', 'well', 'same', 'regular', 'disturbing', 'long', 'long', 'brilliant', 'fabulous', 'other', 'great', 'good', 'racial', 'true', 'real', 'fantastic', 'insightful', 'well', 'incredible', 'good', 'true', 'modern', 'great'];0.1949404761904762
42;Red-Barracuda;"goodfellas is a pretty mesmerizing film. martin scorsese at his best is an incredibly dynamic director and goodfellas is most certainly one of his greatest achievements. for a film that clocks in at two and a half hours it sure moves at a fast pace. this is a movie that never lags. there is no waste. it's a master-class in how to keep an audience glued to a screen. it documents the story of henry hill the real life gangster. like the 30's gangster films it's a rise and fall epic, but unlike these the resolution is a lot more ambiguous and the overall presentation is considerably more complex. i'm not sure how close the film is to actual events, but i do realize that some principal characters have had their names changed for some reason. ultimately, the level of actual authenticity doesn't matter very much as this is a superlative film either way. scorsese has never been afraid to go to extremes. this film like many of his others is very raw. language and violence are strong; the latter, very much so in the murder of the character billy batts. the brutality adds an undeniable visceral appeal to the film. yet it does still seem entirely justifiable within the context of the story. acting is universally top drawer with everybody giving terrific performances. although special mention does have to go to joe pesci whose character tommy is seriously unforgettable. tommy is a pint-sized sociopath with a pretty monumental chip on his shoulder. most film-makers would never have recognized that an actor as small as pesci would be ideal for the role of this character. but pesci's size and high-pitched voice only add to his menace somehow, it's as if these defects of his character make tommy even more at war with the world and make him an even more bitter and dangerous guy. scorsese's trademark use of popular music is excellently incorporated into the film. the tunes by turns indicate the time period, parallel the events and add an ironic backdrop to proceedings. it's a textbook example of how to compose a soundtrack with contemporary music but in a way that adds depth and meaning. in a nutshell, goodfellas is arguably the best gangster film out there. as a piece of cinema, it is thrilling. recommended unreservedly.";22 April 2011;9;['mesmerizing', 'good', 'dynamic', 'great', 'fast', 'real', 'epic', 'ambiguous', 'overall', 'complex', 'sure', 'close', 'actual', 'principal', 'actual', 'superlative', 'afraid', 'many', 'raw', 'strong', 'latter', 'undeniable', 'visceral', 'justifiable', 'top', 'terrific', 'special', 'unforgettable', 'sized', 'monumental', 'most', 'small', 'ideal', 'tommy', 'bitter', 'dangerous', 'popular', 'ironic', 'contemporary', 'good'];0.2147025388404699
43;Pjtaylor-96-138044;while an argument could be made that 'goodfellas (1990)' perhaps comes dangerously close to glamourising the gangster lifestyle it portrays, this sprawling and relentless picture depicts three-decades of mob life through the eyes of a real-life ex-mafioso who entered into the witness protection program in the early 1980s and ultimately manages to maintain an impartial stance by simply portraying all the events the way they are remembered to have occurred. our protagonist also never actually kills anyone and his desperate, drug-fuelled downfall is just as detailed as his seduced start. scorsese directs the piece with a real ferocious verve and the improvised dialogue lends a genuinely unpredictable edge to most sequences, leading to an almost fly-on-the-wall feel even though the techniques used are inherently cinematic. when the violence explodes onto the screen, it is just as shocking as you'd expect it to be. the only downside of all this is that the already long film feels even longer due to the fast-pace and sheer amount of scenes - a minor complaint since it's all so entertaining. 8/10;4 May 2018;8;['close', 'sprawling', 'relentless', 'real', 'early', 'impartial', 'desperate', 'fuelled', 'detailed', 'seduced', 'scorsese', 'ferocious', 'improvised', 'unpredictable', 'most', 'cinematic', 'shocking', 'only', 'long', 'fast', 'sheer', 'minor', 'entertaining'];-0.0089743589743589

45;ElMaruecan82;"""goodfellas"" is so realistic you feel like watching a documentary about the mob: the narration is straight-forward, it doesn't try to use big words, or a rich vocabulary, gangsters proudly talk like the lucky scumbags they are. as for the others, the honest guys, like you and me, they are simply labeled as losers, how could someone like a script where he's almost insulted? well, just think about this, insulted by whom? by a wannabe big shot who thinks he's the king of the world simply because he doesn't need to stand in a queue, or can get the best table to his girlfriend in the restaurant? the genius of the script is that you're almost envying the protagonists in the beginning, the whole first act has a sort of joyful atmosphere where everything is fun, even when it's not. it almost makes you drool about this life where everything is easy: money, girls, sex, fun, power, respect, when you, poor schmuck, has to struggle to live a crappier life ... but they are criminals, no doubt about that, they're cheaters, they're robbers, murderers, they cheat their wives, they stab in the back, and the only honor they have is not to ""rat on your friends"", as if there were friends in this business anyway ... even the rules are corrupted from the beginning, why shouldn't you rat? if you're put in a position where you might do it, you're already a target ... it's a nasty, stinking, horrific world, we're proud not to belong to at the end of the film, and that's the power of the script. you follow these characters who seem cool, nice, funny (like a clown, or just like that) and you end up feeling guilty for that. the movie makes you question this weird appeal you feel to gangsters, even one of the first lines of the movie is quite significant : ""as far back as i can remember, i've always wanted to be a gangster"" ... we're like, wow! this movie goes ahead, it shouts loudly what ""the godfather"" was trying to whisper ... from the first words of the 'wags to riches' song, we're literally plunged into a world, where we share the dreams of a character who wants to be a gangster, as if it was the most honorable profession. the movie doesn't even question that, it's almost normal to want to be a gangster. scorsese has a twisted provocative approach in the beginning of the movie and it works perfectly, because it makes the ending all the more bittersweet, or all the more ironic. which takes me to the last lines, compare them with the first. the character's story arc concludes with these powerful lines : ""i'm an average nobody... get to live the rest of my life like a schnook"", this line is like a last slap in the face to the other schmucks who didn't realize during the movie that these guys were all already average nobodies, and probably worse than that, even when everything was fine ... the last grin on hill's face after he did it 'his way' (a reference to the ending credits song) is to highlight the ridiculousness of the situation where he's trying to persuade himself he ever was someone before, but he was nothing ... he didn't exist in the papers, he didn't exist in society, he did nothing, and the only wise decision he took was to save his skin by 'ratting' on his 'friends'. this is a movie about ultimate losers, about a cruel, violent and nasty world where sooner or later, you lose. but you don't lose because crime does not pay, let's not be that naive. you lose because this so-called fellowship is based on a fallacious etiquette that makes friendship and loyalty totally inconceivable, at least in the long term. consequently, when you watch the movie a second time, you realize that everything is fake from the beginning, the ending makes the irony even more palpable ... hell, the irony is even in the title, 'goodfellas' ... just like its glorious predecessor, ""the godfather"", the script is one of the most remarkable elements of the films, especially when combined with an incredible editing : you jump from a memorable scene to another, you're like watching a time capsule of the criminal world, it's an entertaining journey into crime that doesn't show how crime is fun or entertaining, but just to highlight in a more powerful way the cruelty of this world that looked so joyful, so cool in the beginning (and i don't even mention the acting)... in other words, the script is provocative, ironic and entertaining, what do you want more? better written dialogs? that's not the point. ""city lights"" didn't need dialogs to be considered a masterpiece, nor does ""goodfellas"" where the vocabulary is so particular, it's like another character from the film. ""goodfellas"", marty's masterpiece is the quintessential gangster film, not because it makes you want to be a gangster, but because it gives you two feelings in common with gangsters, envy and fear ... and a third one at the end, which is guilt.";22 December 2010;10;['realistic', 'straight', 'big', 'rich', 'lucky', 'honest', 'wannabe', 'big', 'good', 'whole', 'first', 'joyful', 'fun', 'easy', 'poor', 'only', 'nasty', 'horrific', 'proud', 'cool', 'nice', 'funny', 'guilty', 'weird', 'first', 'significant', 'first', 'honorable', 'normal', 'twisted', 'provocative', 'bittersweet', 'ironic', 'last', 'first', 'powerful', 'average', 'last', 'other', 'average', 'bad', 'fine', 'last', 'only', 'wise', 'ultimate', 'cruel', 'violent', 'nasty', 'naive', 'fallacious', 'inconceivable', 'least', 'long', 'second', 'fake', 'palpable', 'glorious', 'remarkable', 'incredible', 'memorable', 'criminal', 'entertaining', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'powerful', 'joyful', 'cool', 'other', 'provocative', 'ironic', 'entertaining', 'more', 'particular', 'quintessential', 'common', 'third'];0.0623737373737373

47;paul2001sw-1;martin scorcese's compelling 'goodfellas' is arguably his most entertaining film. it's accomplishments include a strong but believable narrative, a loving recreation of two decades of new york life in music and images (including some famously stunning elongated tracking shots), and great performances, in particular from joe peschi as the psychopathic killer tommy and paul sorvino as a mafia boss. yet its watchability is also its weakness. central character henry hill (ray liotta) narrates throughout, smoothing together the strands of the story but also telling us how to interpret it and thus distancing us from the action. the film lacks the visceral intimacy of 'raging bull' (or, indeed, the subversiveness of 'taxi driver' or 'the king of comedy'), while, for example, the emotional impact of the scenes where henry realises the mob is out to kill him is slight compared with, say, the similar scenes concerning al pacino's character in 'donnie brasco'. it's almost impossible to dislike this film, because we are led through it so adeptly, but at a certain level, it's little more than a well-spun yarn, proof perhaps that a master reaches the height of his technical powers somewhat later than the peak of his imagination. enjoy it, but the early stuff is better.;23 June 2004;8;['compelling', 'entertaining', 'strong', 'believable', 'stunning', 'great', 'particular', 'psychopathic', 'central', 'visceral', 'emotional', 'slight', 'similar', 'impossible', 'certain', 'little', 'more', 'technical', 'early', 'well'];0.1760854341736694
48;Robert_duder;"i have nothing against gangster films and i love deniro, and liotta and pesci...in moderation...the godfather were brilliant films and i finally made my way around to seeing the infamously talked about 'goodfellas.' i don't get it. i'll take the heat from any fans and i know there are scores of them...goodfellas was average at best and simply a trashy look at a mobster from childhood to his end in the mob with some decent but over the top performance, brutally gratuitous language and violence. i suppose in some circles that equivalents to a great film but i need far more. i mean even the story has little depth to it and it's more or less an extended episode of the sopranos without the character depth. i suppose after having the film hyped for years and hearing about the 'classic' i had high expectations but for me it was run of the mill, annoyingly loud and abrasive but with some good direction. scorsese knows how to make an epic from beginning to end starting the film in the 50's and 60's and taking it all the way to the mid 80's is a challenge and he does it flawlessly. the gritty underworld, the dark lighting, the facial expressions all very good but put to a pointless story and sub par characters unfortunately. i finally know now why ray liotta is still around and still gets parts because i always found him a little obnoxious in roles and i never realized he single handedly headlined goodfellas and is great at it. his character might be the only one in the film given any depth considering he is the narrator and focus of the film. disgustingly liotta got no nomination that year which is absurd because if this film deserved anything (which i don't think it did) liotta's role was it. robert deniro commonly gets credit for the film as being the headliner which is also a bit absurd. he might be the big name for the film but his role was small. he didn't make a significant part in the film until a good hour into it and his role was small but he still certainly brought his deniro class and style to the ensemble. i think they would have done better to focus more on his character and his relationship with liotta's character. they had good chemistry but just when you wanted to see more...they moved on to something else. joe pesci was over the top insane, downright disturbed tommy devito. his performance in this film is legendary ""oh you think i'm a clown?"" but to be perfectly honest he was ridiculous. his performance wasn't sincere or believable and he was downright annoying. he was loud and abrasive and his barrage of gratuitous language actually made the film less watchable and i am not against the use of four letter words in film but his was too much. lorraine bracco was quite good in her pre-soprano role as liotta's wife karen who sticks with him through pretty much everything and has some powerfully emotional swings throughout the film. paul sorvino is good as the head of the mob family, paulie, but he doesn't make an impact. you don't really believe anyone would respect him. he's quiet and laid back and basically hiding throughout most of the film. at least with brando's godfather he was an image, an icon, something you just were in awe of. the cast all work well together but their characters are so thinly written you just don't give a damn about a single one of them except maybe a little for liotta's jimmy conway. i get that i'm in a severe minority speaking this way about this film and that director martin scorsese is like a god to some but i just didn't seem the talent in this film. scorsese showed talent in the departed and the cast was a million times better than goodfellas and deserved all of it's acclaim but i personally think goodfellas is more of a non-thinking man's mob movie where bloody brutal kills and 1000 times hearing the 'f' word would prompt a dull chuckle as though the audience were 10. no i am not trying to insult anyone i was just severely disappointed by this film after having expected a brilliant classic which i will say hands down is not the case. i suppose if you like the crime genre or moreso the gangster drama than you must see goodfellas anyways but i can promise you there is far better out there than this average, poorly written film. 6/10";29 May 2007;6;['brilliant', 'average', 'good', 'trashy', 'decent', 'top', 'gratuitous', 'great', 'little', 'extended', 'high', 'loud', 'abrasive', 'good', 'mid', 'gritty', 'dark', 'facial', 'good', 'pointless', 'little', 'obnoxious', 'great', 'only', 'absurd', 'absurd', 'big', 'small', 'significant', 'good', 'small', 'good', 'more', 'top', 'insane', 'legendary', 'honest', 'ridiculous', 'sincere', 'believable', 'annoying', 'loud', 'abrasive', 'gratuitous', 'watchable', 'much', 'good', 'pre', 'soprano', 'emotional', 'good', 'quiet', 'most', 'least', 'single', 'little', 'severe', 'well', 'more', 'non', 'thinking', 'bloody', 'brutal', 'dull', 'brilliant', 'well', 'average'];0.1144856244384546
49;MOscarbradley;"some people favour ""raging bull"" but the biggest buzz you are likely to get from a scorcese movie will come from ""goodfellas"" and because of it his name will be indelibly linked with 'gangster' films for evermore. if ""the godfather"" films, (well, parts 1 and 2 anyway), represent the greatest single achievement in the genre taken as a whole, ""goodfellas"" is still probably the pinnacle of the old-fashioned gangster movie per se. it's based on fact, and by all accounts very accurately, but its genesis lies in the warner brothers films of the 1930's, (which, of course, were 'torn from the headlines', so to speak). it is the story of a life, that of henry hill, lived in the pursuit of crime, seen first as a boy, (christopher serrone), and then as a man, (ray liotta). he's one of the narrators, (the other is his wife, who throws her own jaundiced eye on the events in her husband's life), and it is through him we get to know a host of runyonesque-named wise-guys and goodfellas, (gangsters all). the difference, of course, is that runyon made them cuddly whereas scorcese and his co-writer nicholas pileggi, on whose book the film is based, makes them vicious. to most of these guys killing is second nature; they don't give a moment's thought to kicking a man to death or shooting a barhop dead for giving back-chat. and perhaps it is that impulsiveness that is their downfall. they can plan one of the biggest heists in us history but they can't control their tempers. it is, then, a very violent, (and foul-mouthed), movie and i can see why it won't be everybody's bucket of blood but if you love movies at all you can't help but love ""goodfellas"". scorcese brings to bear on the film a true film-maker's virtuosity; he loves the process of making movies and it shows in every frame, in every shot. coupled with his innate understanding of the community in which ""goodfellas"" is set, he has made a masterpiece. everyone is working at a peak here; the editor, thelma schoonmaker; the cinematographer, michael ballhaus; the cast, as well as liotta, never better, de niro, joe pesci, paul sorvino, lorraine bracco. it could be argued that without movies like ""scarface"", (the hawks version), and ""the roaring twenties"", ""goodfellas"" might not have existed. likewise, without ""goodfellas"" would we ever have had ""the sopranos""?";3 September 2007;10;['big', 'likely', 'scorcese', 'great', 'single', 'old', 'fashioned', 'other', 'own', 'jaundiced', 'wise', 'writer', 'vicious', 'most', 'second', 'dead', 'big', 'violent', 'foul', 'mouthed', 'true', 'innate', 'thelma', 'well'];0.0569047619047619

64;tomgillespie2002;"during one of the many thrilling montage sequences littered throughout one of martin scorsese's most revered films, gangster henry hill arrives home at christmas time with a giant white and tacky christmas tree and announces ""i got the most expensive tree they had!"". this sums up the colourful characters that inhabit goodfellas, cheap, trashy thugs who hold more value to material possessions with hefty price-tags than human life. it has been criticised for glamorising these criminal types, all sharp, shiny suits, slick hair and big cars, and it's easy to get lost amongst the glitz and lifestyle. but although scorsese alludes to the appeal of this live-fast way of life, he doesn't have much sympathy for its characters, and rightly so. henry hill may be the protagonist, our window into this world of high-rolling mafioso, but when he's stripped of his 'friends' and cash, he's not much more than a coke-addled rat. ever since he was a little kid, henry hill (ray liotta) always wanted to be a gangster. in his blue-collar, irish brooklyn neighbourhood, he begins by parking cadillacs for local gangsters, and eventually starts to work for jimmy 'the gent' conway (robert de niro). as the years go by, henry, jimmy and italian-american loose-canon tommy devito (joe pesci) form a small crew hijacking trucks and carrying out heists. henry marries a wild and beautiful jewish girl named karen (lorraine bracco), and things seem peachy under the watch of boss paulie (paul sorvino). but when henry starts selling cocaine under the disapproving paulie's nose, his world begins to crumble and he can no longer trust his friend, and the ugly side of the gangster business rears its head. looking back at his early works such as mean streets (1973) and his documentary short italianamerican (1974), there was always a sense of authenticity in scorsese's italian-american-focused work. all the talk now so clearly associated with italian-americans was practically invented by the director, and became so influential it now seems cliche and stereotyping. but scorsese came from these types of neighbourhoods, and this rubs off on goodfellas. this world seems so unreal - a world where a character can be beating money out of someone one minute, and then being sent champagne by a famous crooner the next - yet it comes alive in scorsese's hands. the much-celebrated steadicam sequence has been much imitated, but it still retains its crown. you get washed away amongst it all just like karen. the film simply catapults you through it's story, showing snippets of gangster life through some breathtaking montages with voice-over narration. one minute henry is enjoying new found love, sipping champagne while the glorious soundtrack plays in the background, the next he's on a paranoid and ill-fated drug deal. at the end i felt exhausted, like i'd just lived an entire life within 2 hours, and i've seen this film many times. but still, 24 years after it was made, it still feels fresh, energetic and innovative. perhaps the sopranos took its mantle when it took the gangster genre and made it a metaphor for american consumption, but it owes goodfellas an overwhelming dose of gratitude. it also make it all the more tragic that joe pesci has retired from film, as his oscar-winning performance and the final shot of him shooting at the camera a la the great train robbery (1903) will linger long after the credits have rolled. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com";12 January 2014;10;['many', 'thrilling', 'giant', 'white', 'tacky', 'expensive', 'colourful', 'cheap', 'trashy', 'more', 'hefty', 'human', 'criminal', 'sharp', 'shiny', 'slick', 'big', 'easy', 'scorsese', 'live', 'fast', 'much', 'high', 'more', 'little', 'blue', 'irish', 'local', 'italian', 'american', 'loose', 'small', 'wild', 'beautiful', 'jewish', 'peachy', 'ugly', 'early', 'such', 'mean', 'short', 'italian', 'american', 'influential', 'unreal', 'famous', 'next', 'alive', 'new', 'glorious', 'next', 'paranoid', 'exhausted', 'entire', 'many', 'fresh', 'energetic', 'innovative', 'american', 'overwhelming', 'tragic', 'final', 'great'];0.0787085790026966

66;redryan64;"director martin scorse and a (good)organized crime story, ah what a fine way to spend an afternoon! now, even any italian american organization has to agree with that one. the talent of mr. scorsese and his life proximity to the earthy atmosphere of the gangster film make for a double-barrel dose of the what is both familiar and yet strange to us all. the unique niche in the annals of film genres that is occupied by the gangster movie is truly a study in one end of the spectrum meeting the other end somewhere in the middle. the gangster film seems to be one film genre that everyone enjoys. perhaps it is that there is a clue in the film, itself. at one point, henry hill (ray liotta)in describing what it is to be a gangster says(in fine voice-over form), ""...we were like movie stars with muscle!"" that must be it, for i can well recall as a kid prefer being al capone to being elliott ness. in director scorsese's capable hand, we have the true master. his is the mind to not only select a story for adaptation to the screen. the settings and the stories are great.(being a native new yorker, he knows this terrain, like no other.) but friend martin has one secret weapon at his disposal that gave his work the final edge of so many others. mr. scorsese makes use of all sorts of seemingly commonplace techniques, combined and then given an even greater effectiveness by these combination of these. hence, using the hand held camera with the subjective lens, then combining it with crisp, short bursts of voice over, is used to create a sense of here and now that is virtually unseen elsewhere.. but this director does not push it. he knows that he should just give us so much of this business, and then he abruptly switches gears. this is done several times during the course of the film and is particularly effective in getting out a lot of exposition material and advancing the story. bringing a full three dimensional look and feel to the characters he presents to us is where an awful lot of other film makers are left behind in the dust. any character in good fellas is complex and multi-faceted. plenty of time and care is expended in an effort to make each character into something besides being just another character. there is not any room for the shallow, the one sided, the 'stock' or stereo-typed in martin scorsese's world. so, we see a henry, who would do a 'hit', yet is caring and loving in personally protecting and comforting a frightened, molested karen. paulie who holds the powers of judge and exicutioner over so many low level syndicate 'soldiers' and 'wannabees', yet is gentle and protective to the multitude of his adoring nieces and nephews. even tommy, who is clearly 'not playing with a full deck' and could fly off the handle and kill for absolutely no reason, is still kind and respectful to his poor, old white haired mother. only jimmy conway(deniro)seems to be lacking in any real, even half-fast good points to his personality. in the final analysis, is it he who is the worst of the bad guys? what is it that he lacks to leave him so inadequate as a person? there is one other element that seems to permeate all of master builder scorsese's finished products. mr. scorsese always has had the ability to bring his characters just one step beyond what we would expect. he has displayed the good judgment to make his characters identifiable with us, the movie going public. this he accomplishes by bridging any existing gaps between us and the on-screeners. no matter how different we are, he manages to bring a sense of identification to us. hence, regardless of personal station in life (low-life gangster, caveman-like prize fighter or enigmatic billionaire tycoon) or any difference in ethnicity(italian,irish,jewish, black, etc.)we identify with these characters. i mean, i forget just how many people, who we know, said that they were reminded of someone from their own life experiences from joe pesci's characterization.";14 August 2007;10;['fine', 'italian', 'earthy', 'double', 'familiar', 'strange', 'unique', 'other', 'fine', 'elliott', 'capable', 'true', 'native', 'new', 'other', 'secret', 'final', 'many', 'commonplace', 'great', 'subjective', 'crisp', 'short', 'unseen', 'much', 'several', 'effective', 'full', 'dimensional', 'awful', 'other', 'good', 'complex', 'multi', 'faceted', 'frightened', 'many', 'low', 'gentle', 'protective', 'full', 'kind', 'respectful', 'poor', 'old', 'white', 'haired', 'real', 'half', 'fast', 'good', 'final', 'bad', 'bad', 'inadequate', 'other', 'finished', 'good', 'identifiable', 'public', 'different', 'personal', 'low', 'like', 'enigmatic', 'irish', 'jewish', 'black', 'many', 'own'];0.1160949113779302

68;Dr_Coulardeau;"a long film about ""italian"" crime in new york in the 1950-1980 period, and a good one at that. it shows the brutality and the extreme male chauvinism of these gangsters who are ready to sell anything, steal anything, kill anyone in order to make money, and as for killing, to satisfy their insatiable thirst for blood, to satisfy their unquenchable hunger for violence. it also shows, rather on the side because it is not the main object, how justice and before it the police are managing their gang-spirit, splitting their unity and getting the weaker ones to become protected witnesses, and it works: these criminals prefer being hidden away by the justice department for decades rather than going away in prison for even longer periods of time. the film is well done: robert de niro and joe pesci are quite acceptable. ray liotta on the other hand appears slightly weak when confronted to the other two, and he has to be since he is the side-kick, and an essential one at that, of both of them. one shortcoming though: even if the police managed to more or less bring the italians back in line, the film is absolutely silent about the fact that the various traffics and particularly drugs were then abandoned to another mafia, probably even more dangerous, i.e. the blacks and the porto ricans and other latinos. dr jacques coulardeau, university paris dauphine, university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne & university versailles saint quentin en yvelines";9 April 2008;9;['long', 'italian', 'good', 'extreme', 'male', 'ready', 'insatiable', 'unquenchable', 'main', 'weak', 'long', 'acceptable', 'other', 'weak', 'other', 'essential', 'silent', 'various', 'dangerous', 'other'];-0.0519607843137255

70;johnnyboyz;"goodfellas quite effortlessly embeds itself near the top of the tree in terms of both the best of the genre and the best of a certain director. that director is martin scorsese; a man whose films, it seems, reach out to generation after generation because of their timeless studies of the male who's placed within a scenario of either psychological crisis or social misfit; often both. scorsese's films are journeys, but they never seem to branch out beyond the constraints of a city or the small, designated and rather run down area in which they're set. there are no vast landscapes or set pieces involving glitzy cinematography; just down and dirty locales inhabited by people you wouldn't usually notice or want to pay much attention to, only scorsese brings them to life in that way that he does. such is goodfellas, an old fashioned yarn about the rise and consequent fall of a gangster who begins life at the bottom of the pecking order before working their way up and then realising that once you're in that groove you've been searching for, you become even more vulnerable than before. goodfellas isn't the sort of film you revisit because you're tired of scorsese's more recent efforts. from what i've seen following goodfellas, he hasn't made a great film since his 1990 mob thriller but that's not to say any of his films since haven't been at least good to some degree. the film tiptoes along that fine line that makes organised crime or indeed mafia life look 'cool', or 'sexy' or the sort of lifestyle you might want to get involved in. it's important to recognise that, by the end, ray liotta's henry hill has become the one thing he feared most before even starting out in 'the life' and that's a regular guy who lives in a suburban house, with a mailbox and a newspaper on the doorstep every morning. it sounds like he ended up pretty well off considering the amount of blood, violence and death that awaits rather a few of the other characters that inhabit goodfellas, but that's not to say it's a brain dead blood bath designed to appeal to the masses. each and every death; act of violence - hell, even every gunshot resounds with the viewer in a chilling and quite frightening manner; whoever the victim and whoever the instigator. some are more jarring than others, but we feel a certain something toward each individual that is involved in a grizzly end. such is the power of the character study here. henry hill is young and on the brink of his teen years. he lives opposite a restaurant in brooklyn, new york in the 1950s and doesn't look at but gazes at the activity that goes on down there on ground level as organised crime syndicates go about their business. the first time he sees blood or the results of acts of extreme violence is the first time we do, when one member stumbles back to the place of business in agony. hill meets fellow italian and irish american alike gangsters in jimmy conway (de niro) and tommy devito (pesci), both based on real life people whom, i read, are as akin to their real life persona's as possible. what follows is a study of life, love, theft, murder and honour all within a mafia orientated arena. apart from most things, goodfellas is a cracking ride. at two and a half hours, but never feeling like it, you have fly through the lives of these people in no time at all. hill's voice-overs provide most of the toned down and grubby information required on how he lived as a child complete with violent father a truancy problems and when those switch to karen (bracco) and her, worried if anything perspective, it acts as a jolt to the audience as the mindset of a man in henry who is slowly getting involved to the point in which he may assume himself invincible. of course towards the end, he really does loose it as a cocaine deal and a large family meal clash on the same day in what is a sequence of events that work on several dramatic and humorous levels at once. i think the most resounding reason goodfellas comes across as so good and so memorable is its strength in depth in regards to individual scenes or moments. just thinking about certain sequences, such as the long take in which henry makes his way across a public street and breaks someone's nose with a revolver or the scene in which the guys sit around tommy's mother's table and talk and eat casually, despite the fact there's a dying man in tommy's car which is parked outside, just produce chills. one of the more famous scenes is, of course, tommy's ""funny? funny how?"" tirade. even when the film begins to remove us from the life of crime and more towards the older age that these characters approach, scorsese does it in such a way that we're cool with the genre being manipulated and branching out into something else. goodfellas is, and will continue to be, a very impressive and worthwhile film for many those who stumble across it.";5 March 2009;8;['good', 'good', 'certain', 'timeless', 'psychological', 'social', 'small', 'vast', 'glitzy', 'dirty', 'much', 'such', 'old', 'fashioned', 'consequent', 'vulnerable', 'tired', 'recent', 'great', 'least', 'good', 'fine', 'organised', 'cool', 'sexy', 'important', 'regular', 'suburban', 'few', 'other', 'dead', 'chilling', 'frightening', 'jarring', 'certain', 'grizzly', 'such', 'young', 'organised', 'first', 'extreme', 'first', 'fellow', 'italian', 'irish', 'alike', 'real', 'akin', 'real', 'possible', 'orientated', 'most', 'most', 'toned', 'grubby', 'complete', 'violent', 'perspective', 'invincible', 'large', 'same', 'several', 'dramatic', 'humorous', 'resounding', 'good', 'memorable', 'individual', 'certain', 'such', 'long', 'public', 'famous', 'funny', 'funny', 'more', 'old', 'cool', 'impressive', 'worthwhile', 'many'];0.1310291858678955

72;Movie_Muse_Reviews;"while the title of mob masterpiece most often goes to ""the godfather"" for its stunning drama and dark beauty, something must be said for honesty. those two points belong to martin scorsese's ""goodfellas,"" which plays up the highs and lows of gangster life in cold truth, without any jazzed-up one-liners or thematic scores, with only honest-to-goodness storytelling and direction. some crime films rely on characters killing or torturing people in crazy and memorable ways, but in ""goodfellas,"" when the only nutty character, tommy devito (joe pesci), blows his fuse a few times, it feels jarring and unnatural, not cool or awing in any way. it's because to scorsese, these people are real, this is their life, and a hit is a hit because that's how they do things -- there's not a production to be made out of it. the film, based on true events with much consultation from the real life people who were being portrayed in the film, focuses on gangster henry hill (ray liotta) and how the mob raised him and gave him everything he had, brought him the highest of highs and took him pretty low -- might have even killed him had he not entered the witness protection program in the '80s. scorsese isn't brilliant in this film. it's not visionary. leave that for some of his other films -- this is just incredibly good storytelling. ""as far back as i can remember, i always wanted to be a gangster"" is not a memorable line that pulls you in at the film's beginning because it was inspired writing -- it's scorsese understanding how to take a script and bring it to life in the best way possible. the only truly artistic work being done is some of the camera shots and compelling angles. he finds the script's best moments and adds something to them. otherwise, he is telling this story, he is making a cinematic homage to this incredible true story as penned by nicholas pileggi. of course it helps that the actors he had to work with were top notch. following him from ""raging bull"" among other films were robert deniro and pesci as jimmy and tommy. both characters are easily provoked, sometimes irrational men with big mouths their hearts in the right place despite actions to the contrary. pesci is particularly memorable between the ""in what way am i funny?"" and ""deer paw"" scenes, a deserved oscar for great character work. as for liotta, his great strength is swaying our opinion of him back and forth with his various infidelities yet natural charms -- it's a role that had scorsese cast 15 years later would have gone to the likes of leonardo dicaprio, so let that stand as some acclaim for liotta. it is also this dichotomy of warm support and foul-mouthed matter-of-factness that makes us feel conflicted as we watch the entire film. it doesn't elicit pity for the mafia, but it certainly complicates the ""wiseguy"" stereotype, which i think is much of scorsese's goal. ""goodfellas"" only lacks in an emotional or cathartic pull. many times you wonder why this story is being told, but then you realize how incredibly well it's told and you acknowledge that it's some of the finest film-making out there, regardless how it makes you feel.";2 June 2009;9;['stunning', 'dark', 'cold', 'thematic', 'honest', 'crazy', 'memorable', 'only', 'nutty', 'few', 'jarring', 'unnatural', 'cool', 'scorsese', 'real', 'true', 'much', 'real', 'high', 'brilliant', 'visionary', 'other', 'good', 'memorable', 'scorsese', 'good', 'possible', 'only', 'artistic', 'compelling', 'good', 'cinematic', 'incredible', 'true', 'top', 'notch', 'other', 'irrational', 'big', 'right', 'memorable', 'funny', 'deserved', 'great', 'great', 'various', 'natural', 'scorsese', 'warm', 'foul', 'mouthed', 'entire', 'much', 'emotional', 'cathartic', 'many', 'fine'];0.2762678571428571

74;Anonymous_Maxine;martin scorsese's stunning gangster film goodfellas is the true story of henry hill, a man that wanted to be a gangster for as long as he can remember, and who lived as a gangster for a significant portion of his life. scorsese seems to suggest that his tendency toward a life of crime comes as a result of an unhappy childhood, particularly the brutal beatings that he received from his father as a kid. ray liotta gives an excellent performance as henry hill, and robert deniro is just a bad-ass in the film. he makes an awesome gangster, and he just looks intimidating and interesting and impressive. true, the guy is just a phenomenal actor, but he can also play extremely opposite roles, such as the one he played in scorsese's mean streets in 1973, as well as the nutcase travis bickle in scorsese's taxi driver. joe pesci, also a scorsese regular, and also a tremendously diverse actor, plays the part of the undeniably likeable but quick-tempered and highly ambitious tommy, one of the most violent gangsters portrayed in the film (by the way, his similarity to edward g. robinson's performance as rico bandello in little caesar (1930) is extensive and unmistakable). on a trivial note, look for scorsese's mother playing the part of tommy's loving mother (almost a staple in italian cinema) in the film. it's interesting that for a good portion of her screen time, she is telling stories from the past, exactly as she did in scorsese's rather short film italianamerican, which starred his mother and father as themselves. scorsese clearly sees something of himself in the young henry hill, given his fairly impoverished and physically unhealthy childhood in new york's little italy, where he was always fascinated by organized crime. his unique and expressive direction works perfectly to present the story of the life of henry hill, with the overall purpose of showing what life in the mafia is like. the power, the money, the women, the cars, the color coordinated wardrobe, the special treatment by just about everyone, everything that comes as a benefit of being a gangster. on the other hand, the dark side of organized crime is equally presented. we see the loyalty turned to betrayal, the senseless murders, the self-aggrandizing acts that lead to one's own downfall (especially seen in the way that tommy kills a 'made' man named bask), the occasional crackdown by the law, etc. but even when in prison, they get extremely favorable treatment, with their quarters, their food, and pretty much everything else about their treatment. (spoilers) even the extensive length of the film serves to increase the effectiveness of this presentation of gangster life, because it provides time for scorsese to completely immerse the audience in the world of the mafia, rather than tell about the life of some gangster with a story that is over in 90 minutes. the movie spans a time period of about three decades, from henry hill's first involvement with the mafia, basically as an errand boy, until his eventual betrayal of his betrayers, leaving him stuck to live the rest of his life 'like a schnook.' earlier in the film, deniro's character, james conway, tells the young henry hill that he had learned a valuable lesson from his first run-in with the police - 'never rat on your friends, and always keep your mouth shut.' henry is proud of this, and even at the end of the film, when he opens his mouth and rats on his friends, it is clear that it is not the way that he wanted it all to end. the tragedy here is that he has to spend the rest of his life living in a way that he always despised, as a 'normal' person. even as henry goes to the police, scorsese is still illustrating the practices and realities of the mafia. henry notes that the cops talked to him, which assured him that they were not associated with the mafia, because 'goodfellas' (this is what the gangsters called each other - 'you'll like this guy, he's a goodfella.') would have just killed him. he wouldn't have even heard anything. the italian influence in the film is obviously unmistakable, both in the stereotypical (and, in reality, generally incorrect) involvement with the mafia as well as everything from the way that they dress to the strong family bonds and the delicious meals. goodfellas is an uncompromising and brutally straightforward look at the inner workings of the mafia that makes no effort to make anything easy to swallow. i've heard people complain about gratuitous violence in the movie, such as when henry walks up to some guy on his driveway and pistol-whips him for sexually assaulting his sister. this is crap, of course, because the guy got exactly what he deserved. i think they should implement pistol-whipping in the us court system as a common punishment for sexual assault. the violence is not put into a movie like this to impress the younger male audience that looks for that, it's put here because that's the way the mafia works. this is realism, not audience manipulation, and the spectacularly effective result is a tremendous accomplishment.;23 May 2001;10;['stunning', 'true', 'significant', 'unhappy', 'brutal', 'excellent', 'bad', 'awesome', 'interesting', 'impressive', 'true', 'phenomenal', 'opposite', 'such', 'mean', 'scorsese', 'regular', 'diverse', 'likeable', 'quick', 'ambitious', 'violent', 'little', 'extensive', 'unmistakable', 'trivial', 'italian', 'interesting', 'good', 'short', 'young', 'impoverished', 'unhealthy', 'little', 'organized', 'unique', 'expressive', 'overall', 'special', 'other', 'dark', 'own', 'occasional', 'favorable', 'extensive', 'first', 'eventual', 'stuck', 'young', 'valuable', 'first', 'proud', 'clear', 'normal', 'other', 'italian', 'unmistakable', 'stereotypical', 'incorrect', 'strong', 'delicious', 'straightforward', 'inner', 'easy', 'gratuitous', 'such', 'crap', 'common', 'sexual', 'young', 'male', 'effective', 'tremendous'];0.1408829365079364
75;jzappa;"in the opening moments of goodfellas, a movie about the tradecraft and culture of organized crime in new york, our storyteller henry hill says that for as long as he can remember, he always wanted to be a gangster, that it was better than being president. that he voice-overs his own life, later joined by his wife, narrating her side, is pivotal to the movie's ingenuity. though the film refuses to judge its characters, it's not an omniscient portrayal, but a frame of reference rooted in yearning for the life. what's more, alternating dual narration causes us to see scenes in different ways. ""these were blue-collar guys,"" hill's wife rationalizes. ""the only way they could make real extra money was to go out and cut a few corners."" their influence was, and is, exhilarating. ""if we wanted something, we just took it,"" henry says. ""if anyone complained twice they got hit so bad, believe me, they never complained again."" after all of his harrowing experiences, henry, played by ray liotta in the stand-out performance of his career, still carps, still misses all the good times. and after literally having seen this film possibly a hundred or more times, i still watch. the screenplay is both based on nicholas pileggi's biography of hill, and scorsese's own little italy recollections. the early scenes showcase adolescent henry as an errand boy for the local brooklyn mob. a shot of him peering out his tenement window reflects scorsese's own schoolday reminiscences of the neighborhood. so does the reverse-shot which utilizes quiet slow-motion for closeups of mobsters' shiny shoes, slick ties, greased-back hair, ostentatious rings, smoldering cigars. in a movie legendary for violence that happens by surprise, one of the most jolting kicks comes when henry's beaten by his father for missing school. he had to ""take a few beatings"" at home owing to his teenage professional pursuit, but it was a small price. violence is like the tempo beneath every scene. the percussion is the fruits of unwarranted benefits. henry's accomplice jimmy conway emerges into his first shot with robert de niro's special brand of broadcasted constraint. his mannerisms say, ""don't worry. you'll all get autographs if you're patient."" henry's other partner is the unforgettable tommy devito, in an extraordinary performance by joe pesci, who oversteps his influence rather than letting it imply itself. henry's enthusiasm for his developing profession is tangible. in the movie's most talked-about shot, he takes his future wife karen (lorraine bracco gives it her all) to the copacabana. there's a line in front, but he squires her across the street, downstairs through service hallways, the kitchen area, out into the showroom right as their table's being set right in front of the stage. this uninterrupted three-minute shot is not just a cameraman's feat: it's a bold technique showing how the whole world appears to unravel readily before young henry hill. there's another particularly extended shot, as henry acquaints us with his fellow gangsters. henry leads the camera through a packed speakeasy, calling out names as the characters nod to the camera, mutter to henry. the camera appears to track henry, yet appears to be his pov; sometimes he's talking to them, sometimes to us. we're included in the scene. the cinematographer, michael ballhaus, was a central accomplice. cultivating scorsese's trademark form, he quite rarely lets his camera be stationary. it's so often in motion, if just slightly, making us not cold bystanders but complicit witnesses. alongside the violence is an account of capitalistic striving. henry and karen come from circumstances that couldn't freely result in cadillacs, vegas excursions, fur coats. she rationalizes what he has to do to finance their prestige. the movie centralizes henry's climb through the mob, then down into prison sentences and full-blown duplicity. initially the mob looks to be an augmentation of his life, then eventually, after he begins selling drugs, there's a hemmed-in diminishing. the camera style in the earlier scenes ritualizes his network of control with all-encompassing grace. near the end, in an intoxicatingly berserk segment huddled in one day, the form gets hectic and jerky as he hustles frenziedly around the neighborhood on family and criminal errands while a helicopter constantly feels like it's fluttering above. this is one of the most virtuoso film sequences i have ever seen. what scorsese does that makes goodfellas so universally adored is infect us with his exhilaration with the material. it has the breakneck propulsion of a storyteller who can't wait to see your reaction. scorsese's camera embraces these guys, listens to their shoes clicking, beholds the tailoring of their clothes. and when they're plotting the fabled lufthansa job, he has them whispering together in a tight three-shot that has their heads bent low and close with the rush of their own awesomeness. what a rush it is for them to steal. the film's way is to sever dialogue with brutality. we see some of cinema's most effective cries wolf, as in pesci's legendary restaurant scene where tommy would like to know what henry meant when he said he was a funny guy. other instants amplify abruptly out of the sheer mob environment: the way a mistaken drink order leads to blood. the way kidding around in a bar leads to a man being viciously brutalized. the way the violence bayonets the everyday lives of the characters is invariably enforced. tommy, henry and jimmy, with a body in their trunk, stop at tommy's mother's house to get a knife, and she insists they sit down at 3 a.m. for spaghetti. scorsese feels so in control of his powerful talent here. it describes crime's allure for an insatiable young man who's determined from childhood beatings not to resent power, but long for it. when henry talks to us at the beginning, it sounds like a classic hollywood dream-come-true picture.";8 June 2010;10;['well', 'own', 'pivotal', 'more', 'dual', 'different', 'blue', 'only', 'real', 'extra', 'few', 'bad', 'harrowing', 'good', 'more', 'own', 'little', 'early', 'local', 'own', 'quiet', 'slow', 'shiny', 'slick', 'ostentatious', 'smoldering', 'legendary', 'few', 'teenage', 'professional', 'small', 'unwarranted', 'first', 'special', 'patient', 'other', 'unforgettable', 'extraordinary', 'tangible', 'future', 'right', 'uninterrupted', 'bold', 'whole', 'young', 'fellow', 'central', 'stationary', 'cold', 'complicit', 'capitalistic', 'early', 'hectic', 'jerky', 'criminal', 'virtuoso', 'fabled', 'tight', 'low', 'close', 'own', 'effective', 'legendary', 'funny', 'other', 'sheer', 'mistaken', 'everyday', 'scorsese', 'powerful', 'insatiable', 'young', 'classic', 'true'];0.15679469901168

79;freemantle_uk;goodfellas is one of my favourite films and is my second favourite martin scorsese film (raging bull is my first). this is one of the first modern gangster films that look at the working class/file and rank members of the mafia, compared to films like the godfather which looked at the upper ranks. goodfellas is based on the book wise guys, an autobiographical account by henry hill, a former member of the mafia. the film looks at rise in the ranks from a 14-year-old boy to becoming a successful member, making money and becoming happily married to spells in prison and leaving the mafia. the film looks at the working of the crime organisation, but also looks at hill's (ray liotta (easily his best film)) personal life, such as his courting of karen (lorraine bracco), from an unsuccessful double date to marriage. it looks at his relationships with other mafia members and how they work together and act like a family themselves. it does not show the mafia as either good or evil, even thought they do bad things, and makes the character human. tommy devito (joe pesci), is well played as a psychopath and this film got pesci an oscar for best supporting actor. the casting is brilliant, as already mentioned this is liotta's best performance, robert de niro is always good, so joe pesci and bracco is good and she ends up in the soparnos. this film is excellent and should have won more oscars, especially best director. it has also been very influential in the gangster genre, from the soparnos, to films like donnie brasco to scorese own film casino, and has been parodied in programs like the simpsons and futurama. goodfellas is a must see movie.;30 June 2008;10;['favourite', 'second', 'favourite', 'first', 'first', 'modern', 'upper', 'wise', 'autobiographical', 'former', 'old', 'successful', 'married', 'good', 'personal', 'such', 'unsuccessful', 'double', 'other', 'good', 'evil', 'bad', 'good', 'brilliant', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'excellent', 'more', 'good', 'influential', 'own'];0.30625

83;mjneu59;"martin scorsese's black comic mafia case history claims to be a true story, but the facts are less important than the exaggerated, hyper-kinetic style in which they're presented. in just over two hours the film covers more than thirty years in the career of model criminal henry hill (ray liotta), from his childhood rise to privilege to his inevitable downfall through drugs, and finally to the ultimate treachery of his testimony under the fbi witness protection program. with so little time to cover so much ground the film, by necessity, moves like greased lightning (liotta's constant voice-over narration is almost like having the entire source book, 'wiseguys', read aloud), and although a certain depth is lost in the process the density of detail is amazing. scorsese admitted he wanted to structure his mafia epic like a two-hour coming attractions trailer, and that's a fair description of the finished film: there's no actual dialogue in the first thirty minutes, no real conflict for a least an hour, and no suggestion of a plot until the film is two-thirds over. what emerges instead is a visually dense and hyperactive stew of details, incidents, and non-stop music references, often suggesting an insider's guide to new york city italian-american culture. the technique is often as violent as the subject (even with the gallows humor provided by comic psychopath joe pesci) and, while the director certainly deserves all the acclaim the film has earned him, equal credit for helping build such incredible kinetic energy belongs to his longtime collaborators michael ballhaus (cinematography) and thelma schoonmaker (editing), especially in the latter half of the film, when liotta's cocaine habit starts getting out of hand. scorsese might be criticized for elevating style over substance; his film doesn't really say anything except ""crime doesn't pay"" (not exactly a revelation), but says it with a thrilling, kick-in-the-pants vitality, succeeding in putting a unique spin on a genre many people might be excused for thinking had long been exhausted.";23 November 2010;9;['black', 'comic', 'true', 'important', 'exaggerated', 'hyper', 'kinetic', 'more', 'inevitable', 'ultimate', 'little', 'much', 'constant', 'entire', 'certain', 'amazing', 'epic', 'coming', 'fair', 'finished', 'actual', 'first', 'real', 'least', 'dense', 'hyperactive', 'non', 'stop', 'italian', 'violent', 'comic', 'equal', 'such', 'incredible', 'longtime', 'thelma', 'latter', 'unique', 'many'];0.1216710758377425

94;slokes;"the more time passes, the better ""goodfellas"" looks. a decades-long examination of the mafia lifestyle as seen through the eyes of minor brooklyn hoodlum henry hill (ray liotta), whose secret to survival involves keeping quiet, ""goodfellas"" puts you in the back seat watching with henry as his pals steal, rob, burn, and kill each other off. one thing about living the good life is that it's never good enough. as henry and wife karen (lorraine bracco) partake more in the money, they also become more exposed to the danger. that's really the core of the story, though it's probable if you haven't seen ""goodfellas"" you think more of it as the one where henry's temperamental friend tommy (joe pesci) wants to know why you find him so amusing. ""goodfellas"" is an amusing film, very much so at times, yet like with tommy there's always a barb that comes with the laughter, and makes for a deeper overall experience. director martin scorsese and co-screenwriter nicholas pileggi, who wrote the source book ""wiseguy,"" capture not only the violence but the lifestyle that undergirds and enables the violence, often in finely detailed and witty ways, like when karen meets the other mob wives and discovers their penchant for double-knits and beating their sons with broom handles. other organized-crime films either excuse the lifestyle in a relativistic way (""godfather"") or pump up the volume to an absurd degree (1983's ""scarface"") in order to sensationalize and glamorize the experience. ""goodfellas,"" despite its bad-boy reputation, is really on the side of the angels, out to expose the vileness of mafia living, people who kill each other over nothing and betray each other over nickles and dimes. it's hard to see scorsese's claims of detesting violence in some of his other films, like ""gangs of new york"" and ""casino,"" because he goes to it so often there, but here you meet the people before you see what happens to them, reducing the pleasure of their demise, while the killings are quick and dirty, not exploited for cheap effect. that and it's so damn entertaining. scorsese puts on a clinic, one that is still ongoing, with his use of music, tracking shots, and slam-the-door editing, like when we still hear karen crying from one scene while henry and his pals walk through a door to start the next. even when you watch this film again (and you sort of have to, there's so much to take in) you aren't bored because there's always some new thing to attract your attention. the character of jimmy the gent (robert de niro) is a little confusing in the film, especially when he helps crazy tommy whack a guy he should know better about. the book explains this better, but ""goodfellas"" is one scorsese-de niro collaboration in which de niro is often not the most important person on screen when he is on screen. he's good, but liotta is classic in the central role, a performance for the ages in fact, while pesci made for a deserved oscar recipient with the way he inhabits tommy the walking id and delivers ""goodfellas"" message of how the good life isn't all that good, that there's always something rotten beneath the surface that will reach up and grab you at the wrong time.";7 March 2007;9;['more', 'well', 'long', 'minor', 'quiet', 'back', 'other', 'good', 'good', 'exposed', 'probable', 'more', 'temperamental', 'amusing', 'amusing', 'deep', 'overall', 'co', 'detailed', 'witty', 'other', 'double', 'other', 'relativistic', 'absurd', 'bad', 'other', 'other', 'hard', 'other', 'quick', 'dirty', 'cheap', 'entertaining', 'scorsese', 'ongoing', 'next', 'much', 'bored', 'new', 'little', 'confusing', 'crazy', 'well', 'well', 'scorsese', 'important', 'good', 'classic', 'central', 'deserved', 'good', 'good', 'wrong'];0.0855413895048041

97;TOMNEL;"""goodfellas"" is an exceptional mobster film, but not because of it's plot or script. it's a good plot, nothing too exceptional however, and the characters are pretty solid throughout, every one being a complete sleaze-ball. the performances are amazing. ray liotta is the main character and actually shows off his acting abilities best through his super slick narration throughout the film. joe pesci gives an outstanding supporting performance as the tough, wiseguy he plays in most movies, but for some reason it stands out here. robert deniro also gives an amazing(ly tough) and powerful performance. it's all about the cool direction and great acting for this film. henry hill (ray liotta) has always wanted to be a gangster ever since he was a young boy. we learn his background and how he gets caught up with the mobsters, from the good times to the bad. two of his closest friends are jimmy (robert deniro) and tommy (joe pesci). tommy (especially) goes crazy with power and eventually these three are working their way to the top of the mob standings. one problem with this movie is the lack of any soul or redeeming characters. the characters we are presented are interesting to listen to and follow, but we know each one is a violent criminal. even movies like ""the godfather"" or ""pulp fiction"" give us characters that if not redeeming, become somewhat redeeming by the end of the film and make us care about them. for all i cared, they could've massacred the entire cast of characters. i'd still have had a heck of a time watching them, as i did, they just weren't likable. luckily, the most likable character is also the narrator and star of the film, ray liotta. overall, this is a great mobster film, with some outstanding performances and snappy direction. however, the lack of any redeeming characters might annoy viewers who need at least one person to root for, though those people may find themselves rooting for the three main guys to murder to whole lot of them just for the entertainment value. my rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 145 mins. r for violence, drug use, sexuality, language.";31 May 2008;9;['exceptional', 'good', 'exceptional', 'solid', 'complete', 'amazing', 'main', 'super', 'slick', 'outstanding', 'tough', 'most', 'tough', 'powerful', 'cool', 'great', 'young', 'good', 'bad', 'close', 'crazy', 'interesting', 'violent', 'entire', 'likable', 'likable', 'great', 'outstanding', 'snappy', 'main', 'whole'];0.224904214559387

99;Steffi_P;"the gangster movie has gone through a lot of changes, especially since being reinvented as high drama with the godfather pictures in the 1970s. such classics soon become cliches and in the 80s gangster movies were often spoofs (prizzi's honor, married to the mob). goodfellas opened a new chapter of serious yet very stylish crime flicks. goodfellas was, back then, a comparative rarity in the genre in that it is based on a true story. and storywise it is as a much a documentary as it is a good yarn. most scenes, when considered individually are simply revelations of gangster life, and the almost constant narration more or less acknowledges this. it's only when viewed as a whole that an entire story arc starts to emerge. but there is also continual structure in the arrangement of each little anecdote. take for example the pair of scenes in the bar with ""spider"". these go together, but you need to know that some time has passed in between them. writers nicholas pilleggi and martin scorsese throw in a quick in-between-scene of ray liotta and lorraine bracco arguing. this demonstrates that other events have gone on in the meantime, but also keeps the tense, gritty atmosphere riding along. the vibrant language and frequent diversions into wisecracking make this a forerunner to the dialogue-for-the-sake-of-dialogue school of screen writing which quentin tarantino would soon specialise in. martin scorsese's direction closely follows the narration, both in its content and its snappy pace. like hitchcock his camera is constantly roving around, leading us by the hand and making us look at things. in effect he's illustrating henry hill's words. and often he's showing a little more than that. sometimes there's a cheeky counterpoint between words and images. there are also some clever pull-back-and-reveal shots. in one early shot we see a close-up of some liquor changing hands. the camera pulls out to show that the booze is being used to bribe a couple of cops. we are continually bombarded with ideas, continually pushed and pulled through the narrative. of course, a lot of scorsese's technical business here the zooms, jump cuts and lengthy tracking shots are just cinematic wheelies, and headache-inducing ones at that. but so long as you can put up with them you have to admire the rhythmic precision with which the whole thing has been put together. there is however another downside to the overtly technical style at work here. we don't really get to see the performances at their best. poor old ray liotta probably did the best work of his life here, but it's all chopped up in little bits, and all we get is occasional looks, flashes, half-gestures. the same goes for lorraine bracco. robert de niro apparently did extensive research into his character, but there doesn't seem to have been much point since he is more or less the same as all the other italian american gangsters he has played in his career. the only player who really comes out well here is joe pesci. pesci has such charisma and presence that he commands attention even in small doses. it also helps that his style is very much in tune with the punchy dialogue and staccato rhythm of the whole piece. coming from the peak in scorsese's abilities as a director of tight control over every aspect, goodfellas could easily have fallen into the trap of being nothing but a showy technical exercise. the only thing that saves it is the fact that its subject matter is so interesting. old and established as the gangster movie is, this one reveals so many sordid truths and fascinating facts about that lifestyle, and does so in such a direct, never-a-dull-moment manner, that it gives the whole genre a jolting jump-start.";19 April 2011;7;['high', 'such', 'new', 'serious', 'stylish', 'comparative', 'true', 'good', 'most', 'constant', 'entire', 'continual', 'little', 'quick', 'other', 'tense', 'gritty', 'vibrant', 'frequent', 'snappy', 'little', 'more', 'cheeky', 'clever', 'early', 'technical', 'lengthy', 'cinematic', 'rhythmic', 'whole', 'technical', 'good', 'poor', 'old', 'good', 'little', 'occasional', 'half', 'same', 'extensive', 'much', 'same', 'other', 'italian', 'american', 'only', 'such', 'small', 'punchy', 'whole', 'tight', 'showy', 'technical', 'only', 'subject', 'interesting', 'old', 'many', 'fascinating', 'direct', 'dull', 'whole'];0.090194192599853

all i can really do is add my voice to the already existing sea of people praising goodfellas and offer my opinion that yeah, it really is that good. it deserves its classic status despite not being as old as we'd maybe usually consider a 'classic,' as well as despite of the fact that it really doesn't feel old at all. the main thing that dates goodfellas is that we know it's old because of how much younger still recognisable stars like deniro and pesci look now. speaking of deniro and pesci: they're both absolutely fantastic. deniro is a little more understated here than he is in some of his best and most hard-hitting performances (namely raging bull and taxi driver, two other great scorsese films), but pesci delivers the role of his career here. he's fantastic: so terrifying and despicable, but also funny and bizarrely human. i think the relationship with his mother (played by scorsese's adorable real life mum) humanises him to a degree, and pesci does such a great job at showing why everyone around his character fears and respects him that i think some of that rubs off on you as an audience member. you can't help but like him while you also hate him. ray liotta deserves praise too, as he largely carries the movie, and despite not quite being a big star on the same level as deniro or pesci, he really is just as good here, and delivers a performance as good as those two give. his voiceover narration is also one of my favourites out of any film i've ever watched. lorraine bracco is also great, and it's good to get a surprisingly compelling female perspective on the mob lifestyle. she's something of an audience surrogate, so well-implemented you might not even realise it at first; her mix of horror and awe at the life she finds herself in i think mirrors what most of us would feel if put into a similar situation. i'm glad she also got a chance to shine throughout the sopranos too, because she's an immensely talented actress that although having those two great roles, probably deserved better. the rest of the cast could well be worth mentioning too, but then we'd be here forever. even minor supporting characters with one or two lines are incredibly memorable (jimmy two times, jimmy two times!!) and then i could go on and on about the amazing soundtrack, with every single song choice being absolutely perfect and adding so much energy. and then there's thelma schoonmaker's editing, and based on her track record with scorsese, these two complement each other so well. in all honesty, the editing in goodfellas is not only schoonmaker's best work, it might well be one of the best edited movies of all time- the pacing is perfect, and two and a half hours flies by yet without anything feeling rushed or hasty. and scorsese... he'll always be one of my favourite filmmakers, and i love that even now he's still giving it his all and making great films (his last three as of the time of writing, the wolf of wall street, silence, and the aforementioned the irishman were all great and amongst the best of their respective years). still, goodfellas might well be his best work. everything feels so complete and right and perfectly put together. it is an impeccably well crafted film, with every shot, every camera movement, every editing trick, every song, and every line of dialogue adding something and making the film as good as it can be. i always find myself in awe of films when they're as good as this one. the compliments i could throw at this movie may well be endless, but in less than 1000 words here i've probably said enough, especially given it's not hard to find other people who love this movie who've already said much of what i've said and then some. it's absolutely worth a watch if you haven't gotten around to it yet for whatever reason, and even if you have, it's just as worthy of a rewatch. like i said, from personal experience, i notice something new and gain a new sense of appreciation for it every time i revisit it. it's inspiring and wonderful that a film this great can exist, and it will stick with me and surely remain a personal favourite of mine until the day i die.";5 February 2020;10;['likely', 'whole', 'few', 'first', 'past', 'well', 'tired', 'great', 'many', 'interesting', 'fresh', 'good', 'classic', 'old', 'old', 'main', 'old', 'young', 'recognisable', 'fantastic', 'understated', 'good', 'other', 'great', 'scorsese', 'fantastic', 'terrifying', 'despicable', 'funny', 'human', 'adorable', 'real', 'great', 'big', 'same', 'good', 'good', 'great', 'good', 'compelling', 'female', 'surrogate', 'most', 'similar', 'glad', 'talented', 'great', 'worth', 'minor', 'memorable', 'amazing', 'single', 'perfect', 'much', 'thelma', 'other', 'good', 'perfect', 'hasty', 'favourite', 'great', 'last', 'great', 'good', 'respective', 'good', 'complete', 'right', 'good', 'good', 'endless', 'less', 'hard', 'other', 'much', 'worth', 'worthy', 'personal', 'new', 'new', 'inspiring', 'wonderful', 'great', 'personal'];0.3163746071280317

107;gazzo-2;"i hadn't ever seen this one, save for parts on the idiot box, so i didn't quite know what to expect. to hear the critics drooling about gf, you'd think this was better than the first two godfathers or casino or whatever. well i hate to burst anyone's bubble, but it's not. its too long, ray liotta is ok but comes off having as much mobster credibility onscreen as potsy from 'happy days'. and i didn't feel bad for him one little bit when the feds got him and his wife. the rest-deniro, pesci, sorvino-age some in this thing, which after all goes from c.53-the early 80s. but does ray? not from what i could see. i donno why that was, as he is about as babyfaced as robbie benson, its hard to tell how old the guy is, but i do know he should have shown some aging at least. its almost as if he's stuck in the same age the whole film and watches the rest of the mob universe parade by. watch this, then see casino-you have basically the same movie, with deniro and pesci trotting out the same old characters they have each played scads of times. yeah you hear all about deniro's great versatility, but c'mon-raging bull this ain't. he was somewhat more refined in casino than he was here, he shot more folks in ronin, he was loonier in 'the fan', but i think deniro's just mailing it in sometimes now. pesci goes kookoo at the drop of a hat in this, i really despised the vile scene of him shooting the young kid waiter, and wonder what scorsese was thinking when he put that in. don't give me that 'its what these guys do in real life, its in character' crap-that is like the equally so-violent-its-stoopid aluminum baseball bats chorus that you get to see at the finale of casino. overkill is overkill, plain and simple. pesci was better in jfk and casino, but played the same kinda guy too, save in jfk ferrie was, well....like his name sez. you get the same old scorsese bag of tricks-his folks play some minor parts, the characters narrate the goings ons, the camera work is flashy, the mob is alternately glorified then shown for what it is, the shootings, explosions and stabbings are filmed with bravado, skill and from many angles, jest in case you happened to miss them the first time. i get the feeling when seeing casino or goodfellas that i'm watching a guy with a phd in film school showing off to all us peons. and i'm not impressed. i have seen this all before. lorraine bracco was pretty good then kinda shelved as the film went on. paul sorvino was probably the best thing about the film, and he just trots out the same old 'mean paul' bit you can see in the 'rocketeer' and 'oh god', if you want my honest opinion. this film was not better than dancing with wolves, and therefore, was not unfairly passed over by oscar, despite the rantings of its many acolytes. good movie? sure. great? nahhh. better than the three godfathers? nope, save for maybe the iiird. *** outta ****; somewhat of a big 'so what' reaction by gazzo-2 this time out.";27 February 2000;9;['well', 'first', 'long', 'ok', 'much', 'onscreen', 'potsy', 'happy', 'bad', 'little', 'early', 'hard', 'old', 'least', 'same', 'whole', 'same', 'same', 'old', 'great', 'refined', 'more', 'loony', 'vile', 'young', 'real', 'violent', 'stoopid', 'overkill', 'plain', 'simple', 'well', 'same', 'kinda', 'same', 'old', 'scorsese', 'minor', 'flashy', 'many', 'first', 'impressed', 'good', 'shelved', 'good', 'same', 'old', 'honest', 'well', 'many', 'good', 'sure', 'great', 'well', 'big'];0.1701636904761904
108;Movie-ManDan;"i did enjoy this film, but i think it gets a little too much praise. the godfather movies are far superior. this was innovative, but it ranks too high in all lists. goodfellas is based on the memoir ""wiseguy"" about henry hill's life as a gangster. ray liotta plays hill and gives are star-making performance. robert de niro plays jimmy the gent and joe pesci earns a well-deserved oscar as tommy devito. hill grew up in urban new york and wanted to be a mobster his whole life. only, he wasn't cut out. tommy and jimmy were his best friends and extremely brutal. there was reluctancy sometimes in henry. he marries karen (bracco) and their family life is well-documented. as henry becomes more like the other thugs, bis life crumbles and surrenders to the witness protection program. i thought that the story was great as it cover major parts in hill's life and some infamous crimes in american history. scorsese also recreates some bits from the book that come out better in the movie. for example, he adds lots to the scene with spider. i'm not saying this is the best mob movie ever like roger ebert said and i'm not saying it sucked. it will never reach the godfather heights. although the editing and film techniques were top- notch, it was not enough. one thing i didn't like was that it practically glorified being a mobster. there's so much loyalty and it makes it out to be fun. being a gangster is not fun. sure it's good that everybody is treated better, but they do horrible things that puts everybody in danger. goodfellas does show that the mafia can be bad, but there's so many circumstances surrounding them that can be learned from. another thing i didn't like was the music. the music was too loud and too good. great music such as the rolling stones and bobby darin were playing. they proved to be distracting and did not fit well with some bit. why not just use regular background music instead of hit songs that are overpowering? then there's the flow and story. as i mentioned above, the story is good but does not come across to its potential. some of the scenes go great by themselves but not all work well as a whole. they jump around too much without giving leads in or out. it just goes from thing-to- thing-to-thing-thing over the course of minutes, plus there's the distracting music. i don't mind 146 minutes, but it seems like 5 hours was condensed in half its time. some parts could have been cut out and replaced with more flows and better plot development. goodfellas is a brilliant flick, but not one of the best.";10 June 2015;1;['little', 'much', 'superior', 'innovative', 'urban', 'whole', 'good', 'brutal', 'other', 'great', 'major', 'infamous', 'american', 'good', 'notch', 'enough', 'much', 'fun', 'fun', 'sure', 'good', 'horrible', 'bad', 'many', 'loud', 'good', 'great', 'such', 'rolling', 'bobby', 'regular', 'good', 'great', 'more', 'well', 'brilliant', 'good'];0.2508064516129032

110;eric262003;"and so from the opening narrative from henry hill's (ray liotta) thoughts, he has always had that dream to become a gangster. claiming that it was far better than being president of the united states. this was the beginning of a long-line of intriguing narratives of martin scorsese's brilliant character-study of mafia life in 1990's ""goodfellas"". based on actual events we follow italian-irish kid henry hill from his humble beginnings to when he became ignited into an italian crime family as we see him work his way through heists and his in-and-out prison systems to his drug trafficking empire. while this is happening, hill's life and relationships were becoming more complicated for him to handle, he has to decide on whether he wants face death from his mafioso allies or take his seat on the witness protection program. behind all these enthralling events, scorsese manages to add a myriad of colorful characters which has a benchmark filled with violence, humour, dedication, loyalty and finally the ultimate of all prices, betrayal. the other notable performances comes from robert de niro as decorated criminal mind jimmy ""the gent"" conway and joe pesci as the diminutive and equally short-tempered assassin tommy devito who seems to be branded by a cornucopia of psychological disorders. devito combines both the catalyst to both the gratuitous violence in the movie as well as most of the dark humour as well. and nobody combines both dark humour and violence better than scorsese. who can forget the the memorable ""what's so funny about me"" scene which has a preceding story that is filled with sharp humour that follows later with intense dialogue only to followed by some friendly humour which leads to unexpected violence. it's classic scenes like this that make this movie so unpredictable and yet very magical. with a cesspool of talented performers, you could easily get lost in the shuffle, and that's exactly what happened to ray liotta here. i'm not saying he was terrible in his leading performance here as gangster wannabe henry hill. it's just that of all the major characters starring here, his was the lesser convincing compared to his costars. his narration lacked the integrity of a cold-blooded gangster, but more like a literature student contemplating on finishing his master's thesis on gangs in new york. the weight carriers in this film depends mostly on the performances of de niro and pesci as they embody the emotions and the intrigue which makes the film very believable and at the same time rich in very specific detail. they're respected roles are the reasons to watch this movie because they're more fun to watch than henry hill who at times felt more like an observer as opposed to being part of the action like what de niro and pesci do. but with the characters and the dynamics within them are very satisfying and sure liotta was great in his role and his narration does embody a man who seems to be feared of what he got himself into and how to get out if there is a way out without being dead. rounding out the supporting cast i thought the chemistry between liotta and lorraine bracco as henry's jewish wife karen friedman hill was really special. the trials and tribulations of this dysfunctional married couple added great depth to the story was an important part of the film. it shows that unlike other gangster films, there is family life provided there and it steps out of the inner circle of gangster films which makes it all reason you can't miss out on a film like this one. however, unlike francis ford coppola who's ""godfather"" movies used a more glorified side to the mob life, scorsese took his direction out in the mean streets of brooklyn and makes the disjointed relationship between henry and karen all the more realistic. scorsese once said that all good films are there to teach us the lessons of life. ""goodfellas"" gives us a hard lesson about respect, dedication, betrayal, assets and liabilities. when all's said and done, ""goodfellas"" stands strong in terms of performances, cinematography, direction and writing. this movie is probably the greatest gangster films in the history of cinema. even though it has some flaws, the movie does a great job in not only looking at the dark side of gangster life, but it demonstrates how good storytelling operates. a fine example of scorsese's direction can easily be summed up near the end as henry and karen enter into the copacabana as the go through the halls. they go past the club and past the kitchen and into a dining area where they are being seated at a table with waiters to serve them. i can't recommend this film enough, it's a wonderful movie, not just for gangster fans, but for people who appreciate good cinema.";31 January 2016;9;['well', 'long', 'intriguing', 'brilliant', 'actual', 'italian', 'irish', 'humble', 'italian', 'complicated', 'mafioso', 'enthralling', 'scorsese', 'colorful', 'other', 'notable', 'criminal', 'psychological', 'gratuitous', 'most', 'dark', 'dark', 'scorsese', 'memorable', 'funny', 'sharp', 'intense', 'friendly', 'unexpected', 'classic', 'unpredictable', 'magical', 'talented', 'terrible', 'major', 'convincing', 'cold', 'blooded', 'believable', 'same', 'rich', 'specific', 'respected', 'more', 'satisfying', 'sure', 'great', 'dead', 'jewish', 'special', 'great', 'important', 'other', 'inner', 'glorified', 'mean', 'realistic', 'good', 'hard', 'strong', 'great', 'great', 'dark', 'good', 'storytelling', 'fine', 'wonderful', 'good'];0.1907990314769975

115;Analog_Devotee;"even when this film was released, there were plenty of italian mafia films to watch and enjoy. some good, some bad, and some severely overrated. but only goodfellas, to this day, has ever handled the subject matter with such an unforgiving amount of raw, revealing truth. this is what ""the life"" really looks like. it's beautiful, it's enticing, but most of all, it's brutal and depressing. and this film captures all those elements perfectly without adding a bunch of circus-like, drama theater nonsense for the sake of aesthetic. being authentic and ruthlessly accurate to the subject matter naturally forms its own unique aesthetic; one many film goers could identify with because it wasn't trying to be flashy--it was trying to be real. and by god they succeeded. this film follows the rise and fall of one henry hill, a half italian, half irish mobster who got his start (as a pre-teen) in the 1950's by parking wiseguys' cadillacs and lincolns. his involvement only stayed innocent for a short time. soon, he was peddling stolen cartons of cigarettes and even blowing up cars with molotov cocktails. although the man himself participated in activities many of us view as despicable, he never shied away from telling the truth. his honesty is admirable, and without it, it could've been decades later before we truly had a first-hand account of what it was really like being a mobster during the golden age, and the eventual downfall. henry hill passed away in 2012 from complications related to heart disease, one day after his 69th birthday. henry hill is the star of the show, but he's far from a one-man band. joe pesci's performance as tommy devito shows us how truly psychotic some of the men were in the mafia; willing to murder someone in a split second over something normal people would shrug off without a second thought. at the same time, he can be lovable and down to earth; showing us the facade many of these men could put up at a moment's notice. one moment he's brutally murdering someone, and the next he's having a pleasurable dinner with his elderly mother who's busting his chops about not settling down with a nice woman. all in the same day! lorraine bracco plays karen hill; henry's wife. seeing her get sucked into the life so easily is quite honestly terrifying. she couldn't have been further from what henry was, yet the flashiness of the mobster lifestyle attracted her like cartoonish characters on the front of a cereal box would attract a grocery cart full of kids. and once she realizes how deceptive the life can be, it's already too late. she's in. and there's no turning back. robert de niro's performance as jimmy conway is quite possibly the one that sticks with me the most. he's the perfect example of how paranoia can turn you into a completely different person; causing you to flip out and cause a scene over something as banal as a man's wife wearing a nice coat after a heist. or going to devastating lengths when you start wondering, ""who can i really trust?"" of course, for many true paranoids, the answer is: no one. this is scorsese at his best. while many of his films are amazing, and also 10/10's, the lightning in a bottle captured in this film will most likely never be replicated. not by scorsese, or anyone, for that matter. this is a film everyone should watch. it's enjoyable as all films should be, but eye-opening unlike any other.";22 April 2020;10;['italian', 'good', 'bad', 'overrated', 'only', 'subject', 'unforgiving', 'beautiful', 'enticing', 'most', 'brutal', 'depressing', 'like', 'aesthetic', 'authentic', 'accurate', 'subject', 'own', 'unique', 'many', 'flashy', 'real', 'italian', 'half', 'irish', 'pre', 'innocent', 'short', 'many', 'despicable', 'admirable', 'first', 'golden', 'eventual', 'psychotic', 'willing', 'normal', 'second', 'same', 'lovable', 'many', 'next', 'pleasurable', 'elderly', 'nice', 'same', 'lorraine', 'terrifying', 'furth', 'cartoonish', 'full', 'deceptive', 'late', 'most', 'perfect', 'different', 'banal', 'nice', 'devastating', 'many', 'true', 'scorsese', 'good', 'many', 'amazing', 'scorsese', 'enjoyable', 'other'];0.1435
116;bkrauser-81-311064;"there was a time in my youth when i really didn't appreciate gangster movies. maybe it was because of the way i was raised or the amount of estrogen present in my mothers womb due to birth order but i never saw the intense violence of that lifestyle as anything but a cry for help. it wasn't until watching martin scorsese's the departed (2006) that my notions of true- to-life crime dramas began to change. i then went back to watch goodfellas (1990), a film i originally saw bits and pieces of when i was twelve. today goodfellas remains to me a revelation. an honest portrayal of the mafioso lifestyle told directly from the horses mouth.the movie itself takes the viewer through three decades of mob life. our protagonist henry becomes enamored with the lifestyle in early adolescence and is hooked with its excesses before costars robert de niro and joe pesci even appear on screen. once they do, the trio become the focus of the film as they attempt to climb up the lucchese family hierarchy. ray liotta serves as our narrator and double for real-life wiseguy henry hill a half irish-italian mobster turned informant who spilled the beans on the lucchese crime family for the fbi and later writer nicholas pileggi. pileggi would later release his book wiseguy: life in a mafia family in 1986 which is around the time director martin scorsese got wind of the story. the film is told through a series of episodes starting with the three protagonists driving in darkness and killing an unknown man in the trunk of their car. the film then linearly progresses through time, revisiting that gruesome scene halfway through. while the story structure diverges slightly from the traditionally linear, anticipating action, climax, resolution format, the movie keeps interest. this is to the credit of martin scorsese's direction as well as his habit of putting bubbly 50's and 60's pop songs over brutal acts of violence. nicholas pileggi should also take a bow both for the original book and countless rewrites that made goodfellas possible. it was his authenticity that brought the characters dimension. but while the writer gives characters motivations and plot, it is the actors that really make them flesh and blood. robert de niro's jimmy ""the gent"" conway towers in every scene he's in with equal parts suavity and malice. while de niro provides the group credibility in the yes of the mob and audience, joe pesci is pure id. a trigger-happy sociopath with a red hot temper and a gun; not a combination that leads to good things in a movie of this kind. pesci would end up winning an oscar for his work on goodfellas; a role that was originally offered to al pacino. one underrated aspect of goodfellas is the character arch of lorraine bracco's role karen hill; henry's wife. there are moments of the film narrated by the tragic heroine that provide the movie with a sense of perspective just as henry's objectivity has gone off the deep end. she's an outsider who is at first overwhelmed but becomes seduced by the decadence of mob life and breaks bad. i would argue that the river runs deeper with karen than with the dejected henry. henry wants the fancy cars, excessive staten island home and the most expensive artificial christmas tree money can buy. but when karen is handed a gun and told to hide it, right after a aberrant neighbor gets his faced smashed with the butt-end, she claims arousal. this is not a woman who craves simple security in the arms of the hero, she wants respect. that's why every transgression henry or anyone makes is met with hostility. what isn't shown in the movie but detailed in the book was karen's affair with mob capo paul vario while henry was in prison; little more lady macbeth than ophelia if you ask me. of course, goodfellas as a whole is studded with set pieces of violence and cruelty that in a lesser movie i wouldn't be impressed with. but as with good food, its not just ingredients that make the meal, its how its presented. the violence of goodfellas is presented with a matter- of-factness and purpose that isn't gratuitous. scorsese doesn't want you to bask in the glory of outright gore, he wants you to experience the world as the characters do, a task which he largely succeeds in. i love this movie if for no other reason than it breaks the mold and sets a gold-standard for other genre movies to inspire to. it features topnotch performances from actors and actresses at the top of their game, and it showcases the uncompromising vision and talent of one of the greatest auteurs of the late 20th century. http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/";27 October 2013;9;['present', 'intense', 'honest', 'mafioso', 'enamored', 'early', 'lucchese', 'real', 'half', 'irish', 'italian', 'lucchese', 'unknown', 'gruesome', 'linear', 'brutal', 'original', 'countless', 'possible', 'dimension', 'conway', 'equal', 'pure', 'happy', 'red', 'hot', 'good', 'underrated', 'tragic', 'deep', 'bad', 'fancy', 'excessive', 'expensive', 'artificial', 'aberrant', 'faced', 'simple', 'little', 'more', 'set', 'less', 'good', 'gratuitous', 'other', 'other', 'great', 'late'];-0.0339965986394557

118;wisewebwoman;"'goodfellas' is right up there with the best of martin scorcese. i recently hauled this out for a re-viewing and i was surprised at how totally up to date it felt. how relevant the plot was, how topical the story. and for a mafia movie of that era, how the women were brought front and centre and given a narrative voice - karen hill (played by lorraine bracco), the wife of the protagonist, henry hill (played by a riveting ray liotta) both get to tell their stories. the movie is based on a true story and the cast are awesome. at this later viewing i was particularly interested to see many of ""the sopranos"" cast, here making their debuts in a similar crime-family drama. the movie is astounding in that it brings complexity, a riveting script, brilliant relevant music (with actual stars performing their hits) and mind boggling tracking shots, the most difficult of all movie sequencing. scorcese, or his ensemble, do not flinch from the complexity of this and afterwards, one wonders at how many takes were involved. we are drawn into the intimate life of a crime family, the gradual desensitizing to the horror of the life, driven by material greed at any cost, including the callous snuffing of lives. the large ensemble cast (both known and unknown and including both of scorcese's parents in brilliant sidebits), the cinematography, editing and dialogue are all masterful. de niro is at his charming best,joe pesci captivates as a psychotic, insecure 'made' man lorraine bracco is masterful in a fully developed role, ray liotta is marvellous in the way he depicts the reality of the hoodlum life, the juxta-positioning of sauce making against the back drop of victim burials. paul sorvino, michael imperioli, debi mazar, samuel l. jackson, illeana douglas and kevin corrigan all add to the over all engrossing engagement of the film. 8 out of 10. not to be missed.";17 February 2008;8;['good', 'surprised', 'relevant', 'topical', 'narrative', 'riveting', 'true', 'awesome', 'interested', 'many', 'similar', 'astounding', 'riveting', 'brilliant', 'relevant', 'actual', 'difficult', 'many', 'intimate', 'gradual', 'callous', 'large', 'ensemble', 'unknown', 'brilliant', 'masterful', 'charming', 'good', 'psychotic', 'insecure', 'lorraine', 'masterful', 'marvellous', 'back'];0.3505102040816326
119;Abdulxoxo;"it just so happens i watched the irishman right before watching this movie, as both films are similar in a way; an adaptation of a book about a story of a real life gangster, and you can see the tons of elements of this movie that martin scorsese brought to the irishman. both are great in their own way but i prefer this one as it's shorter and more to the point. this film is a biopic of henry hill, a young man from new york's poorest neighborhood. we see him and his two friends, jimmy and tommy, lookout for ways to climb a career ladder as members of the italian mafia. goodfellas shows how straight-up scary it is to be a 'wiseguy', and it doesn't hold back when it comes to portrayal of violence in modern mob life. the emphasis isn't on plot, which is a series of disconnected events and skips back and forth; it's on one mobster's experience. through voice-over narration, we see thirty years of that life through henry's eyes, and we get to feel the rush he gets from the power and luxury that the life provides. greed, violence and power are some of the central topics in the movie. the film also explores such themes as loyalty, class struggle, and immigration. most of the prominent points in the movie involve money, so people's nature and desires play a crucial role. the performances are exceptional; robert deniro played the calm, smiling snake jimmy conway convincingly, joe pesci in his career best performance, played the short-tempered, murderous lunatic tommy devito, ray liotta as henry hill in the lead role did a great job, and i think deserved way more recognition for his performance but poor him, how could he? since he was overshadowed by the likes of deniro and pesci. lorraine bracco performance as karen hill is also memorable. the soundtrack is absolutely brilliant, it's a huge collection of more than 40 songs starting from 1950s through the 1970s. from the first song by tony bennett to the last song by sid vicious, the music adds more impact, pace and characterization to the film. the music is there clearly and when it comes to really important moments, it really boost up the heart of audience and thoroughly immersed with the characters that a parallel is drawn through the lives of the musicians and characters in the movie. the thoroughness of the expertise and intensity in the choice of the songs creates such a spiritual and omniscient voice in the soundtrack. the cinematography is great; cinematographer michael ballhaus, along with martin scorsese utilized great steady cam work, with intelligent usage of freeze frames, to capture important moments in henry's life like the scene where henry is running away after torching some cars, and after he took a beating from his father. he also used these great, eye-level seeking shots, displaying the amazing scenery and characters emotions. the lighting is also well-done, as it isn't afraid to use darkness. all in all, goodfellas is directed, written and acted well. sometimes hilarious and raunchy and sometimes very raw and violent, with themes that are relevant and that are resonant in today's society.";8 December 2020;8;['similar', 'real', 'great', 'own', 'short', 'young', 'poor', 'italian', 'straight', 'scary', 'modern', 'disconnected', 'central', 'such', 'most', 'prominent', 'crucial', 'exceptional', 'good', 'murderous', 'lunatic', 'lead', 'great', 'deserved', 'more', 'poor', 'lorraine', 'memorable', 'brilliant', 'huge', 'more', 'first', 'last', 'vicious', 'more', 'important', 'spiritual', 'great', 'great', 'steady', 'intelligent', 'freeze', 'important', 'great', 'amazing', 'afraid', 'hilarious', 'raunchy', 'raw', 'violent', 'relevant', 'resonant'];0.2337805605247466

127;hnt_dnl;goodfellas came out in the first year of the 90s and was so good it stayed one of the best films by the end of the decade. it is a supremely confident martin scorsese at his storytelling best! it is perhaps his last true masterpiece (so far). goodfellas is the anti-gangster film. the anti-godfather, goodfellas tells the sordid, sleazy side of the gangster. it is realistic in presentation, but still has that scorcese touch of flair and the characters jump out at the screen at you. goodfellas is the story of one henry hill (played memorably by ray liotta, who also narrates most of the film). henry was raised in brooklyn in the 50s and ended up friends with a local hood tommy devito, who was connected to the mob. as an adult tommy is played by joe pesci in a performance that deservedly won him the best supporting actor award of 1990. pesci's speech was short but memorable (the academy really deserves few words of thanks from anyone, but this time, they got the winner right). tommy is a borderline psychopath who snaps at the slightest hint of disrespect towards him. these moments are simultaneously hilarious and frightening to watch, because they seem so real and pesci perfectly relays the hotheadedness of tommy. tommy works for the larger mob, run by paulie cicero (a well cast paul sorvino in fine form). the go-to guy though for both henry and tommy is paulie's right hand man jimmy conway (played by the great robert deniro in one of his most underrated performances). deniro really carries goodfellas for me. scorcese always seems to bring out the best in deniro. he really seems to know what makes this actor tick. and it works to perfection in goodfellas. together, the triumvirate of henry, tommy, and jimmy successfully gangster-ize their way through the 50s, 60s, and 70s (well, 2 of them made it that far!). the convos in goodfellas are what really strike me. they seem so authentic and scary. these guys plot, scheme, cajole, and kill with such alarming ease that it is almost a revelation that guys like this really existed. they are completely embedded in this world. they love being goodfellas. also memorable is best supporting actress nominee lorraine bracco as henry's wife karen, who gets narrate a small part of the film herself. initially disgusted by henry and his world, karen becomes intoxicated by it and caught in it herself. the biggest star of goodfellas is probably the cinematography: long tracking shots, character closeups at key moments, zoom-ins to characters at important points, slightly shaky camera action, etc. it magnifies the effect of this deadly life that these people have chosen to be a part of. the use of era music is done to great effect as well, in addition to capturing the essence of the 50s through the 70s. great work all around. goodfellas was nominated for best picture in 1990 and should have won. scorsese absolutely should have won best director. a real modern classic. heck, a classic in any time period!;17 August 2008;10;['first', 'good', 'good', 'confident', 'last', 'true', 'anti', 'gangster', 'sleazy', 'realistic', 'scorcese', 'most', 'local', 'short', 'memorable', 'few', 'slight', 'hilarious', 'frightening', 'real', 'large', 'fine', 'right', 'great', 'underrated', 'good', 'authentic', 'scary', 'such', 'alarming', 'memorable', 'small', 'big', 'long', 'key', 'important', 'shaky', 'deadly', 'great', 'great', 'good', 'good', 'real', 'modern'];0.2580687830687831

130;TheUnknown837-1;"when he was asked to name the best films of the 1990s, film critic roger ebert not only ranked martin scorsese's ""goodfellas"" as the best next to ""fargo"" (1996) but also labeled it ""the best mob movie ever."" a friend of scorsese's, ebert also labeled the filmmaker as the finest director in the united states today. to me, ""goodfellas"" is not the best film about organized crime. that reward goes to ""the godfather"" (1972). but if there ever was a film to replace ""the godfather"" (1972) as the best mafia movie, ""goodfellas"" would be it. ""goodfellas"" is one of those rare cases where a true story about violence and ferocity is adapted for the screen but without bringing it to a glorious sense like ""lawrence of arabia"" (1962). the said 60s film took a tale of heroism mixed with narcissistic violence to create a sweeping epic. what scorsese does is take the dark plot of the underworld and the mafia and make it look exactly like what it was and still is today. it is a fabulous retelling of the story of henry hill, a part-italian kid who grew up amongst the mobsters and sought to become one of them. unlike other mob movies, ""goodfellas"" does not make heroes or role models out of its characters. the movie centers around the people of the mafia underworld and avoids the civilians who would ultimately become victims of them and their ways. instead, scorsese and co-screenwriter nicholas pileggi make cruel and dislikable characters and masterfully command the cast into representing them. most particularly is the character played by joe pesci. the character, again based on a real-life person, is like a tender human explosive. just touch the surface of it and it goes off, tearing or blowing apart anything that provokes it. pesci's character is the kind of man who if you insult him verbally, even as a joke, he will beat you half to death or just whip out his gun and empty it into your heart and then sit down and finish whatever he was doing in the first place and not shed a tear or let out a sigh of regret over your mangled remains. like a wild animal, he is unpredictable and cannot be controlled; only put down. and the sickening thing is that robert de niro's character is actually fond of this monstrosity of a man. we only learn the bad sides of these men; not their good sides, for they probably lost it all when they joined the mafia. we see them cheat on their spouses, murder people in broad daylight, traffic drugs, destroy property, and again, they do it for their own satisfaction. there's no morality, not even among themselves. the movie opens with a brutal scene of what these men do and yet the ray liotta character immediately states afterward: ""as far back as i can remember, i always wanted to be a gangster. to me, being a gangster was better than being president of the united statesit was there that i knew that i belonged."" this is a brutal and savage world these men lived in and martin scorsese excellently brings this back to screen to give us a new impression of the mafia and reminds us that these kind of people still exist today and are not heroes or images for civilized people not even in the vaguest sense. in regards to the cast, it is perfect. ray liotta, robert de niro, and joe pesci (who won an oscar for his performance) were quintessentially cast in their roles. the only part i thought was wrongly developed was lorraine bracco's character. i just felt the character was either too over the top or bracco overacted a little, but this is a forgivable weakness and it's hardly a weakness at all. there is also the two-and-a-half-hour running time, which i felt was just a little too long. but these few minor flaws aside, ""goodfellas"" is certainly one of the most important films of the past twenty years in an era where hollywood seems to have lost its motivation for films beyond the conventional range.";5 April 2009;10;['good', 'good', 'next', 'good', 'fine', 'good', 'organized', 'good', 'rare', 'true', 'glorious', 'narcissistic', 'sweeping', 'dark', 'fabulous', 'part', 'italian', 'other', 'scorsese', 'co', 'cruel', 'dislikable', 'real', 'tender', 'human', 'first', 'wild', 'unpredictable', 'fond', 'bad', 'good', 'broad', 'own', 'brutal', 'well', 'brutal', 'savage', 'new', 'civilized', 'vague', 'perfect', 'only', 'little', 'forgivable', 'little', 'few', 'minor', 'important', 'past', 'conventional'];0.0920542295542295
131;baumer;"goodfellas makes you feel like you are watching guys that you know or knew. to this day, i have a friend that still talks like jimmy two times. he always says things like ""nice nice"" and that was just a background piece in goodfellas. but that is the point, all that is background is just as important as the main players and locales. it all paints us a perfect picture of what mob life must be like. and with all due kudos to the godfather, but there is no other film that has ever made mob life look so real and feel so tangible the way goodfellas does. to say that joe pesci is the best part of this film would be to discredit the rest of the cast, but at the same time, you have to mention him in some way. his portrayal of tommy is haunting. here is a man that is so insecure and wants to be the top dog, the made man so bad that he can't decipher between what is a joke and what is disrespect towards him. of course the scene in question is when he shoots a common boy for telling tommy to screw himself after he shot him in the leg. you would think the guy has a right to let off a little steam and vent, but tommy is always looking for the diss. he is always looking to find some hidden gesture from someone that is putting him down. even at the beginning when he is getting on henri in the now famous "" you're a funny guy "" scene. he is kidding with henri but deep down inside he is angry with him, you can see it and feel it. joe pesci gave the performance of his career and he richly deserved to win best supporting actor that year. the story and script by pileggi is sheer inside brilliance. you can feel the inside observations that no one can have except for a guy that spent his whole life on the inside. they ring so true and they get into your blood. from scenes like the fat guy running around delivering messages to the other mob guys because he doesn't like to use the phone to the scene when henri, jimmy and tommy have billy bats in the trunk but they stop off at tommy's moms house for a late night dinner of pasta and such. they also have to borrow a sharp knife to finish off the guy in the trunk, but to his mom they have to cut off the hoof of a dear that hit the car. and the scene where tommy does kill the young kid for joking with him and then jimmy gets mad at him, not for killing the guy but because he doesn't want to dig a hole tonight. there are so many tiny observations in goodfellas that give it the authenticity it has. and it is a film that stays with you for years to come. i think this is scorcese's best film and although i understand and accept why the academy awarded dances with wolves the accolades it did, if this film would have swept the oscars that year, no one would have been surprised. it is a landmark film and i think it is one of the best films ever made. and again, taking no credit away from coppolla's godfather epics, but this gets inside the mafia on a deeper level. it goes one step beyond what coppolla gave us, and for that goodfellas should be remembered as the best film about gangsters ever made.";16 September 1999;10;['nice', 'nice', 'important', 'main', 'perfect', 'due', 'other', 'real', 'tangible', 'good', 'same', 'insecure', 'top', 'bad', 'disrespect', 'common', 'little', 'famous', 'funny', 'angry', 'good', 'sheer', 'inside', 'whole', 'true', 'fat', 'other', 'late', 'such', 'sharp', 'young', 'mad', 'many', 'tiny', 'good', 'good', 'deep', 'good'];0.1545343137254902

136;Joxerlives;"both watched the film and read the book and both are amazing. in terms of accuracy they're pretty terrific, there are a few differences but they're not significant. in real life tommy was a huge, powerful man whilst pesci in the film is diminutive but no less terrifying. tommy wasn't shot in the face so his family couldn't have an open coffin as featured in the film, he just disappeared and was never seen again (which is exactly what happened to his girlfriend a short time later). the famous 'funny how?' story was not actually something which happened to henry hill but was something which really did happen to joe pesci whilst he was working as a waiter for some genuine mafioso. tremendous performances all around, de niro his customary excellent, a career making turn from both ray liotta and loraine brocco and did you spot a then unknown samuel l jackson as stacks? in many ways though it's pesci who dominates, prior to this he was largely known as a comic actor with home alone and lethal weapon 2, such a small guy but just full of unbelievable aggressiveness, he makes you shudder. what i really like about it is that it shows you both the good side and the bad side of being a gangster. on the good side you are the 'movie-star with muscle' everything just falls into your lap and you live the life of reilly, even when you go to prison you're treated special. on the bad side you have to do things like dig up the rotting corpses of other gangsters you've murdered and rebury them. keep looking over your shoulder for the police and fbi all the time. and that your friends aren't really your friends, they'll happily rat you out if they think it'll save them or slit your throat if they think there's 5 bucks in it for them (""f*ck you, pay me!"") one thing i would suggest is that if you enjoyed this you should check out 'the big heist' with donald sutherland, a tv movie starring donald sutherland which concentrates on jimmy burke.";1 April 2013;10;['amazing', 'terrific', 'few', 'significant', 'real', 'huge', 'powerful', 'diminutive', 'terrifying', 'open', 'short', 'famous', 'funny', 'genuine', 'tremendous', 'customary', 'unknown', 'many', 'comic', 'alone', 'lethal', 'small', 'full', 'unbelievable', 'good', 'bad', 'good', 'special', 'bad', 'other', 'big'];0.1111721611721612
137;hall895;"as far back as he could remember henry hill wanted to be a gangster. he got his wish and in goodfellas we get to go along for the exciting ride. before the opening titles have even concluded we get a clear sense of the very dangerous yet oddly thrilling lives henry and his fellow gangsters lead. and the sense of excitement and wonder is maintained right up until the bitter end. ray liotta is the nominal lead in his role as henry from whose point of view the story is told. while liotta is fine in his role joe pesci as tommy devito and robert de niro as jimmy conway are even better. the boundless energy and manic temper pesci brings to tommy are absolutely perfect. pesci's performance in the now-famous ""i'm funny how?"" scene is acting at its best. de niro's performance is more subtle but also brilliant and his portrayal of jimmy brings a sense of menace whenever he appears. even though he is for the most part restrained, you know he is fully capable of exploding at any moment. also giving fine performances are lorraine bracco as henry's wife, karen, and paul sorvino as the quiet, mysterious, yet undeniably powerful mob boss paul cicero. goodfellas depicts the rise and fall of henry hill in his life in the mafia. we follow him from his beginnings as a simple brooklyn youth through dizzying highs and maddening lows. henry is in effect telling his own story here through liotta's voice-over narration and this device works well, filling in some blanks, helping to move the story along and also giving some insight into the motivations which drive his actions. we also get some insight from karen's point of view as sporadic bracco narration sheds some light on how a simple, naive girl gets swept up in the mob life. the unique martin scorsese touch also adds a great deal to the experience. so many sequences are brilliantly conceived and perfectly executed. none is more memorable than the truly brilliant tracking shot where for over three unbroken minutes we follow henry and karen from the street outside the copacabana nightclub down through the bowels of the club and right up to the front of the stage. few directors would even imagine such a sequence much less be able to pull it off so wonderfully. scorsese's use of music is also pitch-perfect as he seems to always be able to find just the right song to perfectly frame each moment. and as would be expected with scorsese nothing is spared in terms of violence or language. henry hill and those around him led ruthless, violent, dangerous lives and scorsese captures that wonderfully. proceeding at its own pace, goodfellas allows you to really get to know and appreciate these characters. some might quibble and say things move along too slowly, that the pace could be picked up. but there is no denying that, overall, goodfellas is absolutely terrific.";31 May 2005;8;['exciting', 'clear', 'dangerous', 'fellow', 'bitter', 'nominal', 'fine', 'well', 'boundless', 'manic', 'perfect', 'famous', 'funny', 'good', 'subtle', 'brilliant', 'most', 'capable', 'fine', 'lorraine', 'quiet', 'mysterious', 'powerful', 'simple', 'dizzying', 'own', 'sporadic', 'simple', 'naive', 'unique', 'great', 'many', 'memorable', 'brilliant', 'unbroken', 'few', 'able', 'perfect', 'able', 'right', 'scorsese', 'ruthless', 'violent', 'dangerous', 'scorsese', 'own', 'terrific'];0.2165057915057914
138;sharky_55;"there is neither glorification or criticism of the gangster lifestyle in scorsese's goodfellas, despite the opening lines of henry hill's narration. at times it can seem almost alluring and seductive. take the character of karen for example, played excellently by lorraine bracco. one can pinpoint the approximate moment in which she becomes swept up in the lifestyle of henry (ray liotta), right when she decides to hide a bloodied gun rather than go to the police as ""other girlfriends"" would do. her voice-over from her first appearance is one of the film's only real insights into henry's world from the outside world. from then on it's a slow process as she is swallowed into her husband's life. some of it is subtle, like the line about the bag of money at the wedding and how no one would dare steal from the mafia. in other instances she's shocked at what she's gotten into as we wake to see an extreme close up of a gun barrel pointed directly at the camera before she breaks down and realises she cannot do the deed. one of the film's pivotal and most famous scenes is the long tracking shot that takes us through one of henry and karen's first dates. they bypass the waiting queue for a nightclub, entering via the service corridors and travel through the kitchen and right up to the stage where they immediately are presented with front row seats and a table. the magic of this shot as henry greets acquaintance after acquaintance illustrates the lavish lifestyle and prestige of his position even at a young age, and seduces us like it seduces karen. in a similar scene, we are presented with henry's pov as the long take and voice-over narration combine seamlessly to introduce us to mafia members in a bar. the camera-work is slow, deliberate and precise; each member is hinted at being their own fleshed out persona, each with their own powers and lives, yet for henry it's a very familiar process. the select few mafia members that are shown to be in close correspondence to henry are tommy (joe pesci) and jimmy (robert de niro), the three of them taking care of business in the opening scene. the ease in which the violence and brutality of their work slips between their mundane lives humanises and establishes the main characters as a family. one moment they are finishing off a murder and digging a hole for the body, the next they are having a meal with tommy's mother. the opening of the film sharply paints a contrast when it is later revealed what they have done and where exactly they got the knife from. compare the harsh ominous red lighting of the digging scene to the naturally calm dinner with tommy's mother. the film's dialogue also makes similar comparisons which highlight the notion of family. there's a brief moment of tension between tommy and henry who comments on his ""funny"" nature, the same comment later mirrored as tommy takes offense to billy batt's ball bustering. one ends in laughter, the other murder. even in prison, a usually dark and dismal location, their ties are are strong as ever. they live like kings inside, getting regular shipments of fine gourmet food from bribed guards: bread, salami, prosciutto, cheese, scotch, wine. it's arguable one of the film's calmest moments, the soft jazz vocals of bobby darin's beyond the sea accompany the scene as the four sit down and dine on better food than many on the outside can afford. it's just one of the many perfect choices of music scorsese uses to add information and mood to the film. later, as jimmy begins to cut ties and whack the people involved in the lufthansa heist, the heavy and bitter-sweet chords of layla's piano segment signal the beginning of the end. scorsese's use of freeze frames at vital points of henry's journey, and the imposing dolly zoom near the end of his mafia life add additional subtext. goodfellas covers a great deal of time from the early deliveries of a young henry, to his marriage and rise up the gang, to the 4 years he spends in prison and the growing up of his kids. so it's a little jarring as a sequence near the end depicts a whole day of his life and responsibility. gone are the long and graceful shots of his luxurious lifestyle. his hair is not slicked to the side and his face shows visible signs of ageing and of course drug abuse, which leads the audience and even karen to believe his paranoia is from that source. it's a very stylish and frenetic sequence; the edits seem to jump quicker and between locations at a moment's notice, the narration of henry is suddenly a tiny bit faster and there's almost a slight fisheye lens effect as we slowly close into his character. the walls of the frame seem to squeeze henry as he rushes from chore to chore; gun deals, snorting cocaine, another gun deal, check on the sauce, mix the cocaine, check on the sauce again. work and life mixes together as henry struggles to maintain his standard of living he has become so accustomed to. the sentiment is echoed most prominently in the end. henry gets up from the witness stand, walk across the courtroom and breaks the 4th wall as he directly narrates to the camera; ""i get to live the rest of my life like a schnook."" it's the high highs and the low lows of the gangster lifestyle that he craves even in the relative safety of the witness protection program. his comment on ordering spaghetti and getting egg noodles with ketchup is particularly telling: even in prison he ate much better and it's exactly in that world where he feels most comfortable. for that, henry would do it all over again.";6 February 2015;10;['alluring', 'seductive', 'approximate', 'other', 'first', 'only', 'real', 'outside', 'slow', 'subtle', 'other', 'extreme', 'pivotal', 'famous', 'long', 'first', 'lavish', 'young', 'similar', 'long', 'slow', 'deliberate', 'precise', 'own', 'own', 'familiar', 'select', 'few', 'close', 'mundane', 'main', 'next', 'harsh', 'ominous', 'red', 'calm', 'similar', 'brief', 'funny', 'same', 'other', 'dark', 'dismal', 'strong', 'regular', 'fine', 'bribed', 'arguable', 'calm', 'soft', 'well', 'many', 'many', 'perfect', 'heavy', 'bitter', 'sweet', 'freeze', 'vital', 'additional', 'great', 'early', 'young', 'little', 'whole', 'long', 'graceful', 'luxurious', 'visible', 'stylish', 'frenetic', 'tiny', 'slight', 'close', 'accustomed', 'high', 'low', 'relative', 'well', 'comfortable'];0.1169067796610169

143;bankofmarquis;"i have to admit, when i first watched goodfellas 30 years ago, i thought it was ""good"" but not ""great"". the years and subsequent viewings of this epic masterpiece has slowly changed my mind. directed by one of the finest directors of all-time, goodfellas is based on the real-life experience of former ""wiseguy"" nicholas pileggi (from his book) and depicts mob life in new york city in the 1960's and the 1970's. scorcese knows this world and it's looks & feels and you can sense that world while watching this movie. whether it's the clothing, the set decorations, the vocal inflections or the music choices, scorcese meticulously blends all of the minutiae of these eras and these people extremely effectively to draw a vivid picture of people - and gangsters - of another era. it helps tremendously that he has an ""a"" cast to inherit the characters. robert deniro shows his ferocious personae as a ""force to be reckoned with"" as legendary (their word) mobster jimmy conway. he has a danger to him that could erupt at any time, but he also has something else - probably even more dangerous - he's smart and wily and will meticulously plan his crimes out. this makes him stand out in a world where most are acting out of impulse. joe pesci, rightfully, won the oscar for best supporting actor for his take on psychopathic gangster tommy devito. what struck me on this viewing of the film was how small a role in this film that tommy is. pesci is not on-screen all that much, but for the scenes that he is in, he is incredibly powerful. you can see that tommy is dangerous and needs to be handled with ""kit gloves"". scorcese took a chance by centering this film on an unknown actor on who's shoulders that this film will stand or fall - and he chose wisely - for ray liotta's performance as henry hill is fascinating to watch. he has a charisma and charm to him that draws you in, but there is also an air about him that repels you away at the same time. scorcese cast another unknown, lorraine bracco as henry's wife, karen hill, who is drawn towards the power and danger of henry (and his world). bracco was nominated for an oscar and liotta never came close to this level of performance for the rest of his career. credit, therefore, must be given to the directorial job that scorcese put in on this film. this is his masterpiece (despite what the oscars say). years from now when scholars look back on his career, this (along with raging bull) will be the films that are shown (not the departed - the film that he, finally, won his oscar for). i find more and more nuance and richness to this film upon subsequent re-watches, and i drank those in on this viewing. goodfellas is like a fine wine, it gets better with age. letter grade: a 9 stars out of 10 (and you can take that to the bank(ofmarquis)";26 June 2020;9;['good', 'great', 'subsequent', 'epic', 'fine', 'real', 'former', 'vocal', 'vivid', 'ferocious', 'legendary', 'dangerous', 'smart', 'wily', 'most', 'good', 'psychopathic', 'small', 'much', 'powerful', 'dangerous', 'unknown', 'fascinating', 'same', 'unknown', 'lorraine', 'directorial', 'more', 'more', 'subsequent', 'fine', 'well'];0.2314182194616977

152;gregsrants;i hate it when people ask me what my favorite movie of all time is. that is like asking an art lover what their favorite painting is. break it down to favorite abstract painter, favorite contemporary artist, and you might get a more definitive answer. so asking a movie buff what their favorite film is not entirely fair. i have a favorite comedy, a favorite drama, horror, foreign film etc., but to pick one from the bunch is more question than i can handle. given my above conundrum, if i was ever to amass a list of best-evers, 1990's goodfellas would surely be near the top of the list. directed by martin scorsese and featuring an all-star cast including robert deniro, joe pesci and ray liotta, goodfellas was nominated for six academy awards including best picture. although at the end of the march ceremony, only one award was engraved with a participant's name - pesci for supporting actor - goodfellas remains as maybe the best film of the 1990's. based on the novel 'wiseguy', by nicholas pileggi, the movie follows the true story of henry hill (liotta), as he rises through the ranks of the mob. from child to young adult, we watch henry as he gains acceptance, gets married, and goes to jail, starts dealing drugs, all leading to his capture by authorities. along for the wild ride of mob hits, heists and murders are jimmy and tommy (deniro and pesci, respectively), two lifetime mobsters that take henry under their wings and teach him the ropes. jimmy is the elder statesman who handles things professionally and is respected for his calm demeanor. tommy is the hot-head stereotype who resorts to violence whenever threatened. together, they provide the perfect balance for henry as he tries to cope with life in the underworld while maintaining a normal life presence. goodfellas is a near perfect film. scorsese has cast each part with actors born to play their role. from paul sorvino as the mob figurehead to lorraine bracco in a breakthrough performance as henry's love interest, the cast fits together like a leather glove. and they each have cool names to boot. there is spider, fat andy, pete the killer and jimmy two times just to ramble off a few. whether you were a bit player or someone with a bigger trailer, scorsese handles everyone with crafted dialogue and incredible attention to authenticity. what also makes goodfellas so good, are the costumes and set design that bring us right back to the 70's and 80's tacky kitchens and pastel living room furniture. scorsese does well in bringing us through multiple decades and showing the natural progression of the actors and their belongings as time marches forward. even the voice over works. not a fan of this cheap tactic to move a story forward, henry hill bursts narration throughout the film with quotes like, 'jimmy was the kinda guy that rooted for bad guys in the movies' and 'whenever we needed money, we'd rob the airport. to us, it was better than citibank.' each narration brings either humor or does well in helping us grow with the characters and eventually cheering for violence bearing mafia. but if i could pick one thing to give the director his chops, it would have to be in his depiction of henry hill. by taking his time with the story (the movie does run 145 minutes), we can follow henry through the many stages of his involvement. when henry is involved with his first encounter with violence, it is a believable occurrence based on the progression. and when henry begins selling drugs, we may not agree, but we can definitely understand what brought him and his family to that stage of their lives. the dvd comes without many special features, and that is too bad. it would be interesting to hear scorsese talk about how some cast members (michael imperioli and tony sirico) went on to become famous with the soprano's, or how he was able to nab samuel l. jackson and vincent gallo for parts all but forgotten by the audience before the end credits. five stars are not to be taken or given lightly. goodfellas deserves every one of them.;11 March 2004;10;['favorite', 'favorite', 'favorite', 'abstract', 'favorite', 'contemporary', 'definitive', 'favorite', 'fair', 'favorite', 'favorite', 'foreign', 'more', 'above', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'true', 'young', 'wild', 'eld', 'calm', 'hot', 'perfect', 'normal', 'near', 'perfect', 'cool', 'few', 'big', 'incredible', 'good', 'tacky', 'pastel', 'multiple', 'natural', 'cheap', 'kinda', 'bad', 'well', 'many', 'first', 'believable', 'many', 'special', 'bad', 'interesting', 'scorsese', 'tony', 'famous', 'able', 'vincent'];0.348781179138322
153;jpschapira;"martin scorsese has had a delicate career. i'm not saying he has had bad times as a director; i'm talking about his recognition as the pro he is. and i'm talking about the times he was overlooked, even with this movie, which is without doubt the best work he has done (or at least the best i've seen). i don't want to say what everyone says but we've seen marty lost his oscars with actors turned directors in those that for most people where his best movies. but many people waste a lot of time talking about those things; and i'm writing about ""goodfellas"". yes, that scorsese movie that is so his as most of his projects are. that movie, one of the few directed by scorsese that he also wrote, in collaboration with nicholas pileggi; who would write with him again for ""casino"", a movie i haven't seen but i watched some parts and there's a clear parallel. in ""casino"", it's a guy talking about how the casino works; the movement. the guy works in the casino. in ""goodfellas"", it's a guy narrating his life as a gangster. he's a gangster, and if you don't realize at the beginning, it'll happen soon when he starts by: ""as far back as i can remember, i've always wanted to be a gangster"". ""goodfellas"" is based on a true story, about characters that really existed and could have had talks with the movie's main actors. there's an unusual magic in cinema when it comes to narration; and this is one of the first movies that dealt with that. frank darabont was having doubts as he was writing his first feature, based on a book, as ""goodfellas"" is. he was writing and discovered he was using a lot of narration, he was afraid it wouldn't work. only just then he sat and watched ""goodfellas"" again, and probably again and again""the heck"", he must have said. ""this is pure narration"". of course that movie is ""the shawshank redemption"", today a classic and personally one of my favorite scripts. when you experience main characters narrating the story, it's something unique. i've recently seen ""paid in full"", where ace, the main character, is telling a story. he takes us to the past once we saw a glance of the presents, and talks quietly and not so much so we can presence the story. this atmosphere came before with ""goodfellas"", where henry hill (ray liotta) talks, after we see a brief glance in a time we'll see after. he introduces us to everyone and to his most united friends; jimmy conway (robert de niro) and tommy devito (joe pesci). henry's both friends are not telling the story; he is. so we know that no matter what, henry won't be dead at the ending. he'll survive because he can't be telling the story from heaven; not when he stops and talks directly to the audience in some shots. in ""paid in full"", ace is a good man, and we want the best for him, because we know the persons around him and how they can influence him. he narrates the story; he's our hero. ""goodfellas"" is another type of enchantment: where no hero exists; where we are just contemplating the story and not taking any sides. is henry the hero because he tells the story? no; neither jimmy or tommy. this is achieved by a wonderful script; trapping and palpable. as in ""paid in full"", we get to know everyone: women (lovers or wives), who are always there for men. this is dealt with complexity, because some men have only lovers, but another are married and also need a company. the important wife role was in lorraine bracco's hands. karen was in love of a violent and dangerous guy that was exciting because of what she turned into when being with him; and the future she predicted by his side. this is all correctly managed in bracco's astonishing performance. we get to know the boss; that type of man knew in movies like ""the godfather"". the man who doesn't talk to anyone personally, is calmed, and available when needed in extreme situations. he's paul cicero, played by paul sorvino, in a performance that compares silence with noise...in the business environment, people come and go, with short dialogues; and you understand who does what...it's all too big to be described. ray liotta carries with the weight of the movie somehow, in one of his ever best performances, adding original changes because of all the different transformations his character suffers. joe pesci, with one oscar he'll always thank to scorsese, steals the show with the movie's best lines and scenes in his hands. de niro was already a pro at that time, butit is something amazing to see him in any performance. he graces the screen with his way of talking, making each moment memorable; and that's one thing not many actors can't achieve. i didn't use to admire him as an actor; but i'm starting to realize, and scorsese has a lot to do with that. with that and with everything, marty is hidden behind every little detail in this film. again, he puts his own visions into the screen, so you can see he's there. sometimes his camera knows more than the storyteller; sometimes it knows nothing, and it really doesn't need toit can be living the moment, or planning that violence scorsese is always willing to release, just to mix it with the characters' deepest feelings. scorsese, like jimmy, henry, tommy or any other says; is a ""good fella"". ""he's with us, he's ok, you can hang out with him; he's a good fellayou know?"". and his ""goodfellas"" is another underrated cinematographic brilliance; as one of those all-time movie classics.";2 June 2005;10;['delicate', 'bad', 'good', 'least', 'good', 'most', 'good', 'many', 'scorsese', 'most', 'few', 'clear', 'true', 'main', 'unusual', 'first', 'first', 'afraid', 'pure', 'classic', 'favorite', 'main', 'unique', 'full', 'main', 'brief', 'united', 'dead', 'full', 'good', 'good', 'wonderful', 'palpable', 'full', 'married', 'important', 'violent', 'dangerous', 'exciting', 'astonishing', 'available', 'extreme', 'short', 'big', 'good', 'original', 'different', 'good', 'amazing', 'memorable', 'many', 'little', 'own', 'more', 'willing', 'deep', 'scorsese', 'other', 'good', 'ok', 'good', 'underrated'];0.2464388341543513
154;ethanbresnett;there's something really quite visceral about goodfellas. yes, one can dive into the more practical and technical reasons as to why its a great film (which i'll attempt to do), but ultimately its one of those films you finish watching and can't help but sit back and think wow. i'm yet to see every scorsese film, but this is top of the one's i've seen (including taxi driver, the irishman and wolf of wall street) - everything he does is just masterful. from the opening narration you just know you're in for a fantastic time with this film. one thing that really stands out are the characters. as mentioned above nobody does gangster films like scorsese, and goodfellas immerses us in the world of organised crime so craftily, fully and intelligently that it feels like there is a treat, nuance and reward in every single scene. what i really enjoy about scorsese's direction is his approach to violence. it's never gratuitous, and is often used sparingly, which really makes it stand out and gives it greater weight. it goes back to something karen says in the film whereby the life of organised crime becomes normal to her after time (or words to that effect). i think as a viewer we experience something similar, in that we perceive the characters as 'good guys' in the sense that they are our protagonists, but the violence serves to snap us out of that and is used to great effect. the characters in goodfellas really push forward the story, and there is so much to digest and pick through in their actions that you will be constantly engaged. what scorsese really does well is the relationships between the characters, with some standouts being liotta's henry and his wife karen, as well as the triumvirate of henry, de niro's jimmy and pesci's tommy. all three were fantastic, and pesci's oscar win is thoroughly deserved. scorsese's humour was on point as always, subtle and strewn across character, script and direction. i must also applaud the score for goodfellas - perhaps the best for a scorsese film? it just sets the tone so well for the film and added to the total immersion. to sum up - watch goodfellas if you know what's good for you!;7 April 2020;10;['visceral', 'practical', 'technical', 'great', 'scorsese', 'masterful', 'fantastic', 'scorsese', 'single', 'gratuitous', 'great', 'organised', 'normal', 'similar', 'good', 'great', 'much', 'fantastic', 'oscar', 'subtle', 'good', 'scorsese', 'total', 'good'];0.346577380952381

(i had to break a my vow never to give a 10 to do this. after all how many things are perfect? but it is a step better than my 9 movies, so what can i do?) it is ironic that liotta - the central figure (henry hill) - in this drama is the least impressive and a class below both pesci (he will never get a role as good as this) and de niro (under acting here for once). whether this is deliberate (so as to make it look less sexy?) i don't know. the liotta movies that have followed have done nothing to to change my mind - although the role suits him right down to the ground so he is not doing any damage. (can the guy play people of authority? teachers, lawyers, government officials? in other words, people without a screw loose?) de niro doesn't have to do much in gangster roles. he is introduced - in voice over - as 28 and despite the fact that he is clearly in his 40's we don't care. his jimmy ""the gent"" conway is a slimeball crime figure, not that bright, but brighter than those around. what do they say: in the world of the blind the one-eyed man is king? conway has worked out that it is easier to kill people than pay them the money he owes. he cannot knock the writer (nicholas pileggi) for this because it happens to be true. i could live without this fact being set to pop music though. pesci won an oscar for his tommy devito. this is the most amazing performance in the history of cinema: deadly and funny at the same time. a complete acting master class and we are going to be seeing versions of this in movies forever. this role is to him what the zorba the greek was to anthony quinn: to good to be played only once! the hyprocracy, stupidity, the viciousness, the black humour are all well done. who else but director scorsese would dare start with a scene that involves such callous violence? people that don't like this scene should stick to disney movies, this is violence that is real and is based on a real incident. if some viewers prefer plastic violence, so what? this might be the best piece of work that martin scorsese ever brings to the screen. some comedians call it ""martin scorsese's greatest hits"". i call it martin scorsese's most perfectly realised picture. oh there is one thing i don't like about it - the trailer is terrible and sells the picture as being pro violence.";12 October 2002;10;['present', 'classic', 'few', 'much', 'great', 'many', 'perfect', 'well', 'ironic', 'central', 'impressive', 'good', 'deliberate', 'sexy', 'other', 'much', 'jimmy', 'slimeball', 'bright', 'bright', 'blind', 'eyed', 'easy', 'true', 'amazing', 'deadly', 'funny', 'same', 'complete', 'black', 'such', 'callous', 'real', 'real', 'plastic', 'good', 'great', 'terrible', 'pro'];0.2860119047619047
156;bryank-04844;"by the time 1990 came around, martin scorsese had already made several masterpieces in film, which continue to be praised and talked about to this day. with the likes of 'raging bull', 'taxi driver', and 'the last waltz', we all knew that scorsese was one of the finest filmmakers and storytellers around. even with just those three previous films mentioned, you'd know you were in for a treat when scorsese wanted to show you something. then 1990 came around and scorsese once again changed the film community with a movie called 'goodfellas', which was his big foray into the whole mafia genre. like myself, i think that most everyone around would say that 'goodfellas' is one of the best mafia movie that has ever been put on film. besides 'the godfather i and ii', i'm willing to bet that 'goodfellas' can stand side by side with those two films, because it is just that good. however, scorsese told this mafia drama in such a different way, that it got most filmmakers to start telling their stories on film the same way that scorsese did with 'goodfellas'. it's one of those movies that while it may be over 3 hours long, it is completely re-watchable at any time or day, because the characters, dialogue, and story are so compelling and told in such a fantastic and realistic fashion, that you can't help but watch the whole thing all over again, and become entranced by what's transpiring on screen. in 1986, a writer by the name of nicholas pileggi wrote a non-fiction book about a real life mafia guy named henry hill. this book called 'wiseguy' detailed the life of henry hill from his childhood through his adulthood, as he joined the lucchese crime family at an early age. the book talked about all the acts of violence and criminal activity that went on, including the largest heist in american history at the time, which was the lufthansa heist. luckily, scorsese got a hold of the book and decided to make a film with a young ray liotta playing henry hill, who narrated what went on throughout the film. scorsese also got two 'raging bull' actors robert de niro and joe pesci to star in this film, which earned pesci a numerous amount of awards. scorsese did something that original with this mafia genre, which was tell this story from a sentimental side from the eyes of these bad guys. yes, we know that these iconic character are violent criminals who murder, steal, and exploit, but we also got to see the family and vulnerable side to them as well, which is one of the reasons 'goodfellas' is such an achievement in filmmaking. we virtually get to meet almost everyone in the lucchese crime family and not only see them commit these heinous acts of crime, but we get to see them being friends with one another, taking care of their families, and sticking up for each other. as many as there are kills and blood in 'goodfellas', there is as much laughs and jokes, which makes this realistic. the real life henry hill really laid everything out on the table for scorsese and pileggi to get acquire the total realness of the story and picture. each character is based on someone in real life, which is kind of difficult to imagine. even some of the more iconic dialogue scenes were taken from real instances, such as the ""am i funny to you"" scene with liotta and pesci. it's a funny scene, but damn is it scary for a moment when you have no idea what pesci's character tommy is capable of. that's why this film is so amazing. you get sucked in to feeling for these guys and want to be their friends, because they are all charming and fun, but we are quickly given a wake up call to see just how rotten these ""goodfellas"" are. still, after 25 years, 'goodfellas' continues to be one of the best films ever made and paved the way for scorsese into the mafia genre, as well as this brilliant style of filmmaking. we saw it in 'casino', 'the departed', and the recent 'wolf of wall street' film, and never disappoints. but 'goodfellas' is where it all started and continues to be the foundation for most modern mafia films. i'll never get tired of seeing this movie.";6 May 2015;10;['several', 'last', 'fine', 'previous', 'scorsese', 'big', 'whole', 'most', 'good', 'willing', 'good', 'different', 'most', 'same', 're', 'watchable', 'compelling', 'fantastic', 'realistic', 'whole', 'non', 'fiction', 'real', 'lucchese', 'early', 'criminal', 'large', 'american', 'young', 'numerous', 'original', 'sentimental', 'bad', 'iconic', 'violent', 'vulnerable', 'lucchese', 'heinous', 'other', 'many', 'much', 'realistic', 'real', 'total', 'real', 'difficult', 'iconic', 'real', 'such', 'funny', 'funny', 'scary', 'capable', 'amazing', 'charming', 'fun', 'good', 'brilliant', 'recent', 'most', 'modern', 'tired'];0.1399523809523809

158;EijnarAmadeus;"spoilers((( martin scorsese created this brilliant masterwork in 1990 and made a new important chapter in gangster movie history. starring the top-notch actors robert de niro, ray liotta and joe pesci this movie is based on the true story of henry hill and his gangster career that stands as one of history's most magnificent mob stories. henry hill is a local boy who's been working for the mob since early days, now being an adult he still serves for them. his since-school-days (although they never went to school) friend tommy devito is a pre italian maniac. and there's jimmy conway, the man who puts these two fellas up together, and is doing some of the worst crimes new york city has ever seen. but soon henry is put in jail and everything that has always been so bright and okay, suddenly goes upside-down and things starts looking bad for the guy, who's always wanted to be a gangster... goodfellas isn't just one of the definitive movies ever made, it makes its march brutally right on the spot, leaving everything that's been earlier made of mafia movies too old to stand up to it when it was released. it's challenger's are few; but there are two (maybe three if you set up the sequel) heavyweighters doing their thing too; the godfather and once upon a time in america (last one also starring de niro). martin scorsese had already showed the world that he was one of the most impressing director's to be in hollywood at the time, and this settled his march once and for all as one of cinema history's biggest. soon after this gangster installment scorsese made another mob-movie with de niro and pesci, named casino, also a great achievement, but it can't stand against this. goodfellas doesn't just have the perfect timing of drama, suspense, violence and pure italian anger, the soundtrack playing fabulously along with great tracks as ""gimme shelter"", ""stardust"", ""bells of st.marys"" and ""memo from turner"". the actors are all amazing, and if i had to pick a favourite among the trio i had to say liotta, although he didn't achieve an oscar for his performance (pesci did) his character simply fixes everything, going threw pissed-wife-happenings, drug-related-cases, killings and emotionally disturbance. the violence of the movie just let us see the real brutality inside mob business, pesci striking a knife, de niro kicking face, liotta punching guy's face apart with a gun, pesci sticking a knife into a guy's backhead...i mean, it's a pretty messed up brutal movie, and that simply sets the mood right. you know this is brutal business, it's illegal with capitol i, people get killed and business that's so freaking wrong for the law are done - and it's pure mafia. seeing ray liotta stepping out of the car after he gets to know that the friendly-neighbourhood-(spider is the bartender)man has been touching and offending his wife, is a sight simply making the hair rise. it reminds a bit off caan in the godfather when he heads to kick his sister's husband's ass, well, i gotta say; liotta isn't just three steps more violent, he is also three steps more calm and cool. goodfellas is an amazing movie, and it really gives coppola's 1972 mafia movie a real breather in the neck. stars: 5/5";30 July 2004;10;['brilliant', 'new', 'important', 'top', 'true', 'magnificent', 'local', 'early', 'pre', 'italian', 'bad', 'bright', 'bad', 'definitive', 'old', 'few', 'last', 'big', 'great', 'perfect', 'pure', 'italian', 'great', 'amazing', 'real', 'messed', 'brutal', 'right', 'brutal', 'illegal', 'pure', 'friendly', 'violent', 'calm', 'cool', 'amazing', 'real'];0.1610485103132162
159;deatman9;alright this is going to be a long review because i have so much to say about this film. first off this one of the or the best mafia film ever made. it stars a bang up cast of world class actors, ray liotta, joe pesci, robert deniro, paul sorvino and the list goes on and on. it was written and dircted by martin scorscese who is considered by many to be the best film maker of all time. this movie follows the true story of henry hill (liotta) a young man who started working for the mob when he was just a teenager. the movie gives a very detailed view of his life and all the trouble he faced through out it. this is easily ray liottas finest hour and this movie is the reason he even got into hollywood. also it has a bang up performances from robert deniro and joe pesci. mob movies would not be the same without those two in them. this movie all comes together perfectly made possible by the fantastic writing of scorsese and the immaculate acting of all those involved. i highly recommend this to everyone hands down the best mafia film ever made;28 June 2011;10;['long', 'much', 'good', 'many', 'good', 'true', 'young', 'detailed', 'fine', 'same', 'possible', 'fantastic', 'good'];0.3513888888888888
160;jdkraus;"i finally saw this movie and it still has a little bit of a spell on me. i can't really compare ""goodfellas"" to ""the godfather"" because they're two totally different films. goodfellas is shown and told through henry hill (ray liotta) whose only dream was to be a wise guy. the movie follows his journey from starting out as a youth who ran errands to the mob, to being one of the mob's closest members, and his eventual downfall. to cover many of the details in the film, there's much voice-over narration. in many movies, i find that a lot of narration is irritating and at times makes me loose interest in a film since i like to be shown what the film is about, not told. but the narration is a definite exception to this movie because it not only reveals the film as a past event, but also gets into the thoughts and feelings of the main character henry. his girlfriend karen (lorraine bracco), who later becomes his wife, also has her share of voice-over. an essential part to the film is both of their narration since it not only reveals their thoughts in a given scene, but it also develops a strong bond between the two, which later spirals. scorsese's direction (who i think can relate a lot to the film, as person who grew up in new york city) is a key driving force in the film. there are many excellent shots in it that i could probably write a book on them. the one that stands out the most for me is in a scene where henry takes karen on a date. the camera follows them from the car, past a line of people at the entrance, down a flight of stairs, through a kitchen, and into the restaurant where a few waiters set up a table for them to be in the front of the floor show. this is the power of the mob, but everything that has a beginning has an end. i won't give the end of the film away, but the main man ray goes from a real somebody to a nobody, which plays in the irony of the film. he gets it all, but then loses it. another main ingredient in this film is thelma schoonmaker's editing. i have come to call her the greatest film editor of all time, and her work of freeze framing scenes, as well as clean cuts in between scenes are priceless. when it comes to the acting, all are great, but joe pesci is the real master. i recognize him mostly for being in the lethal weapons and home alones, but his skills are put to the test in this film as the likable, yet psychotic tommy. his oscar was well-deserved (the academy got it right for once). ""goodfellas"" though is not a movie for everyone. there's a lot of language (mostly said by pesci) and some strong bloody violence that may shock and disturb viewers. other than that, ""goodfellas"" is definitely one of the greatest gangsters films ever made as well as one of scorsese's best!";22 November 2008;10;['little', 'different', 'only', 'wise', 'close', 'eventual', 'many', 'much', 'many', 'loose', 'definite', 'main', 'essential', 'strong', 'key', 'many', 'excellent', 'most', 'few', 'main', 'real', 'main', 'thelma', 'great', 'clean', 'priceless', 'great', 'real', 'lethal', 'likable', 'psychotic', 'right', 'strong', 'bloody', 'other', 'great', 'good'];0.2810631572728346
161;anselmdaniel;this review contains spoilers. goodfellas premiered in 1990. the movie is directed by martin scorcese and stars ray liotta robert de niro, and joe pesci. the movie follows three men in the criminal underworld that they want to ascend. the movie follows these three characters as they traverse the criminal world across the 145 minutes of running time. goodfellas is a masterpiece movie by martin scorcese. the movie is incredibly well directed. martin scorcese should deserve a lot of accolades for directing this movie so well. every scene in this movie has a nice rewatchability to it. these scenes take on a new meaning on multiple watches. this is also helped by the highly energetic style of the directing. the entire movie moves at a fast pace and there is never a dull moment. even the scenes that are more on the quiet side are directed in an interesting way to bring out the best in the actors. the three main leads in ray liotta, robert de niro and joe pesci do a phenomenal job in this movie. ray liotta plays henry hill as he climbs the ladder of the mafia. it is fun to watch henry as he lives a criminal life and interacts with characters played by the other two leads. every scene that has any of these leads is well-acted and directed. joe pesci plays a hot-headed mobster in tommy devito. this character is incredibly memorable. joe pesci absolutely puts in a performance of a lifetime into the character of tommy devito. the story in this movie is rather simple to follow and has many fun twists. the entire movie is narrated by henry hill and incredibly well edited as said before, this is a movie that does not have a dull moment. much of this is owed to the editing, directing, and acting. the story has no problems showing loads of gore and unpleasant scenes to the audience. this is expected from looking into a mobster's life. the movie does not only focus on crime. it also focuses on the home life between henry and karen. this drama that arises from the life of crime is engrossing to watch. i highly recommend goodfellas. grade: a;24 November 2018;9;['criminal', 'criminal', 'nice', 'new', 'multiple', 'energetic', 'entire', 'fast', 'dull', 'quiet', 'interesting', 'good', 'main', 'phenomenal', 'criminal', 'other', 'memorable', 'simple', 'many', 'entire', 'dull', 'much', 'unpleasant'];0.0793044077134986

173;PeterMitchell-506-564364;goodfellas is one of the best mafia films you'll ever been blessed to see in your lifetime, right down to the letter in terms of acting, directing, but especially scripting. i have this fantastic script in book form, where the film honors the script one hundred percent. goodfellas is quite a scary movie in terms of it's character's attributes, the main one being pesci's, his tommy, played with such a haunting ferocity. this is the most scary performance i've seen in a mafia film. he makes the character he played in casino, nicky santori, look tame, although the the two bare some resemblances, especially in the violence and recklessness department. the story is told through the eyes of mafia figure, henry hill, played superbly by ray liotta, his most notable performance, when the mentioning of this actor's name comes up. hill who died a while back, had described the mafia as a dark and terrifying world as seen through this brilliant film. it's through his eyes we meet these characters, like jimmy the gent, conway, de niro excelling himself again, and also paul sorvino as paulie cicero, a sicilian godfather less threatening cause of his laid back manner, but looks can be deceiving. we move through henry's wannabe mafia type, from childhood, that had him skipping school, subjecting him to a whacking from his father here and there, right through to his two incarcerations, where after getting out of the second one, thanks to his mother in law who puts up bail, he is soon making a deal of immunity. reasons. one, his wife (bracco) who goes to see deniro is pointed towards this alley where all these coats are hanging. should she go in there? no, why? cause she'll probably get whacked. she options to quickly take off instead. to me, this was the most terrifying moment in this near two and a half hour film. two, the other reason, deniro asks liotta to whack a guy down in miami, and knows that if he accepts this, he won't came back alive. death is shown so cheaply here, where if you don't do the right thing, the probability of living is null. one of the hoods, stax, played by samuel l jackson in one of it's memorable bloody scenes, is one such an example, where a montage of other victims follow. goodfellas has some real bloody moments, one involving a connected guy who's celebrating, getting out, on henry's hill's actual birthday, where his mouth earns him a helluva of a bashing, followed by a freshly dug grave. when it comes to violence, this movie is uncompromising, but these thugs existed. again at goodfellas's end, as to hill's living arrangements, once more we see that crime just doesn't pay, but it pays bloody well to seen this 1990 classic.;13 January 2013;9;['good', 'fantastic', 'scary', 'main', 'scary', 'nicky', 'tame', 'bare', 'recklessness', 'notable', 'dark', 'terrifying', 'brilliant', 'sicilian', 'threatening', 'wannabe', 'second', 'terrifying', 'half', 'other', 'alive', 'right', 'null', 'memorable', 'bloody', 'other', 'real', 'bloody', 'connected', 'actual', 'more', 'bloody'];-0.0950396825396825
174;WriterDave;"if you hate mob movies, or hate scorsese, then you probably won't be able to sit through this. but for the rest of us out there, this is arguably one of the best films of the 1990's, possibly one of the best of all time, and without a doubt one of the most influential films of the past twenty years. every mob movie/underworld saga/generational tale/crime thriller from ""pulp fiction"" to ""boogie nights"" to ""blow"" (which played like the tv movie version of a great scorsese flick) to tv's ""the sopranos"" owes a debt to this film. scorsese was at the top of his game here, and what makes this film stand tall above all other movies of this ilk (including scorsese's own ""casino""--a great film in its own right) is that there is an overwhelming visceral charge to the film that makes it all seem so enjoyable despite the onslaught of blood, foul language, and unsavory activities. you are made to believe that these gangsters were having the time of their lives. so too were scorsese and pals in making the film. and lastly, so too are we the audience in watching it all. everything came together in this film so perfectly the viewer is left feeling oddly giddy amongst all the true life bloodshed. this sense of ""fun"" is the one thing that his recent ""gangs of new york"" was missing, and may be what keeps that film from being ranked as one of the all time greats. as for the acting, pesci is all at once hilarious and scary. de niro is at his best. and liotta gives a career defining performance (only in the recent ""narc"" has he been able to recapture some of this magic). as for some of the finer details, i dare you to find a movie that makes better use of popular music or steady-cam shots. the cinematography, editing, set designs and costumes (that traverse the varied stylings of the 1950's , 60's, 70's and early 80's) are all pitch perfect. is there a better scene than when liotta takes lorraine braco to the copacabana for the first time and introduces her to the perks of gangster life while ""and then he kissed me"" plays on the soundtrack? will you ever be able to listen to ""layla"" without thinking about mob hits and a frozen body in a meat truck? all these things, a communion with the audience (here we share scorsese's joy both in making a film and in our watching it), top-notch production values, great performances, and a lasting influence on later films are the earmarks of a great movie, the pinnacle of a great director's career, and one of the greatest films of all time. ""goodfellas"" may never reach the mythical status ""the godfather"" saga did, but as great films like this are becoming few and far in between, it makes you believe in the myth of the ""greatest film of all time."" maybe it is, most likely it isn't, but we the audience for a brief moment, maybe for just one scene, are pretty much convinced this is it.";13 July 2003;10;['able', 'good', 'good', 'influential', 'past', 'generational', 'great', 'scorsese', 'tall', 'other', 'own', 'great', 'own', 'overwhelming', 'visceral', 'enjoyable', 'foul', 'unsavory', 'scorsese', 'giddy', 'true', 'recent', 'hilarious', 'scary', 'good', 'recent', 'able', 'fine', 'well', 'popular', 'steady', 'varied', 'early', 'perfect', 'well', 'lorraine', 'first', 'able', 'frozen', 'top', 'great', 'later', 'great', 'great', 'great', 'mythical', 'great', 'few', 'great', 'likely', 'brief'];0.4168981481481483

178;oOoBarracuda;"""as far back as i can remember i always wanted to be a gangster."" every single time we had to do the pointless and awkward introduction in my undergrad classes, henry hill's opening monologue was always my response. this achieved a couple goals for me, i avoided having to actually articulate the fact that i wanted to run for office, and i also got to see if there were any hidden cinephiles scattered around me. it never really worked; occasionally i would find another fan of the film, but never someone with a broad film taste who didn't suggest we watch scarface as a double feature with goodfellas. martin scorsese, one of the kings of new york settled on adapting the novel by nicholas pileggi following the life of henry hill as he rose to prominence in the brooklyn mafia. starring robert de niro, ray liotta, and joe pesci, goodfellas is the work of a true auteur in top form and has remained a mafia classic 27 years after its release. growing up in a modest home with blue collar parents, henry hill saw a way to make everything he had ever wanted his. henry saw how the ""wiseguys' in his neighborhood lived, and wanted to be like them and have the freedom to go anywhere they wanted while wearing the best clothes and constantly having hundred dollar bills to flash. henry started small as a child then a teenager, along with his friend tommy devito (joe pesci) advancing in the mafia with each passing year. learning the ins and outs, the rules and orders, the intricate details of the mafia--like only one could see from the inside, henry had no problem paying his dues and earning his place. when henry is really initiated and deemed worthy of meeting the higher ranks, he is introduced to jimmy conway (robert de niro). conway, hill, and devito become something of a dream team executing some of the biggest robberies and hijackings the country had ever seen. henry's life comes crashing down when he's ""pinched"" and must take the fall for a crime. while in jail, hill enters the drug trade making more money at less of a split than he ever had before. after his jail sentence is complete, mob boss paul cicero (paul sorvino) assures henry that he will be fine in the mafia once again. he understood that henry had to deal in drugs to keep himself and his family afloat while in prison, but he has to give that up as paulie isn't involved in the drug trade. living better than he ever had before, however, meant that hill had no intentions of leaving the drug trade behind. staying involved in drugs and becoming an addict himself got hill into a world of trouble and the only way he can get out is by bringing about the downfall of the two people closest to him, the two he had spent nearly his whole life with, jimmy and tommy. in an expert maneuver, martin scorsese begins in the middle of the story, then traces to the beginning through the end. the story structure of goodfellas is one to marvel at, and certainly one that wouldn't have been so flawlessly executed without director martin scorsese. goodfellas is so engaging that i can't tell you how many times i've seen it, and yet, if i walk into a room in which it is playing i will watch until the end. from the perfect execution of the introductory scenes, which are often a rather boring part in other films, to the brilliant in-depth character development, goodfellas is a film to study for its narrative. an astute viewer is given such a complete glimpse into the men's lives that one can see where the character's failings exist that will eventually bring them down. some of the best tracking shots in cinema history are contained within goodfellas. the one fans of the film love to discuss are the scene in which henry and his eventual wife are shown across the street as their car is getting parked and followed by the camera all the way in through the kitchen then through the front of the restaurant. it's a beautiful shot lasting two full minutes, and that's just one example of directorial prowess concerning tracking shots. my personal favorite occurs during the scene in which the audience is introduced to the mafia members. the camera slides down the length of the bar as we learn the names of those in the brooklyn mafia as well as certain character traits they possess. one of my favorite parts of the film is the way its narration changes seamlessly between henry and karen hill. we go from hearing henry's voice then his wife's, then back to henry's voice again all the while changing the point of view but the audience never misses a step and the narrative is never sloppy. put simply, goodfellas is a master class in filmmaking from a director who is no stranger to making classic films. goodfellas on its own would be enough for any director to hang their hat on, but the fact that the same director was also behind raging bull and taxi driver speaks to the greatness of martin scorsese. i'll never get over what happened to tommy, though.";19 June 2017;10;['single', 'pointless', 'awkward', 'broad', 'double', 'true', 'top', 'classic', 'modest', 'blue', 'good', 'small', 'intricate', 'worthy', 'high', 'big', 'more', 'less', 'complete', 'fine', 'only', 'close', 'whole', 'engaging', 'many', 'perfect', 'introductory', 'boring', 'other', 'brilliant', 'astute', 'complete', 'good', 'eventual', 'beautiful', 'full', 'directorial', 'personal', 'certain', 'favorite', 'sloppy', 'classic', 'own', 'enough', 'same'];0.1885089285714285

180;thejcowboy22;what a feeling of fulfillment when you beat the system. the thrill of getting away with something with the presence of malice. back in the 1970's i met a friend in junior college who was a huge hockey fan. he lived in east meadow, new york adjacent to the nassau coliseum which was the home arena for the new york islanders ice hockey team. my friend wasn't made of money yet he attended all the home games. he invited me to one and i witnessed his underhanded operation of sneaking in to games. it didn't stop there. not only did my friend sneak me inside,, he would go right back out and bring other people inside for a small fee. the patrons were not promised a seat but at least they had entrance and could watch by sitting in the aisle and hallways throughout the hockey match. the ticket takers were in on the scam as well. these employees of the coliseum were basically moonlighting for a second income. our personal ticket taker was a math teacher, we called him mugsy. my friend was in his eighth grade math class. that's how the money making operation started. between the second intermission we would meet at gate #9 and dive up the loot we collected and the scheme was born. we were thinking small so we expanded to all events rock concerts and basketball etc. we had it all and enjoyed the profits. goodfellas is about a journey through the eyes of an impressionable young henry hill (chris serrone). we follow his journey into the underworld from his deficient living conditions in a poor brooklyn neighborhood watching his father struggle financially, taking the subway to work. from his bedroom window henry discovered a new and exciting world watching the mobsters at the taxi stand across the street. he saw these fellows in business suits who parked their cars anywhere they wanted . played card all hours of the night and controlled the neighborhood more efficiently than the cops with numbers and betting sheets. henry was introduced to paulie cicero (paul sorvino) the head of the crew. paulie had his hand in everything from high jacking trucks and stealing precious cargo at idlewild airport. henry would accompany his rotund brother tuddy (frank dileo) who also ran the neighborhood pizzeria. henry worked himself upward in this world of gangsters. henry was so involved that he quit going to school. one day henry's father received a letter from the school that henry hasn't attended in months. a ballistic mr. hill beat up his son giving him a black eye. henry intern went to toody and said he has to quit. toody and some fellows waited in front of the local post office for henry's mailman to return from his route. henry picked out the postman and they grabbed him and throw him in the back of their car drove over to the pizzeria and put his head in the oven. no more letters from school, no more letters to the house. it got so bad that henry's mother had to go down to post office and ask for her bills. to earn his keep and acclaim to the mob henry would vandalize cars, sell bootleg cartons of cigarettes and accompany tuddy on using outside telephones. bar tending for paulie in which he meets an out of control jimmy conway (robert dinero). jimmy takes a shine to the young delinquent. henry watched how jimmy carried himself by hijacking trucks and downright stealing. jimmy teams henry up with another helper tommy devito. henry wins over the trust and honor of the mob by a recent bust by the fbi as they grab henry for selling illegal cigarettes. henry is acquitted of all charges from being a first time offender. henry thought he failed them by getting caught but jimmy tells a teary eyed boy the facts about loyalty. he didn't rat on his friends by not saying anything and telling them nothing as he slips a bill in his shirt pocket to the ovation and delight of the gaudy clad mobsters. henry grows into adulthood played now by ray liotta,working mostly with tommy played now by joe pesce working the airport and planning a huge heist. it was a glorious time with wiseguys and mobsters everywhere . one of my favorite scenes in this movie is the regular frequented mob restaurant as henry narrates all the wiseguys in the joint. from nicky eyes,pete the killer, freddy no nose, anthony stabile and who could forget jimmy two times. this movie continues through the corrupt life and slow down word spiral of organized crime through the eyes of henry hill. from his first big score to his marriage to karen (lorraine bracco), his carousing and brief stint in the joint. finally dealing in cocaine with his pittsburgh connection. honorable mention to actor chuck low as the wig salesman/bookie morris kessler who i found very amusing throughout his scenes. joe pesce also with a violent performance along with robert dinero makes this an addiction in watching the wiseguys do their stuff. the film is enticing to any impressionable kid who wants life in the dangerous lane. the editing and period music adds to the charm of the life of the goodfellas who had it all for the taking, so they thought! meanwhile we used the coliseum for profit at least 10 more years before we were caught sneaking people inside. our operation was finally shut down and an expensive court case followed as we were fined with malicious mischief plus lifetime banishment from the nassau coliseum.;2 March

181;policy134;"the themes of this extraordinary film are in fact quite ordinary when you think about it. the wish that henry hill has to be respected and to have all of his desires fulfilled are wishes that we all can relate to. the fact that he has to lie, cheat and steal and in some cases kill to get it, will probably not relate to many but in henry's world it is just as ordinary as brushing your teeth. martin scorsese paints a portrait of a man who wants it all but is somehow unwilling to pay the price. the character henry hill, based on a real person, is weak in spirit. he doesn't seem to be ruthless enough to be a gangster and it will eventually spell his doom. ray liotta gives an excellent performance that really shows range. he has played bad guys before but also basically decent men like his role in ""dominick and eugene"" and ""corrina, corrina"". here he covers both sides. he is immensely nasty to everybody who tries to steal from him but is also quite sympathetic when it comes to looking out for his family. his wife, played by lorraine bracco, is not really a criminal but she is turned on by crime and the fact that henry kills for a living is not something that bothers her in the beginning. there are several good supporting performances in this movie but to name just the really important: 1) robert de niro as jimmy conway (even though he has top billing). this is not one of his best roles but he is an important figure in the last part of the movie and the way he reacts to the death of somebody really close to him is quite frightening but then again that's no big surprise. 2) joe pesci as tommy devito. what can you say except: bravo! nobody could have played this totally evil character better. and finally paul sorvino as paul. his may not be the most flamboyant role but he does have some eccentricacies that are quite amusing and unlike marlon brando in the godfather, he has a more relaxed performing style and he is therefore more credible as a real person. the superb editing of thelma schoonmaker must also be credited for making this film such an exhilarating experience. three hours seem like a half in this film and it's nice that she just won her second oscar for the aviator. the truth is that even though scorsese has made bad movies his track record is the absolute best for any filmmaker. so let's hope that he does something outstanding very soon as he has been in kind of a slump lately.";26 March 2005;10;['extraordinary', 'ordinary', 'many', 'ordinary', 'unwilling', 'real', 'weak', 'ruthless', 'excellent', 'bad', 'decent', 'nasty', 'sympathetic', 'several', 'good', 'important', 'top', 'good', 'important', 'last', 'close', 'frightening', 'big', 'evil', 'flamboyant', 'amusing', 'relaxed', 'credible', 'real', 'thelma', 'exhilarating', 'nice', 'second', 'bad', 'absolute', 'good', 'outstanding'];0.1012096774193548
182;braddugg;the greatest gangster film that i have seen, it does something that even the godfather, did not do. here is a film on organized crime that is having a voice over of it's protagonist for good amount of time and it makes the film all the more interesting. i love many shots in the film, like the conversation shots between paulie and henry, or the way jokes of joe pesci are captured or even the murders. damn, this is all very realistic and it's admirable to have achieved it this way. indeed at times it plays like a documentary unlike a fiction film. also, the film is told in first person not only by henry but also by his wife karen. damn, it makes the film reliable and real. the performances are superb, each detail, each nuance is done well, nothing seems out of place, a jaw dropping murder of rib tickling joke, all seem so natural in emotions here. joe pesci gets out some wonderful lines. robert deniro is extremely cold blooded as jimmy. paul sorvino as paulie is authoritative. loranne bracco as karen is loving. ray liotta as henry is infectious and fragile. there is a host of other characters that are wonderful too. we must understand that these characters actually existed in reality and from their interviews was the book, wise gy written by nicolas pilleggi. goodfellas was based on this book only. scorsese is indeed the most interesting director of our times, who takes varied themes and puts it all in the pan and cooks it so well that the dish surely tastes delicious. to showcase power, he takes an interesting point where henry takes his karen into a restaurant by surpassing the crowd, going through the back door and a table is literally lifted and placed for them. to showcase guilt, scorsese uses conversation between jimmy and henry. to showcase crime, he shows us just a few gunshots and how emotionless the killer is. damn, all this makes it such interesting and a fun film. the camera movement is adept and so is the cinematographer. but to dive the camera and the cameraman, the director is needed. scorsese precisely is such director. this is not actually a gangster film, i will rather call it as a film that is made on organised crime in a throughly interesting way and with eccentric and interesting characters. of course, the cast does get all the chords right and takes the characters into a new level. it is indeed long with a length of 140 minutes, but it's an easy film for a movie buff. but for the non-aficionados the characters names and the length may take a toll. but i will say, most film-goers have considered this a good film as per ratings all over, thus even the claim that it is lengthy can be cut off. i am giving 5/5 for this wonderful film, that is self indulgent at times, but the best part is that it indulges you as viewer. kudos to the master scorsese for this.;7 September 2014;10;['great', 'good', 'interesting', 'many', 'realistic', 'admirable', 'first', 'reliable', 'real', 'superb', 'natural', 'wonderful', 'cold', 'authoritative', 'infectious', 'fragile', 'other', 'wonderful', 'wise', 'interesting', 'varied', 'delicious', 'interesting', 'back', 'few', 'such', 'interesting', 'fun', 'adept', 'such', 'interesting', 'eccentric', 'interesting', 'new', 'long', 'easy', 'non', 'most', 'good', 'lengthy', 'wonderful', 'indulgent', 'good', 'view'];0.3974675324675324

184;MichaelMargetis;# 1 film of 1990 there are numerous amounts of fantastic movies out there, but the special ones are few and far between. one of the most special motion pictures ever created was a film that combined brutal and painfully realistic violence, grittiness, a great composition of the music of 60s, 70s and 80s, a compelling storyline, authentic dialogue, incendiary narrative storytelling and a hell of a lot style. it was known as 'goodfellas', veteran filmmaker martin scorsese's extraordinary mob film, that was a landmark in cinema because it superseded 'the godfather', in my opinion. many people agree 'goodfellas' outranks 'godfather' but many disagree also. in a nutshell, 'the godfather' is what started it all, it's a stylish, super-cool oscar-winner with fantastic acting but 'goodfellas' paints a more updated portrait of life in organized crime, and unlike 'godfather' shows the severe consequences and results that come with being a 'wise guy'. 'goodfellas' is an amazing movie that will no doubt impress you if you take the time to view it. the film begins with a grown-up hill riding in a car with two other mob associates, the slick, cool and smooth spoken jimmy conway (robert deniro) and the psychopathic and violent mental midget tommy devito (joe pesci - in his academy award- winning role.) it's late at night and both look exhausted and they hear a thumping in the bank of the trunk and wonder what is going on. they pull of to the side of the road, open the trunk to reveal a older gentleman severely beaten up and bloody pleading, 'please, don't. please.' tommy then takes a butcher knife and continues to aggressively stab him while jimmy shoots him several times with a revolver. they close the trunk and the camera pans to hill's face and he narrates, 'as far back as i can remember i always wanted to be a gangster.'. after that moment, viewing the rented dvd from blockbuster, i knew i was in for a powerful, realistic, gritty but astonishing motion picture. the dark and beautifully shot feature 'goodfellas' follows the true story of mob associate henry hill (ray liotta) and his rags-to-riches tale starting as a poor fresh-faced irish-italian kid in slums of brooklyn running numbers for low-level hoods to working along side of major mob players. hill was a boy obsessed with how the mafia worked and like most kids dreamed of being an astronaut, fireman, or president of the united states, he dreamed of being a wise guy. the movie then follows hill's live in the mob until the 80s. i can't really tell you too much without giving the film away, but i can tell you he encounters interesting situations and the movie never ceases to be wild and entertaining. it's definitely the best mafia film ever made. there are many things to praise about scorsese's most talked about motion picture 'goodfellas'. first of all is the acting. all the performers, every one of them, are at the top of their game. ray liotta gives a strong performance as the film's narrator and main character, henry hill, while robert deniro gives an absolutely riveting performance out-shining liotta in almost every scene they share. it's a shame deniro wasn't nominated for an oscar for the wonderful job he did in 'goodfellas'. lorraine bracco impresses as liotta's sassy but ultimately typical italian-mob wife, while joe pesci is extraordinary and ferocious in his scene-stealing role as the blood-hungry and crazy paisan, tommy devito, whom everyone is afraid of. paul sorvino rounds out the leading cast as the tough but quiet mob boss, while the film is packed with small roles played by such actors as vincent pastore, tony darrow, mike starr, chuck leow, tony sirico, henny youngman, frank vincent, frank sivero and samuel l. jackson. martin scorsese provides direction so brilliant you really can't put it into words, that should have won him the 'best director' oscar at the 1991 academy awards ceremony. scorsese and nicholas pilleggi (who wrote the novel which 'goodfellas' is based upon) provide one of the richest and finest screenplays ever created, and thelma schoonmaker provides marvelous editing. there are really no dull parts about this tough and brutal but beautiful and brilliant masterpiece from one of our generations best filmmakers, martin scorsese. if you haven't already and don't mind a little grit (actually a lot of grit) make it a mission to drive to blockbuster and rent this movie on dvd.

186;departed07;"""as far back as i can remember i always wanted to be a gangster."" i remember reading roger ebert's review of ""gangs of new york"" and though his review of the film was biased, he mentions how goodfellas was a classic in point of direction and of characters. as i recall, people have mention that ""the godfather"" is the best crime film ever made, but i disagree; ""the godfather"" was a film that showed the consequences of people in organize crime or in a organization, but not goodfellas. goodfellas shows the exciting sides of people in the mafia, where they would go to bars, dinners, and laugh at america and those who were inferior to them. goodfellas is a story about a young irishman name henry hill (played by ray liotta as the older version) who every night sees the mobsters hanging on the other side of the street where he sees them park their cars in the middle of the streets, play cards and play their music all night without anybody complaining. the leader of the mafia is paul cicero (paul sorvino) who is reclusive towards the neighborhood, sure people have heard of him, but he doesn't like people watching him and yet henry himself lies to his parents when he decides to work for paul and his mafia and is finally notice in the neighborhood, though his father doesn't approve, his dad beats henry a couple of times. but does that stop him? no. years later, henry grows up (ray liotta now) and is enjoying what he is actually doing. he steals and kills like the rest of the gangsters in order to make ends meat instead of working nine-to-five jobs for stupid paychecks. during the film we encounter a group of characters in the film that not only work for henry, but also change the face in cinema history. jimmy ""the gent"" conway (robert de niro) is the rebel that cheers for the bad guys in the movie and has been in jail when he was twelve for stealing. in the film, henry narrates that jimmy ""enjoys"" stealing and throughout the film, de niro does make his presence where if you see his face, show him some respect. another character in the film is tommy devito (joe pesci) whose reputation is more than being in the mafia, but actually has a wild temper when somebody makes him mad. in one scene at a party, tommy is embarrassed by the fact that the owner of the restaurant wants him to pay the tab of $7,000, and yet beats the hell out of the waiter proving that you can't mess with a crew of the mafia, no matter what the rank is. there's another character in the story that is also a narrator, and the character is karen (lorraine bracco), who was pressure to go out with henry on a double date so that way tommy can bang the girl of his dreams. in one scene she is stood up by henry and tells tommy to go after her and after embarrassing henry in front of the mafia on the streets, karen goes out with henry on a single date where she doesn't what he does. later during the film, she finds out that he's in the mob and fears that she will lose him. a lot of things happen during the film; a made man is killed, henry cheats on his wife and goes to jail, a money heist takes place, half of jimmy's mafia gets whacked and a supporting character gets killed. with a great soundtrack and a great storyline, goodfellas proves that cheering for the bad guys is a good thing after all.";20 July 2003;10;['good', 'exciting', 'inferior', 'young', 'old', 'other', 'reclusive', 'sure', 'stupid', 'bad', 'more', 'wild', 'mad', 'double', 'single', 'great', 'great', 'bad', 'good'];0.0928571428571428
187;andrewroy-04316;goodfellas isn't a sprawling gang epic as i for some reason expected, but instead a much more personal and revelatory look at how a young man admires gangsters, becomes one and watches it envelop every part of his life, until he has no option but to reluctantly rat out his partners. the narration and camera work is extremely effective in making the viewer feel like they're going on this journey with henry. it's certainly saying that crime snakes into every part of these men's lives, making them feel greedy and entitled to a lifestyle that they hadn't earned but also would have been unattainable by legal means, and the way it sours friendships, marriages, and personal sanity is obvious. equally relevant, however, is how exciting and flashy it is when it's happening. you feel on top of the world, have all these friends, and can afford a luxurious lifestyle. it's easy to empathize with henry and understand how he reached the point he did, even as we recognize how horribly twisted his priorities had gotten, and that's no small feat by scorsese. liotta is great in showing this transformation, and pesci and de niro were also great as crime lord characters. the ending really drives this duality home: what henry laments in the film's conclusion isn't all the mistakes he made or that he gave up his friends (both would be reasonable), but that he no longer gets that glamorous life and has to live a humdrum daily existence. you'd think this would be a welcome and ideal change after how crime ruined his marriage and came close to killing him, but he misses the thrill of it. it's not hard to compare the narrative arc to one of drug addiction, where he craves the high until it envelops every part of his life. scorsese's direction and script are wonderful, as the repetitive dialogue and the suddenness of violence in many scenes added to the authentic, gritty atmosphere of crime. it's a standout film by all accounts, and absolutely deserves its spot in the film pantheon as an all-time great movie.;29 November 2019;9;['personal', 'revelatory', 'young', 'effective', 'greedy', 'unattainable', 'legal', 'personal', 'obvious', 'relevant', 'exciting', 'flashy', 'luxurious', 'easy', 'small', 'great', 'great', 'reasonable', 'glamorous', 'daily', 'welcome', 'ideal', 'hard', 'narrative', 'high', 'wonderful', 'repetitive', 'many', 'authentic', 'gritty', 'great'];0.2880666666666666

191;Cinemaniac1984;goodfellas is easily one of the greatest movies of all time. hands down, it is one of the few movies that has left a long lasting impression, one that will always be memorable. martin scorsese is definitely on top of his game and goodfellas has definitely cemented a spot in his impressive resume, along with taxi driver, raging bull, casino, the departed, and the wolf of wall street. it's not hard to see why goodfellas is such a critically acclaimed movie and still a very popular movie amongst film fans. based on the non-fiction novel wise guy by nicholas pileggi (who also wrote the screenplay along with martin scorsese, goodfellas tells the story of henry hill (ray liotta who puts in an explosive performance in his best role to date) and his rise and fall in his career with the mafia throughout the 1950's and the 1980's. he starts off as a young boy running errands and as time goes on, he earns his reputation as a feared gangster however such acts including adultery, murder, and drug use contribute to his downfall. his fellow friends and gangsters throughout his time in the mafia include his childhood friend the sociopath tommy devito (joe pesci who deservedly won the 1990 academy award for best supporting actor) and the slick, calculating and volatile jimmy conway who also enjoys hijacking and robbing trucks (robert de niro in another memorable performance). the mob boss is paulie cicero (paul sorvino), a man who commands respect and fear, and rules over the crime family with an iron first including henry hill, tommy devito and jimmy conway. henry hill's wife karen (lorraine bracco, well known as the psychologist dr jennifer melfi from the sopranos) finds herself seduced by her husband's glamorous lifestyle but nothing lasts forever when henry's criminal activities and behaviour impede into their personal lives. without question this is martin scorsese's finest movie. there's not one bad thing that can be said about this movie. the cast is first rate, the entire story and screenplay is excellent, and martin scorsese as the director does a very commendable job. throughout the entire 146 minutes, there is not a dull moment nor is there a minute wasted. there are endless classic scenes in goodfellas that i could not even start to list them. the clever use of the soundtrack with all the songs intertwined with many scenes from the movie makes goodfellas even more memorable at another level. every time i hear the piano exit from layla by derek and the dominos, i am instantly reminded of goodfellas. goodfellas is a movie with a reputation for being violent with 300 uses of the f... word. in no way does martin scorsese pull any punches, nor does he aim to glamorise life in the mafia or the criminal lifestyle. the violence is realistic, cold, and unflinching, and this is certainly not a movie for everyone. unfortunately goodfellas was unfairly robbed of many academy awards, including best picture and best director among others. though martin scorsese finally earns a long overdue academy award for the departed in 2006, he deserved to win best director for goodfellas. goodfellas earns its spot as one of the finest movies of all time, and is definitely one of my favourite movies that will never soon be forgotten. a well deserved 10/10;29 January 2015;10;['great', 'few', 'long', 'lasting', 'memorable', 'impressive', 'hard', 'popular', 'non', 'fiction', 'wise', 'explosive', 'good', 'young', 'such', 'fellow', 'childhood', 'good', 'volatile', 'jimmy', 'memorable', 'glamorous', 'criminal', 'personal', 'fine', 'bad', 'first', 'entire', 'excellent', 'commendable', 'entire', 'dull', 'endless', 'classic', 'clever', 'many', 'memorable', 'violent', 'criminal', 'realistic', 'cold', 'many', 'good', 'good', 'long', 'overdue', 'good', 'fine', 'favourite', 'deserved'];0.2072368421052632

195;Flagrant-Baronessa;"exploring the rise and fall of a gangster, goodfellas dawdles on henry hill (ray liotta) from his childhood when he first started as an errand boy for the local mob on across the street, to the height of his life when he unexpectedly has to make a decision that changes his life. by this time henry is so entangled in the mafia that it has become his whole social life from his friends, his wife, his job to his values he is consumed in a camaraderie. the film is based on a true story and given its content and realistic photography approach, it feels strangely like a documentary. director martin scorsese, who grew up on the gritty crime-infested streets of new york said: ""i remember seeing it on the streets and thinking, this is the way a movie should look like."" to convey this realistic tone, the camera thus coldly follows henry around everywhere and it does not shy away from violence or unpleasant diversions, as is scorsese's style. it invests the whole film in a behind-the-scenes atmosphere, where the director expertly wields a long, continuous reel of exclusive footage. several takes are of steadicams gliding through the world for minutes, as when henry and karen park their cark, cross the street and enter the copacopana where they are pampered by henry's connections. it's raw and unflinching and truly absorbs you in henry's life as a wiseguy, climbing the mafia hierarchy. he often botches his way through jobs; he has a hard time whacking people and he clumsily cheats on his wife karen (lorraine bracco) the danger of the character is that you like him. ray liotta fantastically sews together the events as they unfold in a patient voice-over narrative flow. this flow is the film's fatal flaw. sure, the pacing starts out nicely enough by having henry slowly climb the mafia ladder along with his wiseguy friends jimmy (robert de niro) and tommy (joe pesci), both of whom are equally charismatic characters the latter with rapid-fire dialogue and a rapid-fire gun and pesci winning an oscar for his colourful performance. it's all compelling at first but as is the usual mistake by scorsese... he dilutes his film. it's like he got so taken with the mafia content that he wanted so much more of it for his own self-indulgence. there are numerous scenes that serve no other purpose than giving us a feel for the mafia family and the way things are run. it is true that some of them are important for establishing the atmosphere, but there are too many of them. the pace thus shifts from patient to lingering and the plot suffers countless detours and diversion into the life of crime. it loses focus. i cannot figure out whether this 'diluting the film' approach is scorsese's style or an unfortunate mistake he keeps repeating in every film of his. nevertheless, it makes goodfellas dawdle leisurely without any clear sense of point or direction for long periods of time. everything else in the film is fantastic, no hyperbole. scorsese takes a deep plunge into wiseguy culture, indulging in mob dialogue that snaps and crackles like kindling in a fireplace, brutal hits, sleek heists and rats. he navigates moods, themes, characters, and popular music (which is used throughout as a background device) with expert skill and less than twenty minutes into the film, you are so absorbed in the characters' lives of crime that you know of nothing else. as for acting, it is ray liotta who grabs my attention as henry, and not the resident scene-stealer robert de niro. i also fell in love with lorraine bracco's performance as henry's jewish wife whose kickass attitude and sparkling personality translates well on camera. the greatest sheer presence can best be attributed to paul sorvino as the big-shot boss paulie who, in spite of not saying a word until half of the film has passed, communicates a fantastic lethality. the reason the whole ensemble shines in their performances stems from the fact that they aren't acting like their characters; they are behaving like them. of course the whole of goodfellas is of the utmost quality but it could be even greater by being more condensed, as good most of martin scorsese's long-winded, diluted and slightly self-indulgent films. 8 out of 10";30 September 2006;8;['local', 'entangled', 'whole', 'social', 'true', 'realistic', 'gritty', 'realistic', 'unpleasant', 'whole', 'long', 'continuous', 'exclusive', 'several', 'raw', 'hard', 'patient', 'fatal', 'charismatic', 'rapid', 'rapid', 'colourful', 'compelling', 'usual', 'more', 'own', 'numerous', 'other', 'true', 'important', 'many', 'countless', 'unfortunate', 'clear', 'long', 'fantastic', 'deep', 'brutal', 'sleek', 'popular', 'expert', 'less', 'resident', 'jewish', 'sparkling', 'great', 'sheer', 'big', 'fantastic', 'whole', 'ensemble', 'utmost', 'great', 'good', 'most', 'diluted', 'indulgent'];0.1360381488430269

203;diac228;"1990 was a decent year for movies. we have the now-christmas classic home alone, tear-jerker classic ghost, several decent action-packed flicks (hunt for red october, total recall, die hard 2, steven segal before he became ridiculous), and of course, rocky v (totally kidding). but, 20 years ago, there was one movie that truly rose up amongst the usual pile of movies and delivered one of the most exhilarating experiences in the history of cinema. goodfellas is a masterpiece of its genre, and would change the movie world forever. it was too intense for some, but if you can rise past the grittiness, you are in for a wild ride through the drugs, violence, humor, and money associated with life in the gangsterhood. this movie would change a genre forever, and would pave the way for several promising careers. much like the way sergio leone (and eventually clint eastwood) made classic westerns (for a few dollars more being my favorite) that made all the other westerns made at the time inferior, goodfellas made the godfather and all crime/mafia pictures look silly. that's right, i said it. godfather is a decent flick, but it is no goodfellas. nowadays, whenever you make a gangster movie, you aren't borrowing details or techniques of coppola, you are copying good ol' martin scorsese and his masterful directing style associated with this flick. even television shows have a lot to owe to goodfellas--the sorpranos features over 25 actors and actresses that were in the movie. easily the best film from 1990, and easily the best crime-film of all-time. goodfellas follows the lives of several gangsters and their families throughout multiple decades, as you see their rise and fall in terms of position, power, and money. all of this is being narrated by the main character, henry hill (ray liotta). what separates goodfellas from every mafia/gangster film before and since its release is its very humble, down-to-earth presentation of its story. while the godfather made the mafia life a larger-than-life event with a god-complex, goodfellas toned it down and made it look like a gritty, blue-collar lifestyle that pays well and provides plenty of benefits. also, unlike all gangster films at the time, goodfellas didn't just focus on the main players, but also focused on the wives, mistresses, kids, and families of the gangsters involved. it was a family affair, and this was a realization that scorsese and nicholas pileggi clearly pointed out in their excellent script full of crisp diologue and plenty of substance. another great thing about goodfellas is that gangsters, bosses, villains were all given a heavy dosage of human character. they were all people you can relate to, they weren't just existing and talking to progress the plot, they engaged in deep conversations about subjects that were not always related to their job. when the audience can associate themselves with the people in the film, it's a great connection, and few films can connect better than goodfellas. it never feels like a film that is 146 minutes long. complimenting the superb writing was the phenomenal acting. every single performance was excellent, from the small (samuel l. jackson) to the much bigger roles (joe pesci, robert deniro, ray liotta). the excellent cast of actors and actresses contributed mightily to the powerfulness, and the humbleness of the movie, as it humanized the lifestyles of mobs, gangsters, and the mafia. even the rampaging murderer joe pesci portrayed was likable because despite his rage and murderous attitude, you can still feel his admiration and care for some of the people around him. but the standout feature of goodfellas has got to be the phenomenal directing of martin scorsese. prior to goodfellas, there was not a single director that perfectly mixes long shots, close-ups, track-shots, freeze-frames, long takes, and gritty hand-held-like cinematography like scorsese. the movie lacked the long, artsy, pointless sweeping shots of most gangster films before 1990; not a single shot or scene of goodfellas was unnecessary. for example the wedding scene of the first godfather went on for too long because of its constant shots of the wedding events; now compare that to the epic long tracking shot of the main character entering the copacabana. the action and the mayhem was always close-up, sometimes with a gun pointed directly at the camera, as if it was right on your face. bottom line: if you enjoy a good film, then goodfellas is for you. if you have not seen it, you are missing out on one of the greatest displays of perfect directing in the history of film, and easily the best crime film you'll ever witness. from the writing to the acting to the music selected to the flawless mix of style and substance, goodfellas set the bar much higher for films of its kind, and all adult films overall. it's one of the first modern hollywood films to not have that hollywood touch; as it remains down-to-earth, and allowed for a similar r-rated crime masterpiece (pulp fiction) to flourish a couple of years later. while the general public usually ranks the godfather as the quintessential crime film, i am one of the few that will safely say that the godfather is overrated, and it's because movies like goodfellas exist. this film is very realistic, very intense, and full of so many spectacular moments, you'll need multiple viewings to truly embellish yourself in it all. this movie is literally only one scene away from cinematic perfection (the infamous last day as a wiseguy scene ran just a bit too long). i strongly recommend this movie, as it will change the way you watch movies. and if you are aspiring to be in the film industry, it will change the way you make them.";20 September 2010;9;['decent', 'classic', 'classic', 'several', 'decent', 'red', 'total', 'hard', 'ridiculous', 'rocky', 'usual', 'exhilarating', 'intense', 'wild', 'several', 'promising', 'classic', 'few', 'more', 'other', 'inferior', 'silly', 'right', 'decent', 'good', 'masterful', 'good', 'good', 'several', 'multiple', 'main', 'humble', 'large', 'gritty', 'blue', 'main', 'excellent', 'full', 'crisp', 'great', 'heavy', 'human', 'deep', 'great', 'few', 'phenomenal', 'single', 'excellent', 'small', 'big', 'excellent', 'likable', 'murderous', 'phenomenal', 'single', 'long', 'close', 'long', 'gritty', 'like', 'long', 'artsy', 'pointless', 'sweeping', 'most', 'single', 'unnecessary', 'first', 'constant', 'epic', 'long', 'main', 'close', 'bottom', 'good', 'great', 'perfect', 'good', 'flawless', 'high', 'first', 'modern', 'similar', 'general', 'quintessential', 'few', 'realistic', 'intense', 'full', 'many', 'spectacular', 'multiple', 'cinematic', 'infamous', 'last'];0.1966162464985994
204;peefyn;there's much to say about goodfellas, and most of it has already been said by others. what i enjoyed the most with the movie was how it constructs this dual reality. you see and hear all of these guys having a blast, enjoying their money and their power. you can hear liotta's character describing the joys of the life they led. at the same time you are presented with certain scenes from this life where you can also see the backside of the medal. many mob movies are like this. they show this really charming culture of, well, people celebrating their own importance, and a culture based on respect, tradition and hierarchy. but then you typically see it all falls apart, so it wasn't a good idea after all. this movie plays around a bit with this, showing you both sides of the medal from the get go, but as the story progresses you can gradually see the medal turning around, going from having the positive side in focus, to having the negative side in focus. but, as mentioned, both sides of the medal are visible from the start till the end. this is maybe the most obvious in the ending scenes, with how the narration relates to what you see.;8 August 2015;8;['much', 'most', 'most', 'dual', 'same', 'certain', 'many', 'charming', 'own', 'good', 'positive', 'negative', 'visible', 'obvious'];0.3310507674144038

206;TheHonestCritic;"""goodfellas"" (1990), honestly, why is this considered one of the best gangster films of all-time? it should really be called: ""badfellas""! don't get me wrong, i love gangster films and i was excited to watch this ""movie"" for the first time. but, at the end of the day, i was ultimately just disappointed with it overall. it has a very messy and convoluted storyline, mediocre to over the top acting, and a boring generic soundtrack. the storyline is basically just the realistic life of the mafia. it's based off the novel, ""wiseguy"" by nicholas pileggi. one thing about this novel is that it's non-fiction. i'm not the biggest fan of non-fiction books or other media. however, ""wiseguy"" is one of those non-fictional novels that i enjoy reading. i thought: ""this would make an interesting movie!"" then, when i looked into it and discovered that ""goodfellas"" was based on this novel it sparked my interest. the concept had great potential, and i saw that the screenplay was in fact written by nicholas pileggi himself. then, i saw that martin scorsese joined in writing the screenplay and i thought: ""yeah, i understand it has to meet feature film standards. how much can martin scorsese possibly change with the story?"" i think that martin scorsese should have just left the screenplay writing duties to nicholas pileggi, because he completely screwed it up! the story would have probably been stronger if martin scorsese kept his hands off the screenplay and stuck to directing. another thing, is the annoying and constant narration in the ""film"". narration can be effective when utilized properly, but when it's overdone like in this ""movie"", it just becomes downright unbearable! film making 101: to have a stronger impact in your film, show, don't tell. if you're going to add in narration, make sure it aids in telling the story. in this ""film"", it's absolutely distracting from the story. what little there is! such a crying shame, because the original concept would have made a great movie! there is one thing i'd like to point out, and it's something positive in this ""film"". for those who may not know, one thing i like to see in cinema is a good long single take. of course, there are a few out there that aren't that great, or boring. but, the one in this ""movie"" is fantastic and one of the best single shots i've seen in any film. it's just about three minutes in length without any cuts whatsoever. the scene where henry, played by ray liotta and karen, played by lorraine braco make their way into the restaurant. that shot is so well laid out, and the final result was worth it. so, i will give the ""movie"" some extra credit for that, some, because long single shots can be very hard to nail. that, in my opinion, is the biggest highlight of this ""film"". as for the acting, it's overall just over the top, in the worst possible way. the best performances come from joe pesci and robert de niro. ray liotta was okay, but he just looked bored playing his role. as a result, i was bored watching him! the rest of the actors and actresses are nothing but mediocre. i don't understand, all of the major actors and actresses in this ""film"" give great performances in other films and shows. what's their excuse here? the soundtrack has a couple of memorable parts. but, for the most part it's just dull and therefore it makes the ""movie"" dull as well. now for the positives, yes there are two positives in this ""film"", which are the sets/locations and the special effects. all of the sets/locations are great. you can't go wrong with filming your movie in an iconic city like new york. i may not enjoy visiting the city itself, but it's really entertaining to watch on movies and shows! the sets/locations give the ""film"" a great atmosphere. the only other positive is the special effects. all of the special effects were very well-done and still hold up to this day.

""goodfellas"" is a more realistic movie that de-mythologises gangster life, showing it to be dangerous and highly unpredictable, drenched in blood and ambition. there is not even the faintest whiff of romanticism that you might find in ""the godfather"". the story follows henry hill (ray liotta) and his rise in late 60s and 70s new york to become a 'made man' among the mob. along the way he finds himself working for tommy cicero (paul sorvino), the local mob boss, and alongside characters such as jimmy conway (robert deniro) and tommy devito (joe pesci). nearly every recognisable gangster character actor in the us makes an appearance in this picture, (excluding al pacino and marlon brando). all the actors in this picture acquit themselves admirably. i can't say liotta is in the same acting league as deniro or pesci, whom he's frequently seen alongside. he just lacks the charisma to give the movie a strong enough centre. he is a good actor, but much of the time his performance seems hollow compared to the others. martin scorcese directs in fine style, including several daring long shots that follow henry and his friends in and about their business. script and storyline are also very good, and spring one or two surprises on the audience. i'm not as fond of this as i am of ""the godfather"" but nevertheless it is a fine picture.";22 June 2007;8;['italian', 'several', 'realistic', 'dangerous', 'unpredictable', 'faint', 'late', 'local', 'such', 'recognisable', 'same', 'strong', 'enough', 'good', 'much', 'hollow', 'fine', 'several', 'daring', 'long', 'good', 'fond', 'fine'];0.0587719298245613

226;jcbutthead86;goodfellas is an excellent,flawless masterpiece and a classic and it's not only one of the greatest gangster films ever made and one of the greatest films of the 90's but also one of the greatest films ever made. filled with masterful direction,excellent performances and a great soundtrack,goodfellas is one of my all time favorite films and is martin scorsese and cinema at it's best. set in new york,based on the true life book wiseguy by nicolas pileggi and based on a true story,goodfellas tells the story of henry hill(ray liotta)an irish-italian man who has had a love for gangsters and gangster life since he was a teenager in his local neighborhood. as a youngster henry starts working for the mob and as a he gets older henry becomes apart of the mob and living the lifestyle of a gangster. over the course of three decades henry hill along with his friends jimmy the gent conway(robert de niro)and tommy devito(joe pesci)depicts henry's easy rise in the mob and his hard and dangerous downfall. right from the opening credits and all the way to the very end goodfellas is a flawless masterwork of a film that pulls you end and does not let go until the final frame. martin scorsese has created a film that right next to francis coppola's the godfather as the definitive gangster film. but where as the godfather was an epic and somewhat romantic view of gangster like and a mob family,goodfellas took a much different direction and gives viewers a darker,less romantic view of mob showing viewers a world of how a mobster lives his life as a gangster. what is different about goodfellas is that the story tells the story from the point of view of the gangsters who works is not a mob boss or someone who runs a crime family but someone who works under the mob bosses. one of the things i love about the film goodfellas is the way scorsese plays with the audience showing things from henry hill's point of view where from hill's point of view the mob is a great way of living and a easy way to make money and live the good life showing the glamour,suits and cars making audiences love the lifestyle. but scorsese tricks audiences and shows us that gangster and mob life can be a dangerous and violent way of living where you can either be killed or sent to prison. scorsese gives the film a since of dread where there is violence in the air and that being in the mob is not all it's cracked up to be. some films based on true stories while good are most of the time told in a straight forward fashion and if goodfellas had been in the hands of another filmmaker it would have been more of a straight forward true story but scorsese being the master filmmaker that he is fills the film with great scenes and moments that are iconic and memorable and scorsese keeps you glued to the screen engrossed by the film and making you want more making goodfellas one of the greatest true stories on film. the screenplay by scorsese and pileggi is impressive giving the film excellent dialog and scenes with great realism and edge making you as the viewer feel like you are in the scenes with the characters. goodfellas is one of the fastest 2 and a half hours you will ever go through because when the film starts it never slows down and let's you breath a sigh of relief. the pace is so rapid and quick you will feel like you are watching a 90 minute film rather than a two and a half hour one. i think it's because of the documentary and raw feel of the film and how we as the viewer are in the movie. goodfellas is like a rock n'roll record put on film where you are looking and listening. the main characters in the film are not what you would call likable,but are well-developed and there is times when you can relate to them and you see things from their point of view and you get pulled into their state of minds. the ending and final 20-30 minutes is a classic ending filled with suspense and paranoia that is pushed to the max. it's an ending you will not forget. the cast does excellent jobs in their roles. ray liotta is amazing in his career defining role as henry hill,with liotta bringing intensity and wild energy to the role. robert de niro is excellent and at his best as jimmy conway,with de niro being menacing and unforgettable. joe pesci is brilliant in his oscar winning role as the volatile tommy devito,with pesci being scary,intense and funny at the same time. lorraine bracco is riveting as karen hill,henry's wife. bracco has great chemistry with liotta. paul sorvino is captivating and suave as paulie,the boss over everybody. frank vincent is wonderful as billy batts,a made guy from tommy's past. frank sivero(frankie carbone),chuck low(morris),michael imperioli(spider),debi mazer(sandy),gina mastrogiacomo(janice)and catherine scorsese(tommy's mother)give good performances as well. also lookout for an early role by samuel l. jackson in the role of stacks. the direction by martin scorsese is masterful and brilliant,with scorsese always moving the camera and giving the film a great pace and visual style. great direction by scorsese. the soundtrack in the film is one of best soundtracks in movie history with classics by the rolling stones(gimmie shelter,monkey man),donovan(atlantis),the crystels(then he kissed me),cream(sunshine of your love),the who(magic bus),harry nilsson(jump into the fire),sid vicious(my way),bobby darin(beyond the sea),aretha franklin(baby i love you),eric clapton,derek and the dominoes(layla,piano exit),george harrison(what is life)and more. excellent soundtrack. in final word,if you love martin scorsese,gangster films,crime dramas or films in general,i highly suggest you see goodfellas,a timeless masterpiece and classic that you can watch again

227;jackasstrange;what a joke. aesthetically the film is without a doubt one of the best films made, but plot and acting-wise(excluding deniro) it was annoying and mediocre. and it glorifies criminals and treason. that is one of the reasons i find the recent the wolf of wall street better. and it indeed is. ray liotta's voice was cringe worthy and weird. dicaprio's was smooth, soft, and sounded much more natural. and is totally a sarcastic and ironic film. so thats it. fanboys will say that i missed the point and so on, but in the reality they missed the point. the film is about glorifying criminals. obviously, if you want a class of filmmaking and insanely awesome camera-work, editing, cinematography etc. so you shall watch this film. scorsese is great, but he usually waste his talent in lame stories. 7/10;25 April 2014;10;['good', 'annoying', 'mediocre', 'recent', 'worthy', 'weird', 'smooth', 'soft', 'natural', 'sarcastic', 'ironic', 'awesome', 'great', 'lame'];0.1023809523809523

231;GeorgeRoots;"robert de niro, joe pesci and an outstanding job from ray liotta. ""goodfellas"" has everything that says priceless, as well as adding some new values to the lifestyle. dare i say it modernises both the look and era of the genre, to which many still consider it the best gangster flick to come out since ""the godfather"" (1972). it's a bold statement, and i just don't think it's that same level of good. still pretty fantastic regardless. as story goes it's pretty strong. based on the real events of gangster-turned informative henry hill (played by liotta), it tells his story of growing up in organised crime and his somewhat ""initiation"", that ultimately leads to him meeting jimmy ""the gent"" conway (robert de niro), and loose cannon tommy devito (an oscar winning performance by joe pesci). from then on we as an audience grow up with henry hill and his ageing, his addiction to drugs, his time in prison and the meeting of his future wife. all of it portrayed as a ""glamorous"" lifestyle, or as a stick of dynamite with the fuse nearly out. during the 1970's, the gang commits the infamous lufthansa heist, and starts killing off other members from rival gangs to assure dominance. bizarrely, they start offing their own as well to assert their power, will henry survive? well again, tops to martin scorsese. truly the best man you could want behind the camera for this kind of genre. every detail in the background is crisp, and the shadows in the corners of the frame have never looked so menacing and unsafe. broad, dark and flashy, ""goodfellas"" is a great film. luckily for us scorsese would revisit this kind of lifestyle a few years later in ""casino"" (1995), but since then nothing has felt quite like this and i can't think of a 1990's gangster film that compliments the old tropes of the genre. as piles and piles of new-age british gangster movies appear, they all deal with nothing but sex, drugs, football and money. there are no values in these movies that come off legitimate anymore. final verdict: a landmark film to kick off the 1990's, ""goodfellas"" is the kind of movie that just gets better with age. 9/10.";6 September 2014;9;['outstanding', 'priceless', 'new', 'many', 'good', 'bold', 'same', 'fantastic', 'strong', 'real', 'informative', 'organised', 'loose', 'oscar', 'future', 'glamorous', 'infamous', 'other', 'rival', 'own', 'good', 'crisp', 'menacing', 'unsafe', 'broad', 'dark', 'flashy', 'great', 'few', 'old', 'new', 'british', 'final', 'well'];0.1592581800915134

233;mnpollio;"goodfellas is a technically impressive film and interesting to review largely because of the huge following it has amongst film critics and martin scorsese fanatics alike, most of whom reverentially believe it is his best workand they may be correct. the story based on a novel by nicholas pileggi chronicles the rise through the ranks of the mafia of irish-sicilian henry hill (ray liotta), who has always wanted to be a gangster since he was a kid, and finds his wish granted. we follow him from a rambunctious teen to his first arrest, his marriage to jewish wife karen (lorraine bracco) through to their fall into drugs, and finally as an informer prior to entry into the witness protection program. the film has a dry sense of humor and is technically and visually amazing. scorsese loves the mobster milieu and is obviously working in his element here with a nicely picked cast. the attention to detail, the camera work, the costumes, the choice of music is all well thought out to the most intimate minutiae. the film is a fairly fascinating peek at life inside the mafia. scorsese allows events to unfold believably and the moments near the end where henry and karen become increasingly paranoid that they are under surveillance, complete with jittery, over bright intense camera work that heightens their unease, is arguably some of scorsese's best work. the acting is fairly solid. liotta manages to hold things together as the focal character and he gets nice support from bracco. deniro manages a dignified turn as liotta's mentor and friend. joe pesci won the oscar as the psychotic killer tommy devito. he is utilized well enough here to overlook the fact that it is basically the same performance he gives in everything else. yet as amazing as the film is, it still has its drawbacks that prevent it from becoming the classic that many of its admirers would have you believe. as fascinating as goodfellas is, i actually find scorsese's similarly themed subsequent work casino just as impressive technically, yet far more interesting in that it tells its tale using the backdrop of the formation of gambling mecca las vegas. i realize that i am in the minority with that view, but there it is. yet most notable of all is that goodfellas seems utterly incapable of connecting on an emotional level with the viewer. the superior godfather films featured similar themes and focused on characters capable of shocking acts of violence, yet managed to connect on an emotional level so that we had some concern for the players. by contrast, at the end of goodfellas, as brilliant as i thought some of the direction and technical aspects were, i found that i did not give a damn what happened to any of the characters on screen, including henry and karen. i was completely indifferent to whether they lived, died, escaped, etc. and this issue makes for a somewhat empty viewing experience. 1990 was a very interesting film year. coppola released his last godfather film that year. although it got an oscar nod, critics largely overlooked it in favor of goodfellas due to the fact that it is not on the same level as its predecessors. there is no question godfather iii is a flawed film, but it is also more emotionally rich than goodfellas and any one of its flaws is more interesting to discuss at length than any of goodfellas successes. conversely, critics and scorsese fans have spilled gallons of ink over the ""injustice"" of dances with wolves winning the best picture over goodfellas, but it is not hard to see why it did. dww in its own right is just as technically impressive as goodfellas (maybe even more so considering its director was an amateur with a passionate vision), but dww connects emotionally with the viewer in a far more powerful way than goodfellas ever does. at the end of dww and godfather iii, i had to know what happened with those characters. at the end of goodfellas, not so much. what scorsese has achieved is certainly noteworthy and makes for a very good, solid gangster film, but most definitely not a masterpiece. it is slick, flashy and technically well done (sometimes even brilliant), but its inability to make me give a damn about any of its characters is a huge stumbling block.";24 April 2012;7;['impressive', 'interesting', 'huge', 'most', 'good', 'correct', 'irish', 'rambunctious', 'first',

246;brianberta;"""the godfather"" is usually called the greatest gangster film ever made. several films such as ""scarface"", ""the godfather part 2"", ""bonnie and clyde"", and ""pulp fiction"" are rivals to that movie. to me, ""goodfellas"" definitely ranks very high up there. i love both ""the godfather"" and ""goodfellas"" and i think that both films are masterpieces. this movie follows infamous gangster henry hill and his friends as they work their way up in the gangster world. it shows different people and different events he encounters in this film. i just want to start off this review by saying that this movie is incredibly entertaining. it keeps the movie going at an enjoyable pace and it makes the movie very easy to follow. the movie even draws you in right at the beginning with its brilliant opening scene which is now iconic. by far, tommy devito (joe pesci) is my favorite character in this movie. he is threatening and he seems like the kind of guy that you don't want to mess with. he can lose his temper very easily and if someone annoys him even in the slightest way possible, they risk getting themselves shot and killed. the infamous ""funny how?"" scene near the beginning is definitely one of the most tense scenes in all of cinema history. the audience is left wondering if he'll pop and the silence of the scene makes it more tense. in other words, he basically steals the show. ray liotta also gave a fantastic role as henry hill. i can't think of a better actor to play him. he captures a feeling of innocence all while having a feeling of violence to him. he also loses his temper easily and when he does, those scenes stick with you very long after viewing it. also, robert de niro gave a great performance. robert de niro has always been one of if not my favorite actor of all time. i like him for his tough guy roles. in my opinion, his performances in ""taxi driver"" and ""raging bull"" are some of the best performances ever in cinema. he gave another phenomenal performance in this movie as well even though he's not in the movie as much as you'd expect him to be based on the dvd cover. this movie is based on the true story of henry hill and it is adapted from the best-selling book ""wiseguy"". the book is great but the movie blows it out of the water in every way imaginable. also, henry hill himself actually stated that this movie is about 95% accurate. also, the movie is very stylish with its dazzling cinematography. the cinematography looks so good mainly because of the lighting and realistic set design in it. on top of that, scorsese's copa cabana shot is a fabulous shot and it has a lot going for it in terms of the long take. in conclusion, this movie hits all the right notes and it is contains everything which i think is mandatory in gangster films. it is easy to follow, it has enjoyable pacing, great acting, and memorable characters. this film is definitely a masterpiece and it definitely ranks up there with some of the best movies ever made.";6 November 2015;9;['great', 'several', 'such', 'infamous', 'different', 'different', 'entertaining', 'enjoyable', 'easy', 'brilliant', 'iconic', 'favorite', 'slight', 'possible', 'infamous', 'funny', 'tense', 'tense', 'other', 'fantastic', 'well', 'great', 'favorite', 'tough', 'good', 'phenomenal', 'true', 'good', 'great', 'imaginable', 'accurate', 'stylish', 'dazzling', 'good', 'realistic', 'copa', 'fabulous', 'long', 'right', 'mandatory', 'easy', 'enjoyable', 'great', 'memorable', 'good'];0.3139469608981803
247;Gubby-Allen;if i had my way, this is the film that all gangster & violence films should be measured up against. it sets all the standards which some films have since lived up to but most have failed miserably. dare i say it, it's better than godfather 1 & probably even part 2, and that takes some doing. the main reason, is the plot is kept simple, there's just the right amount of characters. even godfather 1 -if you can find a fault with it- probably has just one or two extra italians to confuse you slightly. this is gangster films & even films generally, at it's best. sure there's some gruesome & heartless scenes, and i felt for the innocent postman, but they fit in perfectly with the context of the film and create exactly the mood. of course, the main reason is that it's based on true accounts which you can easily believe. if only others in the film industry would try to do likewise. 9.5/10 if such a vote existed, it doesn't so 10/10. alongside only star wars, great escape, shawshank redemption & the magnificent 7 out of 300 films. that's pretty good company.;5 December 2001;9;['most', 'well', 'main', 'simple', 'right', 'extra', 'good', 'sure', 'gruesome', 'heartless', 'innocent', 'main', 'true', 'great', 'magnificent', 'good'];0.3335034013605442

249;illbebackreviews;"there are many films that i would highly rate when it comes to crime films. pulp fiction, dark knight, the godfather and the shawshank redemption but in this list will always come goodfellas. goodfellas is not just a movie about gangsters. its a movie that has heart and emotion as well as comedy, violence and pretty much everything else. much of the film focuses on the inner self of our three main mobsters: henry, jimmy and tommie. the film deeply explores the personalities of each character and shows us the friendship between these three criminals. this film does something ""quentin tarantino"" ish and that is something i found interesting for a martin scorsosse film and that is the link between the opening scene and a scene approximately half way during the movie. the film mainly focuses on henry, our main character, as a boy at a young age who had admired and wanted to be a gangster like the family he idolised, the luchhes'. i found each of the main characters fascinating, and as much as i liked the character story for henry, i mainly enjoyed joe pesci's oscar winning performance as tommie. i often found myself laughing at tommie. the casting for this film could not have been any better. robert de niro as jimmy was brilliant, ray liatto as henry was great and most of all joe pesci as tommie was the best of the three. i liked the story very much which focuses on henry as he mainly tries to become a gangster in order to also help out his family. i found the ending emotional and brilliantly done. overall, fans of crime movies must check out goodfellas. it'll hardly disappoint!";28 December 2012;10;['many', 'dark', 'much', 'inner', 'main', 'interesting', 'half', 'main', 'young', 'main', 'fascinating', 'oscar', 'well', 'brilliant', 'great', 'most', 'good', 'emotional'];0.3255555555555556

251;TheHande;'goodfellas' is an interesting piece. it has the mobster-romance of godfather and the gritty reality of scarface all in one. yet, it is perhaps less than the sum of all its parts. mob-films aren't typically cheery or uplifting but keeping a safe-zone where the audience isn't too bothered by all the evil things going on screen is something i really missed and something which i think the godfather succeeded much better in accomplishing. on its own the film is none the less fantastic. it feels like a twisted kind of reality where you're not exactly sure what's real and what's not. perhaps i get a little squeamish when drugs become an element in the story but that might be just me. there is a great deal of irony in the film but it lacks the likability of the godfather. on the whole that might not be a fair comparison as coppola's films made up a saga where as this had to wrap the mobster tale in one movie. it's definitely a great film for fans of mobster films, but not a master-piece and way too gory and bleak. on the whole i thought the performances were, none-the-less, great. robert deniro, ray liotta and joe pesci are amongst my favorite actors and each deliver a brilliant character to the screen.;10 August 2007;8;['interesting', 'gritty', 'less', 'cheery', 'uplifting', 'safe', 'evil', 'own', 'fantastic', 'twisted', 'sure', 'real', 'little', 'great', 'fair', 'great', 'gory', 'bleak', 'less', 'great', 'favorite', 'brilliant'];0.2042708333333333
252;theinaniloquent;when i first heard of goodfellas, i was intrigued. it wasn't about a a single part of a gangster's life, it wasn't about the one part where the gangster decided to move along, it wasn't all that sappy, stupid stuff. it was about the life of a gangster, and that meant realism.. realism is a change sometimes, because it's either overused or underused. people make it so hyper-realistic, it may be a bit boring. on the latter, they use so many things to make it unrealistic that it doesn't even make sense to watch it. but realism works as a counterpart, and it was a film by martin scorsese. who could go wrong with that? i turned it on, watched it, and enjoyed it. it worked as a gangster movie, but anything outside of that? i had some mixed feelings... the acting was brilliant. everything did such an amazing job, i was surprised at how good it was. especially how i've heard some scenes were acted how by real gangsters. and some scenes weren't told to the background actors, so their reactions were real and surprised.. the screenplay was really well-done. the jokes weren't supposed to be laugh- out-loud funny, but the actors played their parts and perfected them. their sarcastic behavior made it this much more enjoyable and i had a grin upon my face the entire time.. the thing that made this the best was how the whole film reflected of the entire life of a gangster, and how things go in between. instead of believing i was just watching a movie, i believed i was watching the unfolding of a gangster's life. we have the start, the life of them, the ups and downs, and how everything just goes downhill. we go on an array of emotions and much more. classic.. but there seemed to be a problem with all of this. although the movie broke-ground for future movies, there seemed to be this blandness to it. i don't know what it was. i loved the movie as a whole, but looking as i hadn't seen it when it became a classic, it seemed a bit contrived maybe? it seems sad to say that because i wanted to like it more than i had. but something seemed wrong. something seemed not scorsese about it... bad things stop there. the movie really was great, and i really do recommend watching it. but as it receives such high praise, maybe i had too much expectation(s) to surpass the un-originality the film gave to me. but the film was good, no doubt about it. 7/10.;10 May 2012;7;['single', 'sappy', 'stupid', 'overused', 'underused', 'hyper', 'realistic', 'boring', 'latter', 'many', 'unrealistic', 'wrong', 'mixed', 'brilliant', 'amazing', 'surprised', 'good', 'real', 'real', 'surprised', 'loud', 'sarcastic', 'enjoyable', 'entire', 'good', 'whole', 'entire', 'more', 'future', 'sad', 'wrong', 'scorsese', 'bad', 'great', 'such', 'high', 'much', 'good'];0.0768412698412698

257;HelloTexas11;"'goodfellas' could be described as ""'the godfather' on speed,"" but that wouldn't really be accurate. the two movies are very different. the mobsters in 'godfather' are dignified by comparison. those in 'goodfellas' have practically been driven mad by power, money, and eventually, dope. at least one of them, joe pesci's tommy, is quite literally insane. the film moves at a lightning pace, narration provided by the character henry hill (ray liotta) and his wife karen (lorraine bracco.) we see what takes places through henry's (and to lesser degree, karen's) descriptions, though it plays out right in front of us as well. robert de niro plays jimmy, a charismatic gangster who is part of the mob but also something of a free agent; he can never be 'made' (the ultimate distinction the crime family can bestow on a member) because of his irish roots. the same goes for henry. he earns his place in the mob by starting at an early age as an errand boy willing to do anything, which endears him to the mob and their boss, paulie. the violence in 'goodfellas' is all the more appalling because for the most part, it is so casually administered. tommy, for example, will kill anyone for the slightest perceived insult, with no more thought or regret than he would have ordering a drink. people are routinely beaten up savagely if they get crossways with any of the mob figures. but there is much more to the film than that, and i should point out there's a great deal of humor in the film, some of it laugh-out-loud funny. at times, it's like the most twisted comedy you've ever seen. 'goodfellas' also shows how this 'community' of criminals and their families live; it takes place in and around new york city for the most part. not surprisingly, it is a very tightly-knit group. once karen marries henry, she has no contacts or life outside the extended 'family.' all of her female friends are wives of other mobsters. birthdays, weddings, holidays... these are only shared with family insiders. this quirky little subculture has its own rules, standards and perks. for instance, there is one night a week designated for the men to take their mistresses out for drinks at a nightclub. serving a prison term is accepted with a shrug; it seems almost all the men have served time at one point or another. henry's first prison stint gets him congratulations from the others. it's like a badge of honor or a rite of passage. the lifestyle is very fast-paced, almost maniacally so. everyone the mobsters deal with is paid off with wads of cash: cops, delivery boys, waiters, prison guards, you name it. every gangster in the family carries with him a roll of hundreds (occasionally twenties); i've never seen so much currency exchange hands so frequently as in 'goodfellas.' eventually, despite paulie's prohibition against it, several of the men including henry begin dealing in drugs, specifically cocaine, which he and karen are soon hooked on. the final scenes show a paranoid, out of control henry totally wired from the coke, backed into a corner, the only way out being to turn government informant and enter the witness protection program. turns out old don corleone, in that very different film 'the godfather,' was right. drugs did end up destroying the mob to a large degree.

258;Mr_Censored;"as far back as henry hill can remember, he always wanted to be a gangster. his dreams are realized early on in his childhood as he ascends the ranks of the mafia in brooklyn, ny and then finds his life descending into a downward spiral that forces him out of society altogether. this is his true story, adapted from a novel by nicholas pileggi and brought to the screen by writer/director martin scorsese. authenticity plays a big role in the film. because it is a true story about real people, it would be nothing if the characters didn't feel authentic. thankfully we have the great robert de niro and joe pesci (who subsequently won an oscar for his role) along with ray liotta (in, no doubt, his finest role) bringing the players in the film to life so naturally. nothing these actors do is over-done nor glamorized in any way. in fact, it's almost as if the trio personally knew the people they were portraying before committing their interpretations to film. for all of their character flaws and ugliness, nothing is sugar-coated, and the film is the better for it. of course, it helps with a solid supporting cast that includes paul sorvino, lorraine bracco, and frank sivero. bracco, in particular, gives the viewer someone to live through the experience with, as she witnesses and comes to term with the shocking reality she must adapt to. the film is no doubt violent and brutal, but is delivered with a touch of class as only martin scorsese can bring to the game. this film alone is a testament to his status as one of america's finest film-makers. conjuring up images that will stay with you long after your first viewing, scorsese makes the ultra-violence as real as it should be and brings only the finest performances out of even the smallest players in the pack. helping to commit the film to memory is a brilliant soundtrack of popular tunes that spans three decades and serves as a stunning example of popular music used effectively in cinema. if you remember one thing about ""goodfellas,"" it may very well be eric clapton's ""layla"" and the grisly and haunting images that accompany it. without a doubt, ""goodfellas"" is one of the finest mob films ever made and, at the very least, is certainly one of scorsese's best. from the cast to the music and everything in between, it is complete, sweet and sensational perfection. view it, and you'll see why it was such a smashing success and why it is still considered a classic almost 20 years later.";26 August 2009;10;['downward', 'true', 'big', 'true', 'real', 'authentic', 'great', 'fine', 'well', 'solid', 'particular', 'shocking', 'violent', 'brutal', 'fine', 'first', 'ultra', 'real', 'fine', 'small', 'brilliant', 'popular', 'stunning', 'popular', 'grisly', 'fine', 'least', 'good', 'complete', 'sweet', 'sensational'];0.2293333333333333

260;Hancock_the_Superb;"""goodfellas"" is a solid, well-made and well-put together film that deserves the accolades it gets. however, i don't think it's quite in the same league as ""the godfather"" or ""once upon a time in america"". it's more in the realm of ""the untouchables"", in that it's made more for a mainstream audience than the above films. the movie, to put it succinctly, regards henry hill (ray liotta in a wonderfully underrated performance), an irish/italian kid who grows up in new york wanting to be a gangster. he becomes a relatively big shot apprentice of local boss paulie (paul sorvino), though his sympathies lie with infamous gangster jimmy conway (robert de niro) and his explosive long-time partner, tommy devito (joe pesci). eventually, after much violence, many affairs, a downward spiral caused mostly by drug abuse, and a robbery gone bad, hill is arrested by the police and basically forced into violating one of the mob's key codes: don't rat on a friend, and always keep your mouth shut. the film's storyline is flawlessly done, with no real plot holes that can be noticed. the photography is gorgeous throughout. and the acting is some of the best you're likely to see anywhere. liotta tackles the role of henry hill with great panache, and depicts his rise and fall very well (even his narration is great to listen to most of the time). lorraine bracco gives arguably her best performance as henry's slightly unhinged and paranoid wife, karen. robert de niro gives his usual excellent performance, underplaying his part as jimmy except when a little force is needed. paul sorvino is calm and likable as the big boss paulie. but needless to say, joe pesci as the explosive, extraordinarily profane (2/3's of the films ""fucks"" must come from him), and extremely violent tommy steals the show. pesci is one of the finest actors ever, and he really owns this movie from beginning to end - and his death, needless to say, is something of a shock. various other great actors like frank vincent, vince pastore, michael imperioli, and samuel l. jackson, among others, have small, early career parts. but there's just something about this movie which doesn't strike me as being as good as the above films. i can't put my finger on it how. i think, like ""the untouchables"", it was made with being a popular film in mind, rather than a great one. that's not to detract from the film too much, but it's just an observation. the period soundtrack (made up almost entirely of songs from the '40s-'70s) works sometimes, but other times (particularly the ""beyond the sea"" during the prison scenes) it detracts from the action and took me at least out of the film. obviously, most others will disagree with my points. overall, ""goodfellas"" is a solid, entertaining, and very well-made film that i'd recommend to pretty much anyone. is it a great movie? i think so. is it a classic? arguably. is it one of the top two or three mob movies ever? not quite. still, an 8/10 (which is what i'm giving this film) is still a very good score. nothing to be ashamed about in that, martin.";5 September 2005;8;['solid', 'same', 'more', 'more', 'above', 'underrated', 'irish', 'italian', 'big', 'local', 'infamous', 'explosive', 'long', 'much', 'many', 'downward', 'bad', 'key', 'real', 'gorgeous', 'good', 'likely', 'great', 'great', 'most', 'lorraine', 'good', 'unhinged', 'paranoid', 'usual', 'excellent', 'little', 'calm', 'likable', 'big', 'needless', 'explosive', 'profane', 'violent', 'fine', 'needless', 'various', 'other', 'great', 'small', 'early', 'good', 'above', 'popular', 'great', 'other', 'least', 'most', 'solid', 'entertaining', 'much', 'great', 'top', 'good', 'ashamed'];0.2068576388888888

271;ilovedolby;"there is a fascination with the underworld that exists in everyone. we find ourselves drawn to the headlines of gang wars and those caught in the middle. after all, al copone was a crook, but also a celebrity. it is this fascination that has captivated audiences with gangster pictures from the 1930s with james cagney in ""the public enemy"" to the more recent ""goodfellas"" from director martin scorsese. the latter picture, with its sense of realism, like ""the public enemy"" stands the test of time. its characters are every bit as terrifying, especially tommy de vito played by joe pesci as was cagney's portrayal of tom powers. and of course with robert de niro and ray liotta, one can only expect explosive portrayals. ""goodfellas"" tells the story of henry hill (liotta), who from childhood had aspirations of being a gangster. he starts out small, parking cadillacs for wise guys and eventually works his way up to top of the food chain. by the time he is 21, he has more money than anyone else does his age, a sexy girlfriend, and the respect of the mob. henry soon teams up with tommy de vito (pesci) and the two work the streets with jimmy conway (de niro) for paul cicero (paul sorvino). what begins, as robbery becomes another crime: murder, extortion, booze, etc. but after henry gets married and finds himself rooted deeper into the mob, he begins to take on more than he can handle. director scorsese grew up on the streets of new york and witnessed the rough life that people could have. he incorporates his own history into the characters of the film. this is a common practice in most of his films from ""raging bull,"" ""taxi driver,"" and ""mean streets,"" as he has a fascination and love for the big apple. but the most obvious aspect of that life is the violence. it is portrayed in ""goodfellas"" from a realistic point of view. scorsese does not hide the blood. he does not hide way people die or where they may end up. he simply shows the gut-wrenching reality of the mob world as is. the most affective example of that realistic violence is pesci's performance, which garnered him an oscar for best supporting actor in 1990. tommy's character is a homicidal maniac, and a reminder of cagney's performance in ""white heat."" pesci is horrifying to watch in action. from the opening scene where he stabs a body that is not quite dead, to his shooting of a young man named spider who is slow to serve him a drink, the man is simply on fire. pesci had a similar affect in ""raging bull."" as such, ""goodfellas"" is pesci's ""raging bull."" a scene in ""raging bull"" shows pesci throwing a drink in a guy's face, then after a merciless beating, drags the guy out onto the street and repeatedly thrashes the man with a car door as the man's body lays half in the car and half outside it. the scene is horrific, but also enthralling. what is even more affective is scorsese's use of music throughout the film. the time frame ranges from the 1960s to the late 1980s and the film's soundtrack plays like a time warp. the best use of music is eric clapton's ""layla,"" in which scorsese plays the song's last four minutesa piano and guitar duo that masterfully captures the feeling for the events in the film. ultimately, ""goodfellas"" is the equivalent of a mob-epic. like the gangster pictures of the 1930s, there is also social commentaryit is the government that tries to crack down on these criminals, however, it is the police and other public sectors that are hand-in-hand with the moband little is ever done to change the situation. ****";13 March 2005;10;['public', 'recent', 'latter', 'public', 'terrifying', 'explosive', 'small', 'wise', 'more', 'sexy', 'married', 'more', 'rough', 'own', 'common', 'most', 'mean', 'big', 'obvious', 'realistic', 'affective', 'realistic', 'good', 'white', 'opening', 'dead', 'young', 'slow', 'similar', 'such', 'horrific', 'affective', 'late', 'good', 'last', 'social', 'other', 'public', 'little'];0.0383333333333333

276;Gideon24;movies about the mob have been part of cinema history for decades, but never was life as a mobster made to look more glamorous and more alluring than it was presented in martin scorsese's 1990 masterpiece goodfellas, a sweeping cinematic epic that spans several decades in the lives of a select group of men working their way up through the social strata of the syndicate. the film opens on the childhood of one henry hill (a real person btw, who is now in the witness protection program), a teen who started his career with the mob as an errand boy and was paid handsomely for his efforts. it's a little unsettling the way the mob draws henry in and makes what he does seem so glamorous and exciting, but nicholas pileggi's screenplay brilliantly shines light on the allure of life in the mob. even though we know it's wrong, the way the director and screenwriter make it completely understandable. there's something rather pathetic about the fact that when a teenage henry is arrested for the first time, the fact that he keeps his mouth shut about his employers, makes him the new hero of this dangerous inner circle and that he will be protected by them for life. the inner circle includes a couple of career mobsters jimmy conway (robert de niro) and tommy de vito (joe pesci) who take the adult henry (now played by ray liotta) under their wing and the sometimes conflicted emotions henry goes through when he realizes some of the things that are required of him. the movie's opening is proof of this as we see jimmy, tommy, and henry in a car with a body in a trunk which they are preparing to bury somewhere in new jersey. despite the rampant ugliness that is a part of this life, the perks seem to outweigh the ugliness for henry until he is in so deep that he can't get out, to the point where his job has direct correlations to the don, paul cicero (paul sorvino) who treats henry like a son until he learns that henry has branched out into his own side business that has threatened the primary business and everyone involved. scorcese has created a world that looks impossible to resist and it is very easy to understand how hill got pulled in, and as we all know, once you're in, you never get out. eventually, henry was in so much trouble, his only alternative to being whacked was selling out. the cast is absolutely perfect, led by de niro as conway and a star- making performance by ray liotta as henry hill. liotta is sexy and charismatic as hill and no matter what hill does, liotta always makes the viewer sympathize with henry, no matter what he's going through. joe pesci won a best supporting actor oscar for his outrageous performance as tommy, which produces equal doses of laughs and chills, whether he is amusing cronies with wild stories, beating the crap out of old buddies, or borrowing a shovel from his clueless mom to help bury a body in the trunk of his car while he is at mom's dinner table eating pasta. lorraine braco received a supporting actress nomination for her fiery performance as karen, henry's wife who turns a blind eye to what her husband is doing because the perks for her seem to be even better than the perks henry gets. paul sorvino commands the screen as big paulie and catherine scorsese (the director's mother) is adorable as tommy's mother. scorsese's cinematic eye for violence and shock is in full view here, creating a glamorous look at mob life that doesn't minimize the violence and ugliness that comes along with it. the art direction and divine musical score also deserve mention here. the film and scorsese were both robbed of oscars...in a word, a masterpiece.;6 March 2015;9;['glamorous', 'alluring', 'sweeping', 'cinematic', 'several', 'select', 'social', 'real', 'btw', 'little', 'unsettling', 'glamorous', 'exciting', 'wrong', 'understandable', 'pathetic', 'teenage', 'first', 'new', 'dangerous', 'inner', 'inner', 'rampant', 'deep', 'direct', 'own', 'primary', 'impossible', 'easy', 'much', 'only', 'perfect', 'sexy', 'charismatic', 'outrageous', 'equal', 'amusing', 'wild', 'old', 'clueless', 'fiery', 'blind', 'well', 'big', 'adorable', 'cinematic', 'full', 'glamorous', 'divine', 'musical'];0.0319128787878787
277;michael_the_nermal;"i suppose a lot of people found the characters in this film compelling and relatable on a basic human level. from what i saw, virtually all of the characters are low kinds of scum, always willing to betray one another and murder for kicks. the protagonist, played by ray liota, lacks the depth or redeeming characteristics that cagney and al pacino's gangsters had. liota's henry hill has very little that would make him seem like somebody to care about, because he's always willing to betray people and lie to save his own skin. when he gets his comeuppance, the viewer knows he richly deserves it, and will find no reason to take his side. his colleagues in crime, played by robert de niro and joe pesci, are equally irredeemable. the only decent qualities about de niro and liota is that they are not quick to condone random murder, as pesci is always apt to do. the level of violence in this movie is gratuitous and disgusting. it does little to glamorize the life of crooks, and instead makes it seem like a low, loathsome venture. this movie is full of violence and little in the way of decent themes, as virtually all the characters are too slimy to convey anything relatable to the viewer on a basic level, except that we sometimes betray others to save ourselves. the acting is decent, though not something to write home about. the plot is winding and tortuous, so pay very close attention if you want to understand the action. the plot actually seems secondary, more like a framework for a menagerie of blood-and-guts and gangster dialogue. i do enjoy movies that feature prominent ultra-violence, like ""robocop"" and ""sin city,"" but those movies had deep characters and themes about morality that this movie does not explore. watch it if you wish, but don't expect this to be the classic everyone seems to think it is. ps: listen for the phrase ""you're busting my balls."" virtually all the main characters say it. you could play a drinking game with this movie for all the times the characters say that phrase. this likely inspired a scene in the tv series ""south park,"" where cartman says this phrase to people who refuse his offer to buy aborted fetuses. good times.";13 June 2006;4;['compelling', 'relatable', 'basic', 'human', 'low', 'willing', 'little', 'willing', 'own', 'irredeemable', 'only', 'decent', 'quick', 'random', 'apt', 'gratuitous', 'disgusting', 'little', 'low', 'loathsome', 'full', 'little', 'decent', 'slimy', 'relatable', 'basic', 'decent', 'tortuous', 'close', 'secondary', 'prominent', 'ultra', 'deep', 'classic', 'main', 'aborted', 'good'];0.0662202380952381

284;Jakealope;"first off, this is really a well made movie, with martin scorcese's bringing to life all the hoodlum midlifes and lowlifes he knows so well. the cast is a1, and includes all the usually suspects like sorvino, liotta, deniro, pesci, and future soprano's luminaries like lorraine bracco, mike imperioli, tony sirico, vincent pastore, as well as eugene levy and sam jackson. i mention sopranos boldly cause this movie definitely is the template for the sopranos and other revisionist mob comedy/dramas. it chronicles the real life exploits of henry hill, a mobster who ratted out his pals in queens and became a notorious witness protection screw up, then cashed on on his criminal/mob past with his books and this movie, so in all the murder, racketeering and mayhem he was an accomplice, though it is tempered by liotta, with a great ""nice bad guy"" act. paul sorvino, as pauli, is the template for all mob boss types, who shuffles around grilling sausages while commanding his little crime fief. here is the problem. unlike the ""godfather"" series, which almost canonizing the mobsters with old world grandeur, this movie is upfront that these mobsters are greedy bullies, just out to have a good time. they are fun loving party animals who threaten to kill the club owner they suck off of as he tries to collect the tab from tommy devito, the fun loving murderous little psychopath that made joe pesci a household name, and his character niche. that's the problem, the movie glorifies gangster life and is a media ""pimp ride"" for a killer hood like real life henry hill. it's more than a morally dubious movie. even ""clockwork orange"" which was banned in england with the help of stanley kubrick, was more of a morality play than this. without belaboring the point, since scorcese is such a good film maker, he puts a glam spin on these real life people who should be swinging from the gallows, not serving as role models for a growing psychopath. that is why i only gave it a 6, it deserves a 9.5 by most ""normal"" movie scales. it is funny, dramatic and always interesting. the music, the good hits of the time mirroring hill's career from the late 40's to the late 70'sis a great melding of pop culture. it is almost uproariously funny. i only recommend this to mature adults, which excludes about half the country.";12 December 2006;6;['future', 'tony', 'other', 'real', 'notorious', 'criminal', 'great', 'nice', 'bad', 'little', 'old', 'upfront', 'greedy', 'good', 'murderous', 'little', 'real', 'more', 'dubious', 'more', 'good', 'glam', 'real', 'normal', 'funny', 'dramatic', 'interesting', 'good', 'late', 'late', 'great', 'funny'];0.1931159420289855

289;Jonathon_Natsis;christmas. the time of year where hearing one more carol or watching one more commercial for frozen ham will surely send anyone over the edge. it's also the time that almost every major film studio tries their hand at making a quick buck by releasing some generic, light- hearted holiday movie you've probably seen in some form already. i don't care for these films at all, which is why i have all the more reason to thank fox classics for their spotlight on scorsese week, which ended last friday with what is, in my opinion, the greatest film ever made by the greatest filmmaker alive today. goodfellas is the remarkably true story of henry hill (ray liotta), a young boy whose imagination is captured by the prospect of being a gangster. fast forward thirteen years, and henry has befriended local legends jimmy conway (robert de niro) and tommy devito (joe pesci, in an oscar-winning performance) as part of the mafia. the rest of the film plays out as a rise-and-fall story as old as the roman empire, as henry's addiction to the good life slowly consumes him and his wife karen (lorraine bracco, whose role in this film led to her big break as jen melfi in the sopranos). scorsese's two most recent feature films (shutter island and the departed), while being quality efforts in their own right, are very different to his career-shaping masterpieces. they follow a structured plot, whereas his earlier movies tended to focus on a single character (or two) and a series of key moments in their existence, and what impact they had on the character's mental state or, indeed, life (think taxi driver, raging bull and casino). goodfellas follows the same structure, progressing in a chronological fashion but only showing events worth documenting. it makes the film feel like less of a narrative and more of a biopic, but certainly dosen't detract from the entertainment. pesci is almost unanimously considered the standout, while the smaller-than-expected role played by de niro makes one forget just how good an actor he really is. in fact, the very young liotta almost seems overshadowed by his co-stars, despite being the lead actor. that is until the final act, where he steals the show as a coked-up henry, trying to get through the hectic day of a mobster while the rest of his life appears to crumble around him. his overt aggression and deep-seated paranoia contribute to his performance being the most realistic and poignant depiction of a person under the influence ever seen on film. goodfellas consists of some of the most inspired cinematography and editing ever to be seen. indeed, what makes the use of the camera such a delight to watch is that it is almost a character in itself, so much does it reflect the tone of each scene. when henry is in a rush to get his date back home, the film cuts from point a to point b showing nothing in between, to maintain an urgent pace. when he takes karen to the copacabana for the first time, the camera follows her so that the viewer feels the same sense of unfamiliarity and surprise at just how good henry's life is as she does. finally, an excellent soundtrack perfectly compliments henry's non-diegetic voice-over. music by tony bennett, the rolling stones, dean martin, donovan, cream, muddy waters, the who and sid vicious (and that's just scratching the surface) make enjoyable scenes memorable, and memorable scenes legendary. and while goodfellas doesn't exactly promote peace on earth and goodwill to your fellow man, i'll take it over the search for santa paws any day of the festive season. *there's nothing i love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. so drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.*;1 February 2011;10;['more', 'more', 'commercial', 'frozen', 'major', 'quick', 'generic', 'hearted', 'more', 'scorsese', 'last', 'great', 'great', 'alive', 'true', 'young', 'local', 'old', 'good', 'big', 'recent', 'own', 'different', 'early', 'single', 'key', 'mental', 'same', 'chronological', 'worth', 'less', 'more', 'small', 'good', 'young', 'final', 'hectic', 'overt', 'realistic', 'poignant', 'inspired', 'much', 'urgent', 'first', 'same', 'good', 'excellent', 'non', 'diegetic', 'rolling', 'muddy', 'vicious', 'enjoyable', 'memorable', 'memorable', 'legendary', 'fellow', 'festive', 'more', 'good', 'bad'];0.2265500992063492
290;Jackblyth8;"life in the mafia as a gangster brings the thought of risk of losing all you own but for many, offers an attractive lifestyle entailing a bundle of all the wants in the world. scorses's film, lasting for 148 minutes, was set to be named 'wise guy' but changed in the last minute to 'goodfellas' and in an interview joe pesci admitted to the director given the actors freedom to improvise, making scenes more realistic and fluent. we begin in 1955, brooklyn and meet henry hill, a young man who has had his eyes on the mafia lifestyle for a long time, he joins the life as a bandit working downtown. henry works for local capo-regime paul cicero and james ""jimmy the gent"" conway, performed by robert de niro, along with fellow gangster tommy de vito, perceived by joe pesci. henry is a very slick, polished looking man, who's nature and look screams confidence, he is extremely assertive but not afraid to get his hands dirty, which appeals to the likes of james and tommy. moving to 1960, henry is embroiled into the nightclub scenery, he is mainly plotted in the 'copacabana' and dates karen friedman a jewish woman, she, at first is worried and concerned about henry's criminal activity but is seduced by his glamorous lifestyle and displaying masculinity. karen is certainly taken on a journey throughout the watch and experiences life as a mistress to a thug, struggling with the difficulties and mental strains it includes. despite karen's parents disapproval she marries henry and the pair have two children of their own. now in 1970, henry, jimmy and tommy are pictured at a bar, seeing billy batts a tough man recently released from prison, consecutively insults tommy, aggravating pesci's character, leading to jimmy and tommy murdering him. the three bury the body in upstate new york, subtly thinking they got away with such a crime, jimmy is informed six months later that that the burial site is slated for development - forcing the group to relocate the corpse. the three were certainly a variation of personalities, jimmy was a reserved type with limited speech, only speaking when was completely necessary, but, when he had to we see him snap and show a brutal side to him which is hinted at in his lack of facial expressions. tommy on the other hand is a bubbly character, the joker of the pack and seems to perform to whoever is in his company, but his dark side shines if any person dares to question him, punishing them through murder ruthlessly. henry's other mistress janice proves an obstacle for karen and in 1974 we see karen harass janice and hold a gun directly at henry threatening him to commit to his 'actual' family - henry moved in with janice despite advice from paul to spend more time with his kids and karen, explaining that he had collected a debt from a gambler in tampa. the gambler's sister turned in henry and jimmy, with the pair being arrested due to the sister being an fbi typist. the pair received 10 years behind bars. this allowed henry to consider his life choices and commitments and almost allowed him to calm down, he understood his obligation to provide for his family so when karen visited, she smuggled drugs into the jail, for a henry to sell to pittsburgh inmates and return money to the family. henry's release in 1978 enforced him to continue his drug business, expanding a cocaine commerce against paul cicero's orders, soon the business involved tommy and jimmy. jimmy organised a raid focusing on the lufthansa vault at jfk airport, stealing million of cash and jewellery, the initial plan was a success but the assembled squad didn't hide the getaway van and it was found by the police, jimmy had everyone involved in the heist killed. henry's voiceover, narrating inside information and truths about the story, states whilst showing a sequence of dead body's that jimmy would've killed them anyway rather than share the profits. the line from the protagonist is soft-spoken and makes us question about tommy, a man also involved in the raid. tommy at this point beloved he was the 'made man' but was shot dead on his way to the ceremony in retribution for batts' murder, significant it was on his way to a ceremony involving a man he murdered. ray liotta captures the stern masterpiece of what it takes to be a bandit, the smooth but scary characterisation shines throughout the film; his character in 1980 struggles from cocaine use and insomnia. being out of control, henry sets up a drug deal with his pittsburgh associates, but the main character is too deep into his profession the police found out, jailing him for a second time. karen, using the money from the business, bailed henry out, but after being under pressure by the police's sudden arrival, she confesses to henry that she flushed $60,000 worth of cocaine down the toilet, in an act to salvage her reputation and remain in custody of her children, this left the family virtually penniless. a combination of both physical and mental pain follow with henry, who experiences pain and anger in the scene, knowing he may have lost it all. henry meets jimmy at a diner in town with talks of a proposed assignment - henry is reluctant to begin with and realises that a jimmy is set to have him and karen killed. henry's failure in the cocaine business and two arrests, not to mention his failure as a husband and father causes him to decide to become an informant with his family in the witness protection program. therefore, having paulie and a jimmy arrested. grateful to be alive, henry is forced out of the gangster life and made to spend time with his family, readjusting to the real world. he narrates at the end of the watch that: "" i am an average nobody. i get to live the rest of my life like a schnook"". the end of titles informs us about unanswered questions, reporting that in 1990 (when the film was released) henry is still a protected witness, but was arrested in seattle 1987 for narcotics conspiracy and given 5 years probation - but clean since then. in 1989 he roy separated from karen after being married for 25 years. paul ""paulie"" cicero died age 73 in prison from respiratory problems and finally, a jimmy was still serving his 20 year life sentence in new york prison for murder, set to be paroled for 2004. he'd be 78 years old. the picture is a textbook scorsese journey, following all aspects of life in the mafia - the insights of pain and anger it can cause, it also the included luxury it can carry. the film's message begs the question what is important in life; it isn't money and glamour, but family. and that the people who care for you and warrant that care to be reciprocated are important. simply brilliant. the picture highlighted on the right from the iconic scene following batts' murder, the casual stop at tommy's mother and the three supplied with a late night meal to interrupt their 'business'.";14 December 2020;9;['own', 'many', 'attractive', 'wise', 'last', 'realistic', 'fluent', 'young', 'long', 'local', 'capo', 'fellow', 'slick', 'polished', 'assertive', 'afraid', 'dirty', 'jewish', 'worried', 'concerned', 'criminal', 'glamorous', 'mental', 'own', 'tough', 'upstate', 'reserved', 'limited', 'necessary', 'brutal', 'facial', 'other', 'bubbly', 'dark', 'other', 'actual', 'more', 'initial', 'dead', 'soft', 'spoken', 'dead', 'significant', 'stern', 'smooth', 'scary', 'main', 'deep', 'second', 'sudden', 'worth', 'physical', 'mental', 'reluctant', 'grateful', 'alive', 'real', 'average', 'unanswered', 'clean', 'respiratory', 'old', 'scorsese', 'important', 'important', 'brilliant', 'iconic', 'casual', 'late'];0.0434251478369125

292;schroeder-gustavo;"goodfellas is what i would call a masterpiece, a wonderful movie and a representation of everything i love about movies. it's a movie i have loved pretty much all my life and i just had the privilege to experience it in a theater, so i'll do my best to explain why goodfellas is not just an ordinary crime film and why it's one of the greatest movies ever made for me. there are so many movies about crime and gangsters and many before goodfellas and this movie is often considered as the best mob movie ever made next to the godfather. one the things that makes goodfellas so good is the way it shows the gangster life and how it can be so attractive. we follow henry hill since he was a kid and he explains throughout his journey how ""being a gangster was better than being president of the united states"" henry never had to wait for anything, he got what he wanted every time and he loved it. he explains how he thought people that worked every day just to get a paycheck had no balls. it's interesting because it shows why so many people join the mob in the first place, no matter how ugly it may seem. but one thing the film never does and it's also a reason why it's so great, is that it never glorifies the life of a gangster. scorsese makes sure the audience feels how filthy and dangerous it is and how awful the people that live it can be. this is something goodfellas excels at. goodfellas is also probably the most fast paced movie i have ever seen. the editing is amazing, but it's never confusing and this movie may be a lot of things but it is certainly not a boring film. it's an extremely entertaining and engaging film. the performances are just amazing and you get to know every main character. joe pesci won the oscar for his performance, of course, but ray liotta and robert de niro are just great in the film. the cinematography is great and the movie just has scorsese written all over it. his directorial choices are so evident in the film and they are beautiful. the combination of soundtrack and the film is beautiful and perfect. i love every bit of the movie but two of my favorite scenes are the steadicam shot when henry takes karen to the copacabana and when robert de niro decides to kill morty with sunshine of your love playing intensely. the fast pacing of the film works very well because if you pay attention, you will realize the pacing gets faster as the movie advances. this is paralleled with how henry starts to lose control over his life through drug addiction, sloppiness (as he gets caught) and cheating on his wife. in the end we realize how deranged these people really are. tommy (pesci) is a psychopath, jimmy (robert de niro) acts as a father figure and close friend to henry most of the film and in the end he tries to get him (and probably his wife, too) killed. henry rats everyone out and he doesn't even feel sorry for it. he feels sorry because he can't live the life anymore. he has to ""wait around like everybody else"" the audience realizes how dull and boring a ""regular"" life can be and we understand why he lived the life he lived. scorsese never tries to moralize the actions of these people, but he makes sure we understand them. for me, the movie is pretty much flawless. you could argue that there are too many freeze frames, but they all work. also, you could argue that it's crazy that henry's character is 21 years old at a point in the film when he looks 40. think about it, though. if it was played with different actors the movie would not have the same effect and it would degrade the film. and remember, the movie plays out over a course of 30 years. this was the best way of shooting the movie. in conclusion, goodfellas is a must watch for any film lover. a classic and a masterpiece. 10/10";5 March 2016;10;['wonderful', 'good', 'ordinary', 'great', 'many', 'many', 'good', 'next', 'good', 'attractive', 'well', 'interesting', 'many', 'first', 'ugly', 'great', 'sure', 'filthy', 'dangerous', 'awful', 'amazing', 'confusing', 'boring', 'entertaining', 'amazing', 'main', 'great', 'great', 'directorial', 'evident', 'beautiful', 'beautiful', 'perfect', 'favorite', 'fast', 'fast', 'close', 'most', 'sorry', 'sorry', 'dull', 'regular', 'sure', 'flawless', 'many', 'crazy', 'old', 'different', 'same', 'good'];0.2622340425531915

295;chvylvr80;goodfellas blows the godfather away. you read that right. the godfather is a bloated, wheezing blob compared to this tight masterpiece. the real jewel of this film is the incredible cast, everyone turning in oscar caliber performances. goodfellas is one of those movies that you can watch hundreds of times and never get sick of it. ray liotta's narration gives you the lay of the land on the story and never grates on your nerves. martin scorcese's direction is a thing of beauty and joe pesci's performance is the best of his career, even considering he played basically the same character in casino. a great soundtrack and dazzling cinematography make this film a national treasure. bottom line: the power of this film cannot be underestimated and i wouldn't be out of line by saying this is scorcese's best film. truly a masterpiece.;16 September 2003;10;['bloated', 'tight', 'real', 'incredible', 'sick', 'good', 'same', 'great', 'national', 'bottom', 'good'];0.3295918367346938
296;RickHarvey;goodfellas, a film that immediately grabs your attention and doesn't let go to the final credits. the film runs for almost two and a halve hours but one would never notice the time racing away due to brilliant structure and narrative. henry's narration gives this film a calming effect, he never shouts he just tells the story as if he being investigated by the cops. with the narrative, the films rolls like a dream. the pacing is perfect and not once do you hang around the same scene. in these two hours, you learn how henry always wanted to be a gangster. he tells you this in the first three minutes of the film. 10 minutes later, he a gangster and from here on, you witness the power and glamour you receive when everyone knows who you are. the acting is brilliant. ray liotta gives a outstanding performance while joe pesci is steals every scene he in . deniro role is not as large as one would like but he still gives a strong presence. the art design is another brilliant achievement . the world around you is portrayed perfectly that you can't help but be dragged into the setting. this is also helped by the directing which brings great style and editing that the film is like a dream. overall, a great film;14 August 2010;8;['final', 'brilliant', 'perfect', 'same', 'first', 'brilliant', 'outstanding', 'large', 'strong', 'brilliant', 'great', 'great'];0.5581349206349207

301;Kubris;"imdb top 250: 15 goodfellas is one of the best films ever. it's dramatic, charming, crazy and even a bit funny. chronicling the rise and fall of wiseguy henry hill from the 50's to the 80's, goodfellas is the best look at mob life... after the godfather. this is scorcese's best work that i have seen. the plot can be summarized very easily: henry hill wants to be a gangster, and when he becomes one he lives the life, good and bad. a biography like this could be shown in an average way, but it has the scorcese touch. the presentation of goodfellas is, in my opinion the most interesting and engaging in film. period music plays throughout, hill and karen narrate with charm, and the pacing is perfect. goodfellas doesn't have a dull moment. the characters are top-notch cinema, interesting and flawed. hill, our anti-hero, is a charming irish-italian nobody who becomes a somebody. he looks cool, talks cool, and acts cool, until he gets in over his head with products and problems. jimmy conwa is the high roller, stuffing everyone's pockets with money, playing it cool until his neck is on the line. and tommy, dear volatile tommy, whose voice and actions steal the show, is an italian fireball who is unpredictable. all expertly acted, these are the guys you wish you could be. karen is also well-acted, from innocence to involvement. the entire cast of goodfellas are personalities. this film has its share of incredible cinematic moments. from the pistol-whipping to the montage of deaths, every scene is crafted with care. two in particular have stood above the rest though: the famous ""how am i funny?"" speech, a highlight of the rapid-fire dialogue, and the long shoot, showing henry and karen's date from a single perspective. genius directing. the mood is wonderful, helped profusely by the music. starting with oldies to show the golden age of gangsters, the music progresses in the same direction as the plot. it's unbelievable. when you hear songs from the movie, you think of goodfellas. i hated 'sunshine of your love' until goodfellas, and when i hear it now i think of jimmy conway, smoking his cigarette, thinking, as the camera slowly zooms in. a classic, goodfellas has inspired countless films even to this day. every part of this crime masterpiece is top- notch. if you like movies, you have to see this. 9.7/10";22 August 2011;10;['top', 'good', 'dramatic', 'charming', 'crazy', 'funny', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'bad', 'average', 'scorcese', 'interesting', 'perfect', 'dull', 'top', 'interesting', 'flawed', 'anti', 'hero', 'charming', 'irish', 'italian', 'cool', 'cool', 'cool', 'high', 'cool', 'dear', 'volatile', 'italian', 'unpredictable', 'entire', 'incredible', 'cinematic', 'particular', 'famous', 'funny', 'rapid', 'long', 'single', 'wonderful', 'golden', 'same', 'unbelievable', 'countless', 'notch'];0.2228392857142857

304;FilmSnobby;"overrated in 1990, *goodfellas* has grown even more overrated with the passage of 15 years. it's based on the -- i daresay -- untrustworthy recollections of a half-irish, half-sicilian mobster-turned-informant who recently, i am reliably informed, appears as an addled, half-witted guest on ""the howard stern show"". the narrative arc, if one can accurately term it that, spans 30 years, roughly from 1950 to 1980. this, of course, gives martin scorsese every incentive to soak the background with dozens of pop-culture tunes ranging from bobby vinton to derek and the dominoes. his use of the last 3 lilting minutes of ""layla"" as some sort of ironic counterpoint in the extended montage that reveals the corpses of a dozen gruesomely executed mobsters in various places across new york city only underscores his utterly conventional taste in music. one wonders whether scorsese would've been happier as a top 40 deejay instead of a filmmaker. his conventionality -- a surprising development, given his success with such seventies classics as *mean streets* and *taxi driver*, both infused with his uniquely individual aesthetic -- extends beyond the soundtrack to the actual movie itself. lovers of this movie will doubtless be distressed to learn that the various stylistic techniques scorsese uses here -- whip-pans, sudden freezes that supposedly add ironic punctuation to the narrative, even the use of pop music as commentary on a montage -- all derive from french (yes, i said french) auteurs from the new wave school of the sixties and seventies. these same lovers of this movie would probably also consider orson welles to be an overrated old fuddy-duddy, but that doesn't stop scorsese from pointlessly laying on at least two sequences of long tracking-shots through complicated spatial arrangements without cuts, the device welles perfected if not wholly invented. (an even less impressive feat for scorsese, who benefits from the technological advance of the steadicam. welles did it with old-fashioned cameras on dollies and hydraulic cranes.) i believe that all these borrowings betray scorsese's fundamental, perhaps unconscious, lack of confidence in the power of his story, here. for the screenplay, let it be said at once, is poorly constructed. the narrative focuses on trivial events, like a gofer getting shot in the foot during a card game or paul sorvino slicing garlic to atomic thinness, and then presents the world-famous lufthansa heist through hearsay. the movie's main character, ray liotta as henry hill, hears a news report about the heist while in the shower. one may reasonably ask why we're in the shower with henry when we should be in the getaway car with robert de niro's jimmy conway and his henchmen. this, of course, leads one to reasonably ask why we're not watching a movie about jimmy conway instead of henry hill, the latter being, more often than not, on the periphery of the movie's main events. having liotta narrate the exciting stuff for us in voice-over is no substitute. indeed, the movie is cripplingly dependent on voice-over narration, perhaps because mr. hill's own story, in and of itself, isn't interesting enough to really warrant a honest-to-goodness movie in the first place. as the movie drones on with liotta's loquacious narrator ceaselessly filling in the narrative gaps, one suspiciously wonders -- for example -- why hill and conway are not whacked for bumping off ""made man"" billy bats, while joe pesci's tommy does get whacked. all three men were involved in the killing, yet only tommy pays the price. why? does conway's and hill's irishness serve as a magical force-field? -- i don't get it. well, i did say at the beginning of this review that hill was an untrustworthy storyteller. from the evidence, it appears that hill was quite conversant with his mob boss's cooking techniques (hence all the time wasted on cooking scenes and shots of gorgeously laid-out family feasts) and far less conversant with the important incidents that are the subject of this film. note too how inconsistently handled henry's character is throughout the film: one moment he pistol-whips almost to death a sexual predator who messes with his girlfriend, the next he's aghast when some punk kid gets carelessly killed. hmm -- smells like self-hagiography to me. after an overly-edited, chaotic, 30-minute final act in which a sweaty-faced, puffy-eyed liotta drives around the suburbs, peering up through his windshield at police helicopters, dropping off hot guns, going to the grocery store, zipping back home to make meatballs (again with the cooking!), and so forth, he gets pinched for good. under the umbrella of the witness protection program, he finally rats out his mob bosses . . . and it occurs to us that this should have been the focus of the film all along, i.e., the fbi's successful eroding of the criminal code using witness protection. but scorsese crams it in during the last five minutes of this 3-hour movie. a little less time in the kitchen and in the shower, and a little more time getting down to business, might have made this movie pretty great. as it is, the performers give *goodfellas* undeniable energy, almost mitigating all its flaws. fans of good new york actors will forgive this movie everything: liotta, de niro, pesci, sorvino, and lorraine bracco do their job, at least. and perhaps this is why the movie is so well-loved. colorful characters limned by great performances are entertaining. but, in my judgment, the virtues of verisimilitude can't overcome what amounts to a 3-hour-long non-story. 3 stars out of 10.";25 November 2005;3;['overrated', 'untrustworthy', 'half', 'irish', 'half', 'addled', 'stern', 'narrative', 'pop', 'last', 'lilting', 'ironic', 'extended', 'various', 'conventional', 'happy', 'top', 'surprising', 'such', 'individual', 'actual', 'distressed', 'various', 'stylistic', 'scorsese', 'sudden', 'ironic', 'derive', 'french', 'french', 'new', 'same', 'overrated', 'old', 'scorsese', 'long', 'complicated', 'spatial', 'impressive', 'technological', 'old', 'fashioned', 'hydraulic', 'fundamental', 'unconscious', 'trivial', 'atomic', 'famous', 'main', 'jimmy', 'latter', 'main', 'exciting', 'dependent', 'own', 'interesting', 'honest', 'first', 'loquacious', 'narrative', 'only', 'magical', 'untrustworthy', 'conversant', 'conversant', 'important', 'sexual', 'next', 'aghast', 'chaotic', 'final', 'puffy', 'eyed', 'hot', 'successful', 'criminal', 'scorsese', 'last', 'little', 'less', 'little', 'more', 'great', 'undeniable', 'good', 'lorraine', 'least', 'colorful', 'great', 'entertaining', 'long', 'non'];0.1655293536872484

317;marissas75;"""goodfellas"" is a superb movie presenting an amoral and very real-seeming portrait of the mafia. where ""the godfather"" limits itself to a sepia palette and a somber tone, ""goodfellas"" is brash, busy, and captures both the humor and the horror of a mobster's life. nor do the goodfellas pretend to have noble motivations. instead, they're a bunch of power-hungry guys who band together for protection but double-cross each other at the first opportunity. many admit to a compulsive love for crime, including robber jimmy conway (robert de niro) and, especially, the unhinged, trigger-happy tommy devito (joe pesci). tommy and jimmy are the closest associates of henry hill (ray liotta), the movie's narrator and main character: all are mid-level mob guys who start out around the same time. henry is half-irish, so he knows that the mafia will never fully welcome him. this outsider quality complicates his personality and makes him an ideal narrator. ""goodfellas"" runs on style and atmosphere rather than a linear plot. the first hour culminating in the famous long-take at the copacabana nightclubshows the glamorous appeal of the mob lifestyle for young henry. it's the rat pack early sixties, and america and the mob are still somehow innocent. as we follow henry into the late sixties and beyond, the mob becomes more insular and a parody of what it once was. the women have tacky outfits and hard-edged faces; the men's crimes get bigger. henry gets involved in drug dealing, and his wife karen (lorraine bracco) turns from a tough-but-sweet jewish girl into a full- fledged mafia wife. the best part of the movie is the virtuoso, suspenseful, darkly funny sequence (it could almost stand on its own as a short film) where henry's responsibilities as mobster and family man threaten to overwhelm him. in the course of a single day, he must keep his drug smuggling, mafia connections, large extended family, and mistress under control, while trying to evade a helicopter that seems to be following him. the editing and music perfectly recreate henry's jittery, cocaine-fueled paranoia. indeed, ""goodfellas"" has probably the best compilation soundtrack that i've ever heard: each song perfectly fits. there is always so much going on at once in ""goodfellas""music, narration, dialogue, camera movements and imagesthat boredom is not an option and dazzling moments come frequently. and its ambivalent moral perspective (should we love these men and their lifestyle, or hate them?) gives you something to think about after the pop songs and shootings have ended.";23 June 2007;10;['amoral', 'seeming', 'somber', 'brash', 'busy', 'noble', 'hungry', 'double', 'other', 'first', 'many', 'compulsive', 'unhinged', 'happy', 'close', 'main', 'mid', 'level', 'same', 'irish', 'ideal', 'linear', 'first', 'famous', 'long', 'glamorous', 'young', 'early', 'innocent', 'late', 'insular', 'tacky', 'big', 'tough', 'sweet', 'jewish', 'good', 'virtuoso', 'suspenseful', 'funny', 'own', 'short', 'single', 'large', 'extended', 'good', 'much', 'dazzling', 'ambivalent', 'moral'];0.2116363211951447
318;rmarkd;"i live in emeryville, california (near sf, ca, which is more well known than emeryville), and one of my favorite ways to spend a couple of hours is to head over to everett&jones for ribs and watch goodfellas. from the beginning, it draws you in to the mafia life following henry hill (ray liotta) rise from childhood dreams of being a gangster along with jimmy conway (robert deniro), and tommy devito (joe pesci in an amazing role). from the beginning, scorsese captures the romance and logic of being a gangster. young henry hill saw the beauty of it all. ""it was out of respect"" he says, when kids carried his mother's groceries all the way home for her. ""it was better than being president"", he says. and why not? gangsters seemed immune to police, law, having to pay bills. that's the beauty that draws you in. pesci plays the role of a hot-tempered gangster which is robin hood on-target. you can tell early on that this is a man who probably got stepped on when younger, and craved the respect given to gangsters. that makes him the most volatile of the trio since he constantly wants the respect from everyone, but sometimes doesn't command it. deniro is, not surprisingly, great as jimmy conway, but between the central role that liotta has and the character pesci plays, deniro's character doesn't really stand out. that's not to say deniro didn't play the character well, just that the nature of his character, imo, wasn't meant to stick out. the music is a wonderful complement to the story. the fluid camera shots are amazing, especially after multiple viewings. there's one in particular where it follows henry and karen on their first real date. it's amazing. there's also another scene where the piano exit of layla plays in the background. it's one of my favorites in the movie. geez, what else can be said. great acting by everyone. the story flows like water. the characters are drawn perfectly and have a depth. you feel the rationale of these gangsters and even find yourself siding with them. no scene is wasted. this is easily a 10/10, and to some extent, makes me rethink some other movies that i've rated a 9 or 10. taking from spinal tap, this movie should be an 11. it is on my top 5 list of favorite movies. i liked it more than the godfather (it's close, though). i've seen it a dozen times and it loses nothing with each subsequent viewing. if anything, it gains more and more of my admiration.";27 May 2001;10;['favorite', 'amazing', 'scorsese', 'well', 'immune', 'young', 'volatile', 'great', 'central', 'wonderful', 'fluid', 'amazing', 'multiple', 'particular', 'first', 'real', 'amazing', 'great', 'other', 'spinal', 'top', 'favorite', 'more', 'close', 'subsequent', 'more'];0.3995614035087719

324;Mnemosyne15;to some extent, the most successful part of the film is its self-confidence in dealing with the rhythm and theme given by its authenticity.its authenticity extends to the protagonist henry's intention to join the gang, the desire for material desires, and a primitive and unadorned violent worship. at the same time, the unhappiness of family life gave him a desire to be recognized and recognized. regarding his enthusiastic pursuit of self-worth recognition, he stuck his face to the window and looked at the people across the street. since then, the whole film has always been compact, from his stepping into the den across the street to becoming one of them. then met tommy and jimmy, and then went to commit crimes, start a family, commit a major crime, and finally went to jail, pleaded guilty, and assisted the police to confess other associates, and was included in the witness protection plan. from an outsider's perspective, i can't find the climax of the film. some people say that the climax is henry's imprisonment, but i think scorsese will not be too interested in the popular theme of punishing evil and doing good. from the perspective of the dictator, the climax of the film should be the most popular part of the three brothers' illegal business. since the killing of tommy, the film has reached an inevitable ending.;14 March 2020;8;['successful', 'primitive', 'unadorned', 'violent', 'same', 'enthusiastic', 'worth', 'whole', 'compact', 'major', 'guilty', 'other', 'interested', 'popular', 'popular', 'illegal', 'inevitable'];0.1026785714285714
325;ereinion;"what is the formula behind making the perfect gangster movie? it has to be long, short gangster movies seldom work. there has to be a wide variety of characters, movies like ""the hoodlum"" were dull because there were only a few main characters there. here even the minor characters are well developed, enough to catch your eye. and last, it has to show some violence but in moderate quantities. there is some violence here, most notably in the ""billy batts scene"", but it never overflows, ""casino"" had far more violent scenes than this film. if there is no violence whatsoever, then the movie can't be an effective gangster/mafia movie. but what is perhaps most appealing with this film is that, in contrast to movies like the godfather trilogy, scarface and casino, this movie is based 100% on real events and characters. only a few names are altered, the rest is all authentic.robert de niro again delivers, even though i think he has been somewhat miscast as jimmy (burke) conway. jimmy the gent was irish-american and even though deniro is part irish himself, he doesn't look like a typical irish-american. burke was also a tall and imposing man, unlike deniro and he always chomped on a cigar. doesn't help that deniro also has that unmistakable italian-american drawl: ""wats da madda wit u?"" pesci is just incredible and a delight to watch, despite playing a very unsympathetic character. liotta fits his part perfectly as well and what i liked here is that they show his corruption by the mob world that embraced him in the beginning. if he had been shown as just some innocent naive sweet guy, it wouldn't look authentic, would it? several scenes have since become classics, deservedly so. the ""shinebox scene"" aka billy batts scene is perhaps the most unforgettable, but also the ""funny guy scene"". elizabeth bracco, even though not my favorite actress, offers a strong supporting role as mrs. henry hill, the headstrong and hot tempered karen. paul sorvino is also marvelous in his somewhat restricted but pivotal part as henry's close friend and first mentor paulie cicero. frank sivero from ""godfather ii"" is a welcome sight and his character is like a counterpart to pesci's, a silent and unintentionally humorous sidekick. scorsese scored big with this big screen adaptation of one of the most intriguing real-life mafia stories. this remains one of his crowning achievements.";4 November 2011;10;['perfect', 'long', 'short', 'wide', 'dull', 'few', 'main', 'minor', 'enough', 'moderate', 'batts', 'violent', 'effective', 'appealing', 'real', 'few', 'miscast', 'irish', 'american', 'irish', 'typical', 'irish', 'tall', 'unmistakable', 'italian', 'incredible', 'unsympathetic', 'innocent', 'naive', 'sweet', 'authentic', 'several', 'unforgettable', 'funny', 'favorite', 'strong', 'hot', 'marvelous', 'restricted', 'pivotal', 'close', 'first', 'welcome', 'silent', 'humorous', 'big', 'big', 'intriguing', 'real'];0.1961382113821138

336;Sfpsycho415;i once read a story about martin scorsese's battle with cocaine addiction and how robert de niro saved his life one way or another by visiting him in the hospital and convincing him to get back to work and make raging bull. i started to think that if it wasn't for that, we may never have seen goodfellas. so if the above is true, thank you bobby and marty for making it possible. goodfellas is one of the very best movies i have ever seen. it's story, it's dialouge, it's visual style, and it's characters force us to sit up and pay attention to the story of a guy who as far back as he could remember always wanted to be a gangster. in what should have been an oscar-winning performance (more on that later), ray liotta delivers as henry hill, a half-irish half-italian new yorker who joins the local mob and is introduced to a life most people never have the chance to live. he meets a pretty but fiery woman named karen (lorraine bracco), makes best friends jimmy (robert de niro) and tommy (joe pesci), and becomes a mob saint when he helps pull off a multi-million dollar heist. slowly but surely, however, the good life turns sour as he cheats on his wife, the heist eventually costs him everything he has and some very dear friends, and he is forced to testify against the people who gave him so much and enter witness protection. martin scorsese moves the story along with quick pace, by using hilarious, violent, and emotional scenes alternately. we see hill's life deteriorate by keeping the glamour and the women at the beginning and the addictions and paranoia towards the end. it is an absolute shame that this film didn't win best director (which scorsese should have one countless times by now), let alone best picture, actor, supporting actress, and adapted screenplay. this is the reason i don't care for the oscars anymore. one thing the academy did do right is give joe pesci the best supporting actor award. never has a character been so funny and so terrifying all in the same film. pesci was another reason the 2 and a half hour film goes by in a snap. goodfellas, in my opinion, is even better than the godfather. while the godfather may have marlon brando's brilliant performance and more visually pleasing locations, goodfellas is a true gangster picture based on reality and more adaptable to modern times. it is not only a classic, it is a masterpiece. 10/10;29 July 2003;10;['above', 'true', 'possible', 'good', 'dialouge', 'visual', 'half', 'irish', 'half', 'italian', 'new', 'local', 'most', 'pretty', 'fiery', 'good', 'multi', 'good', 'sour', 'dear', 'quick', 'hilarious', 'violent', 'emotional', 'absolute', 'good', 'countless', 'good', 'funny', 'same', 'half', 'well', 'brilliant', 'pleasing', 'true', 'adaptable', 'modern'];0.2006565656565656

348;tml_pohlak_13;"to be frank, ""goodfellas"" is probably the best crime movie ever made. it is more than just a movie; it tells a captivating tale; it is perfectly cast; scorsese's direction is at its utmost brilliance. in fact, i'd venture to say that ""goodfellas"" far surpasses what francis ford coppola's much-loved ""the godfather"" has to offer. in the first place, the entire sympathy for the characters of ""the godfather"" depended on portraying them more as a dysfunctional family. this is not what a crime film should be. a crime film should be about *crime*, not men in tight suits pledging loyalty to each other. the characters of ""goodfellas"" are, above all, gangsters. as a matter of fact, one of the very first lines is ""as far back as i can remember, i always wanted to be a gangster"". at the same time, however, martin scorsese does not glorify violence. he does not overemphasize blood spattering or disturbing death sequences. the violence here is realistic, precisely because it's cold, cruel, and emotionless. as a result, this film is one of the more realistic, plausible, and believable crime films out there. another thing that is better about ""goodfellas"" is its length, 146 minutes compared to ""the godfather""'s 175. that might not seem like much at first, but think about it. that's just short of a half-hour. ""the godfather"", as is, could've easily been trimmed down by an hour. that can't be said about ""goodfellas"". things just happen in the film; it's interesting all the way, even during its more contemplative parts. additionally, the characters of ""goodfellas"" are really compelling, but i will avoid going in-depth here. martin scorsese is, as i've mentioned, at the top of his game when directing ""goodfellas"". one particular shot near the end stands out. scorsese makes use of the (as i like to call it) ""vertigo effect"" (ie zooming in while tracking backwards; the characters in the foreground remain approx. the same size while there is a significant shift in the background). this shot has been overused to the point of becoming cliche, yet it works effectively here. this is just one instance of scorsese's fantastic work on this film. he constantly keeps the audience engaged in the film and the characters. in the blink of an eye, a scene can shift from comedic to horrific. yet such transitions never seem jarring or awkwardly paced. one more thought about the film: the upbeat soundtrack that accompanies ""goodfellas"" is actually really well pulled off. whenever a song plays, it fits in perfectly with the action, both in melody and lyrics. the verdict: this is what a crime film should be all about: realistic, entertaining, gripping.

397;PartyGirlSkank;"goodfellas is one of the most iconic films of all-time. it's often listed as one of the greatest movies of all-time and the famous ""funny guy"" scene has been parodied countless times. it struck a huge impact on the genre and influenced countless gangster films that came after it. but why is that? let's find out! firstly, the story and how it's told. while the story in goodfellas about the rise and fall of a gangster is nothing new, it's the way that scorsese tells the story that makes it so compelling. the movie opens immediately with henry, jimmy, and tommy driving late at night in the highway and then stopping their car to check their trunk and then... it turns out that there's a guy who's all bloodied up there and then tommy stabs the guy a few times and jimmy finishes him off by shooting him at point blank and then boom! the movie starts and it never slows down. what's so effective about this opening is that it immediately grabs your attention. we don't start out with any boring exposition dialogue, we get thrown right in the middle of the murder and it makes the audience want to find out why they killed this guy. it's a brilliant opening scene and it's one of the greatest in all of cinema in my opinion. the rest of the film goes through the life of henry hill from his teenage years working at a mafia-owned cabstand to dealing drugs behind their back at a brisk, fast pace. this movie has a lot of plot and it could've been really long and boring if it was made by a weaker director but scorsese keeps the plot going at a fast pace and uses a lot of interesting shooting and editing choices to keep the film interesting. the first half of the film shows the positive side of being a mobster as we get to see henry take karen to the copacabana, steal trucks, rob an airport, and beat the snot out of a man for touching his girl. a lot of people say that this film glamorizes the lifestyle of a gangster from watching this half but i think it's necessary because it makes it believable why henry would want to join the mob in the first place and it makes the audience enjoy the lifestyle while watching it. the thing that makes this part of the film so enjoyable is how fast-paced it is. we go through all this plot and information in a fast-paced manner so we never get bored in such a long film. also, the shooting and editing in this film is excellent. scorsese shot and edited this film with a sense of intensity and it works because it keeps the audience interested rather than if they just used flat, static shots the entire time like the star wars prequel. the second half is when the sh!t starts hitting the fan. this is the part in the film where things start going really bad for the characters. tommy gets whacked for killing billy batts, henry gets arrested for dealing drugs, and jimmy becomes a paranoid wreck over an airport robbery and starts killing members of his crew out of fear of them leading him to his demise. what's so great about this part of the film is that you really feel the fear and anxiety the characters are feeling. when henry gets released from prison and gets really paranoid about getting whacked for dealing drugs, you feel the same way because you care about his character. it's quite an accomplishment to make you feel for a mobster/drug dealer. i haven't talked about the performances yet so i might as well here. ray liotta is really underrated in this film. he plays henry as a douchebag and not a nice guy but we do see his humanity when he sees tommy murdering people. he makes us both pity him when he's caught dealing drugs and find him despicable when he's cheating on karen and it's sad that when people talk about this movie, they never bring up his performance because he's actually really great in this film. robert de niro is the middle ground character of the trio. he's not as violent as tommy but he doesn't have as much of a conscience as henry and he plays it well, showing both the ruthless gangster side as well as the respectable side. the actor who gets the most attention for this film is joe pesci. he plays tommy as an explosive, violent psychopath who would kill you just for looking at him the wrong way and yet, he's still really funny because of the way he talks. he's a joy to watch in this film! lastly, i want to bring up scorsese's choice of music in this film. the music he chooses in this movie consists mainly of 70's rock & roll and pop music and they fit with every scene in this movie. when henry's dating karen, bobby vinton's roses are red and it helps in creating a romantic scene. when henry's snorting coke, a rock and roll song abruptly comes on and it fits in with the intensity the character's feeling. all in all, the music choices in this movie were great and i suggest you to go buy the soundtrack. overall, the amazing direction, shooting, editing, acting, pacing, and music choices all add up to making one of the greatest films of all- time. i'm gonna give it a 10/10.";31 August 2013;8;['iconic', 'great', 'famous', 'funny', 'countless', 'huge', 'countless', 'new', 'compelling', 'tommy', 'few', 'blank', 'effective', 'boring', 'brilliant', 'great', 'teenage', 'brisk', 'fast', 'long', 'boring', 'weak', 'fast', 'interesting', 'interesting', 'first', 'positive', 'necessary', 'believable', 'first', 'enjoyable', 'bored', 'long', 'excellent', 'scorsese', 'interested', 'flat', 'static', 'entire', 'prequel', 'second', 'bad', 'paranoid', 'great', 'paranoid', 'same', 'underrated', 'nice', 'despicable', 'sad', 'great', 'middle', 'violent', 'much', 'ruthless', 'respectable', 'most', 'explosive', 'violent', 'wrong', 'funny', 'red', 'romantic', 'great', 'amazing', 'great'];0.1466720779220779

402;abum190;"and yet the ending felt like a copout, an anticlimactic way for the filmmakers to get out of coming up with something better. this movie deserved a great ending, and it got a quick job instead. but maybe that's as it should be. maybe there was no better way to end this incredible movie. it's a true story, so obviously the movie had to end a certain way. however, considering the talent involved, you'd expect something more. but however much i didn't like the ending was a quarter of how much i liked the rest of the movie. maybe this isn't how the mob actually works, but the way martin scorcese films it seems about as realistic as a movie could get. the narrator takes us into the inner workings of the mob, explaining how everything is done and what everyone's job is. of course, that would mean nothing without good characters, and the main character, henry hill (ray liotta), is a great one. not a great person, mind you; he's wanted to be in the mob all his life and the movie chronicles all sorts of nasty things he and his colleagues do to other people. but the character is great, partially because liotta is so magnetizing. one of my friends thinks liotta is the worst in the movie, but i don't think so. we see everything from his perspective, so we actually don't see a whole lot of him. but when we do, the movie is on. joe pesci and robert de niro give good performances as hill's best friends, and pesci deserved his oscar for being a hothead that causes the mob a lot of trouble. but i really think liotta takes the best performance in the movie and his was definitely an underrated one. lorraine bracco is also effective and versatile as hill's wife. the two of them are more than convincing from beginning to end and the movie would not be the same without them. martin scorcese has made a brilliant movie, never boring, always alive. he's obviously a master director, but that darn endingmaybe the next time i see the movie the ending won't bug me so much. maybe i'm overreacting. i certainly wouldn't want my qualms about the resolution to keep anyone from seeing such an incredible film.";4 October 2006;9;['anticlimactic', 'well', 'great', 'quick', 'well', 'incredible', 'true', 'certain', 'more', 'much', 'much', 'realistic', 'inner', 'good', 'main', 'great', 'great', 'nasty', 'other', 'great', 'magnetizing', 'bad', 'whole', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'underrated', 'effective', 'versatile', 'same', 'brilliant', 'boring', 'alive', 'next', 'incredible'];0.3150352733686067

406;Bevan - #4;"chalk me up as another reviewer who found this movie to be vastly overrated. my wife and i saw it a couple nights ago, for the first time, and it just pales in comparison to cinematic triumphs such as the godfather movies or the sopranos. as much as anything else, there are no likable characters. part of the reason you could keep turning in to the sopranos is that you could genuinely like and identify with the principals, despite their brutality and crimes. here, you can't. none of the principals have any displayed virtues: at best, they're shallow and two-dimensional. yes, the highly lauded soundtrack has many tunes. but if you're going to use the hoary old tactic of advancing pop tunes down the years to denote the march of time, could you not be so flamingly anachronistic as all of that? they were playing 40s tunes in the doo-wop era, 50s doo-wop post-british invasion, 60s psychedelic pop in the 70s, and early eric clapton in the disco era. get the freaking dates right. speaking of anachronisms, the film's jammed with them, and while it's superficially a glittering, gritty portrait of the wiseguy life and the wiseguy era, the goofs just overload. cars too late for the year. phones too late for the year. livery too late for the year. did scorsese bother at all with accuracy and continuity, or did they just say ""eh, get an old looking car out there."" it pains me to read about how exacting and painstaking deniro was to get every aspect of jimmy's personality true to life, exactly how the real jimmy burke did, in the middle of a blizzard of anachronisms. most damning, there's just no dramatic tension. there's little by way of plot, little by way of suspense. the actors did good jobs with the material and direction they were given, but that's not remotely enough to sustain this seriously overrated flick. 5/10.";20 October 2015;5;['overrated', 'first', 'cinematic', 'such', 'likable', 'good', 'shallow', 'dimensional', 'many', 'hoary', 'old', 'anachronistic', 'post', 'british', 'psychedelic', 'early', 'jammed', 'gritty', 'scorsese', 'old', 'painstaking', 'true', 'real', 'damning', 'dramatic', 'little', 'little', 'good', 'enough', 'overrated'];0.1129166666666666
407;MyDarkStar;"the only thing keeping this movie from being known as scorsese's crowning achievement is that other movie he made known as ""raging bull"". i have read many times how ""raging bull"" was the greatest movie of the 80's. that's probably true. this is possibly the greatest movie of the 90's (definitely in the top 3). the thing that makes this movie so attractive to me is that scorsese didn't set out to make another ""godfather"". this isn't about mafia kings, or crime lords. this is about the lower level of people who are the ""soldiers"". these are the people who are several levels down from don corleone. hence, the tone of the movie is much more raw, and violent. scorsese pays attention to every little detail in this movie. he uses so many different aspects of cinema in order to turn what may be a typical scene into something that you always remember. examples of this include the brilliant camera work through the back entrance of the nightclub ; freeze frames that are accompanied with interesting narrative ; great shifts in scenes that highlight twists in the characters' minds. it is as though scorsese had a whole bag of tricks that he was picking from to put into this movie - and they all work perfectly. the soundtrack is implemented brilliantly. in some cases it places an exclamation point on a dramatic scene (when the opening chords of cream's ""sunshine of your love"" play as the camera centers on james conway you know something bad is going to be happening soon). in other cases it is used to give the viewer a sense of a time period (50's, 60's, 70's etc). scorsese even shows the same scene twice from two different angles just to illustrate two different points of view...brilliant ! i could go on forever about this movie...but that would be ridiculous. the best way to illustrate just how brilliant scorsese is, is to point out that this isn't even considered his best movie by many !!!!!";4 December 2001;10;['only', 'other', 'known', 'many', 'great', 'true', 'great', 'attractive', 'low', 'several', 'raw', 'violent', 'little', 'many', 'different', 'typical', 'brilliant', 'back', 'interesting', 'great', 'whole', 'dramatic', 'bad', 'other', 'same', 'different', 'different', 'brilliant', 'ridiculous', 'good', 'brilliant', 'good', 'many'];0.2108874198717948
408;kuner-59029;upon rewatching the movie, i realized two things. one, the performances by everyone, down to the smallest role, are stellar and memorable. joe pesci stands out in what may be one of the most despicable characters ever to grace the big screen. he plays a thin skinned maniac who readily kills people over as much as a misunderstanding. that is the general jist of the movie. life is cheap in the mafia. people get whacked all the time. even the suspicion that someone may talk is a death sentence. the movie does a fantastic job portraying life in the mafia. the hierarchies, the shady dealings over meatballs with marinara sauce and the casual conversations between the wives about people getting shot. scorcese's direction is assured as ever, the sets and production design are spot on, and the trademark montages make the movie pass quicker than its 2 1/2 hour runtime would make you think. but it's still a long movie. and that's where point number two comes in: the movie lacks narrative focus. for most of the runtime, you don't know where the movie is going. it's a collection of montages, monologues, gory killings, but there's no narrative thrust. the movie meanders along until things inevitably fall apart towards the end, but the various happenings never really feel like they have anything to do with each other. we don't see the big heist, we don't get any foreshadowing of the turn at the end, we don't see the effects that the intro scene has on the mafia. 90% of the movie is people in rooms talking, drinking and either introducing themselves or talking about events we never see. there's way too much expository dialogue. it's still a fine movie, deserving to be seen at least once, even if it's not one of the all time greats.;4 September 2021;8;['small', 'stellar', 'memorable', 'despicable', 'big', 'thin', 'skinned', 'much', 'general', 'cheap', 'fantastic', 'shady', 'casual', 'long', 'narrative', 'most', 'narrative', 'various', 'other', 'big', 'much', 'expository', 'fine', 'least'];0.0467592592592592

412;Strider_1978;"ok, i'm not going to spend a long time on this film, mainly because i'm about to watch it again and i wanted to slip in a quick review. this film, basically follows the 'business' of a new york mafia. the 'goodfellas'. the rise and fall of henry hill, whose story is told visually and in a narration by actor ray liotta throughout the film. it's one of these motion visuals and scripts that has gone down in history because of how good it is. people, to this day quote from it after sixteen years, and it will continue to have longevity. the cast, is superb, with de niro and pesci co starring along side liotta, the films main focus. with lorraine braco and a host of other stellar actors to keep us not just interested, but entertained. it's a very violent and profane mob movie. i am the kind of movie viewer that does not honestly care for too much language and violence. i can live with it if it is within the context of the story. i am a taranino fan because of the sheer style more than what is depicted of the adult nature. i would go as far as to say that most of the most renowned scenes in movie history are in restaurants: casablanca, reservoir dogs, pulp fiction, when harry met sally, heat etc etc. this film is certainly no exception. ""what do you mean i'm funny, funny how? like i'm some kind of clown, i'm here to amuse you??"" (bringing some of the lines together without the language). i honestly could do without the f word as frequently as it appears, but i understand that it was a part of mob everyday life in it's frequency so i accept it. the violence is nasty, but there is no cotton wool padding in mob hits. all in all, this film is a must watch, and a must own for the movie fan with broad tastes. it is worth owning as part of a collection just to see what is arguably pesci's best scripted performance.

413;dragonshield;"""goodfellas"" is martin scorsese's highest ranked movie over at imdb. i had never seen it before 2 days ago and to be honest it wasn't what i expected it to be. don't get me wrong, it is all in all a great movie, but like scorsese's movies usually it's over-hyped. ""goodfellas"" is based on a true story and it tells a story about henry hill who grows up to be a gangster, a part of the mob. along with his friends, other wiseguys tommy devito and jimmy conway, the movie tells about how organized the mafia really is and follows the rise and fall of henry hill from the beginning till the end. the movie progresses very well with the narration of henry hill, who's played by ray liotta. the narration's excellent and keeps the movie going in a good flow with it's precise use of words and witty sarcasm. i've never been so impressed of liotta's performance than i was after this movie, he does his best role performance yet to date and does it by far. liotta evolves the character so realistically, by emotions and doing the whole progress of the character's corruption in a so believable way. the role of tommy devito is played by joe pesci who has always been enjoyable for me, he has that personal voice and essence which can't be compared to any actor. i've never seen joe pesci in such a serious role before and to me he did some fine job in it. he also does his best role performance yet to date. then there's the mighty robert de niro, who plays the role of jimmy conway, and you can't go wrong with de niro now can you? he is perfect for the role and to be honest the whole cast is chosen very specifically, each right actor/actress for the right role. amazing role performances indeed. the screenplay is brilliant, the story in its wholeness is a real treat for you and that's one of the reasons why you can't miss this movie. sadly, the movie suffers from one significant problem; it's too long and that is pretty much the only reason why it doesn't deserve a 10. the first hour goes very smoothly and things keep on going all the time, you don't get bored in any part. after that it kinda stops, i wouldn't say it's downhill after that but i'd say it just stops the whole smoothness and the flow. i hate to say this, but it does get slightly too boring, hence why i said it's too long. i feel so bad because of it as this would have been a perfect movie without it being too long. the second hour just isn't nearly as interesting as the first, a real shame indeed. what comes to direction, well it's scorsese and to me it's pretty much as excellent as it can get. you just have to admire that style of his, being oddly joyful in parts where sadness should take place. the whole soundtrack is also very martin scorsese stylish, not including any beautiful compositions but some really groovy and great tracks, which also play an important role in the whole progress of the movie. ""goodfellas"" is a great movie, but for me personally it was rather disappointing. having an average rating of 8.7 at imdb it should be amazing, shouldn't it? maybe the slight disappointment is because of the movie being over-hyped, yeah, most certainly. despite it being a slight disappointment for me it's still a definite recommendation for all of you who love great movies. you don't have to like mob movies in general, as this movie gives the whole mob thing some real depth in it, giving a realistic sort of an inside-look of it. it's not phenomenal, but it's definitely a great movie.";26 May 2007;8;['high', 'honest', 'wrong', 'great', 'true', 'other', 'excellent', 'good', 'precise', 'witty', 'impressed', 'good', 'whole', 'believable', 'enjoyable', 'personal', 'serious', 'fine', 'good', 'mighty', 'wrong', 'perfect', 'honest', 'whole', 'right', 'right', 'amazing', 'brilliant', 'real', 'significant', 'long', 'only', 'first', 'bored', 'whole', 'boring', 'long', 'bad', 'perfect', 'long', 'second', 'interesting', 'first', 'real', 'scorsese', 'excellent', 'joyful', 'whole', 'beautiful', 'great', 'important', 'whole', 'great', 'disappointing', 'average', 'amazing', 'slight', 'slight', 'definite', 'great', 'general', 'whole', 'real', 'realistic', 'phenomenal', 'great'];0.2954665898617511

421;OllieZ;"to me, this is the best film ever made. a bold statement you may think, but i the minute i saw henry hill utter the famous line of: ""as far back as i can remember, i've always wanted to be a gangster"", followed by the kick of tony bennet's rags to riches, i knew i was in for something special. in the hands of any other director, this could have been a straightforward adaptation of pileggi's ""wise guy"". yet with scorsese, the film is injected with an important dose of life - something i thought was slightly missing from the godfather series. the relationships are so close and warm between these goodfellas, something that was absent from the cold relationships in casino(1995). the actors react well to each other - the main actors being superb. liotta has never been better as he was as henry hill, the man seduced by the mob life. pesci never reached the great heights he did in this film, as the only 5ft5 man i know who can scare me. de niro is doing what he does best, and that is playing the gangster, but in an understated fashion, never going into parody. yet like most good films, it is the small things that make a difference - and there is no exception here. even the minor roles are fully fleshed out, as if there is a life behind the story of hnery hill. like mickey eyes...or anthony...jimmy two times (on the account that he says everything twice). the sheer density of the characters is to be commended. scorsese has the knack of timing his music to the action that occurs on screen. but this isn't just a song played in its entirety (something tarantino would do) - instead scorsese chops and changes his songs, halfway through a scene. take for example the ""1980's"" scenes, where hill is in a fit of paranoia whilst delivering the guns to jimmy and picking up drugs for himself. from the start of this powerful section of the film, we get nilsson's ""jump into the fire"", followed by some muddy waters, mixed in with the stones - to a dizzying effect, until we end this section with ""jump into the fire"" again. pure genius. this is also seen in the ""layla"" montage - the piano exit of eric clapton's layla introducing us to the fall of the gangsters who knew too much about the heist. from the pink cadilac, to the meat locker with frankie carbone in it - it is a beautiful scene, with so many great techniques on offer. i could go on forever with the amount of great scenes in this movie that work with the music (billy batts murder with donovan's atlantis...tracking shot of jimmy with cream's sunshine of my love...) - but that is for you to watch and experience. goodfellas is a film lovers film. it has a great story (great narration too), superb acting from all, beautiful cinematography (copacobana scene comes to mind, also with the visceral tracking shots) and the all seeing eye - scorsese. goodfellas is a film that is as violent as it is funny, a sense of humour in scorsese's work also seen in king of comedy and after hours. this is scorsese's (and in my humble opinion any director's) work. that is something considering how fantastic raging bull and taxi driver are. visceral, violent and film lover's dream.";21 December 2004;10;['good', 'bold', 'famous', 'tony', 'special', 'other', 'straightforward', 'wise', 'important', 'missing', 'close', 'warm', 'absent', 'cold', 'other', 'main', 'superb', 'well', 'great', 'only', 'understated', 'most', 'good', 'small', 'minor', 'sheer', 'tarantino', 'scorsese', 'powerful', 'muddy', 'dizzying', 'pure', 'layla', 'pink', 'beautiful', 'many', 'great', 'great', 'batts', 'great', 'great', 'beautiful', 'visceral', 'scorsese', 'violent', 'funny', 'humble', 'fantastic', 'visceral', 'violent'];0.2901785714285714

""and when the cops, when they assigned a whole army to stop jimmy, what'd he do? he made 'em partners."" goodfellas did many things extremely well. how could anyone like, or even feel sorry for any of the gangsters in this movie? i find myself wondering how that could happen? but that's the genius of this movie, actors, writers, and director. some how it's acceptable to like these characters. yet in reality they are really despicable, violent people. ""...it was among the italians. it was real grease ball sh*t."" goodfellas is based on a true story possibly best known as involving the lufthansa airport heist in 1970. it's told primarily through the eyes of henry hill, who joins up with paul cicero as part of cicero's crew. ""when they found carbone in the meat truck, he was frozen so stiff it took them three days to thaw him out for the autopsy."" the story begins with young henry, who has already figured out that he's going to be a gangster. as the story progresses, henry is taken in by the crew and gains their trust, deservingly so. he eventually meets tommy devito and jimmy conway, partners who hill will be with through the end. materialism is rampant throughout the story, definitely it's a significant icon in this story. they all lead a rather lavish lifestyle, and are all willing to do whatever it takes to maintain it. ultimately as they lifestyles rely more heavily on income and violence, this eventually leads to the crews self-destruction. they have drowned in their own excess.

429;goreilly40;as far back as i can remember, this has been one of my favourite movies. this is a brutally honest and authentic depiction of the mafia in new york and how they got their fingers in every pie available. the story is told mainly through the eyes of henry hill, who we see go from impressionable child to career criminal and finally a beleaguered nervous wreck. ray liotta turns in his best performance in the role, joe pesci likewise as tommy devito is brilliant in his genuinely terrifying performance of the unstable and merciless mobster. robert de niro, although not as psychotic is just as ruthless and frightening in his part as jimmy conway, the mob enforcer who could easily be shaking your hand one minute, then shooting you in the head the next, as shown when he has most of the crew who helped in the lufthansa heist murdered without so much a second thought. the rest of the cast are also brilliant particularly lorraine bracco as the impressionable wife of the mobster who finds herself at first attracted by the life and then terrified of it, and paul sorvino as the ultimate mob boss who can bring people into line with just a look. special mention for frank vincent, who, although not in the movie for very long turns in a memorable performance as billy batts whose arrogance would end up costing him dear. goodfellas shows every aspect of the life of a mobster, including its dark and ugly side which shows how high the price can be for the perceived glamorous lifestyle, so i don't agree with the train of thought that it glamorizes organised crime, and its depiction of the lifestyle is feels very real and authentic. this movie is a definitive movie of the ages and one of the best ever made.;27 August 2017;10;['favourite', 'honest', 'authentic', 'available', 'impressionable', 'criminal', 'beleaguered', 'nervous', 'good', 'brilliant', 'terrifying', 'unstable', 'psychotic', 'ruthless', 'frightening', 'next', 'most', 'second', 'brilliant', 'lorraine', 'impressionable', 'ultimate', 'special', 'frank', 'long', 'memorable', 'dark', 'ugly', 'high', 'glamorous', 'organised', 'real', 'authentic', 'definitive', 'good'];0.1159627329192546

432;DylansFearFiles;"what would it be like to be a foot soldier in the mafia? would it be exciting? would it be frightening? violent even? or would it be a similar lifestyle to what is portrayed in mario puzo's the godfather trilogy? in martin scorsese's mafia classic goodfellas you get an amazing look into the life of a gangster. this is based on the best-selling and critically acclaimed true-crime novel, wiseguy: life in a mafia family by crime reporter nicholas pileggi (who also co-wrote the screenplay with director, martin scorsese) which is the first hand account of irish-italian lucchesse crime family associate turned fbi informant, henry hill. this movie tells the story behind many infamous crimes such as the 1978 $6,000,000 lufthansa air line robbery which led to the murders of ten people. this movie also includes a fabulous rock/pop soundtrack with songs such as the rolling stones' gimme shelter and sid vicious' my way. the story begins as an irish-italian twelve year old boy, henry hill, later played by ray liotta, admires the mafiosi that operate in his neighborhood of brooklyn, new york, including lucchesse crime family caporegime paul 'paulie' cicero (based on paul vario), played by paul sorvino, who soon recruits the teenager into his gang and later becomes a fatherly figure to him. paulie then introduces henry to some of the most violent mobsters in new york city; james 'jimmy the gent' conway and the sociopath tommy devito (based on jimmy burke and tommy desimone), played by robert de niro and joe pesci. the three ""goodfellas"" then begin a twenty-five year rise and fall in mafia hierarchy. this is probably the best mob movie i've ever seen and also has my nomination for a few academy awards! goodfellas is as exciting as movies can get. the violence is very realistic and accelerates the flow of the movie. martin scorsese directs a top-notch cast whose acting is flawless. in goodfellas, joe pesci plays the role of a psychopathic italian mafia triggerman even better than jack nicholson plays the psychotic writer in stanley kubrick's the shining! nobody else in the world knows the mafia underworld better than martin scorsese and nicholas pilleggi. scorsese is truly able to portray the lifestyle of this particular organized crime group. in one scene, martin scorsese perfectly captures the mentality of almost all mafiosi. tommy, henry and numerous other gangsters are seated at a table listening to tommy telling jokes and henry tells tommy that he is a funny guy. an apparently insulted and enraged tommy asks how he is funny. henry begins to show fear as his volatile mafia partner acts more and more aggressive. tommy then reveals he was only kidding with him. henry was obviously afraid tommy would kill him, that's the way it is. later in the movie during a voice over, henry states that ""people would get over arguments over nothing and before you knew it one of them was dead,"" this scene shows the paranoia and fear that all mobsters experience at some point during their careers. in a martin scorsese career profile called scorsese on scorsese, scorsese states that the ""funny guy"" scene in goodfellas is the most realistic segment of any of his mafia pictures. i recommend goodfellas as an outstanding movie to all gangster, true-crime, and biopic film fans. goodfellas is often held as the most authentic film portrayal of life in a mafia family ever captured on screen. if you are interested in watching a good crime-drama; sit back, relax and enjoy! 10/10";29 September 2007;10;['exciting', 'frightening', 'violent', 'similar', 'amazing', 'true', 'first', 'irish', 'italian', 'many', 'infamous', 'such', 'fabulous', 'such', 'rolling', 'sid', 'vicious', 'irish', 'italian', 'old', 'fatherly', 'violent', 'good', 'few', 'exciting', 'realistic', 'top', 'flawless', 'psychopathic', 'italian', 'well', 'psychotic', 'able', 'particular', 'numerous', 'other', 'funny', 'enraged', 'funny', 'volatile', 'aggressive', 'afraid', 'dead', 'scorsese', 'scorsese', 'funny', 'realistic', 'outstanding', 'true', 'authentic', 'interested', 'good'];0.0910714285714285

449;Lunchbox-8;good fellas was directed by master director martin scorcese and is probabaly his best. it tells the story of an irish-italian protaginist, henry hill, who starts out running errands for his friendly mafia neighbours to becoming a made man. it brings us through the traditional and exciting avenues of an italian crime syndicate from the the fifties to the eighties. the cast is also exceptional. ray liotta plays the main character and his close friend and mentor is played by robert deniro, the definitive actor to play a gangster. the rest of the cast is filled with actors who play mafiosos in many other crime movies. the movie is really a story told in the first person by the main character, henry hill, of the perks of being involved in the mafia and the sudden betrayl and the self-centeredness that the mob can entail. it's truly a great picture that should be seen by everybody whoo has any interest in crime or crime dramas. superb!;7 June 2001;10;['good', 'good', 'irish', 'italian', 'friendly', 'traditional', 'exciting', 'italian', 'exceptional', 'main', 'close', 'definitive', 'many', 'other', 'first', 'main', 'sudden', 'great'];0.2812499999999999

464;Sonic_Ocean;what makes goodfellas such an enjoyable film for me would have to be its hard hitting, witty dialogue. if i have to pick a film that is a winner script-wise, goodfellas would definitely be one of the top contenders. with a script like this, there are many lines that are good enough to be quotable, and it's very long list to choose from. and the desired effect is not only achieved by the script, it had to be the select number of people who be up to the task at bringing out the sharp wit of the characters and we have a cast that really shines in that department. with ray liotta playing henry hill, his performance in letting you in on the character by putting you through his perspective with his narration alone is enough to pull you in and become captivated by the film. and as he pulls you into his world, we get introduced to numerous criminals he gets mixed up with such as tommy devito played by joe pesci, who he plays with a lot of intensity that brings out a lot of the brutal elements in the film. when on screen, you can always sense something is going to go wrong, and what pesci brings to this character is deserving of all the praise. every character evokes that sense of intensity that really gives this film its distinctive edge, but one person i seem to be captivated the most by in the movie would have to be robert de niro's performance as jimmy conway, who is crazier, but in his own more methodical way that is a lot more subtle than tommy. what bob brings to the table is something special that again shows how versatile he is as an actor and gives me another reason as to why i think he is the greatest actor ever. he may not be in every scene, but he is the foundation of the movie for me. these are all great performances that help to bring out this story and to know that these are true events makes this film even more insane than it already is. while the godfather felt more graceful and has placed a heavier emphasis on subtlety to make the violent scenes have more impact when they happen unexpectedly, goodfellas is sharp all around its edges. whereas the godfather was violent, it offered insight into the human aspects of the criminals and the reasons they murdered for business. that sense of sentimentality is nonexistent in goodfellas and offers a bare bones, raw insight into the crooked lives these criminals were leading, and with that, you get a story that is sharp like a knife that when it hits you, you'll know you'll never forget it.;29 May 2013;10;['enjoyable', 'hard', 'witty', 'top', 'many', 'good', 'quotable', 'long', 'select', 'sharp', 'enough', 'numerous', 'mixed', 'such', 'brutal', 'wrong', 'distinctive', 'most', 'crazier', 'own', 'methodical', 'subtle', 'special', 'versatile', 'great', 'great', 'true', 'insane', 'graceful', 'heavy', 'violent', 'more', 'sharp', 'violent', 'human', 'nonexistent', 'bare', 'raw', 'crooked', 'sharp'];0.0375429258241758
465;ferni-tierni;"goodfellas is a voyage to the distant idiosyncratic existence of the mobsters in the 1970s. the movie achieves and excels in articulating a narrative that is rich with symbolisms that display a clear landscape of the philosophy that made the mobster families so efficient at crime. the movie gives you so much to work with in terms of description and metaphors that the viewer feels that you know the characters intimately. with good reason, in order to adapt properly nicholas pileggi's novel into a screenplay we needed to feel part of the mobster family. we are the eyes, ears, perception of henry hill in most of the movie, and it is conducted with brilliant detail that we immerse ourselves seamlessly into his phenomenology. at the beginning of the movie we immediately get presented with a gallery of gestures that bring teenage henry hill's aspirations to life. for him anyone else that was not part of the mobster family was a nobody, and the dialogue did an accurate depiction representing the value that he placed on being someone. he wanted notoriety, respect, stability, wealth, blissful hedonism, and more than anything power. the mobster family gave him all that with the liabilities that he eventually discovered. we get entertained with one of those cautionary stories where a young person lives life too fast and is not aware of the consequences of his actions. all throughout the movie we hear the excellent dialogue navigate us through the events of the protagonist's life. scorsese used emotionally charged situations instead of descriptive statements to elicit a sensation from the viewer. for instance, instead of narrating: ""i had gained the respect of strangers and acquaintances"", he created situations that would demonstrate that event. this happened throughout the entire movie. the general tone and atmosphere of the crime family was of gratuitous irreverence. in this same tone he was able to introduce one of the best performances i have seen joe pesci deliver in any movie. in every scene, tommy (joe pesci) was demonstrating to be an outrageous, sadist, amoral, macho, over the top, ruthless maniac. the soundtrack of the film was also brilliantly used to solidify the tone of a scene. scorsese masterfully navigated the viewers through various sensations using in tandem the soundtrack and the narrative in creative and diverse ways that immortalized moments within the film. jimmy starts to descend into paranoia after the lufthansa score, but before the viewer can begin to experience his degeneration, scorsese shows us a scene of him looking suave, calm, collected, and reflective. this scene with the soundtrack attempts to mitigate his fall and preserve his status and gravitas. we eventually see henry cheating on his wife and degenerating into not being able to control his marriage and sleeping with other women. he starts to become reckless, dabble with drugs, fornicate and not abide to the mafia's ethos: we are not ""animale"" says ""paulie"" and tells him what to do to deal with the situation in an emblematic way that demonstrates that the crime family is always first than the blood family. jimmy, tommy, and henry carry the movie effortlessly, as is the attitude of the mobsters in the entire film. their experience exudes sophistication, wisdom, proficiency, prowess, admiration. there are implicit and explicit gestures where we gradually get convinced that they indeed are worthy of admiration.";23 March 2020;10;['distant', 'idiosyncratic', 'rich', 'clear', 'efficient', 'good', 'most', 'brilliant', 'teenage', 'accurate', 'blissful', 'more', 'cautionary', 'young', 'aware', 'excellent', 'scorsese', 'descriptive', 'entire', 'general', 'gratuitous', 'same', 'able', 'good', 'outrageous', 'amoral', 'macho', 'top', 'ruthless', 'various', 'creative', 'diverse', 'reflective', 'able', 'other', 'reckless', 'dabble', 'fornicate', 'emblematic', 'first', 'entire', 'implicit', 'explicit', 'worthy'];0.194047619047619

467;Habibi-Universe;"martin scorsese's 'goodfellas' (1990) is an iconic gangster/mobster movie about the real-life story of henry hill (ray liotta), his life in the mob and his relationship with his mob partners jimmy conway (robert de niro) and tommy devito (joe pesci) in the italian-american crime syndicate. it is genuinely a great feeling when you get the opportunity to review an all-time great film such as 'goodfellas'! this is the one pure gangster movie that everybody keeps talking about (i don't consider 'the godfather' a ""pure"" gangster movie)! i am someone whose number one favorite director of all time is martin scorsese and i therefore love a lot of his movies! while 'goodfellas' is not my favorite film of his, it is certainly scorsese's most iconic and beloved piece! for heaven's sake, this film is one of the top 20 highest rated films! there are so many good reasons why the film deserves this great amount of praise! let me now explain why this film is so great! first and foremost, the acting performances as well as the chemistry between all the actors are both completely on point! the protagonist in this film is ray liotta's character henry hill who also does the voice-over explaining the whole process of becoming and being a gangster. liotta plays a bit of a socially awkward character who has some weird tendencies, yet he fits in well with his gangster group. of course we also have to talk about robert de niro, the acting genius! de niro is an absolute titan in the film industry. he paved the way for so many young actors who looked up to him thanks to his incredible performances over the many decades! de niro's most iconic role might just be the one of james conway in this movie! i don't know how de niro does it, but he can make anything look cool. there is one iconic scene of him just smoking a cigarette for about 20-30 seconds. that scene alone is one of the greatest scenes in film history! de niro has always had the incredible ability to stir up the whole scene and be an absolute scene-stealer! many of these mob movies require actors that bring a lot of charisma with them. robert de niro is definitely one of those actors who can fool the audience, making them think that he might not be so bad after all due to his undeniable charm and charisma! when you talk about gangster movies, names like al pacino, marlon brando, robert de niro and joe pesci usually come up very frequently. speaking of joe pesci, he arguably delivers a career best performance in this film! pesci plays tommy devito, a really funny, yet extremely scary gangster who, if you annoy him a little bit (""break his balls a bit""), might end up killing you on the spot. he is that crazy! joe pesci plays this gangster with such brilliance and precision! it seems effortless the way he just talks and acts. it's like he is a real-life gangster himself! that's how convincing joe pesci plays tommy devito! i also find it pretty amazing that i picture an italian gangster to be someone like joe pesci's tommy devito. the way he talks, acts and the things he says. moving on, let's talk about the genius mastermind that we can all thank for making this film, martin scorsese! scorsese wrote the screenplay for 'goodfellas' alongside nicholas pileggi. scorsese obviously also directed the film. let me get down to the nitty-gritty. this motion picture has some outstanding cinematography! there is one scene when you can see characters walking inside a restaurant through the back and the camera always staying behind them as they move from one room into the next. the way it was shot blew me totally away! the film also has really fitting musical choices with lyrics that can partly tell the story without any voice-overs needed. now that is not something you experience in a lot of movies out there. as if i haven't given the film enough praise already, i need to commend the editing department for doing such a fantastic job with the pacing of the film as well as the great transitions between the scenes! on top of that i definitely appreciate that this is not a predictable film. furthermore it is a very rewatchable film because, despite being over 3 decades old, it still manages to stay so relevant, fresh, timeless and unique, all at the same time! before i wrap up this review of mine, i most certainly need to compare this film with scorsese's other mobster movies! in my opinion 'goodfellas' is better than 'mean streets' (1973) and 'the departed' (2006) while not being quite as great as 'the irishman' (2019) and 'casino' (1995) in my opinion! i only really have two minor criticisms. firstly the film is more interesting to me when it was about the gangsters interacting with each other. the scenes that were about henry hill's family and that whole side story was definitely good, but it was just not on the same level. finally this movie wraps up a little too quickly for my taste. i thought the ending was a bit too abrupt. like i said i only have ""minor"" criticisms! overall, martin scorsese's 'goodfellas' is one of the best motion pictures ever made! this is an absolute must-see for anyone out there who, for some reason, hasn't seen it yet!

(possibly). or is it perhaps because the film is based directly on his testimony (in which case - he would allow himself be occassionaly human in a world of unfeeling animals: wouldn't he?)? call me cynical, but watch for yourself. anyway. that's the only potential flaw. that and the fact that, three quarters of the way in - as liotta focusses on drug running - scorsese decides to produce twenty minutes of a completely different style of movie! oh, and lorraine bracco's bravura performance being shamefully underrated by far too many reviewers (which is, of course, not a flaw of the film!). and finally the fact that, even though this film has existed for over a decade (and therefore the evidence that fine writing helps fine direction and fine direction helps fine acting and - never! - these things altogether add up to classic cinema) hollywood will still, on the whole, prefer to go for chaos over character and janet and john dialogue over a literate script!

482;alishahmohd;goodfellas is based on a book which in turn is based on a real life story of henry hill, a person who always wanted to be a mobster and this film tells his story about he went from being a criminal to finally turning into a rat and leaving his whole mafia life behind. i think the overall storyline is very good, it is just the way it is told, too many filler scenes that are extremely, slow, boring and do nothing for the overall plot. in particular the heist sequence was done so terribly, they introduce members of the heist and minutes later the heist ended and members started spending money, moments later they all end up dead. this whole angle was rushed and so poorly handled. . the love story between henry and karen was also slow and took too long to develop and the affair angle was so fast you blinked you misses it. when henry was arrested the second time, they handled it with a series of jumbled up scenes, that could have been handled in half the time. add to that the constant and annoying narration. scorsose likes that style of storytelling, the one with narration but it is way too much here, and occasionally they would pause certain scenes and liotta would narrate which breaks the flow of the movie, many scenes are events are explained with narration. ray liotta is decent in his protagonist but the other two protagonists de niro and joe pesci. pesci is fantastic and extremely charismatic as tommy, his scenes are fun to watch and whenever he is on the screen he demands your attention, his lines are also pretty funny. de niro does great with the amount of screen time he gets but he does not get a lot of it and allow his character to properly develop from a rationale person to a paranoid man who thinks everybody is going to get him arrested. liotta was not bad he gave a decent performance but there are others who could have done better in his role, he is really good in some scenes, but in emotional scenes and even the funny scenes his poor acting clearly shows, his laugh is terrible and looks fake. some great sequences regardless. the tommy death scene and him killing a made man was one of the interesting parts. overall i don't see what is so special about goodfellas, it is an average movie, which had a great story with potential but was told in a very average and slow manner, the narrative had tons of filler and was not handled well, the main protagonist was decent at best, leaving the other two main actors to make the most of it and carry the film and steal the show. it is definitely no godfather. overall: 6/10.;16 May 2014;6;['real', 'whole', 'overall', 'good', 'many', 'slow', 'boring', 'overall', 'particular', 'heist', 'dead', 'whole', 'slow', 'long', 'second', 'constant', 'annoying', 'certain', 'many', 'decent', 'other', 'fantastic', 'charismatic', 'fun', 'funny', 'great', 'rationale', 'paranoid', 'bad', 'decent', 'good', 'emotional', 'funny', 'poor', 'terrible', 'fake', 'great', 'interesting', 'special', 'average', 'great', 'average', 'slow', 'main', 'decent', 'good', 'other', 'main', 'most'];0.0926984126984126

507;john_meyer;"many people think scorsese is a great director because he is a skilled craftsman who produces a clear realization of his own weirdly fractured vision. given the reverence with which some people treat his work, any criticism may be viewed as sacrilege. however, this film is filled with wooden, cartoon characterizations of real people. they do very ugly things to each other, but without any understanding of their motivations. the movie drags on far too long thanks to countless scenes that should have been shortened or cut (e.g., the endlessly long prison kitchen scene). the transitions between different phases of the movie are abrupt and without explanation. for instance, the transition to drug addiction and trafficking comes out of nowhere when the main character pulls pills out of his pocket and swallows them on his way to jail in a limousine. no drug use is shown or even hinted at prior to that scene. while the movie certainly progresses over time, and there is definitely plot development, the cardboard characters don't really change, and every scene seems like a repeat of something we just saw. unlike ""the godfather,"" to which this film is sometimes compared because they both depict the ""inner workings"" of the east coast mafia, there is no deeper insight into any part of the human condition, and only the shallowest revelations about why the mafia even exists. the only thing we are given -- explained in clumsy narration at the end of the movie -- is that all the participants are drawn to each other because they enjoy a sense of belonging: of being ""good fellas."" while the irony between that explanation and the extended depiction of these beautifully bonded people eating their own is certainly acknowledged, in the end none of it really makes sense, and we are reminded of that too-frequently quoted shakespeare line: it is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury signifying nothing macbeth was clearly talking about goodfellas.";2 June 2013;2;['many', 'great', 'skilled', 'clear', 'own', 'fractured', 'wooden', 'real', 'ugly', 'other', 'long', 'countless', 'long', 'different', 'abrupt', 'main', 'inner', 'deep', 'human', 'shallow', 'only', 'clumsy', 'other', 'good', 'extended', 'own', 'full'];0.0920138888888889
508;exterminator_99;"for so long ""the godfather"" and its superior sequel ""the godfather: part ii"" were held up as the ultimate gangster movies. there had been imitators, yet none could match the originality and sheer weight of the corleone saga. if anyone were to recreate the mafia genre, or at least redefine it, it would have to be someone with the right cultural baggage. martin scorsese had already painted an indelible vision of new york through ""mean streets"", ""taxi driver"" and to a lesser extent, ""raging bull."" in that sense, he was the perfect choice to direct a modern version of a genre that inspires, fears and captures the imagination of audiences on a similar level to science fiction. instead of rehashing the past of ""the godfather"", scorsese drew from a more recent past: the 1960's and 70's. in fact scorsese drew most inspiration from a book by journalist nicholas pileggi, entitled 'wiseguy'. after both men made contact with one another they set about creating a script for a film based upon the book. the premise for the film is based around the true story of a 1980's court case involving an informant for a new york mafia family. henry hill (christopher serrone) is a 13-year old boy growing up in 1950's brooklyn. awestruck by his daily mafia surroundings, henry is drawn to the allure of a gangster's life. while his father, of irish stock, works away in a blue-collar life of drudgery, henry sees the mafia as a way out to a life of glamour, girls, money and ultimately, respect. he begins his journey as an errand boy for local crime boss paul cicero (paul sorvino), collecting debts and doing damage when required. as henry says in the narration, ""i was earning more money at 14 than most of the adults in the neighbourhood."" absolutely and utterly enamoured with his new life, henry is proud to be a mobster. at this stage of the film, we feel as if we are in corleone territory. everything is nostalgic to the point of rose-tintedness, we as an audience are drawn to what the mafia represents: a tough guy fraternity that deals above the law. henry's ascension into the mafia life is something we view with a smile rather than a frown. by the 1960's we catch up with the adult henry (ray liotta). now 21 years old, he and his friend and cohort tommy de vito (joe pesci) are foot soldiers for boss cicero. robbing trucks for cigarettes, clothing and alcohol, the two forge a name for themselves as good earners. despite their accomplishments, they pale in comparison the 'made' guys, the real mafioso who run cicero's shady underworld. scorsese introduces us to the cicero family in a superb steadicam sequence early on in the film. as henry walks through a nightclub we are shown the caricatures of mafia hitmen. he narrates over the top and presents us characters with names like fat andy, frankie the wop, jimmy no nose, pete the killer and jimmy two times. if one were to be not paying attention, you could be mistaken that you were watching ""dick tracy"". one character not caricatured at all is jimmy conway, played by the great robert de niro. cool, calm, tough and quietly evil, conway is the ultimate gangster, bristling with venom and style. due to his irish background, conway will never be made, yet his presence is enough to suggest that his standing on the ladder is a non-issue. de niro plays conway brilliantly, drawing from his portrayl of jake la motta in ""raging bull"". once again, the tag team combination of scorsese and de niro just about makes the film, despite the overall excellence of the movie. henry climbs higher and higher up the ladder of the mafia, marrying a jewish girl named karen (lorraine bracco) along the way and forging a name for himself as a gangster who's 'got things worked out'. he's earning big and the cicero family is doing nicely. it all goes pear-shaped when henry's goals change: he acquires a mistress and begins dealing cocaine. as his lavish tastes and dangerous lifestyle escalate, the workings of the cicero family also begin to change. the 1970's introduce new, more violent and extravagant opportunities to make money for henry, tommy and jimmy, all of which start the rot. it all begins to tumble down and henry and karen are forced to make decisions that could cost them dearly in the long run. ""goodfellas"" is blessed with outstanding performances all round. liotta's henry is understated, yet we travel along his journey of self-destruction easily. like henry himself, we are too caught up in the speed and glamour of the life to take stock of where he ends up. pesci is amazing as the volatile yet charismatic tommy. he won an oscar for his role (and repeated this performance in 1995's ""casino"") and it's obvious why. the sense of unease mixed with humour around tommy is a credit to pesci's ability to invisibly and unassumingly flick the switch between joker and psychopath. bracco is also strong as karen. she has since taken up a more subdued role on the television series ""the sopranos""; also based on the mafia. also of note are chuck low as morrie, frank vincent as billy bats and the late catherine scorsese as tommy's mother. scorsese's collaborators michael ballhaus (cinematography) and thelma schoonmaker (editing) once again deliver. ballhaus captures the mood of each decade perfectly: the nostalgia and innocence of the 1950's, the power of the 1960's and the seedy 1970's, they are all captured brilliantly. also of note is the final few scenes involving a coked-up henry trying to do a million things at once. the frenetic pace and quick editing of this section is a credit to both ballhaus and schoonmaker. the director is in total control of proceedings, with the film never altering from its course. the use of music is superlative, the costumes and overall mise en scene of the film is pure genius. scorsese hasn't matched ""goodfellas"" since, and while ""taxi driver"" remains his best, ""goodfellas"" ranks extremely close. by the end of the film the viewer realises that they have witnessed a different kind of gangster movie. brutal, fast, exciting and violent, ""goodfellas"" is the anti-""godfather"". it portrays the mafia life as an uncompromising and shady world, yet one that rewards those who play by its rules. it is a difficult feat for the greatest of directors to create a movie that engrains itself on popular culture, but scorsese once again delivers.

543;Bill21;"it happened again. just as america's greatest living (greatest ever?) director created the best film of the decade in 1980 -- ""raging bull"" -- and lost the oscar to robert redford's ""ordinary people"" (an outrage by all accounts), yet another thespian's pretentious film -- kevin costner's ""dances with wolves"" -- beats out one of the best acted, best directed, most kinetically charged and most entertaining/horrifying films ever created... ""goodfellas"" this is one hell of a ride. everything in the film is perfect. the soundtrack perfectly mirrors the time period (musically and lyrically, from ""rags to riches"" to ""my way""). joe pesci is a revelation. of course he could be a thug, but they way his tommy devito enters every shot as an unknown factor -- ""is he going to snap?"" is the only thing we can think of -- gives the film an edge that would not have been the same with another actor. robert deniro is, of course, terrific, and ray liotta inhabits the character unlike he's done since. but the real star is martin scorsese. just when it seems that ""raging bull"" would be his apex, i think ""goodfellas"" may top it, on the basis of scope and technique. it's not just a man as in ""raging bull"" and ""taxi driver,"" his other legendary works. it's a whole lifestyle, a way of being. and it follows three decades of a ""family's"" rise and fall. and there is never a slow or tedious moment. the movie is raw action. whether it's the hellish tracking shots or the point of view shots or the way the trunk lets off an evil red glow, everything is for a reason. and the double voice-over technique is brilliant, because it gives two different perspectives of mafia life.

546;vittoriocosanostra;for a director, one of the most impossible tasks imaginable is trying to make such greatness for the big screen, and to do it well is even more difficult. however, director martin scorsese has succeeded in this near impossible task, as despite the obvious fact that no movie can be as great or complex as he imaginated novel, this 2 hour epic barely suffers from any such point. i do not believe that comparing the quality of a movie to that of its idea is a very relevant point, as every film stands alone as just that, a film. but if one tries to remain faithful to the source thinkedl, there is a chance some things get hushed up which might result in certain scenes not quite fitting in anymore. of course, significant part of the stories of henry hill, jimmy conway & tommy (paulie was kind of like a 4th main character in the idea) for example were left out of the film, yet this is made up for quite smoothly by really only focussing on the development of karen, morrie & frankie carbone. everything else might be barely developed, but it plays out in such a way as to develop our three main characters consistently. thus, scorsese has succeeded in narrowing down the plot to a 2 hour movie, and still maintains the essential continuity of character development in these three characters, and never does he really show that it is about the development of someone else. much lauded, the technical aspects of goodfellas are all superb. it is definitely one of the most visually astounding pictures ever made. it is also said to be one of the most expensive movies ever made, utilizing thousands of extra's and endless beautiful aristocratic art design. with the red army being called in to supply a lot of the roles of extra's, it is as if almost the entire american nation was involved into making this impossible titanic film. a lot of sequences are just about unparalleled, especially during the action ones. the complex shots of thousands of extra's in sequence in killing scenes, the reflective helicopter aerial shots of death and destruction in the mob, the many steadicam shots watching the movie, changing distances and overviews effortlessly without editing. the many scenes of big bosses society, the beautiful balls, costumes, cathedrals. there is also an incredible one-take shot of a ball sequence where the camera steadicams from the opening towards a certain door and back, ending perfectly symmetrical, that is just an epitome of the directorial smoothness this picture consists of. it is so exquisitely shot that nearly every frame is material for a beautiful painting, and it comes as no surprise that fincher was highly influenced by these visuals for his masterpiece: fight club. the acting is also superb in this rendition of the goodfellas, especially lorraine bracco as karen. she perfectly embodies the vivaciousness, innocence, happiness, artlessness & naivety of scorsese's character, as if she just walked out of the idea into the screen. de niro, casting himself as jimmy conway, also has this merit, as he perfectly displays the clumsy, idealistic, kind-hearted & absent minded nature of the jimmy in the thought. and to top it off, the strict and stoic demeanor of joe pesci as tommy also perfectly embodies scorsese's character spirit. of course, accuracy to the idea in these terms is not required to create a superb movie, but when the movie is as faithful to the thougtl as this one, it would not make a lot of sense to have your characters utilize traits they should never have had. in any case, these characters feel just as alive as they are in scorsese's novel. the dialogue, well adapted from the source material, is psychologically & philosophically superb, although of course a lot of those credits go to marty, but the narrative implementation of psychological happenings in the minds of our three main characters is a brilliant addition to add as much scope as possible to a film that already has a scale that is nearly unequaled. a lot of people complain that in scorsese's next film casino (1995) there was much scale and little scope, but this is not the case for goodfellas. as it is both substantial in terms of character, and gigantic in terms of scale. the score is also excellent, and often used effectively as a reflective measure near the end of battles, or beautifully during balls. it is varied, it is epic and it is beautiful at the same time. it would be a hard task to distinguish what aspect of goodfellas isn't great, and due to its incredible complexity largely owed to a 2-hour runtime, there's very little movies that can possibly equal the pure raw incredible power of will that was needed to create such a giant production, not to mention the personal poignancy also evident in its main characters. thus, despite the fact that this film is not widely known due to various reasons, there is little doubt as to its status of an all-time great among motion pictures.;28 August 2020;10;['impossible', 'imaginable', 'such', 'big', 'difficult', 'impossible', 'obvious', 'great', 'complex', 'such', 'relevant', 'alone', 'faithful', 'certain', 'fitting',

567;fatehsmann;such is the reputation of goodfellas, that when i finally set about watching it a few months ago, i was sure of an unforgettable movie experience. but i was bitterly disappointed. while by no means a bad movie, goodfellas never touched the heights of the godfather and the departed, two other movies about 'wiseguys'. goodfellas is a true story about henry hill (ray liotta), who, since childhood was charmed by gangsters. he set about doing odd jobs for the mob as kid, and after being arrested ones and not ratting out, he earns the mob's respect. he then starts to enter the big time, befriending by jimmy conway (robert de niro) and tommy devito (joe pesci) the movie never really took off for me, and never had me sucked into it, as i would expect all so-called classics to.despite that, there are a few seminal scenes in it. the 'you're funny' scene is one of them, which probably was the main reason for joe pesci's oscar as best supporting actor. credit has to be given to scorese though, for sticking true to henry hill's story and not overtly dramatizing it. the three central characters are in good form. liotta does a great job of portraying the level-headed (compared to conway and tommy) gangster, while deniro's charisma is there for all to see as the flamboyant jimmy conway. however, pesci is the star of the show, delivering a top performance as the hare-brained, hot tempered gangster tommy devito. while for me it wasn't good enough to be considered a classic, it's good enough to warrant a watch. 7/10;20 December 2010;7;['such', 'few', 'sure', 'unforgettable', 'disappointed', 'bad', 'other', 'true', 'odd', 'big', 'few', 'seminal', 'funny', 'main', 'good', 'true', 'central', 'good', 'great', 'flamboyant', 'top', 'hot', 'good', 'good'];0.2102272727272727

570;MovieTim14;"i'm a martin scorcese fan as much as the next film lover. having made at least 1 of the best films of the decade for each decade since the 70's, the director and his oeuvre are legendary. that's why when i finally sat down to watch ""goodfellas,"" a film that many consider to be in the upper echelons of his work, i was surprised at how underwhelmed i ultimately felt. now, being underwhelmed does not equate to thinking this is a bad movie. the craft of this film is undeniable. each setting is lavishly and painstakingly created to transport us into the many different time periods the story covers, the ensemble cast is impeccable, the dialogue is always lively and engaging, and the camera work is timeless. everything comes together perfectly to portray mafioso life as sleek, stylish, and sexy, as well as cold-blooded, two-faced, and horrific all at once. where the movie falters for me is in a lack of tension, a flaw of both screenplay and directing alike. all the above-mentioned descriptors can be captured in the first scene alone. crazy mafia activity ensues, and enthralls us for what is going to come next. but then, at least in my experience, nothing comes next. it's scene after scene that can capture a facet of gangster life: how unhinged a character is, the irony of the lives being lived, etc. but it never ramps up to something greater, either in action or drama. take the main protagonist, henry hill, for example. in the first scene, he utters his iconic line, ""as far back as i can remember, i always wanted to be a gangster."" so he does just that. he becomes a gangster with ease, rises through the ranks, gets married, experiences some hardships, some betrayals, standard gangster stuff. the movie portrays this all as matter-of-factly as i just did. there's no character arc to speak of here. he never really changes or even struggles internally. the only things that change are the situations he is involved in. but with all the conflict being of a strictly external nature, even where the set-up is begging for some internal conflict, it never truly hit the dramatic boiling point i thought it should have. to be honest, it never even really got close. that was my experience with ""goodfellas"": all flash and no substance. i can't be too harsh on it, because again, it's about as perfect of a portrayal of the gangster life as there is. for myself however, if i want that experience to include actual drama and tension, i'll be revisiting ""the godfather"" instead. if i want scorcese's unique flavoring of the genre, i'll pick ""the departed"" any day of the week.";17 May 2020;7;['next', 'least', 'good', 'legendary', 'many', 'upper', 'surprised', 'underwhelmed', 'bad', 'undeniable', 'many', 'different', 'ensemble', 'impeccable', 'lively', 'engaging', 'mafioso', 'sleek', 'stylish', 'sexy', 'cold', 'blooded', 'faced', 'horrific', 'first', 'crazy', 'least', 'great', 'main', 'first', 'iconic', 'standard', 'only', 'external', 'internal', 'dramatic', 'honest', 'close', 'harsh', 'perfect', 'actual', 'unique'];0.1441919191919191

572;Bandit1974;"i'm sure i am not the only one on this web site who gets into arguments with their friends about which mob movie is the best. ultimately it always comes down to the godfather and goodfellas. it's like debating over who is better, the beatles or the stones? both are fantastic movies, but offer two different view points on the same subject. i do believe that the godfather offers a more romantic point of view of the mafia. perhaps that is because it focuses more on the early years of the mafia. the good years. goodfellas covers a longer period of time.including the early 80's when the mafia began to fall apart due to its involvement in drugs. regardless of whether you prefer the godfather to goodfellas there is no denying that goodfellas is an amazing film. total perfection. from the directing to the acting to the soundtrack. this movie is flawless. as much as i think the godfather romanticizes the mafia, when you watch goodfellas you'll find yourself drawn to the characters and lifestyle depicted in the movie. goodfellas is that powerful. are these ""good"" people? hell no. but it's all relative. yes, they are all scumbags, but some are worse than others. when you finish watching goodfellas, ask yourself this: are you ticked that it's over? are you angry that henry got busted? do you want to punch the cop in the face when he licks the cocaine off of his fingers smiling at henry as if to say, ""busted!"" stellar performances throughout make this a must see for anyone who considers themselves a fan of film. how powerful are these performances? i happen to think de niro deserved an oscar simply for the way he smoked a cigarette. the scene where henry confesses that he knew jimmy was going to ""whack"" morrie. sunshine of your love by cream begins to play as the camera zooms in on jimmy (de niro) standing at the end of a bar, smoking a cigarette, pretending to pay attention to someone who is talking to him as he stares off into the distance in anger. this is my favorite scene ever captured on film and it lasted less than 30 seconds. this scene is why de niro is the best living actor. without saying a word his facial expressions are oscar worthy. de niro aside, the movie is loaded with talent. hell, even martin scorsese's mom, catherine, steals a scene. the plot follows a ""crew"" in new york. in the beginning they ruled the neighborhood and ran all the schemes. when it all fell apart ""one of their own"" sold them out in court to save his own ass. it's not a movie for the squeamish. the f bomb is dropped constantly and the violence is real and raw. it's been said that when watching the godfather you almost feel as if you are watching a family's home movies. if that is true, then goodfellas is like watching the home movies the family didn't want you to see. these are not admirable people. but like i said, scorsese is so good at what he does, you will be heartbroken when it all ends.";14 February 2006;10;['sure', 'only', 'good', 'well', 'fantastic', 'different', 'same', 'romantic', 'more', 'early', 'good', 'long', 'early', 'amazing', 'total', 'flawless', 'powerful', 'good', 'relative', 'bad', 'angry', 'stellar', 'powerful', 'favorite', 'less', 'good', 'facial', 'oscar', 'worthy', 'own', 'own', 'real', 'raw', 'true', 'admirable', 'good'];0.2553285256410256

575;gautammayya;"goodfellas... one of the perfect movies of all time and one of my personal favorites. basically this is the rise and fall of henry hill from being a teen obsessed with the mob life and then becoming a gangster and then how it damages his personal life and health. okay i have never been a gangster but after watching this movies, i can safely say that's what gangster life would have been. everything was so cold and....cool!!even the color plating was on the cold side, signifying the cold heartlessness nature of the men shown on screen. but is this enough to call it a perfect film and one of the best of all time? of course not!! come on what is wrong with this movie? scorcese gave the perfect explanation of why people are so enticed by the gangster life on the first half of the movie and then the ugly truth of the people inside it. talking about the first half. it's filled with great shots showing why people are enticed towards the gangster life. oh my god ""that"" scene with then he kissed me playing, that is cinematic gold. those kind of moments just remind us again why we people just love watching movies! the first half is filled with quotable lines, funny moments and just cool guys doing cool things. it goes on and on until things slowly go out of hand. the pacing quickens . the same guys who were just petty thieves and smugglers become drug dealers and killers and they have no remorse as well. and coming to the second half we figure out no one has any sort of morality. jimmy(de niro) who was an accomplice and dear friend of henry hill(ray liotta) tries to have him killed in the fear henry will rat him out!! he kills everyone associated with the heist as well!! he is freakiin psycho. tommy(joe pesci) who is shown to be so funny(""funny how? am i here to ****in' amuse you"") and charismatic in the early scenes turns out to be an absolute psychopath and no one in the mob is surprised by it! it is horrifying actually. he kills people without much hesitation for silly things!!(how can anyone forget the ""go get the ****ing shinebox"" scene). and along with this we get karen hill's struggle. she basically represents us in the movie. she like we all was drawn onto henry's life in the beginning even though she knew the things that he was doing. then as we slowly began to hate henry as he became more and more out of control karen also began to hate him. and then the last 30 or so minutes is where we know things are way worse than we imagined. henry is splitting his time in making and selling drugs, making dinner for his family, delivering guns to jimmy and trying to evade the cops following him in helicopters. and then in the end henry justifies against the mob in court in fear of his own life and he himself doesn't get jail time. but even after all that he says he misses the glamour of the gangster life!! he doesn't feel regret about the killings of so many people nor the regret of ratting out his best friends!! what kind of a guy is he? what kind of a life is that? to those who say this movie glamorizes the mob, come on anyone who has seen the entire film knows that it is against it. so finally i have to say this is one of those gems you surely cannot afford to miss. it has everything. all time great performances by the entire cast especially liotta, de niro, pesci and lorraine bracco, an all time great director at his best, greatest use of music in movies, great camera work and cinematography, showing the real dirty gangster life against a more dramatized godfather, and a script which moves along at high speed providing us an entertaining joy ride of two and a half hours(i couldn't believe it was that long!!)";24 May 2020;9;['perfect', 'personal', 'personal', 'cold', 'cold', 'cold', 'heartlessness', 'enough', 'perfect', 'good', 'wrong', 'perfect', 'first', 'ugly', 'first', 'great', 'cinematic', 'first', 'quotable', 'funny', 'cool', 'cool', 'same', 'petty', 'second', 'dear', 'charismatic', 'early', 'absolute', 'much', 'silly', 'last', 'bad', 'own', 'many', 'good', 'entire', 'great', 'entire', 'great', 'good', 'great', 'great', 'real', 'dirty', 'dramatized', 'high', 'entertaining', 'long'];0.1954761904761904

590;dwpeak;"martin scorsese is one of the best filmmakers who ever lived, if not the greatest. ""goodfellas"" is one of his best movies. it is energetically violent, and full of language and drug content. does that make the film what it is? no. it is a great study of organized crime from 1955 to 1970. it is real and it is haunting. henry hill (ray liotta) grew up in brooklyn. as he narrates, he makes it apparent that the life he always wanted to lead was the gangster life. he lives across from a cab stand owned by some ""wiseguys."" henry gets a job there, and suddenly becomes so engulfed in the life, that he misses school for months. he spends his childhood finding ways to score money, and learn the mafia routine as taught to him by jimmy conway (robert de niro) and paul cicero (paul sorvino). he obviously gets older hill remains a gangster, and the film is about his life growing up surrounded by violence and corruption. it is the story of how something so glamorous could be so ugly. ray liotta gives the best performance of his career as henry hill. no other role he has had comes close to this one. robert de niro pulls off a fascinating job, as well. joe pesci plays the profane tommy, a long time friend of jimmy and henry, in his oscar-winning performance. a surprising addition to a great cast. lorraine bracco plays karen, henry's wife. she had a difficult role, considering her character's personality, but she did a great job. paul sorvino is superb as cicero, and gives one of the film's best performances. ""goodfellas"" is based on a true story novel by nicholas pileggi. pileggi, along with scorsese, developed a truly amazing screenplay, that few can match with its wonderful voice-over narration and stunning dialogue. martin scorsese is a truly skilled director. not many directors can match is sense of style and darkness. every scene is worked to utter mastery. the film, in the end, is great. there's not much to argue about there. this film will turn viewers away with its graphic violence and language, but the film is not without its messages. mainly about the study of how one's life can be turned inside out by the decisions he/she makes. or redeemed by those decisions.

591;alexsafc123;"this is as close a thing to film making perfection as you are going to get in your lifetime. when i first saw this film several years ago i thought it was the greatest film i have ever seen, and i still believe that now. goodfellas is the chronicling of the life and times of henry hill (liotta) and his seedy underworld dealings with his dubious associates jimmy conway (de niro) and tommy de vito (pesci). it begins with with his entanglement with the mob, follows his rise to power and riches, then allows you to watch, as his whole carefully balanced life comes crashing down around him in spectacular fashion. what stands out for me about this film is that it does not rely on flashy special effects, extravagant pyrotechnics or a spot of the good old ultra violence (that said this film is by no means without violence), but it simply uses extraordinary story telling, a skill lost all too easily on most of modern cinema. it will suck you in right from the get go and grasp you to its greasy, mozzarella scented bosom right until the closing minutes when you are allowed to un-immerse yourself from the captivating portrayal of the life of a ""goodfella"". scorsese has without doubt been one of the best and most consistent directors and film makers of all time, everything he touches seems to turn to wonderfully gritty, seedy, gold, but i believe this to be his magnum opus above all of his other films and accolades throughout his career. he has a method of presenting the gangster genre i have yet to see be surpassed in terms of sheer entertainment value and depth. he also brings out truly top drawer performances from some undoubtedly great actors across the whole spectrum of the cast. only this truly great combination of this directing, acting, and not to mention the realistic and natural scripting, could culminate to make the viewer feel some sympathy (mixed with a small degree of satisfaction at hills retribution) towards a murdering, coke snorting, cheating mobster and all round scum bag. this film also boasts the infamous ""you think i'm funny?"" scene with pesci providing a truly incredible performance here in particular. in a matter of minutes tommy's character is encapsulated in emphatic style providing a brilliantly suspenseful and humorous peek into his psyche. i would recommend this film to anyone that has not seen it already, and if you haven't, why the hell not?! it's been out for 18 bloody years go and buy the dvd now!";17 June 2008;10;['close', 'several', 'great', 'seedy', 'dubious', 'whole', 'balanced', 'spectacular', 'flashy', 'special', 'extravagant', 'good', 'old', 'ultra', 'extraordinary', 'most', 'modern', 'good', 'consistent', 'gritty', 'seedy', 'magnum', 'other', 'sheer', 'top', 'great', 'whole', 'great', 'realistic', 'natural', 'mixed', 'small', 'round', 'infamous', 'funny', 'incredible', 'particular', 'emphatic', 'suspenseful', 'humorous', 'bloody'];0.2109002976190476

598;LoveCoates;"this film is considered the definitive mob film, probably more because martin scorsese is quite possibly the best living american director. if francis ford coppola (director of ""the godfather"" trilogy) were still alive, he may disagree with this assessment -- and if he did, i would have to agree with him. granted, the direction is brilliant, especially on the opening credits, the beginning of liotta's flashback, the psychedelic feel of the end, and the stunning tracking shot that introduces liotta and bracco's first date, but there are so many postmodern innovations that the viewer is veritably jarred. with repeated viewings (which have made this film a classic) this alienation is felt less so, but there is nothing here to challenge coppola's christening scene. nonetheless, not enough can be said, especially about this movie's acting. pesci's star-turn is celebrated, but kudos must also go to the always underrated liotta whose subtley suits his role perfectly. de niro is wasted but good playing the role he always plays (could he be anything less than good?) and paul sorvino is perfectly understated in a supporting role. the real praise must go to lorraine bracco, the only character to experience a full spate of emotions. she is the most convincing female character ever in a gangster film and doesn't have enough scenes, to my taste. the plot - what little there is - weakens the film. the main character's ambiguous goal is to become a gangster, but this does not drive the film. events happen to him, rather than grow out of his own actions making him difficult to sympathize with. the unsatisfying ending is too quick (as if scorsese knew his movie was getting a tab bit overlong) and also unsatisfying, though he did the latter on purpose as a point of theme. overall, a must-see film, though i prefer the better-directed and more engaging plot of ""casino,"" which, unfortunately is often-panned as a rip-off of this film. both film's are ridiculously and violent unlike the early hollywood gangster flicks which were juist as - if not more - thematically effective.";31 July 2001;4;['definitive', 'good', 'american', 'alive', 'brilliant', 'psychedelic', 'stunning', 'first', 'many', 'postmodern', 'enough', 'underrated', 'good', 'less', 'good', 'real', 'only', 'full', 'convincing', 'female', 'enough', 'little', 'main', 'ambiguous', 'own', 'difficult', 'quick', 'latter', 'engaging', 'violent', 'early', 'juist', 'effective'];0.2209935897435897

616;CastleToe;"an enthusiastic adolescent stares longingly out of his bedroom window at the gangsters hangout, dreaming to be a gangster... bunks school, works with them and eventually grows up to be one of them. this boy narrating his story is half irish, half italian, new york based mobster, henry hill(ray liotta). he is lashed by his father but he complains to the mob bosses who help him out. his mother looks at him in a suit and shrieks ""you look like a gangster!"" this scene marks his transformation into a ""wiseguy"", one among the goodfellas. how he grew up surrounded by the mafia and worked and lived off them for 3 decades forms the basis of this film. based on the book ""wise guy"" by reporter nicholas pileggi (to whom the real henry hill reportedly gave his true-life account), whose also penned the screenplay with director scorsese, the 146 min movie successfully packs 3 decades of mafia life without compromising on the pace or the details, thanks to the brilliant direction of martin scorsese and the editing(thelma schoonmaker). the beauty of this movie was it was full of violence, murder, theft, smuggling, substance abuse, adultery, profanity and other unsocial acts, all of which were spoken of very casually in the same breath with no feeling of remorse or guilt. it delved deep into the subject of the power of mafia but it never advocated their use or glorified it. neither was it a typical moral bedtime story that are narrated to children. this is effectively expressed by the gradual change in the character of hill's wife, karen hill(lorraine bracco) through her narration. she initially feels as uncomfortable as any outsider would feel with the movie's theme but slowly gets absorbed just as the viewer into the mafia lives and in certain places, even makes you feel a certain sympathy for the lead character and other people but leaves a stranger taste when you realise that all their sufferings are well deserved. they are casual with their criminal acts but deep down, they know they are wrong. and as roger ebert said, they know they are guilty, not because they did wrong but know that they want to do the wrong again. the music & tempo(""rags to riches"", ""pretend you don't see her"" and so on) seem hand picked for the occasions, perfectly echoing the mood of the scenes. in addition to this, the screenplay of some scenes(which i heard was mostly improvised by the actors, spot on) stand out for their sense of sheer brutal-ism while some for their humour while some others explaining a subtle point or thought or a transition in character. the acting cast comprising of robert deniro(jim conway), joe pesci(tommy devito), paulie cicero(paul sorvino), ray liotta(henry hill), lorraine bracco(karen hill) ...the list goes on....put an earnest performance. we also have some interesting small-time roles played by significant actors - ed stacks (samuel jackson), old vinnie(martin's father, charles scorsese), tommy's mother(martin's mother, catherine scorsese), diane(kate wallach, daughter of legendary eli wallach of good, bad, ugly fame) and so on... i admit to first seeing this movie in bits and parts(as i heard it was one of scorsese's best) as and when it was telecast on television and wasn't very impressed but decided to hold my view until later. but when i got a chance to see it from start to end, i was impressed and mesmerized by this piece of art. the primary goal of movie is to keep a viewer engaged through its runtime and leave the viewer with a feeling of having experienced a story which goodfellas successfully does. so, here we have a gangster movie ranking (almost) equivalent to the likes of godfather. 9 / 10 (minus one, not because the movie was flawed, but as i respect the 10 stars for a once (or twice) in a lifetime movie - and i have chosen fight club for now)";10 December 2010;9;['enthusiastic', 'irish', 'half', 'italian', 'wise', 'real', 'true', 'brilliant', 'full', 'other', 'unsocial', 'same', 'typical', 'moral', 'gradual', 'uncomfortable', 'certain', 'certain', 'lead', 'other', 'strange', 'deserved', 'casual', 'criminal', 'wrong', 'guilty', 'sheer', 'brutal', 'subtle', 'earnest', 'interesting', 'small', 'significant', 'old', 'good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'good', 'impressed', 'impressed', 'primary', 'equivalent'];0.0681972789115646
617;mrdestroyer2001;"who would you call a nice guy? probably a work colleague who, to the detriment of his time, agrees to drink a glass of beer with you and listen to crazy talk about lost love. and after the third glass of beer it becomes clearly clear to you that this is, in general, a nice guy. the heroes of this film will not negotiate with you, will not show understanding, and if you owe something to these people, then death becomes not the worst way out of this situation. this is a film about the life of the mafia . even when henry was in school, he saw how simple it all goes to people from the "" family "". they robbed, cheated and even killed people, but their opinions did not change. they were afraid, and therefore - respected. they were not afraid of anyone and they had good reason. naturally, young henry was struck by such a life, and in his heart he had long since matured in order to start his own criminal career and, finally, to become a real gangster. and this story is dedicated to his ascent, his victories and his collapse. despite the fact that the events of the film occur predominantly in the 70s of the last century, this picture makes us recall our nostalgic memories of the unforgettable computer game "" mafia: the city of lost heaven "", where events took place in the 30s. in addition to the general atmosphere in these works of art, some scenes from the film frankly migrated to the screens of computer monitors. remarkable is the fact that the protagonist of the film - ray liotta was subsequently involved in the sound of tommy angelo - the main character of the already mentioned game. according to many sites that are directly related to the field of cinema, and some film magazines, "" glorious guys "" - this is the most realistic film about the mafia ever created. in this aspect, it is difficult for me not to agree with them, when scenes of beatings, which the godfather trilogy and the painting once upon a time in america often neglected, are often swept across the frame. martin scorsese took the story based on real events, reworked it into a script, and created from it not a banal tale about the mafia, but a hard interesting film that is worth watching several times. henry . the protagonist of the film, through whose eyes we see everything that happens in the film. his character performed by ray liotta is laconic and not too emotional. but this does not mean that he is boring. his acting potential is revealed closer to the second half of the film, when henry's life begins to lose its former stability, and now he has to really survive in order to stay afloat. jimmy i have already seen so many films with the participation of robert de niro that it would seem there is nothing surprising. this actor perfectly showed a variety of images, from comedies to strong dramas. and yet, robert is surprised. he is fully revealed in the film. his character is a gangster with experience, who has engaged himself in all areas of the criminal life of society. his preference is robbery, however, if necessary, he is capable of anything, including murder. tommy . the brightest character in this movie. in all likelihood, this is the best role played by joe pesci . here he was given a real revelation, which cannot be said about such paintings as "" home alone "" or "" deadly weapon "". his character is small, obviously with a chronic neurosis, a gangster, with a complex youthful fate, who is very proud of what he has achieved. he does not allow anyone to insult himself, while he will allow himself clearly more than acceptable, at any convenient occasion grabbing a knife or a gun. it is necessary to mention that this is also a very talkative, and therefore very funny character. honored oscar for best supporting role. the director of the film, martin scorsese , the author of such masterpiece films like gangs of new york and the oscar-winning ""the departed, "" created a film that perfectly complements godfather , telling the most tough and interesting story about the life of the mafia. i recommend viewing this film to anyone who likes masterpieces, to all sincere cinema fans, since this is a really interesting film, which doesn't need a half-hour buildup at a time of two and a half hours. the film clings from the first minutes and releases at the moment when the final credits are on the screen. watch it ...";24 April 2019;7;['nice', 'crazy', 'lost', 'third', 'clear', 'general', 'nice', 'bad', 'simple', 'afraid', 'respected', 'afraid', 'good', 'young', 'own', 'criminal', 'real', 'dedicated', 'last', 'nostalgic', 'unforgettable', 'general', 'remarkable', 'main', 'many', 'glorious', 'realistic', 'difficult', 'real', 'banal', 'interesting', 'worth', 'several', 'laconic', 'emotional', 'boring', 'second', 'former', 'many', 'surprising', 'strong', 'surprised', 'criminal', 'necessary', 'capable', 'bright', 'good', 'real', 'such', 'deadly', 'small', 'chronic', 'complex', 'youthful', 'proud', 'acceptable', 'convenient', 'necessary', 'talkative', 'funny', 'honored', 'good', 'such', 'tough', 'interesting', 'sincere', 'interesting', 'half', 'first', 'final'];0.1100198412698412

636;keving4241;"sure this is a gangster movie and in the genre of gangster movies this stands as one of the greatest of all time. but i think this movie holds that title even out of its genre. i think this is one of the greatest movies of all time. from realistic characters and some of the finest acting in movies, to an epic story full of humor/suspense/drama/tragedy, the colorful dialog that feels so organic you wouldn't be able to tell the actors are reciting lines from a script and the most amazing part of it all is the fact that this all actually happened. i can't help but feel more drawn into movies that are based off real events. sure its a movie but its telling a real story that i haven't heard before, i don't know who lives and dies in this story and because these characters represent real people i can't help but think when someone dies in the movie its possible that person they are playing was actually killed in real life. and that makes me care about the characters in the movie so much more. this is an example of a gangster movie that doesn't need action to be a good a movie. there aren't crazy shoot outs and explosions going off every 5 minutes, its the mob. the real mob... the ""cut your throat in your sleep quietly"" mob. every aspect of the movie was done so well. the actors play their roles perfectly, the director shot this movie to make every scene an amazingly epic visual spectacle for the audience, the writer drenched every part of this story with realistic human emotion and henry hill got to tell his story through an amazing piece of cinema. realism is by far this movies best aspect. the story is being told by henry hill and the movie portrayed the actual events from the actual point of view it was lived from. in this movie you won't know anything henry hill doesn't know. for example towards the end (not a spoiler don't worry) henry hill's wife was told to go into a shop and pick up a dress, she felt as if she was going to walk into a trap and get whacked. so she left in hurry, we aren't told whether she was actually going to get whacked... we aren't shown a piece of evidence other than there are people in that store and they stopped talking the second she walked up. we don't know if it was actually going to happen, because the real henry hill didn't know if it was actually going to happen. that is realism, that is a movie that stays true to the person's point of view. there are tons of those tiny little details like that in the movie. and while they maybe minor details to the story, they actually show the true cinematic genius that went into this absolutely amazing movie.";28 August 2013;10;['great', 'great', 'realistic', 'fine', 'epic', 'full', 'colorful', 'organic', 'able', 'amazing', 'real', 'sure', 'real', 'real', 'possible', 'real', 'more', 'good', 'crazy', 'real', 'epic', 'visual', 'realistic', 'human', 'amazing', 'good', 'actual', 'actual', 'other', 'second', 'real', 'true', 'tiny', 'little', 'minor', 'true', 'cinematic', 'amazing'];0.269758064516129

638;pratyush-03848;"goodfellas has got to be one of the best mob movies i have seen. not only that, it is probably the best scorsese film i have seen so far. the acting, the dialogues, the setting, everything in this film is brilliant. anyone who watches this film is guaranteed to love it. the plot is based on a true story of a real life mobster henry hill. it follows his beginnings as a kid growing up in brooklyn who eventually works for a crime family. the reason why he wants to work for a crime family, is because ""as far back as he can remember he always wanted to be a gangster."" henry's life as a mobster forms the rest of the movie. henry hill is played by ray liotta, an actor that i wish to see more on the big screens. his portrayal of the real life gangster is as realistic as it gets. from the mannerisms to the speech delivery, it is almost like we are all thinking this is a real gangster. robert de niro plays jimmy gent, who takes henry under his wing and in a way mentors him. the other guy jimmy takes with him and who eventually works with henry is tommy devito, played by joe pesci. this to me is the best performance of the film. devito is a character with a short fuse and pesci played the character to perfection. this film shows why he is one of the finest actors of his generation and why he won an oscar for his role. to me, his performance is what you will think of when the movie is over. all in all this was a fantastic film and definitely one of the best mob movies ever. as i said before, everything aspect of the film from start to finish is incredible. this is a film that no one should ever miss, especially if you are one who loves mob movies.";21 December 2015;8;['good', 'good', 'scorsese', 'brilliant', 'true', 'real', 'more', 'big', 'real', 'realistic', 'real', 'other', 'good', 'short', 'fine', 'fantastic', 'good', 'incredible'];0.4699404761904762

640;coolfasho-1;"having seen this film almost every other week for approximately five years, i think its time to express my true opinion on one of martin scorsese's finest finest film. in this iconic mobster film, martin scorsese idyllically illustrates the corrupt, avaricious and precarious lives of three mutual, malevolent partners who orchestrate brutal acts of irrational violence to procure money, take on business ownership, and establish naval and trucking deals to generate gargantuan sums of money. the first scene is imperative, because it brings the entire film into a whole new perspective. the word ""mafia"" is used scarcely in the film, if not used at all, because the first scene sums up the identity of the protagonists in such a sublime way. it begins with an opaque image of an old vehicle rambling along a recently paved road out skirted with dead, scraggly trees. an audible thump, followed by the revelation of the blood deluged man whose lying in excruciating pain in the trunk and the beginning narrative along the lines of ""wanting to be a gangster"" set the entire saga in motion. we learn that the narrator has always wanted to be a gangster and followed by this want comes scenes of his early childhood life where he personally ran errands for smalltime mobs located in various fronts ranging from pizza parlors to restaurants. the first jobs were banal.. innocuous store owners who refused to relinquish their businesses to the mob need only have their car windows smashed before their minds were changed. periodically it would require more effort, such as the immolation of their vehicles altogether but they would give in sooner or later. this is where the narrator played his role. the insignificant errands, the parking of cars, the dismembering of cars and the conflagration of cars were all atrocities executed by him, but overall orchestrated by the mob. the narrator's childhood life plays an imperative role to his participance in ""real mafia business"" because it shows how ultimately necessary this life was for him. as directly quoted: ""for them(the narrator's parents) the cabstand was just a part time job, but for me it was definitely full time."" that's all i wanted to do. manipulated by the propaganda that mob life was his destiny he isolates himself from the face of reality and follows his own fabricated truths. due to the fact that working for the mob and being a gangster was so essential to him, he began disassociating himself from his parents at an early age and following his own whims and paths to success, until finally he had grown so attached to the strictures of mob life that he returned home to his mother one day in a stately suit, tie and considerably opulent formal shoes only to be remonstrated by his mother for ""looking like a gangster"". another moral factor which eventually dies within the narrator in his childhood life is sympathy. when a man runs along the sidewalk, erratically vociferating that he has been shot, the narrator who is, at the time in the mob's pizza parlor, succors him, due to the fact that he had never seen a person shot and bleeding before and he ""felt bad for the guy"". in his adolescent life, the narrator meets and becomes very affable with james conway (robert de niro) who is one of the main mafia mob leaders right under pauline. again his involvement increases and by the time he is an adult, the narrator is executing trucking heists on an underground market near the airport, a very lucrative underground market where pauline gets the most for his ""protection"" the mobsters get their cuts and the trucking companies are deprived of their earnings. later the narrator marries and becomes involved more in more, in heroin deals, a bank heist and the assault of a certain man who lands both jimmy and himself and prison. followed by the memorable and comical histrionic performance of joe pesci as tommy devito and the interesting classical music which arbitrarily plays during scenes of the narrator's early childhood and later in softer tones throughout the villainous executions of mobster deals and altercations, goodfellas is an iconic classic which is categorized with other timeless classics such as the godfarther part i and ii and pulp fiction.";26 November 2006;10;['other', 'true', 'fine', 'fine', 'iconic', 'corrupt', 'avaricious', 'precarious',

664;jorn-truyen;"""it was a glorious time."" glorious doesn't begin to describe this 1990 gangster flick by martin scorsese, starring ray liotta, joe pesci and the inevitable robert de niro. it quickly became a cult classic and therefore it was no coincidence that legendary film critic roger ebert called it the greatest mob film of all time. goodfellas deals with the rise and downfall of half-irish, half- italian mobster henry hill. born in an italian-american neighborhood in brooklyn, henry hill is soon intrigued by the lifestyle of the local mafia family. henry becomes a part of the crime organization, which includes jimmy conway (robert de niro) and tommy devito (joe pesci). henry enjoys the luxuries of being with the mafia for several years and finds a wife in karen (lorraine bracco). he earns his living by robbing, racketeering and other criminal activities. however, eventually, the gangster life becomes too much for him and in order to avoid being imprisoned, he goes into the witness protection program. he incriminates all of his former friends and is forced to give up the exciting gangster lifestyle to live the rest of his life ""like a schnook"". there are several reasons why goodfellas can be considered a great film and a must-see . firstly, scorsese's movies are known for their adept use of music, and goodfellas isn't any different. nobody wanted to be in morrie's (chuck low) shoes after robert de niro stared at him for 60 seconds, cream's sunshine of your love rendering the situation exceedingly frightening. every scene is accompanied by music appropriate to the scene, as well as captivating the setting in which goodfellas is set. secondly, the acting performances in goodfellas are memorable to say the least. de niro is practically born to play a mafioso, but the most remarkable performance is perhaps that of joe pesci, in his portrayal of tommy devito, an italian-american gangster with a short fuse. pesci sucks all the attention towards him in every scene, which results in a great mixture of hilarious and shocking moments. strangely, even though he has a (psychopathic) tendency towards violence, you empathize with tommy, which is all pesci's credit for making him a 'family man'. the academy thankfully rewarded him for his troubles with an oscar for best supporting actor. goodfellas deals with important themes such as love, marriage, family and crime. therefore, what makes this gangster film so enduring and interesting is the sympathetic and likable characters which the actors bring to the screen. often, gangster movies are associated with stereotypical characters, ""tough guys"" who love to 'lean on a guy' or push the proverbial 'button'. however, marty shows us the human side of these gangsters. therefore, this duality in the characters intensifies the shock you endure when for example tommy suddenly violently erupts. for all the above reasons, i consider goodfellas a must-see and modern classic like no other. goodfellas is full of quotable and funny dialogues (funny how?) and excellent acting, making it one of the greatest movies of all time.";22 January 2014;10;['glorious', 'glorious', 'inevitable', 'legendary', 'great', 'half', 'irish', 'italian', 'italian', 'american', 'local', 'several', 'other', 'criminal', 'much', 'former', 'exciting', 'several', 'great', 'adept', 'different', 'low', 'frightening', 'appropriate', 'memorable', 'least', 'remarkable', 'italian', 'american', 'short', 'great', 'hilarious', 'shocking', 'psychopathic', 'good', 'important', 'such', 'interesting', 'sympathetic', 'likable', 'stereotypical', 'tough', 'proverbial', 'human', 'above', 'modern', 'other', 'full', 'quotable', 'funny', 'funny', 'excellent', 'great'];0.1807328605200945

676;heero_yuy2;"well everyone's telling it and i hadn't tried it once, not even in cable. so here's my two cents worth of it. ray liotta plays an italian-irish boy obsessed with becoming a gangster. while seemingly getting close to a certain ""main man"" in the streets, his dreams suddenly became a reality, getting friends with two gangsters, all the money, a wife and kids, even girls, fame and fortune, all that he wanted to be...until things gone haywire. i know scorcese is a great director, but this movie seemed like a raging bull reunion with pesci and de niro, not to mention de niro being worn out as a mafia/local gangster in his role, and pesci uncontrollable in his role that i can't seem to understand he began and end up that way. if i was a gangster, i never would had liked that guy to be met in the first place...and how did liotta get close to him? the cinematography is too much pizazz by the 90's edge that it end up being boring in, like, more than 2 hours of it (the way scorcese make his movies these days). too complicated idea that liotta's role end up seeking witness protection against his ""friends"". the only thing i was impressed is paul sorvino's role. i think scorcese is starting to diminish his quality movie-making and style with this movie, focusing more on popularity of stars and movie length rather than a stylish, good story movie. i had much fun better watching taxi driver, king of comedy, last temptation of christ, and my favorite, raging bull. i'm sorry for the negative criticisms on this famous movie, but that's how i see it in an unbiased way. although pileggi initially wrote the novel good, he edited it with boggleness for the movie, which, err, hadn't got better.";20 August 2005;5;['worth', 'italian', 'irish', 'close', 'certain', 'main', 'great', 'local', 'uncontrollable', 'first', 'close', 'much', 'more', 'complicated', 'only', 'impressed', 'stylish', 'good', 'much', 'last', 'favorite', 'sorry', 'negative', 'famous', 'unbiased', 'novel', 'well'];0.2174185463659148
677;kitteh_harbls;"...which is hard to say. this is one of those all-too-rare moments where the praise showered upon a movie truly lives up to its hype. the accolades and critical acclaim this movie has been receiving (and will continue to receive) are truly deserved. teenyboppers, however, don't attend, please. anyone who was dying to watch britney's crossroads movie: steer clear, otherwise you'll feel a compelling urge to come here on imdb's board and voice your idiocy to the whole world in the ever-so-repetitive: ""this movie iz overrated"". here are the reasons this movie is considered by me and many others (including critics and movie buffs) to be one of the greatest movies ever made: (1) martin scorsese. he's the director, and he's the number one reason this movie is so, so good. there are three factors that make marty a master of his craft (in no particular order): first, he has vision. talent. the stuff. he has what it takes to be a director. he knows what to do, where to do it, when to do it and how to do it. he knows what works and what doesn't work. he knows when something is almost good (hence push it to be good) or overdone (hence take it down a notch). that's the first factor of his greatness: talent, and skill. second, his amazing attention to detail. in his movies, everything has to be just perfect. 'nuff said about this. third (and his one sets him apart from the majority of the great directors), he has a rare (perhaps perfectly unique) ability to direct the worst actors and absolute novices and turn them into acting gods and goddesses. i do not think there has been any director, past or present, that has this ability. marty ensures that every single line, body movement, facial expression, voice tone and what have you are convincing...to the extreme. the realism of it, in fact, can be so creepy (seen taxi driver?). sharon stone's first nomination came late in her career (in 1995) when marty directed her. marty directed a new actress (cathy moriarity) in raging bull and had her nominated for an oscar. the same for joe pesci in the same movie (he was new back then). when pesci won his first oscar, it was scorsese who directed him (in this very movie, goodfellas). (2) the cast. this is the second reason this movie is so great. joe pesci is a psychotically violent thug, ray liotta as the lead in this biographical picture (mostly biographical, with quite a few artistic liberties), deniro as liotta's take-no-prisoners boss, and most importantly (for me anyway), paul sorvino, as the capo regime for the big crime family he's working for. he heads this group of thugs and they all report to him. sorvino delivered one of the scariest, most intimidating performances ever, in any movie. the terror he strikes into your heart as the feared, imposing mob boss is matched by very few in other mob movies. even don vito corleone had a softer, more courteous, more diplomatic side. paulie cicero (sorvino's character, based on a real mobster called paul vario), however, is terrifically intimidating. i remember an interview with paul sorvino (a few years ago) in which he says some goodfellas fans tremble when they meet him, still shaken up by his dead-on performance. and, i don't blame them. incidentally, let me combine the first point and the second point to produce this little back-up trivia: during the course of the movie, sorvino improvises a slap to liotta's face, which he receives with a stunned, surprised look against sorvino's static, icey face. that slap was real, and liotta didn't know it was coming. scorsese left it in the movie because of that reason. that's a demonstration of point 1 (scorsese's brilliance and attention to detail) and 2 (the cast, i.e. sorvino's emotionless, scary look in this case). (3) the story. the story this movie is based on is real. however, not every single thing in this movie happened. there were some liberties taken; some improvisations and some modifications. in any case, the story is superbly immersive and interesting. to top it all off, the movie runs at past 2 hours, so you get a heavy dose of movie pleasure. (4) the music. the period music was used to perfection, although this can belong to point #1, but i thought it deserves its own point. the first song you hear (along with a paused shot of ray liotta's face) is ""rags to riches"" by tony bennet, which really sets the mood for the movie at its beginning and adds a little preview at the same time (the story is about henry hill's rise to power from a small, underprivileged family). the songs are matched brilliantly to the scenes and chosen with utmost care. so, dear reader, these are the four main points that i believe made this movie what it is: a cinematic masterpiece and one of the greatest movies ever made. inevitably, and because of the movie's supreme power and brilliance, it will always be compared to the godfather, but the two are essential different. whereas goodfellas is the story of one man's journey through crime, the godfather is about a whole family's ups and downs. the term ""mob movie"" is applied very loosely to the two. it's just a general label. so, it's futile to compare them, because they're two superb pictures. but a personal observation of mine is that the godfather is great as a whole, whereas goodfellas outshines it in many little details that make it more than the sum of its parts. beyond that, they're both great and neither is better than the other, so to speak. the movie's violent though, so it ain't for the squeamish. but that's all irrelevant. those are just little post-it notes on the back cover of a whole book on how to make movies that time will eternally remember.";24 January 2007;10;['hard', 'rare', 'critical', 'clear', 'compelling', 'whole', 'repetitive', 'many', 'great', 'good', 'particular', 'good', 'good', 'first', 'amazing', 'perfect', 'third', 'great', 'rare', 'unique', 'bad', 'absolute', 'past', 'present', 'single', 'facial', 'convincing', 'creepy', 'first', 'new', 'cathy', 'same', 'same', 'new', 'first', 'scorsese', 'very', 'second', 'great', 'violent', 'biographical', 'biographical', 'few', 'artistic', 'capo', 'big', 'scary', 'intimidating', 'few', 'other', 'soft', 'courteous', 'diplomatic', 'real', 'few', 'dead', 'first', 'second', 'little', 'stunned', 'surprised', 'real', 'scary', 'real', 'single', 'immersive', 'interesting', 'past', 'heavy', 'own', 'first', 'tony', 'little', 'same', 'small', 'underprivileged', 'utmost', 'dear', 'main', 'cinematic', 'great', 'essential', 'different', 'whole', 'general', 'futile', 'superb', 'personal', 'great', 'many', 'little', 'more', 'great', 'well', 'other', 'violent', 'irrelevant', 'little', 'post', 'back', 'whole'];0.119680936347603

710;ryan-bfd;"goodfellas is a one of a kind film. that feels kind of strange to write considering that this film has been repeatedly attempted to be copied. the narration, the fourth wall breaks, the over-the-top violence; it all seems like a cliche in the ""true-crime"" genre. blow, casino, the wolf of wall street, donnie brasco and many more films have tried to capture the same essence that goodfellas had back when it was released in 1990. but, in this film-lover's humble opinion, they have all failed. that's because goodfellas holds a style and atmosphere all of its own. but in the minds of the hollywood ""big-wigs"", if something works once then it must work a dozen more times. which is why every year we get an eye-rolling remake of a movie that was just fine when it came out. as i am typing this a remake of the 1959 classic ben-hur is about to be released. a film that won a record eleven oscars is being remade! and, needless to say,many, including myself, do not think this film will hold up in comparison to its predecessor. anyways, i think that the same thing is happening with goodfellas in a more indirect way. i don't think that it will ever be remade frame-by- frame, but stylistically, it has been remade a dozen times, including a few times by scorsese himself. it feels like every time scorsese releases a new film it is trying to top goodfellas, but no matter how good his films get, they never do. goodfellas is his crowning achievement and it always will be. because you can't remake goodfellas, you can only come close. the acting, the camera movement, the cinematography, the lighting, the writing, and the overall unapologetic grit all come together to make a cinematic masterpiece and one of the best crime films of all time. i'm not saying that this film is better than the godfather, but if you made that argument, many film-buffs would have a hard time debating you. joe pesci's oscar- winning performance is just one of the many great highlights of this film. jaw-dropping aggression, unchained violent nature, and unmercifully abhorrent personality highlight the surrealistically vicious world of henry hill (played by ray liotta). that and his narration which sounds more like reminiscence rather than straight-forward storytelling. henry hill describes his time in the mob in a musing tone as if to show admiration for his sinful past-life. say what you will about how the true story actually relates to the film, but there is no denying that this film captured the spirit of henry hill and the mafia lifestyle. and that's what a good film based on a true story does. a biographic film is by no means a frame-by- frame record of every factual event that happened in an individual's life, but rather an homage that sums up that person's life and what impact it had on other people. even if it was a negative impact, it can still make for a d****-good story. i could write about this movie for a hundred more paragraphs talking about scorsese's decision in camera movement, the amazing performances given by the various actors and actresses (robert de niro, ray liota, lorraine bracco, frank vincent, even samuel jackson's small role), the way that the screenwriter, nicholas pileggi, nailed the character narration, fourth wall breaks, and witty dialogue just right, and a bunch of other elements that bring this film together so beautifully. but, to be honest, you wouldn't want to read that much text anyways. so, i will leave it up to the film to show you what i mean. and if you haven't seen this film yet, stop reading this and watch it now. seeing it is always better than talking about. you won't regret it. even if you do, you can still be glad that it was made. without goodfellas, there would be no sopranos, boardwalk empire, pulp fiction and any of your favorite tv shows or movies that were influenced by this movie. goodfellas isn't just a film, it helped make film what it is today.";1 July 2016;8;['kind', 'strange', 'fourth', 'true', 'many', 'more', 'same', 'humble', 'own', 'big', 'more', 'fine', 'about', 'needless', 'many', 'same', 'indirect', 'few', 'scorsese', 'scorsese', 'new', 'good', 'close', 'overall', 'unapologetic', 'cinematic', 'good', 'well', 'many', 'hard', 'many', 'great', 'violent', 'abhorrent', 'vicious', 'straight', 'sinful', 'past', 'true', 'good', 'true', 'biographic', 'factual', 'other', 'negative', 'more', 'amazing', 'various', 'small', 'fourth', 'witty', 'other', 'honest', 'much', 'well', 'glad', 'favorite'];0.159816247582205
711;jhnachos;goodfellas is crime drama that came out almost 25 years ago and it still stands as by far the best mob movie ever made. the film is about of the true story of former gangster henry hill, who worked his up the ranks to become a big time gangster in new york in the 1960's. the film focuses on hill working his way from a child gangster to becoming a popular gangster in the mob. the story flows very well and without any noticeable bumps in the movie. the story is easy to follow and not very confusing. the film just focuses on the ride of henry hill as a new york gangster, however no film is perfect, my only critique or criticism with the film is that at some point for a couple of minutes it seemed like the film dragged on with the plot. however, i barely noticed it, so it isn't that big of a deal. henry hill is a bad guy, but at the same time you can't help but just feel for him. in a world where gangsters spend their time murdering and stealing, hill seems like the one who has a heart, even if it is hard to see. the acting is as good as i thought it would be. henry hill is played ray liotta, and he does a really good job of portraying the young gangster, but he was overshadowed by supporting cast. robert de niro does a amazing job playing the veteran gangster who lives in a world surrounded by guns, money, sex and violence. he made me hate him and feel for him at many different points in the film. he carried the film nicely and kept me interested. tommy devito is played by joe pesci and he has never been better. this is one of his best performances as a violent and humorous psycho who will make jokes and then start shooting people around him. he made me think that there is no way that anyone this crazy exists, but at the same time, he was my favorite character throughout the film. joe pesci fits the role perfectly. the rest of the cast is also delivers but with de niro and pesci performances i didn't care that much about the other performances. goodfellas had 12 different songs, playing at 12 different points and all of the music flowed together very well. i don't think the score could've been better fit for the tone and atmosphere of the movie. during tense situations or heart pounding moments the music is always there to build the atmosphere, and make the scene in the movie seem meaningful even when it doesn't matter that much. the score just works so well with the movie and makes moments that already stand out even more intense. few movies have the ability to create a feeling to the viewer and then double that feeling with the music that is playing. the screenplay and the script is also very well done. martin scorsese does a great job of showing the life of henry hill using convincing dialogue and scenes. i loved the way events played out. it seems like the events were played out in a real life scenario. also this movie has some of my favorite quotes and scenes i have ever seen in a movie. nothing in this movie is predictable or cliche at any point of the film. whenever something important happened it wasn't predictable, and at some points of the film, i was caught off guard completely. the dialogue also made every scene seem meaningful even when it didn't affect the plot of the film or change the characters in a major or dramatic way. when a scene was full of suspense, the dialogue made all of it full of anticipation and gripped me in a very memorizing way. i may be talking about the dialogue a lot, but it did help the film a lot by building the situations and making every scene have deeper meaning. the dialogue was my favorite part of the film. the overall theme is forgiveness and if the main character can live with himself with all of the brutal things he does to other people. i couldn't think of a better way to show this theme by taking the true story of a gangster and bringing back to life. with great acting, a well made script, convincing dialogue, an amazing atmosphere and compelling story make goodfellas one of the best movies of all time. if you haven't seen this movie, i recommend you do, this is the best mob movie ever made.;18 March 2017;10;['good', 'true', 'former', 'big', 'popular', 'noticeable', 'easy', 'confusing', 'perfect', 'only', 'big', 'bad', 'same', 'hard', 'good', 'good', 'young', 'amazing', 'many', 'different', 'interested', 'well', 'good', 'violent', 'humorous', 'crazy', 'same', 'favorite', 'much', 'other', 'different', 'different', 'well', 'fit', 'tense', 'meaningful', 'much', 'intense', 'few', 'great', 'convincing', 'real', 'favorite', 'predictable', 'important', 'predictable', 'meaningful', 'major', 'dramatic', 'full', 'full', 'memorizing', 'deep', 'favorite', 'overall', 'main', 'brutal', 'other', 'well', 'true', 'great', 'convincing', 'amazing', 'compelling', 'good', 'good'];0.2048132183908046

719;vinniejo;goodfellas will always figure as one of the best gangster movies of all time. it makes you transcend into a whole new world, i.e .a 'gangster's world'. it's a world where the rules of the game are dictated by the person who's got the money & power. it is essentially the story of an irish boy, henry hill (ray liotta) who grows up in a gangster neighborhood & always aspires to be a gangster. it's the glamor, power, thrill & money associated with the life of a gangster that really attracts him towards it. the fact that gangsters are not governed by any law that is applicable for the ordinary citizen. he rises up the ranks from being a small time thug to an influential & trusted aide of a big shot named james conway (robert de niro). it is this journey of his, which is the focal point of this movie. after joining the gangster world, all his attributes reflect the influence of james conway, who is someone he looks up to. like most of the gangster movies, even this one ends with the fall of its central character as he succumbs to the traps which are associated with gangster world. it has the usual drugs & weapons angle also. one thing which really stands out in this movie is the direction & screenplay which makes you sit on the edge of the seat for the entire movie. the nuances of each & every character, including that of the wives of the gangsters is extremely well brought out & every scene is extremely powerful. ray liotta is average at best & i believe that martin scorsese could have done with a more intense actor. robert de niro is his usual self, but, the real show stealer is joe pesci. he has given a truly fantabulous performance. his character (tommy devito) is similar to the one he played in casino, that of a loose cannon who likes to use his gun, more than his head. who can forget the whole 'funny guy' scene which triggers a series of laughter riots. the chemistry of the trio of robert de niro, scorsese & joe pesci once again comes through after raging bull & casino. this is one movie which should be inducted in the gangster movie hall of fame along with scarface & pulp fiction.;1 November 2007;9;['good', 'whole', 'new', 'irish', 'applicable', 'ordinary', 'small', 'influential', 'big', 'focal', 'most', 'central', 'usual', 'entire', 'powerful', 'average', 'good', 'intense', 'usual', 'real', 'fantabulous', 'similar', 'loose', 'more', 'whole', 'funny'];0.1208836617927527

find out that the land due to a new construction project. henry soon takes a mistress. karen pulls a gun on him, he overpowers her and tells her that he has bigger worries than her, like getting killed on the street. paulie meets him and orders him to return to her, and sends him with jimmy to recover money from a defaulter. but the target's sister is a typist with fbi, she turns over the entire gang (her brother included) to the police. in order to make his ends meet, henry resorts to drug running from jail. upon release from prison in 1978,he continues his cocaine trading which he had started in jail, much to the disapproval of paulie who sternly warns him to stop it immediately. he not only ignores this warning, but ropes in jimmy and tommy and various other people, including karen, his daughters babysitter and a new drug addict girlfriend. the same year, henry along with the crew, carries out the lufthansa heist in jfk airport , which is the biggest hijacking of goods in us history.some gang members start spending the proceeds from the heist immediately, buying expensive things that put them in the spotlight. jimmy promptly has them murdered and later on,also has one by one all the other participants of the heist murdered, their corpses turning up in different parts of the city for months. henry knows that jimmy has all the cash from the heist, and he is merely eliminating the partners to have it all to himself, but cant do anything. one day, tommy is lured by promises to make him a made man and killed, by his own gang members as a revenge for the murder of billy batts in order to make peace with the gambinos. by 1980, henry is a cocaine addicted wreck, sustaining himself solely by drug running, due to which he has alienated paulie and the others. he is on the constant surveillance of the fbi , who finally tail him an entire and arrest him. during his absence, his house is also raided, and karen in order to evade arrest and conviction flushes down the entire cocaine stash, thereby rendering themselves virtually penniless. jimmy goes to paulie for help, who being angry with him due to his drug operations, pays him $3200 and ends all association with him.he gets a final shock when he realizes that jimmy intends to have him killed, by setting him up in a hit, in order to erase the last link between him and the lufthansa heist. with no other way to save himself and his family, henry agrees to become an fbi informant under the witness protection plan. as a result of his collaboration and his testimony, paulie, jimmy and all the major members of the gang are arrested and sentenced to long terms in prison without parole. henry himself gets a sentence which is further reduced due to his collaboration. the last shot of the film shows a very vulnerable looking henry hill ,now divorced, who in a final voice over says that the good times are over and that he is penniless just like the average working people that he used to ridicule .the closing credits show his fate and that of all the others in the gang, being put away for life. scorsese maintains a good pace, with a crisp background narration. gangsters are shown as what they are, vermin beneath the shining suits . it perfectly shows that crime never pays giving the message subtly, sans preaching or moral dialogues, instead leaving the viewer to figure it out as the film goes along. ray liotta plays henry efficiently, right from the background narration to his transition from a brash gangster to a sorry shadow of his former self. lorraine bracco is fine as karen. robert deniro very beautifully portrays the cunning & vicious jimmy conway ,a friend one instant and a killer the next, his screen time is shorter than usual but just as effective. but the show stealer is joe pesci as the psychopathic tommy vito who is crazy & vicious at the same time, as the one who intimidates henry or the one who calmly shoots a waiter for being late in serving him. oscars snubbed this great work and only joe pesci got his due. but it rightly was a commercial & critical success and will always remain a favourite for any avid film viewer.;14 October

2006) series tv gangster theme program (voted the best written dramatic tv series in tv history by the writers guild of america) is largely based on story telling and structural approach used in goodfellas (1990). goodfellas (1990) lead actress lorainne bracco also appeared in the sopranos (1999 -

1980 time as a mafie associate criminal, and also again after he entered the federal government witness protection program after he was arrested and convicted for drug crimes. he served a total of 14 years in prison. he was kicked out of the witness protection program in 1991 as a result of his participation in goodfellas (1990) movie publicity and his efforts to make himself a public celebrity made famous by that movie and the book wiseguy. he survived another 21 years after leaving federal government protection until his 2012 death. he was paid more than half a million dollars for his part and contribution to the making of the goodfellas (1990) movie. he lived and died in open prosperity and was never attacked or harmed by presumably vengeful former associates from the mafia. henry hill's life after 1980 in the us federal government witness protection program was presented and treated in comic form in a second movie about him titled my blue heaven (1991) written by wisseguy author's book author and movie script writer wife of fame, nora ephron. ephron wass famous for her comedy book writing (she wrote best seller crazy salad in the early 1970's) and comedy movie script writing (she wrote when harry met sally 1988 starring billy crystal and meg ryan). the goodfellas (1990) movie describes the famous lufthansa aircraft heist of 1978, one of the largest robberies in usa history. that robbery was the subject of a movie titled the 10 million dollar getaway, and included several cast members who acted in goodfellas (1990). goodfellas (1990) is by any measure an astonishing and worthy movie. it is a portrait of urban america in the mid-20th century. used copies of the movie can be purchased from amazon.com for tiny money (less than $5 as of 2017). this movie is worth study and re-screening often. it is a highwater mark of usa cinema. ------------------------------ written by tex allen, movie historian, movie history teacher, sag-aftra career movie actor. more about tex allen on imdb.com which has published 220 of his movie reviews as of december 2017). ---------------------------";27 December 2017;10;['major', 'high', 'good', 'good', 'western', 'true', 'important', 'fellow', 'italian', 'great', 'western', 'good', 'top', 'good', 'same', 'federal', 'national', 'good', 'irish', 'italian', 'aged', 'italian', 'federal', 'fellow', 'federal', 'mass', 'near', 'illegal', 'long', 'fellow', 'certain', 'long', 'trivia', 'many', 'famous', 'different', 'sound', 'dramatic', 'structural', 'tony', 'minor', 'former', 'other', 'good', 'other', 'several', 'famous', 'extensive', 'real', 'federal', 'public', 'famous', 'federal', 'more', 'open', 'vengeful', 'former', 'federal', 'comic', 'second', 'blue', 'famous', 'good', 'crazy', 'early', 'famous', 'large', 'several', 'astonishing', 'worthy', 'urban', 'tiny', 'less', 'worth', 'more'];0.1930734126984127

759;the_stiff_meister;"everything about this movie is absolutely perfect it is without a doubt pretty much the high point of everyone involved and the definitive film of the 1990s and one of the best films of all time. co-written by the writer of the book wisegy nicholas pileggi this fact based film upon the rise and fall of gangster henry hill(played to perfection by ray liotta) the film charts his friendships, loves and rivalries among the mob he longed to be against the backdrop of new york in the 1950s, 60s and 70s. the film starts in 1955 as 12 year old henry hill is watching the gangsters across the street wishing he could be like them in no time at all he is taken in by them and grows up among them much to the dismay of his parents and becomes a pupil under the mob boss paulie cicero(an effective paul sorvino) and also around the same time introduced to a top popular gangster jimmy ""the gent"" conway(robert de niro in one of his finest performances) and is taken under his wing. only a minority of the action takes place in the 1950s the majority takes place in the 60s and 70s and that is mostly when we meet the majority of the films cast with characters such as tommy desimmone(joe pesci in his oscar winning turn) a psychotic wild man with too much to prove and then there is karen(lorraine bracco in her best performance) the at time loving but at others estranged wife of henry. martin scorsese really breathes life into this film really making you believe you are in 70s nyc wit these men the script is top notch and as good as anything ever written another thing is that scorsese makes you like these guys he makes you ""like"" henry hill even though he is a cheating, gambling drug addicted criminal you like and respect him and root for him during the movie equally likable are joe pesci's deranged character who is a killer and who seemingly takes great delight in doing so however the guilt he feels is evident and after cold bloodedly shooting spider it is clear through his ""don't care"" antics that he regrets going too far, robert de niro is very likable as the man who could be your best friend one minute and your deadliest enemy the next his character reminds me of his character from heat who doesn't look upon the people around him as friends merely assocaites. with great script, direction and acting this is one the best films you're ever likely to see if haven't seen it then what are you waiting for and if you have seen then watch it again also there is a great performance from the sopranos star michael imperioli in a small role";18 June 2007;10;['perfect', 'high', 'definitive', 'good', 'much', 'effective', 'same', 'top', 'popular', 'fine', 'such', 'psychotic', 'wild', 'much', 'good', 'estranged', 'top', 'notch', 'good', 'likable', 'great', 'evident', 'cold', 'clear', 'likable', 'good', 'deadly', 'next', 'great', 'good', 'likely', 'great', 'small'];0.3620987654320988

761;aboettinger1;"if stream of consciousness, ""tell, don't show"" storytelling is your thing, you'll probably love this movie. it might be the laziest film i have ever seen. don't get me wrong, i love martin scorsese; the departed is on my top 5 movies. but this movie somehow fell short in almost every way i can imagine. i honestly don't understand how it is rated so highly. the only thing it got right was the time period-set design, costume, cars, period acting- all of that was on point. everything else felt... just off. the acting was over the top, storytelling was jarring and totally out of pace for the characters, especially considering their supposed ages at any given time relative to each other and themselves. they say someone is 21 but they look 35. i think deniro's character was supposed to be in his 20's at one point but he looks 40. it just gets worse from there-trying to keep everyone's age difference in line as the story progresses because they all look the same age. and the narration. just. won't. stop. and it's not even one character telling the story. that i could understand. not forgivable. but i could understand that. characters just randomly start narrating their thoughts out of nowhere. it's a jarring whiplash storytelling method of which i have never seen/heard and can't for the life of me figure out. when a character needs to explain how they're feeling: narration! when the audience might not understand someone's motives: narration! if there's even the slightest doubt that someone might have motives other than what you see on screen: narration! so don't worry, the filmmaker will make sure you never feel anything other than what they want you to feel at any given moment through, you guessed it: narration! i get what the narration is, to some degree; it's a distraction from the reality of what's really taking place. it's a deception of what we're seeing on screen, i think. to the audience, if you can drown them with narration over substance, perhaps they will find the overall end result exquisite. hit them with thougts and platitudes and drop the finale on them as character development. it's like, ""see, they came a long way from where they were before because their thought process changed"". only, the writers couldn't figure out how to naturally incorporate their thoughts and emotions, so they gave them pages of narration. there were so many scenes that characters had the perfect opertunity to express their thoughts and feeling in a natural way through dialogue in the scene or just through simple expression, and yet here they were, waxing ineloquent on the inner goings on of their minds. i'm sure this has something to do with it being adapted from a book, but i don't think that's a valid excuse for any film, much less a scorsese one. narration aside, the acting was severely over the top, especially by pesci and liotta. there were several scenes where their characters seemed to play off of each others overacting to the detriment of the overall tone of the story. some things just didn't make sense, like stabbing a guy multiple times to kill him and then shooting him. why not just shoot him? or just stab him? shooting him was going to draw attention to their location so it made no sense. things like this stand out in a movie that prides itself on realism and i simply find it goofy and boring. overall, i found this movie nearly unwatchable due to the lazy storytelling and narration. even the narrators themselves lacked emotion leaving me feeling numb to the story and characters. it was like they were begging me to ignore them. so i did.";16 August 2021;5;['lazy', 'wrong', 'top', 'short', 'only', 'right', 'jarring', 'relative', 'other', 'bad', 'same', 'forgivable', 'jarring', 'slight', 'other', 'sure', 'other', 'overall', 'long', 'many', 'perfect', 'natural', 'simple', 'inner', 'sure', 'valid', 'less', 'scorsese', 'several', 'overall', 'multiple', 'boring', 'unwatchable', 'lazy', 'numb'];-0.0231937602627257
762;sdrake2-53-373531;brilliance. this film reeks of brilliance. from the direction, to the screenplay, to the cast. everything in this film is flawless. but, i shall go into more detail to explain this film's brilliance. mobster films are one of my favorite film genres, and i am sure many people share that same liking. they always produce a weird sense of suspense, intrigue, and mystification. the godfather emblazoned the mobster genre, marking a true cinematic farce and a very good milestone in film making. after the godfather, many people tried out their hands on mobster films, but none equaled the impact and quality of the godfather until scorsese made goodfellas. goodfellas biggest quality is that it is based on a true story. this makes the film even more interesting and likable, seeing as most of the events portrayed really happened. the story of henry hill was a perfect foreground. on the acting side of things, there is nothing to really to complain about. the actors gave powerhouse performances, particularly joe pesci and ray liotta. joe pesci really gives a genuinely terrifying yet hilarious character performance. he is truly believable and ultimately ruthless. liotta is spectacular. no more to add to that. he really showed the world that he could truly act when he did this movie. as for robert deniro, he shines in every scene he is in, but my only quibble is the fact we didn't get to see more of his character. he seemed interesting, but we didn't really get any insight. lorraine bracco has an annoying voice, but she does give a great, passionate and sympathetic performance as liotta's wife. the direction by scorsese is flawless. his choices were brilliant. he really gives a documentary style of direction, as if we are there observing the everyday life of the mafia. his fade outs are poignant, and his choices for the background music are a plus. as a whole, goodfellas gives a great insight into the mafia. it throws away the stereotypes we usually associate with those who are in the mafia, and it really has an impact. with terrific actors,top notch direction, an excellent, precise screenplay, and a great story, what is there not to like about this film? i highly recommend this film to everyone, and it should become a part of your movie library immediately.;2 January 2012;10;['flawless', 'more', 'favorite', 'sure', 'many', 'same', 'weird', 'true', 'cinematic', 'good', 'many', 'big', 'true', 'interesting', 'likable', 'most', 'perfect', 'terrifying', 'hilarious', 'believable', 'ruthless', 'spectacular', 'more', 'only', 'quibble', 'more', 'interesting', 'annoying', 'great', 'passionate', 'sympathetic', 'flawless', 'brilliant', 'everyday', 'poignant', 'great', 'terrific', 'top', 'excellent', 'precise', 'great'];0.34125
763;dick6756;"this film is, to me, one of the best mob films. in my mind, it outperforms godfather(1972) and top all of mafia films except infernal affairs(2002), which is too often classified into ""cops & robbers movies"" by me. by the way, infernal affairs is later on adapted for a new american one, named the departed(2006), which is, to me, one of the worst films partly because i find it that there is a inconsistency between the original and the remake. and the main reason i dislike the departed(2006) is, i think, the original is so perfect that any remake that attempt to pay homage to it would be disgraceful. let's get down to goodfellas (1990). in comparison with those remakes and fictional stories, goodfellas is real, of course real because, after all, it is based on a real story. i know, godfather is regard as one of the greatest films throughout the film history, but it is just make up by a genius, who creates it by making some interviews, intergrating some stories heard from others; while goodfellas is a wise-guy's life, real life. i love godfather for sure, and i believe everyone loves it too, as we love romantic legend and epic mythology. however, those stories are far away from us. goodfellas is more human, less romanticized. i believe few people, as a gangster, could lead a life portrayed by godfather. most of us are boorish goodfellas, or wise-guys. that's why i insist that goodfellas be better than godfather. after all, we cannot deny ourselves. speak of the cast of this film, i was familiar with henry at the first sight of him. i must have seen him before, i knew it. it took pains for me to recall which film he showed up in. at long last, i got a hunch that he supposed to star in hannibal lector series, so i got through the cast list of hannibal trilogy. and sure enough, he did. he is the one who wants to arrest hannibal but fails and be one of the toys that hannibal plays with. until now, i can clearly, crystal clearly, remember the bloody disgusting scene that in hannibal (2001), he (starred by ray liotta) is probably hypnotized and hannibal opens his skull, gets a piece of meat out of his brain, and ...... too disgusting to describe furthermore. and he (ray liotta) is the narrator and protagonist of goodfellas. that interests me. from a puppet manipulated by a puppeteer to the narrator and protagonist of goodfellas. while watching the mob lifestyle in goodfellas that borders on the ridiculous, his face always reminds me of the fact that he once shows up in other film and be grinded down by someone sinister. and it gives added zest to my pleasure. tommy(joe pesci) is impressive in the film. he does everything big, regardless of outcome. and it makes the film never become a snooze fest. as long as he is in that scene, you always expect something exciting happen, and he always live up to your expectation. with him, there is an unpredictability in the film. i guess that's why everybody considers it a pity when he is whacked by mafia despite the fact that he is such a rude guy. come on, the film is not a solemn moral lesson. joe pesci is awesome. no wonder he wins an oscar. he totally deserves it. basically, the whole film consists of many fragments of daily life, including eating, drinking, sex, party, robbery, fest and what not. nevertheless, every fragments are interesting enough to keep you focus on the film, and even immerse yourself in being the part of henry's special life. colorful, literally and metaphorically, life. a great deal of lively moving shoots, as well as a bunch of classic 60's and 70's rock 'n roll music, make the film, despite the long running time, full of energy from start to finish.";16 February 2018;10;['good', 'infernal', 'infernal', 'new', 'american', 'bad', 'original', 'main', 'perfect', 'disgraceful', 'fictional', 'real', 'real', 'real', 'great', 'wise', 'real', 'sure', 'romantic', 'epic', 'human', 'romanticized', 'few', 'most', 'boorish', 'wise', 'well', 'familiar', 'first', 'hannibal', 'hannibal', 'hannibal', 'hannibal', 'bloody', 'disgusting', 'hannibal', 'hannibal', 'disgusting', 'ridiculous', 'other', 'impressive', 'big', 'f', 'exciting', 'rude', 'solemn', 'moral', 'awesome', 'whole', 'many', 'daily', 'f', 'interesting', 'special', 'colorful', 'great', 'lively', 'classic', 'long', 'full'];0.1929626623376623

788;chrishavluciyan;goodfellas is one of the best movies i've ever seen. despite the fact that i haven't seen many gangster movies i was impressed by scorcese's masterpiece. the film deals with a child whose only dream - which later comes true - is to become a gangster. henry hill (ray liotta), who is 10 or 12 at the time, starts working at a cab station where his relationship with the italian american mafia starts to grow. he starts doing whatever he wants, stealing and skipping school, and eventually becomes a real mobster. this is the story of henry becoming a big name in the mafia with lots of ups and downs. it has great storytelling aided by an innovative voice-over. some say that voice-over is a lazy way of storytelling but i say that is bs at least when it comes to this movie. the voice belongs to the main character, henry hill. he tells his story in detail and it feels like he is talking to a friend when he is talking to us - his speech is emotional and makes you feel with the characters. in one scene, everything stops and the voice-over becomes alive when henry faces the camera and talks directly to the viewer. cool, right? no need to comment on the performance of the amazing cast: robert deniro, joe pesci, paul sorvino, frank sivero... long story short, it's a movie you'll always remember.;17 October 2016;9;['good', 'many', 'only', 'true', 'italian', 'american', 'real', 'big', 'great', 'innovative', 'lazy', 'least', 'main', 'emotional', 'alive', 'cool', 'right', 'amazing', 'long', 'short'];0.1974937343358396

847;afddiary;"a fantastic, raw movie about mob life. instead of glamorizing, this film shows it as it really is --- it can appear glamorous at times, but there are a lot of rough patches as well, and those have to be taken into account. people can get hurt from all directions. people can get careless. people can get overconfident. and then, people can be removed from their pedestals by force... if i had to reward the best actor in this film, i would have to go with joe pesci. he portrayed the psychopathic, insecure, bigger-than-life, living time bomb tommy devito so well, especially the chilling way tommy could snap like a twig when a remark rubbed him the wrong way, as well as the chilling, casual take that tommy took when he carried out a murder, like it was comedic and normal to him. just... chilling is the only word i can think of. the way the actors responded to him was amazing, too; every time tommy looked like he was a little angry, everybody ducked for cover and simultaneously pretended like they were still having a great time when they were actually all petrified with fear. i lost myself in his character, who i actually found to be incredibly intriguing. while every character made me forget that i was watching a movie (i felt like i was watching henry hill's life from behind his own eyes), tommy devito brought the whole film to a new kind of life that has never happened to me before. pesci won and fully deserved his oscar for best supporting actor. well done. as i said before, every actor is fantastic. ray liotta perfectly portrayed henry hill's subtly innocent personality; henry always felt like a bystander, like he wasn't fully engaged in the perfect storm surrounding him, and ray liotta portrayed that part of henry perfectly. likewise, robert deniro flawlessly portrayed jimmy 'the gent' conway's paranoid, secret, and subtly violent personality. at the same time that he seemed like a friend, he also seemed like an enemy and a traitor, scheming behind your back to ruin you and keep the riches to himself. the soundtrack is, simply put, amazing. every song fits its corresponding scene perfectly, especially the dreamy ""beyond the sea"" while things seem to be going well for the wise guys in prison, ""rags to riches"" to give a strong, powerful kickoff to the film, and especially ""what is life,"" during henry's frantic last day before his life collapses, but the token song on the soundtrack would have to be ""sunshine of your love."" i will always get chills during a moment that i call one of my favorite movie moments of all time, courtesy of one of the greatest directors in history, the masterful martin scorsese: when jimmy takes a drag on a cigarette and glares at morrie while the beginning of ""sunshine of your love"" plays in the background, and morrie is dancing and singing a cheery song, irish folk anthem ""danny boy,"" like a bird, without knowing what fate awaits him. that always gives me chills. i have a remark to the people who say that goodfellas glamorizes violence and mob life. i think that the direction scorsese was taking with the film was not to glamorize violence and mob life, but to show the domino effect that mob life has on the people on the inside. jimmy 'the gent' started with everything --- too much money to count, prestige, security, and comfort. so did henry and paulie. then the reality of mob life hit them, and the walls started crumbling, and things weren't so beautiful after that. the film shows the imperfections in mob life, especially the imperfections that most contemporary counts seem to gloss over. overall, this is my favorite movie for a myriad of reasons. it's a beautifully raw film, and i will always love it every time i see it. no film that i've ever seen can beat this masterpiece... yet.";3 August 2013;10;['fantastic', 'raw', 'glamorous', 'rough', 'careless', 'good', 'psychopathic', 'insecure', 'big', 'chilling', 'wrong', 'chilling', 'casual', 'comedic', 'normal', 'chilling', 'only', 'amazing', 'little', 'angry', 'great', 'intriguing', 'own', 'whole', 'new', 'good', 'fantastic', 'innocent', 'perfect', 'paranoid', 'secret', 'violent', 'same', 'amazing', 'dreamy', 'wise', 'strong', 'powerful', 'frantic', 'last', 'token', 'favorite', 'great', 'masterful', 'cheery', 'irish', 'much', 'beautiful', 'most', 'contemporary', 'favorite', 'raw'];0.1724392085187539

853;rockybalboa2430;goodfellas is one of the top movies in the history of cinema, nominated for best picture (and five other oscars) considered by many the top movie of the 90s, so how can it be underrated. put simply, it is underrated because the godfather (parts i and ii) are so brilliant. the sad thing is that, because goodfellas is a gangster movie, it will always be compared to other gangster movies. for some reason, movies in that genre (gangster/organized crime) are never looked at as individual pictures, but are forever compared and put up against other gangster films. the only exception to this rule, is the godfather of all gangster movies, the godfather. this is probably because it is the first of its kind (not the first gangster movie, but the first modern-style gangster movie), most gangster movies made after the godfather are complete rip offs of the godfather, but every once in a while a movie like goodfellas comes along that may be similar to on the surface, but is then written off by many. when i say, written off, i mean that it is not getting the credit it deserves. it is a masterpiece, yes it is a gangster picture, no it is not the godfather. many people admire it for what it is, but if the godfather hadn't been made, or even if this film wasn't always compared to it, it would take its deserved place in cinema history. that place is not as a good film, and a great gangster film, it is a artful, entertaining, and near flawless film, and one of the top two greatest gangster films.;28 June 2005;10;['top', 'good', 'other', 'many', 'top', 'underrated', 'underrated', 'brilliant', 'sad', 'other', 'individual', 'other', 'only', 'first', 'first', 'first', 'modern', 'most', 'complete', 'similar', 'many', 'many', 'deserved', 'good', 'great', 'artful', 'entertaining', 'flawless', 'top', 'great'];0.3490384615384616

875;Jimmie_twotimes;"while francis ford coppola's ""the godfather"" saga focuses on the highest levels of a crime family, martin scorcese's ""goodfellas"" tells the story of a family from the lower levels. the story starts in brooklyn 1955 where young henry hill becomes an errand boy for the local mobsters. he meets and becomes friends with jimmy conway (robert deniro) and young tommy devito. he earns the respect of the crew after he is pinched for selling illegal cigarettes and doesn't rat out his friends. we then flash forward to henry (ray liotta) and tommy (joe pesci) in their twenties, where they are still trying to steal everything they can get their hands on. the two pull of a daring robbery of air france, scoring almost $ 400,000. henry meets and eventually marries karen (lorraine bracco), a no-nonsense jewish girl. in one of the best sequences of any scorcese picture, henry walks with karen through the kitchen of the famous new york restaurant, the copacabana (this shot was imitated in ""boogie nights"" and ""swingers."") all is going well until henry and jimmy get sent to prison. henry starts selling cocaine and eventually becomes hooked. in the most entertaining sequences of the film (title card reads sunday may 11, 1980), henry must coordinate several different things in one day -- cooking dinner for his family, delivering silencers to jimmy, picking up and preparing cocaine for some customers near atlanta. the entire montage is set to several great classic rock songs, including harry nillson's ""jump into the fire"", george harrison's ""what is life"", the who's ""magic bus"" and the rolling stones ""monkey man."" one of scorcese's strongest points has always been his musical selections, especially in ""goodfellas"" this is scorcese's masterpiece and it should not be missed. a must see for any fan of the cinema. 10 out of 10 stars.";10 December 2006;10;['high', 'low', 'young', 'local', 'young', 'illegal', 'daring', 'jewish', 'good', 'scorcese', 'famous', 'hooked', 'entertaining', 'several', 'different', 'entire', 'several', 'great', 'classic', 'magic', 'rolling', 'strong', 'musical'];0.1821052631578947

881;KlinePatsy;a gripping, shocking, at times shamefully hilarious, mob masterpiece, with a soundtrack so brilliantly chosen, you'd be forgiven for thinking all the songs were written just for this movie. the lightning pace never lets up as we follow the criminal career of the kid henry hill, as he blossoms from a scrawny mob-gopher into a streetwise foot soldier for the local sicilian gangsters. it's a cautionary tale about the excesses of the american dream. all the major characters hold the world in their hands, but the inevitable backlash comes as the death toll rises and the money-making schemes become more grandiose...add some drugs, turf wars and extra-marital affairs into the mix..as well as the plain psychotic artistry of the more uncompromising villains (pesci at his finest), and you've got a frenzied free-for-all on the streets of new york, as the gangster life tears up anyone and anything in its path. it's a wild ride, even if it's apparent where we're heading. liotta adds a supremely good voice over which sets everything in context and slips you right into his edgy world, where every day is a constant hustle requiring wit, skill and courage. it's not a film for the faint hearted. while we are seduced by the wild world of organised crime, there are enough reality checks, in terms of the violence, to put us at an appropriate distance from the corrupt, morally redundant world that we are experiencing. henry hill is no alex de large, there's little ambiguity involved. he chooses the life and he pays for it in spades by the end. but the acting is so convincing, the story so well paced and delivered, that we have no time to reconsider our initial empathy for this bunch of villains. the cast is strong. liotta performs an acting miracle as he holds onto the reins, occasionally being outshone by the electrifying pesci, and the quietly malevolent de niro...but never letting go of the story as his character ploughs on to the end. the supporting cast is brilliant so many memorable secondary characters, from karen hill, mob boss paulie, morrie the wig-shop owner with grand ideas, henchman carbone and many more. it's movie perfection..the blend of storytelling savvy, pitch=perfect performances, great music, elaborate camera-work and brilliant set design..it captures an era convicingly, and with an objectivity that really elevates it into a classic work of art.;5 August 2007;10;['shocking', 'hilarious', 'criminal', 'scrawny', 'streetwise', 'local', 'sicilian', 'cautionary', 'major', 'inevitable', 'grandiose', 'extra', 'marital', 'plain', 'psychotic', 'uncompromising', 'fine', 'frenzied', 'free', 'wild', 'apparent', 'good', 'edgy', 'constant', 'faint', 'wild', 'organised', 'enough', 'appropriate', 'corrupt', 'redundant', 'large', 'little', 'convincing', 'paced', 'initial', 'strong', 'electrifying', 'brilliant', 'many', 'memorable', 'secondary', 'grand', 'many', 'more', 'perfect', 'great', 'elaborate', 'brilliant', 'classic'];0.1702991452991453

887;goodfellas-foggetaboutit;"it's as if scorsese peeked into their lives. eavesdropped on every conversation they had. took note of every little thing. otherwise how can one justify this movie that provides the closest look ever into the lives of mob soldiers? by focusing on a group of small-time street guys - hijackers of booze, cigarettes and what-not, and narrating their story, scorsese paints a larger picture. it is essentially this approach, this perspective from the bottom rung of the ladder that reveals to us like never before the inner workings of the mob, its rules, its values (or lack of them). the result is a threadbare expose of mob life, a horrifying tale of greed and violence. the result is ""goodfellas"". ""as far back as i can remember, i always wanted to be a gangster"" reminisces henry hill (ray liotta), an aspiring irish-italian hood who will never be ""made"" and allowed into the family, who will always have to scrounge for existence at the fringes of power. with his mentor jimmy ""the gent"" conway(de niro) and a gun-wielding, short-fused psychopath tommy devito (joe pesci) by his side, hill lives his dream. he earns money for himself and for the family, but stays inside the line, because, if ""you get out of line, you get whacked"". then the lufthansa heist comes along, and little by little, things start to go haywire. fidelity among fellow gangsters evaporates only to leave the slime of violent greed. and in the end, ironically, hill must get out of line in order to save himself from the very people he idolized. he must rat out. the screenplay by scorsese and pileggi remains faithful to the original book and is a-w-e-s-o-m-e. no one will feel the absence of paul schrader here. but it takes the brilliance of scorsese to take those words and turn them into unforgettable scenes on the celluloid. take, for example, the scene when henry takes karen to the copa through a back-door. the whole scene from the car to the copa stage is filmed in a single shot, with a steadicam following henry and karen as they move through winding hallways and kitchen. the technical complexity of the shot is matched only by its extraordinary vision. through this single shot karen, virtually a stranger to henry's way of life gets a taste of what power can be, of how seductive and intoxicating it can be. scorsese redefines cinematic language in this film. the piano coda in ""layla"" or donovan's ""atlantis"" will never be the same for someone after they've seen ""goodfellas"". yes, it's that powerful. i've often wondered how this film is complementary to ""the godfather"". while ""goodfellas"" discerns mob life through the eyes of a lower-strata soldier, ""the godfather"" deals with the upper echelons of the mafia syndicate. but they meet somewhere. from the bribing of senators in ""the godfather"" to the bribing of prison guards in ""goodfellas"", from the wiping out of the heads of the crime families in ""the godfather"" to the gangland executions of mob enforcers in ""goodfellas"" they meet somewhere. the actions, the emotions, the motives they all meet somewhere. they meet and create the whole picture. a picture that is brutal, but true nonetheless. we were waiting for the other half of that picture since 1972. our wait ended with ""goodfellas"".";25 February 2010;10;['little', 'close', 'small', 'scorsese', 'large', 'bottom', 'inner', 'threadbare', 'horrifying', 'irish', 'italian', 'little', 'little', 'fellow', 'violent', 'very', 'faithful', 'original', 'unforgettable', 'back', 'whole', 'copa', 'single', 'winding', 'technical', 'extraordinary', 'single', 'seductive', 'cinematic', 'same', 'powerful', 'complementary', 'low', 'strata', 'upper', 'whole', 'brutal', 'true', 'other'];-0.0243835034013605

903;walkinginmysleep2129;"when speaking of gangster films, the argument will always come down to the relative supremacy of the two best offerings of the genre, godfather and goodfellas. the interesting parallel between these two films is realism. after the release of godfather, writer mario puzo was approached by several mafioso who assumed (incorrectly) that he was involved with the mob due to the level of perceived realism. meanwhile, one of the biggest complaints against goodfellas is that the violence is over-the-top and unnecessary. however, unlike godfather, goodfellas is based on a true story and the real henry hill has stated the film is 99% true. in fact, the real tommy actually yelled ""shine these f**king shoes!"" as he stomped billy batts. disturbing scenes like this draw a lot of criticism for the film, however this is all an accurate depiction of mob life, so if you don't like that, then why are you watching mob films? the story of henry hill is a familiar one; a young boy growing up in a tough neighborhood becomes seduced by the flashiness, respect, and perceived success of the mob. what makes goodfellas a classic, and better than the countless others, is the stylish and effective camera-work of director martin scorsese. as we trace henry's new jersey childhood, the camera continually centers on a star struck young boy watching his heroes with admiration and wonder. this is continued throughout the film even as henry moves into adulthood, he still looks up to paulie like a little kid. then there is the narration. in lesser films narration would be used to cover plot holes and force the film along. in goodfellas, the narration is probably unnecessary, as the film would flow fine without it, but scorsese uses it the way it is supposed to be used, to provide added insight into the characters and why henry participates in amoral activities with such zeal. it also helps that ray liotta's delivery is just about perfect. the usual theme of gangster movies is otherwise good people getting seduced into a bad lifestyle of doing horrible things for money. the interesting thing about goodfellas is that under scorsese's expert direction, we are the ones being seduced. an excellent example of this is the famous copacabana date scene. in this three-minute long steadicam shot, it is almost as if we were on a date with henry as we follow he and karen wind their way through the back door of the famous nightclub, eventually coming out on top, as it were, into a choice spot right in front of the stage. throughout the film, we are confronted with extremely intimate camera-work that brings us into their inner circle as they lean together conspiratorially to plan their air france heist and others. however, no discussion of goodfellas would be complete without addressing the violence. yes, it is horrible. yes, it is graphic. yes, it is disturbing. one thing it is not, is glorifying. the opening scene foreshadows the brutality of the last half of the film as we see a man, in a trunk, get shot multiple times, then stabbed with a kitchen knife. but once the opening credits rush across the screen, and the narration starts we can push that out of our minds and get lulled into a false sense of security by henry's adoring praise of the wiseguy father figures who populate his childhood and the darkly humorous way the violence is handled in the first act. this all changes, however in one instant as henry pistol-whips karen's neighbor with the wandering hands. we are definitely made to feel as though this attack is justified, but it marks a turning point in the mood of the film. we can draw a line right at this point to divide the movie into two halves. where as before we see the mob life through rose-colored glasses, we now begin to see the downfall of the characters that before were invincible. from here we see brutality after brutality as their situation gets more desperate and they try harder and harder to keep things together. the difference between the mood of the two halves can also be seen in the first two times henry finds himself in court. when, as a child, henry keeps his mouth shut and takes the fall, he is praised and congratulated by paulie and the others. the event is seen as a rite of passage. the second time, however, no one is laughing, foreshadowing the final scenes of the film. goodfellas is everything godfather is not. where godfather focuses on kings of the underworld, goodfellas shows us the lives of the low level soldiers under them. when godfather is grandiose and operatic, goodfellas is gritty and intimate. even though they actually have similar running times, godfather comes off as hard to sit through, while goodfellas is accessible, almost to a fault, as in the nearly heavy-handed technique of freezing the frame to make sure we pay attention to the particularly important moments. by drawing us into the life of one of the most mysterious and fabled aspects of american society, the mob, martin scorsese earns his title as the greatest living american director, and goodfellas earns its place as the best gangster movie ever.";17 April 2006;10;['relative', 'good', 'interesting', 'several', 'big', 'unnecessary', 'true', 'real', 'true', 'real', 'accurate', 'familiar', 'young', 'tough', 'well', 'countless', 'stylish', 'effective', 'young', 'little', 'less', 'unnecessary', 'amoral', 'such', 'perfect', 'usual', 'good', 'bad', 'horrible', 'interesting', 'expert', 'excellent', 'famous', 'long', 'back', 'famous', 'intimate', 'inner', 'complete', 'horrible', 'graphic', 'last', 'multiple', 'false', 'humorous', 'first', 'invincible', 'desperate', 'first', 'second', 'final', 'low', 'grandiose', 'operatic', 'gritty', 'intimate', 'similar', 'hard', 'accessible', 'heavy', 'handed', 'sure', 'important', 'mysterious', 'fabled', 'american', 'great', 'american', 'good'];0.1248379629629629

937;mr_tambourine_man72;goodfellas makes a strong case for itself as the most overrated movie of the 80s or any decade. never in my life have i encountered a film less deserving of its critical and popular accolades. after watching it for the second time recently (to make sure my impression from a viewing years earlier was accurate), i feel every person involved in the picture, and particularly martin scorsese, deserves to be punished severely for inflicting goodfellas upon me. goodfellas has absolutely nothing to offer. it has neither the wisdom nor the compassion to say or reveal anything about life or human beings. anyway, goodfellas is not interested in that. it just wants to be smart, hip, and funny. with such lofty goals, it's a wonder this entire star-studded cast of actors and filmmakers fell so very, very short. goodfellas is not smart. it is not intelligent enough to understand what it think it portrays on an individual or larger basis. it does not somehow explain or explore the mob psyche, the existence of organized crime in america, or anything else for that matter. despite the fact that it is taken from actual events and people, it seems to desire no contact with reality. goodfellas is not hip. apparently martin scorsese was not aware that there is nothing less cool than trying hard to be cool. goodfellas is full of flashy camera moves, tough looking guys in swank suits, and more fast, colloquial dialogue than you could beat out of dashiell hammett, but none of it adds up to anything but slime. yes, that's right: slime. goodfellas is so obnoxious you want to take a magical eraser and scrub each of its characters back into the pure white on the page from which they sprang. is this an honorable aim for a film? to make you hate its characters, to make you hate its voice? let me be the one to say that cynicism is generally a good cover for laziness, and as an approach to life it is one step above nihilism. real cynicism has no place in art. goodfellas is not funny. a complete lack of respect for human life is not a secret recipe for brilliant ironic comedy. it is disgusting, really, and those who laugh reserve a spot for themselves in the grime between the cracks under the bottom of the barrel of good humor. the performances in goodfellas, much lauded, are ridiculously one-sided. how wonderful they managed to span the chasm between looking tough and looking smug - all except for ray liotta who has to do the balancing act between being paranoid and annoyed. bravo. of note is scorsese's choice to play pop music over 95 percent of the film, presumably so that we have something to listen to while we are busy ignoring his movie. goodfellas is trash. utter trash. the only thing i took out of it is that it is unwise to let a gangster stand behind you.;9 August 2004;1;['strong', 'overrated', 'deserving', 'critical', 'popular', 'second', 'sure', 'accurate', 'human', 'interested', 'smart', 'funny', 'such', 'lofty', 'entire', 'short', 'smart', 'intelligent', 'individual', 'large', 'actual', 'aware', 'cool', 'cool', 'full', 'flashy', 'tough', 'swank', 'fast', 'colloquial', 'right', 'obnoxious', 'magical', 'pure', 'honorable', 'good', 'real', 'funny', 'complete', 'human', 'secret', 'brilliant', 'ironic', 'disgusting', 'good', 'sided', 'wonderful', 'tough', 'smug', 'paranoid', 'annoyed', 'busy', 'utter', 'only', 'unwise'];0.1812139249639249

947;corey_coyle;goodfellas is my second favourite all time film. just after scarface. this film is just absolutely brilliant. i originally watched goodfellas back in the late 90s when my dad had an old vhs of it. i fell in love with the film right there and then. i didn't get the dvd until by birthday in 2010. unfortunately, it was the annoying double sided disc. you get the first 70 minutes of the film on one side, and the last 70 minutes on the other. this means you have to flip the disc over half way through which is really irritating. you half to take the disc out, turn it around and then put it back in just after the sequence where tommy kills spider. i haven't got the 2 disc edition yet, but i really want it. the film was inspired by true story and is also based on the book wiseguys by nicholas pileggi. he co wrote the script with the director of this masterpiece martin scorsese. ray liotta gives his greatest performance in this film as the lead character henry hill. he is just absolutely brilliant. the sequence where he has to break the wall at the end of the film and talk to the camera was just brilliant. robert de niro gives one amazing performance as well as the infamous gangster jimmy conway. however, it is joe pesci who steals this movie. he is just absolutely terrifying as tommy devito. definitely someone you don't want to mess with. the way he just shoots spider in the foot and later on kills him was scary. this is because he just acts like there is nothing wrong with his actions. joe pesci won a rightly deserved academy award for this film. i think he does just as good, if not even better as nicky santoro in another martin scorsese masterpiece casino. lorraine bracco gives a great performance in this film as well as karen hill. she scares the hell out of me every time she shouts. another amazing actor in this film is paul sorvino who plays paul cicero (paulie). there are several scenes of brutal violence in this film but don't worry its nothing to disturbing. the sequence where henry bashes the face in of a man who tried to rape his wife is sick. another shocking sequence is when tommy and jimmy beat the living hell out of billy batts who is played very well by frank vincent. goodfellas stands the test of time as being one of the greatest films ever made. if you are going to purchase the dvd then get the full 2 disc edition. i heard you get two audio commentaries and several documentaries. the choices of the music in this film is absolutely brilliant. it truly is the second greatest film ever made.

and does not know what is happening. even after the movie finishes, it does not even name the names of any of the characters, but its excitement does not let its true sense of the film come to light. a good comedy movie is a movie that the audience, when faced with a so-called mafia story, presents itself to the film and does not see other components of the film, and only follow the movements of the mafia. good comedy films can be seen only once, because in the second time it quickly goes through all the problems of the film and loses the value of seeing it. good comedy films begin with a flashback, it turns out to be claiming ""how"" it is from the beginning. in general, the film hits the main character, which is not personality, and the same type of person plays a member of a simple mafia. he is not at all the center of the film, and his only role is to explain the story to images that they do not know and do not speak themselves. until the end of the movie, we do not understand how they are coming from, and they are continually being told, what they are doing is the same claim of how they do it, so that it does not happen to anyone, and it's always a storyteller. be as she tells the story, she wants to be a gangster and somehow into a mafia, her family is shown in a small, wildly scary plan, and after a while they are left behind. a little boy who aspires to a mafia is driven to a group by the help of the little girls and becomes a member of them. the problem with this is that there is neither a mafia nor a gangster, suddenly a court view and the victory of the boy from his first crime in his life and being official in that group, which is unclear and where is his place in the film. the brigades are bursting and constantly stealing and murdering, there is no life in the film, and not intuition, with all these backwardness of the film, suddenly the main character succeeds in marrying his unclean future in an unknown future. . a woman who, if removed from the film, will not cause any problems. the woman adds a bit of spiritual and religious sensation to the story, which ends in a few dialogues. a woman who does not know the mafia but is still homeless and without identity, who immediately marries a gangster who the gangster tells her is in construction, and it is not even known where in the film woman finds out what her husband really is. and how it works. no creature is defined in the film, the music comes and goes, the camera for itself hovers around several gangsters, and when it gets tired it zooms in and out some of them. the actors are always laughing and even teasing the mafia. there is no good reason for the killings, nor is a specific identity defined behind them. suddenly, after two hours of confusion, everything is on a steep pace, and murders are carried out more quickly, the police arrest everyone and the entire dreaded band disappears. unfortunately, the police can not take one thing, it's a nonsense of the film, which is a free end to itself, and tells everything that it wants (even if it does not help the story). because of the inability of the film in its own image and later in its nursery, the end of the film ends with sentences, they come and before the title, half-story is collected so that no one understands its weaknesses. the director is also looking to repeat himself. if you look at this ""wolf of wall street"", you'll find that both are the same with just different stories, all the camera movements and other mecensical components are the only difference. the average age of cast is lower. repeating such a situation is not a sign of a signature in one work, but a sign of a kick in a particular area that the director fears to quit or try. good comrades do not make friends and not a good particle, all humans hate each other, and it is not clear at what time they will try to kill each other. it does not really show up as a human being in the film, and then he was looking to introduce

1001;koalatracker;"""as far back as i can remember, i've always wanted to be a gangster."" -- henry hill, brooklyn, n.y. 1955. gangsters are all around us. everyone knows it, not everyone wants to accept it. ""goodfellas""--based on true events--explores the lives of gangsters, chronicling the events through the eyes of henry hill (ray liotta), who gets involved with the mafia at a young age and continues his ""career"" throughout the film. as he gets older, he marries and has children, but still works for the organized crime family, under mob boss paulie (paul sorvino); and he is friends with jimmy (robert de niro), a calm, steady gangster; and tommy (joe pesci), a wild man with serious mental problems. eventually henry's life goes down the gutter, leading to drug abuse and paranoia, that leads to other unfortunate incidents that will be ruined if i type any more about them. ""goodfellas"" is one of the best films i have ever seen. it's a tour de force of breathtaking images, witty scriptwriting, superb acting and realistic violence. robert de niro gives one of his best performances -- ever -- as jimmy, even if he's not in the film as much as you might be lead to believe from the front cover. joe pesci is in this movie about as much as de niro, maybe a bit more or less. but when he's on screen there's no doubting he's on screen--he's very hard to miss. a short, deranged, loud-mouthed man with something wrong in his head. someone makes an insult toward him and he shoots them, and then laughs. it's quite disturbing. i am a huge fan of pesci, and i tend to love his characters, but he really makes you feel sick towards his character in ""goodfellas,"" while at the same time taking a strange liking to him. that just goes to show how good of an actor pesci is. ray liotta is perfect as henry hill. i can't think of a better actor to play him. he captures a sense of innocence yet at the same time a feeling of violence. i love the scene where he walks over to a man's house with a regular expression on his face. ""what do you want, f&*^&?"" the man asks. liotta continues walking, takes out a gun, and starts to continually beat the man in the skull with the butt of his gun. as henry walks back to his car, his face is disturbing and his expression stays with you for a long, long time. martin scorsese is a brilliant director and his work here is fabulous; it's been recreated by other directors (namely paul thomas anderson in ""boogie nights"") and there's a reason: it's great stuff. he totally deserved to receive best director in 1990, but of course he didn't. (rumor has it the academy frowns on scorsese's use of racial slurs in his work. oh boo hoo, get over it.) the movie is based on the true-crime memoirs of the real-life henry hill, whose novel with nicholas pileggi -- ""wiseguys"" -- was adapted into a screenplay by pileggi and scorsese. the book itself was fantastic and insightful; the screenplay is even better. the dialogue is incredible. anyway, ""goodfellas"" has to be one of the best films i've ever seen--a true modern classic that will be remembered for what it is: one of the greatest tales told on screen. it's an offer you can't refuse!";3 September 2020;10;['true', 'young', 'old', 'calm', 'steady', 'wild', 'serious', 'mental', 'other', 'unfortunate', 'more', 'good', 'witty', 'realistic', 'good', 'lead', 'front', 'less', 'hard', 'short', 'loud', 'mouthed', 'wrong', 'disturbing', 'huge', 'sick', 'same', 'strange', 'good', 'perfect', 'well', 'same', 'regular', 'disturbing', 'long', 'long', 'brilliant', 'fabulous', 'other', 'great', 'good', 'racial', 'true', 'real', 'fantastic', 'insightful', 'well', 'incredible', 'good', 'true', 'modern', 'great'];0.1949404761904762

1011;ZakG;when encouraging people, who have yet to view this masterpiece, to get down the video shop and hire this wonderful film, i describe the opening scene. (*spoiler*) three guys are in a car, at night. one of them hears a noise, so they pull over. one takes out a gun, another draws a knife. the boot of the car is opened to reveal a beaten up guy in distress. the knife armed fella proceeds to repeatedly stab the victim. then the guy with the gun shoots him several times. it was this opening scene that instantly drew me in to this film, and developed my love for gangster movies. the only film to shock me in it's opening sequence the same way since then is saving private ryan. a rare attribute in a movie indeed. so what about the rest of the 2+ hours of this movie? the casting is perfect. old hands to scorsese films, de niro and pesci must have been obvious choices. pesci especially as the frightening tommy. he even admitted in an interview that he scared himself at times. ray liotta has the performance of his lifetime, unfortunately it looks like he will never have the opportunity to top it. and paul sorvino proves the point that saying nothing can speak volumes in his role as mafia boss paulie. the film covers three decades of the characters lives in the mafia and the music, costumes and settings help carry you through the years believably without trying to shove the time period in your face. the true magic of this film is that you are drawn into the characters lives, despite knowing that they are the sort of people that you would normally despise. this is done through the fast paced storyline and dialogue. you are continually shocked by the characters actions because, at the end of the day, life in the mafia is a life with friends who will shake your hand one day, and shoot you in the back the next. if you haven't seen this film yet, stop what your doing get down the rental shop, and 'make that coffee to go!';27 September 2002;10;['wonderful', 'armed', 'several', 'only', 'same', 'private', 'rare', 'perfect', 'old', 'scorsese', 'obvious', 'frightening', 'true', 'next', 'rental'];0.1875

1031;lydiae67;"there is no doubt that goodfellas is a true gangster classic which represents high points in the careers of those involved in it. scorsese tells the true story of henry hill and his cohorts superbly, starting as he means to go on - with a violent, profanity ladened fast paced tale of hill's rise to prominence in new york's organised crime underworld during the sixties and seventies and his subsequent rapid demise as he goes from airport heists to drug dealing and finally ends up in the witness protection scheme where he remains to this day. as scorsese takes us on this twenty five year journey we are introduced to and get to know the various wiseguys that hill associates with, from those at the very top like paulie cicero to people like morrie (chuck low) and brief introductions to jimmy ""two times"" and fat andy etc. and then there is tommy de vito. let's make no mistake about it, this is pesci's finest performance which rightly won him the best supporting actor oscar. unlike casino in which he basically plays the same character but with a different name, in goodfellas pesci is far more believable as a guy who will kill people without thinking twice but despite this, he doesn't make the audience dislike him, he is a far more rounded character and despite all his violence, and after all the fast talking and wisecracks you can't help but like him and find him amusing. pesci is the one with most of the best lines in the film, the most famous of which is the funny how? scene which legend has it was written and directed by pesci at the request of scorsese. it is a scene that demonstrates both sides of tommy's character perfectly and which couldn't have been bettered in any way. it's definitely one of my favourite movie moments. pesci's undoubtably steals the show in goodfellas but every single character in the film is played to perfection. liotta, despite not going on to bigger and better things after goodfellas, is convincing as henry and de niro despite not having as much screen time as one might expect in such a film plays the charismatic but also ""violent when necessary"" jimmy conway, who holds a lot of sway within the organisation and is the orchestrator of most of the heists. others of note include : lorraine bracco, frank vincent, paul sorvino and catherine scorsese who plays tommy's mother, all of whom fit their respective roles in the film perfectly. **** out of 4";11 July 2003;10;['true', 'high', 'true', 'violent', 'organised', 'subsequent', 'rapid', 'various', 'top', 'low', 'brief', 'fine', 'same', 'different', 'believable', 'rounded', 'fast', 'amusing', 'most', 'good', 'famous', 'funny', 'scorsese', 'favourite', 'single', 'big', 'well', 'convincing', 'much', 'charismatic', 'violent', 'necessary', 'most', 'catherine', 'respective'];0.1798236331569665
1032;rightaboveit011;"as a huge fan of scorsese's 2000s movies goodfellas seemed right up my alley. indeed, the measure of greatness of scorsese movies is how they stack up against this classic and the question is often what is his best since. so my expectations were high to say the least. there are some scenes in goodfellas which would make me proud to have it included in my list of top movies - from intimidating the mailman by shoving his head in the oven to tommy's reckless blasting away of ""spider"" over a trifle, to henry hill waking up to his wife pointing a gun in his face, and, my favourite scene, when tommy is shot dead and blood flows slowly from his head out over the floor. and i could go on listing scenes. this is exactly the point - there is something lacking, even poor, in the story as a whole i.e. in the pace of the film. henry following tommy along to the double date is a turning point in the narrative, with karen coming into the story at this point. the initial scene at the restaurant just seems to fit in as another part of the lengthy orientation. then the two have an argument on the street - again it all seems to fit in. then all of a sudden henry's voice-over tells us that he finds her attractive and karen's opinion somehow changes and they decide they'll go out, this time on a proper date - this is way too unrealistic. the awkwardness of the first date is conveyed so well, with the contrast between tommy and his girl, and the voice-over from karen, that it's fair to wonder why she even wanted to go on the second date. after the copacabana date you can believe that she was impressed with him but i'm sure most people found it odd that she wasn't repelled to begin with and got caught up in the whole thing. it takes ages for anything narratively significant to happen, and when it does it's out of nowhere. the film seems to be confused what its emphasis is. the opening scene is taken out from a late point in the movie, giving it that mystery-movie style revelation when we realise the context of that scene. this is inappropriate - by the time we figure out what that scene was about we know that the gangsters kill people all the time, and sometimes over practically nothing, especially tommy. there's too much of a similarity between the murders of spider and billy batts to give special importance to batts; sure, spider was a nobody and batts was a ""made"" man, but there should have been more done to show why batts was more serious. the filmmakers couldn't have expected audiences to grasp the intenseness of killing a made man. goodfellas isn't a movie about the lufthansa heist, not really. the filmmakers obviously chose to sacrifice a traditional story for an in depth, more holistic view of mob life. the cost is that the climax lacks some depth. the filmmakers were never interested in the heist, they were interested in its aftermath, because that's where the characters interrelate. all those involved are slowly killed off by jimmy conway, and in the sense that we finally see the fullness of jimmy's gangster quality (besides throwing 100s to operating doormen and bartenders) there is some interest and drama. but this is compromised because the heist is an opportunity that the gangsters merely stumble upon - there is no reason or meaning involved in the actual robbery besides their normal greed. jimmy conway has nothing personal in it, no journey towards it, and it is this extra psychological depth that would have made the ending truly masterful. the filmmakers, and hence the audience, are too caught up in the characters' relations to think about them individually. a lot will disagree with this, but i think the departed is better. it has all the same great hallmarks of directing but it has a masterfully crafted story that isn't spontaneous and doesn't drag (even though the departed is longer) and it is psychologically deep (the main female character is a psychologist, what more could you want?). this said, goodfellas is a quality movie and a proud part of the scorsese canon, and if a friend came and told me he recently watched it i would still light up and be ready to talk about all the amazing scenes. in short, to be a masterpiece, everything has to go right - and although there are lots of awesome films there are few masterpieces, and goodfellas is definitely an example of the former and not the latter.";5 December 2011;9;['huge', 'scorsese', 'good', 'high', 'least', 'proud', 'top', 'reckless', 'favourite', 'dead', 'poor', 'whole', 'double', 'initial', 'lengthy', 'sudden', 'attractive', 'proper', 'unrealistic', 'first', 'fair', 'second', 'impressed', 'sure', 'most', 'odd', 'whole', 'significant', 'late', 'inappropriate', 'tommy', 'much', 'batts', 'special', 'serious', 'traditional', 'holistic', 'interested', 'interested', 'actual', 'normal', 'personal', 'extra', 'psychological', 'masterful', 'well', 'same', 'great', 'spontaneous', 'long', 'deep', 'main', 'female', 'more', 'proud', 'scorsese', 'ready', 'amazing', 'short', 'right', 'awesome', 'few', 'former', 'latter'];0.2184171075837742

1043;lime_and_limpid_green;"martin scorsese's ""goodfellas"" is an amazing film that looks at life in the mafia. it tells the true story of henry hill, a former mobster, who is still alive to this day; it also relates the story of his friends and associates who he spends a great deal of time with in the film. henry's (ray liotta) grandest dream as a young boy is to someday become a gangster. as he says, ""being a gangster was better than being president of the united states."" he grows up in a neighborhood full of them, and even gets a job at the cabstand which gains him respect among his peers. (during all of this, his parents become aware of his interaction with the other mobsters, and his dad cruelly beats him.) he continues to work and become more familiar with the neighborhood, including paulie (paul sorvino) who he becomes very close to later on. eventually, he is introduced to jimmy conway (robert de niro) who he begins working for soon selling cigarettes. from here, he first meets tommy devito, who he will also become extremely close with later on along with paulie. unfortunately for henry, he is caught selling one day and is immediately arrested. luckily, henry is smart enough to not reveal anything, and he is acquitted of the charges. later on, the story moves into henry's adult life where he continues robbing the airport and other places with his close friend tommy (joe pesci). we learn more about tommy from this point. what we learn more than anything else is how insane he is. he is obviously a complete psycho, and at his worst he kills people just for kicks. over time, henry begins dating karen (lorraine bracco) who, while she seems close to him, is infuriated when one day he decides not to show up for a date. she stands him up, and this is when the connection between the two of them is soon about more than just a date. over time, henry marries karen and they have two daughters. henry's work starts getting more serious, and occasionally they have fights which result in karen almost killing him. tragically, henry and his friends' killings go over the line and result in ***spoilers!!!*** tommy's death.***end spoilers!!!*** henry becomes a cocaine dealer and addict (despite paulie's warning that if he messes around with it too much he'll disregard him forever) and earns a fortune from it. but, what he and karen don't realize is that narcs are fully aware of his actions, and they arrest him one day. when they arrive on the scene, karen, in panic, thinks that they are actual cops and flushes all of henry's cocaine down the toilet (all of which is worth about $60,000). in the end, henry has to become ""an average nobody just like everybody else,"" as he puts it. to conclude, ""goodfellas"" is an absolute masterpiece. martin scorsese directs it with a master's touch, and the 145 minute running time truly flies by. the performances are fantastic (the best being from pesci) in addition to the writing and editing.";19 February 2007;10;['amazing', 'true', 'former', 'alive', 'great', 'grandest', 'young', 'well', 'full', 'aware', 'other', 'familiar', 'close', 'close', 'smart', 'other', 'close', 'more', 'more', 'insane', 'complete', 'bad', 'close', 'more', 'serious', 'aware', 'actual', 'worth', 'average', 'absolute', 'fantastic', 'good'];0.1598443223443224

1047;Ravinder-Tulsiani-EDGE;"this is essential for anyone who enjoys gangster drama. fantastic movie. the best gangster movie ever. it is one of my favorite movies of all- time. martin scorsese explores the life of organized crime with his gritty, kinetic adaptation of nicolas pileggi's best-selling wiseguy, the true- life account of mobster and fbi informant henry hill. set to a true-to- period rock soundtrack, the story details the rise and fall of hill, a half-irish, half-sicilian new york kid who grows up idolizing the ""wise guys"" in his impoverished brooklyn neighborhood. he begins hanging around the mobsters, running errands and doing odd jobs until he gains the notice of local chieftain paulie cicero (paul sorvino), who takes him in as a surrogate son. as he reaches his teens, hill (ray liotta) is inducted into the world of petty crime, where he distinguishes himself as a ""stand-up guy"" by choosing jail time over ratting on his accomplices. from that moment on, he is a part of the family. along with his psychotic partner tommy (joe pesci), he rises through the ranks to become paulie's lieutenant; however, he quickly learns that, like his mentor jimmy (robert deniro), his ethnicity prevents him from ever becoming a ""made guy,"" an actual member of the crime family. soon he finds himself the target of both the feds and the mobsters, who feel that he has become a threat to their security with his reckless dealings. goodfellas was rewarded with six academy award nominations including best picture; pesci would walk away with best supporting actor for his work.";3 August 2013;10;['essential', 'fantastic', 'good', 'favorite', 'gritty', 'kinetic', 'true', 'half', 'irish', 'half', 'wise', 'impoverished', 'odd', 'local', 'surrogate', 'petty', 'psychotic', 'actual', 'reckless', 'good', 'good'];0.190625

1050;odoylerules88888;"director martin scorsese's goodfellas is an american crime film based on the non-fiction book, wiseguy written by nicholas pileggi. pileggi used real life interviews with henry hill to create wiseguy. goodfellas takes viewers into the world of real organized crime in the lucchese family from 1955 to 1980. goodfellas features an all-star cast of ray liotta, robert de niro, joe pesci, lorraine bracco, and paul sorvino. goodfellas was convincing because it used a very established cast. de niro had experience working in other mob films before such as the godfather part ii where he won the academy award for best supporting actor. de niro, along with pesci, worked with scorsese before in his 1980 film, raging bull, where de niro won the academy award for best actor. what scorsese did extraordinary well with goodfellas was creating a movie where the story was historically accurate with hollywood drama that makes a film successful using engrossing characters and dramatic scenes. the story begins with henry hill (liotta) who states, ""as far back as i can remember, i always wanted to be a gangster,"" which shows his admiration and eagerness to join to mob. hill starts out as a boy who did errands for the mob organizer, paulie. soon hill grows up to be a wise and willing mobster and it doesn't take long for others to notice him. hill soon gets involved with fellow mobsters jimmy (de nero) and tommy (pesci), who steal, embezzle, and whack fellow mobsters. scorsese makes us feel hill's intoxication with this crime family. hill is obliviously thrilled with the danger of being in the mob and he fully embraces it. membership of course comes with a big price because the only way out of the mob is by going into hiding or death. when hill says at the end of the film, ""i'm an average nobody. i get to live the rest of my life like a schnook"", moviegoers see how thoroughly he's bought into the mob mentality. he doesn't know how to live any other way, and he fears normal life. scorsese's screenplay with goodfellas was done in an innovative way because he wanted to make the sequences go out of order. when the film begins, a major whack scene from the middle of the film is shown at the beginning and the viewers don't know why. soon the movie rewinds to the beginning and the scenes go middle, forward, and backwards. scorsese wanted those scenes short and scattered because the impact on the audience later on would be terrific once everything soaks in. to add more authenticity, scorsese wanted the movie's soundtrack to match the scene time periods. if a scene took place in 1971, you would only hear a song from that year or older such as eric clapton's, ""layla."" viewers who grew up in the 1950's though 1970's will enjoy the movie's nostalgic, classic rock soundtrack. goodfellas does not fall short on violence. no actor in the film better depicts a better example of a cold mobster than joe pesci as tommy devito. as tommy, pesci shows us how psychopathic mobsters see the world and how they treat the people in it. the way tommy casually whacks people will have a memorable impact on the audience and put more fear of the mobsters into them. pesci truly has you believing he is a narcissistic, maniac. goodfellas accomplished exactly what it was set out to do. scorsese wanted to take real life crime events based on henry hill's interviews from wiseguy and incorporate it into film where everyone could see just how the mob functioned in the mid-to late 20th century. goodfellas is a prodigious achievement that puts this film into the categories of one of the best mob movies of all time.";16 November 2013;10;['american', 'non', 'fiction', 'real', 'lucchese', 'convincing', 'established', 'other', 'such', 'good', 'good', 'accurate', 'hollywood', 'successful', 'dramatic', 'wise', 'willing', 'long', 'fellow', 'fellow', 'big', 'only', 'average', 'other', 'normal', 'innovative', 'major', 'middle', 'short', 'terrific', 'more', 'old', 'such', 'nostalgic', 'classic', 'well', 'cold', 'psychopathic', 'memorable', 'more', 'narcissistic', 'real', 'late', 'prodigious', 'good'];0.1498737373737373

""being a gangster is better than being a president of united states...."" what a dialogue.. kick ass. ""as far back as i can remember, i've always wanted to be a gangster."" -- henry hill, brooklyn, n.y. 1955. gangsters are all around us. everyone knows it, not everyone wants to accept it. ""goodfellas""--based on true events--explores the lives of gangsters, chronicling the events through the eyes of henry hill (ray liotta), who gets involved with the mafia at a young age and continues his ""career"" throughout the film. as he gets older, he marries and has children, but still works for the organized crime family, under mob boss paulie (paul sorvino); and he is friends with jimmy (robert de niro), a calm, steady gangster; and tommy (joe pesci), a wild man with serious mental problems. eventually henry's life goes down the gutter, leading to drug abuse and paranoia, that leads to other unfortunate incidents that will be ruined if i type any more about them. ""goodfellas"" is one of the best films i have ever seen. it's a tour the force of breathtaking images, witty scriptwriting, superb acting and realistic violence. robert de niro gives one of his best performances -- ever -- as jimmy, even if he's not in the film as much as you might be lead to believe from the front cover. joe pesci is in this movie about as much as de niro, maybe a bit more or less. but when he's on screen there's no doubting he's on screen--he's very hard to miss. a short, deranged, loud-mouthed man with something wrong in his head. someone makes an insult toward him and he shoots them, and then laughs. it's quite disturbing. i am a huge fan of pesci, and i tend to love his characters, but he really makes you feel sick towards his character in ""goodfellas,"" while at the same time taking a strange liking to him. that just goes to show how good of an actor pesci is. ray liotta is perfect as henry hill. i can't think of a better actor to play him. he captures a sense of innocence yet at the same time a feeling of violence. i love the scene where he walks over to a man's house with a regular expression on his face. ""what do you want, f&*^&?"" the man asks. liotta continues walking, takes out a gun, and starts to continually beat the man in the skull with the butt of his gun. as henry walks back to his car, his face is disturbing and his expression stays with you for a long, long time. martin scorsese is a brilliant director and his work here is fabulous; it's been recreated by other directors (namely paul thomas anderson in ""boogie nights"") and there's a reason: it's great stuff. he totally deserved to receive best director in 1990, but of course he didn't.

1053;cristiang-sensey;"i must start by saying that ""goodfellas"" is one of the greatest movies ever made, being inspired from real events. the movie represents a display of martin scorsese's ingenuity in directing and writing at its highest degree. scorsese delicately mixes deception, greed, love and the need for power into one fantastic story, at the center of which stands the life as a mobster and all its inherent tribulations. the cast is as good as they come, but the most impressive is joe pesci , whose transcendent and quite short performance is the heart of the movie, beating increasingly until his very end. his character's loyalty, dark humor, impulsiveness, irascibility and complete disregard of society's laws compose, more or less, the typical "" wise guy"" of that time. the most memorable scene which masterfully displays some of these traits is the one in the bar, on poker's night, when he feels humiliated by his friends' intense laughter after being cursed by the waiter, spider, and his instinctive reaction is to kill him, thinking that this will remove the temporary stain on his cultivated reputation. the masterpiece illustrates in a most special way the methods gangsters unscrupulously use to make a living (stealing, killing, etc.), their hypocrisy towards each other, promoting love and tolerance when some of them would betray the others in a blink, and their inexorable addiction to, in a wider sense, more.

1057;WilliamWiderstrom;"martin scorcese's ""goodfellas"" is the true story about henry hill, and his 30 years in the mafia. lets be straight. i have seen a lot of different movies through my time, good and bad, touching or disgusting, but this one takes the price. it's safe to say that this incredibly well directed and well played movie is my personal favourite. starting from the beginning, we se three guys, that is henry and his two friends, driving a car on the highway in the middle of the night. seems first like any other trip, but suddenly there is a strange noise coming from the car, and henry turns to his friends. at first they all seem uncertain, but when they pull over, they all know where the sound is coming from, the trunk. we now witness the first of many coming violent scenes, as this is when they finish the job of getting rid of a mob-boss that they got in an argument with. after the brutal killing act, we get thrown into the magical but yet horrifying world of the mafia, and henry hill, played by the actor ray liotta, starts to tell his story. we start in the 50's, how henry first got connected, and then the whole movie follows his career through out the years. we witness the ups and downs of being a wiseguy, someone in the mafia. i think what i most like about ""goodfellas"" is that henry is narrating throughout the movie. that is a concept i am very weak for when they use in movies, because it feels like you are in the movie with the main character, and that he in some way is communicating to you, it increases your connection and helps you to bond and feel sympathy for the character, no matter what kind of person he is. throughout the whole movie, no matter what he does, henry has my sympathy and i route for him. i want him to succeed and don't care about the others. because he briefly manages to convince you that life in the mafia is something glorious, that you have power, money, and respect, and you almost fall for it, the first half of the movie scorcese puts in flashy 50's and 60's music, and creates a world of luxury built up by corruption and violence, but everything has its price. goodfellas is actually based on a true story. almost everything in the movie has happened, and it is shocking to se how all the characters are willing to cross all lines in order to establish the kind of world and lifestyle that they want. henry and his friends are willing to stop at nothing to get what they want, and that is also a point that henry makes us very clear with in the beginning, that you take what you want in the mafia. it is a very tempting idea at first, but when you ask yourself truly what that really means, its like you wake up from a dream and realise what in gods name you are thinking. every scene is well made, and scorcese uses his well developed directing skills as he captures the perfect moments. a lot of scenes illustrates a flashy and fun part of being in the mafia, while other scenes later in the movie breaks the good image and gives you the chills. often when someone later on becomes hurt, but the best part is when you anticipate something, and it turns out totally different. every character has a different fate in this movie. its also safe to say that robert de niro and joe pesci manages to capture their roles outstandingly good, along with ray liotta. there are a lot of powerful scenes and great acting and integrating between the characters. they are so well played that you would not be surprised if any of them had a mysterious and haunted background. i have to mention the scene where liotta and pesci integrate, at a restaurant, and pesci manages to fool not only the audience, but also liotta himself and the people around them. everyone thinks for a moment that liotta is dead meat and and that he has isolated the short tempered pesci. outstanding. the scene was also improvised. until the very end, goodfellas stays at the same level of perfection. i can only hope that that this will always remain among the most watched movies, and that everyone sees this at least once. because it is vital to ask yourself, what am i willing to do for money and power, and what price would i be willing to pay?";24 June 2015;9;['true', 'straight', 'different', 'good', 'bad', 'touching', 'disgusting', 'safe', 'directed', 'personal', 'other', 'strange', 'uncertain', 'first', 'many', 'violent', 'brutal', 'magical', 'whole', 'weak', 'main', 'whole', 'glorious', 'first', 'flashy', 'true', 'shocking', 'willing', 'willing', 'clear', 'tempting', 'perfect', 'flashy', 'fun', 'other', 'good', 'good', 'different', 'different', 'safe', 'good', 'powerful', 'great', 'surprised', 'mysterious', 'haunted', 'dead', 'short', 'outstanding', 'very', 'same', 'least', 'vital', 'willing', 'willing'];0.1003401360544217

1063;shinelans;i've seen many mob movies,until now,this one is the best~i was deeply shocked while watching this movie the first time,and then within 24 hours i just watched it again.to me it's far better than other movies related with mafia. from the beginning i was attracted by henry's legendary life...he's really a perfect guy,agile,flexible,ambitious.lovable...except for choosing the run way, in some way he's my idol~ robert de niro and joe pesci's performed great,too.de niro still as a cold-blood killer,he seems to be specialized in acting this kind of character..and pesci still acted as a nut..crazy and dangerous and disgusting nut like he acted in casino.the camera shots was concise and the rhythm was quickly,it's hard to believe that this movie was casted in 1990, thanks to the director martin scorsese.. and after my second watch i got more info,every game has it's rules,and joining mafia is just like playing a dangerous and exciting game,rules also exist,at the beginning of the movie herry was told by jimmy never sold off friends,and always keep mouth shut,later paul admonished him never touch drugs,those are the prime rules,but apparently herry broke them all,he got involved in drug dealing,and caught by cops,then afraid of being killed,he sold up the whole family,it's rather interesting,herry is a smart guy in the mafia group,but he was just too smart and ambitious,and finally led to his doom,and destroyed the whole family by keep on breaking rules.tommy did the same thing,killed batt without the confirmation from upper class,and got revenge..jimmy also made stupid mistakes,he tried to set up herry's wife,but failed,then he ordered henry to kill someone,he must know that the herries are very wise people,so it's really hard to believe why he left so many hints for them to fight back,whilst paul is rather pathetic,he got fooled by herry for once,and too mercy to let him go,but he underestimated the effect of this drug cases,that led to his doom. i think the chinese translation about the film name is very vivid,(dao yi you dao)literally means even being a thief has it's rules. but some of the plots are really hard to understand,especially the painting drawn by tommy's mother when tommy killed batts,it was rather weird,tommy killed batts,then his mother show the painting exactly like batts,and there's two dogs behind,one head for east,the other head for west,does that implicit anything??;6 January 2006;8;['many', 'good', 'shocked', 'first', 'well', 'other', 'legendary', 'perfect', 'agile', 'flexible', 'great', 'cold', 'crazy', 'dangerous', 'disgusting', 'concise', 'hard', 'second', 'more', 'dangerous', 'exciting', 'prime', 'afraid', 'whole', 'interesting', 'smart', 'smart', 'ambitious', 'whole', 'same', 'upper', 'stupid', 'wise', 'hard', 'many', 'pathetic', 'chinese', 'hard', 'weird', 'other', 'implicit'];0.0082046332046331
1064;scyyoung;goodfellas gets a 5/5 which does this film justice due to the amount of unique film techniques utilized by martin scorsese and the length of the movie that never seems to stagnant. the film manages to cover a two and a half decade timeline with the additions of narratives from two of the films main characters to pace the film correctly and fill in details that would've been impossible to inform us in 146 minutes or cover a 25 year timeline, which is integral when documenting a story of a character from childhood to manhood while including other aspects of his life. narration/voiceovers played an integral part in goodfellas because this enables scorsese to give us ample information in a short period of time, which is essential to keep up with the films 25 year span or else the movie would have to be much longer or we'd miss out on crucial details that drive the film. continuing, the film revolves around henry but it is crucial to know and understand what he's into and who his friends or the people he hangs around really are which would've been impossible without the narrative. fortunately for the audience henry is a reliable narrator so we don't have to question what he is saying because no one can tell one's story better them they can, this also adds the ability to add opinion without them being wrong because they're his own opinions.next the narrative makes the audience gravitate towards henry and helps the audience to understand his ways and see him in a better light and not have to make our own assumptions about henry whereas we see him as a hero rather than an anti hero, with henry explaining his ways it helps us look past his greed, drug abuse, and cheating because him explaining himself is almost like an apology or friend telling you why they do the things they do. lastly the dual perspective also adds a flavor not many narratives add which is a female perspective in parallel to the main character. furthermore the camera techniques used in this film are very different than an average cinematographers go to techniques. with the use of long cuts, freehand shots, and following movement during scenes this creates a genuine feeling and makes the film unbelievable realistic and intense. for example one of the most important scenes in the film from a cinematographic aspect is the restaurant scene when henry and karen walk from the street outside through a tunnel and walk through a kitchen into the restaurant and sit down all in one take and no cuts. everything in the scene seems to flow fluidly and perfectly in cohesion with the two stars. the following of the character(s) by the camera adds a 3rd person spectating perspective that indulges you into the film and makes some seemingly pointless scenes interesting. in conclusion goodfellas is a tremendous film directed by martin scorsese that utilizes many film techniques not used together often and creates a seemingly effortless environment while also being realistic to the audience. the theme of the film is surrounded in tragedy and misfortune. while we see henry's rise in power within the mob, we inevitably see his fall towards the second half of the movie. with money,power, and greed even the mightiest may fall which is what we see scattered throughout the later half of the film.;5 June 2017;10;['unique', 'stagnant', 'main', 'impossible', 'integral', 'other', 'integral', 'scorsese', 'ample', 'short', 'essential', 'long', 'crucial', 'crucial', 'impossible', 'reliable', 'well', 'wrong', 'own', 'well', 'own', 'anti', 'dual', 'many', 'female', 'main', 'different', 'average', 'long', 'genuine', 'unbelievable', 'realistic', 'intense', 'important', 'cinematographic', 'pointless', 'interesting', 'tremendous', 'many', 'effortless', 'realistic', 'second', 'mighty', 'later'];0.0864583333333333

1152;preobrazhenskaya_lika;"in general, everything is fine in the film: the setting, the performance of great actors, and the work of the cameraman. i already wrote about the director, he is the best in this sense! this film is very good even now, and even in the 90s it was just a masterpiece. so if you haven't watched it yet, then don't pay attention to when it was filmed, feel free to watch it. it will still be a pleasure to watch today. there is no doubt about this. it is very interesting to look from the inside at what was really going on in the world of gangsters, realizing that these are not fictions and not fantasies. it's impossible to take your eyes off the screen. in fact, there are not very many such worthy films about the mafia, and ""goodfellas"" occupies one of the first places among films of this genre. the most remarkable thing in the picture is that we are also shown simple human feelings and relationships, which is why we want to revise it again and again.";20 January 2022;9;['general', 'fine', 'great', 'good', 'good', 'free', 'interesting', 'impossible', 'many', 'such', 'worthy', 'first', 'remarkable', 'simple', 'human'];0.3155555555555555
1153;abukhtoyrov;"""for as long as i can remember, i always wanted to be a gangster!"" the cult quote that opens the film goodfellas, staged by the famous martin scorsesi based on the documentary book wiseguy (smart guy, in russian) by nicholas pileggi back in 1990, and which has long become a classic of crime cinema, and for the director - a key milestone in his creativity, which finally secured for scorsesi the status of a living classic of world cinema. ""being a gangster meant more to me than being president of the united states"" in general, the word ""gangster"" in russian sounds quite loud, because, thanks to the translators, the viewer could get the impression that the gangster is such a cool hired killer a la leon, who shoots people to order and leaves no traces behind. in fact, the gangster is the most ordinary bandit, a petty criminal from the lower strata of the mafia in the united states, who makes a living selling drugs, murders, robberies and blackmail. the ""upper strata"", bandits ""higher in rank"", more respected and authoritative members of criminal gangs are called differently - they are called mobsters. but today we are not talking about them. it's about gangsters. ""everyone who lived a gray, ordinary life seemed to us just idiots"" the story is told from the perspective of henry hill, an ethnic italian living in the united states with a family of emigrants from sicily. in america in the 1950s, during the heyday of crime and racial discrimination, the prospect of easy money, absolute freedom and impunity was very tempting for a young guy named henry, who worked in a parking lot after school hours, very tempting. on a tiny salary, a large family barely made ends meet, lived half-starving, and literally in the house opposite, the mafiosi played cards at night and had fun as best they could. naturally, to dream that one day he will become one of them, henry hill began from childhood. and, when he had such an opportunity, he, of course, immediately took advantage of it. ""never snitch on your friends. and never open your mouth"" the plot covers the entire ""criminal"" period of the life of henry (played by ray liotta) and his two bosom friends: irish veteran mobster jimmy conway, played by the brilliant robert de niro, and full-blooded italian tommy de vito, whose role he played with a plus joe pesci. his tommy de vito is a small, but extremely aggressive, cynical and irritable bandit, ready for any abomination in order to achieve his goal. a sort of bundle of energy, constantly in tension and just about ready to explode and create another muck. you never know what to expect from something like that, what's on his mind. joe pesci's performance was simply amazing and the oscar was well deserved. the roles of frostbitten criminals are joe's forte, just remember him nikki santoro from the ""casino"" of the same scorsesi. ""do i look like a clown?!"" the film is very plausible (especially since it was filmed according to a documentary) showing the life and customs of those times (50s-80s), dismantled the mechanisms of illegal earnings through various frauds, murders, smuggling, etc. moreover, according to the results of viewing, it becomes clear that the director does not feel any sympathy for the characters, does not try to ""romanticize"" something or arouse sympathy and understanding in the viewer. no snot, no ""drama"" and ""romanticism""! baseball bats that gouge heads, obscene language (no one is shy about choosing expressions in gangster circles), point-blank shootings, bribes, drugs, no fables about gangster honor, justice and duty. everything is shown very vitally and realistically - that's why the film looks so interesting. ""those were good times"" the scene towards the middle of the film is indicative, where the main character takes his woman to an expensive restaurant. bypassing the line at the main doors, they go through the back door, ""thanks"" to each guard along the way with a decent amount of money; actually, they enter the restaurant, and, having exchanged a couple of polite words with the owner, they sit down on the most ""trump card"" table right in front of the podium. technically, the scene is just superbly shot, and it is this scene that represents all this ""romance"" and permissiveness, for which young guys like henry hill turn to gangsterism. shows what attracts people in the life of a mafia. and throughout the rest of the film, scorsesi progressively rids us of these illusions, showing the reverse side of the gangster's carefree life. together with the viewer, the protagonist of the film, who reads the off-screen text, also gets rid of empty childhood fantasies. and how he reads it - it must be heard! with a share of irony and sarcasm, black humor, he seems to take a look at his life, telling in detail and calmly about what he did. what happened in the end? the result is one of the best crime films ever made (and for me personally, it's simply the best mafia movie ever made) and one of the best works of the legendary martin scorsesi. evil, cynical, superbly staged, absolutely realistic and believable - it's all about him. about a masterpiece of cinema called goodfellas. a classic that needs no ratings.";19 January 2022;9;['famous', 'key', 'more', 'general', 'russian', 'loud', 'ordinary', 'petty', 'low', 'upper', 'high', 'respected', 'authoritative', 'criminal', 'gray', 'ordinary', 'ethnic', 'racial', 'easy', 'absolute', 'tempting', 'young', 'tempting', 'tiny', 'large', 'entire', 'criminal', 'irish', 'brilliant', 'full', 'blooded', 'italian', 'small', 'aggressive', 'cynical', 'irritable', 'ready', 'ready', 'amazing', 'deserved', 'frostbitten', 'same', 'plausible', 'illegal', 'various', 'clear', 'gouge', 'obscene', 'shy', 'blank', 'interesting', 'good', 'indicative', 'main', 'expensive', 'main', 'back', 'decent', 'polite', 'young', 'reverse', 'carefree', 'empty', 'black', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'legendary', 'evil', 'cynical', 'realistic', 'believable'];0.0901385281385281
1154;pingyinik;"the nihilistic impulse of ""goodfellas,"" however, does not overstep the bounds of propriety. on the contrary, it turns out to be a good-natured story about friendship. the authors' sense of humor is to blame. black sacrificed most of the film's dramaturgy in favor of the endless stream of gags, the best of which is due to ryan gosling. his character is, in fact, the comedic center of the whole movie - a talentless alcoholic on every occasion screws up the most ridiculous jokes about hitler and terrified of bees. russell crowe clearly loses against him and looks like a kind of shrek, a grumpy grouch in the lead. ""goodfellas"" with proper treatment could resemble ""the big lebowski,"" but to the potential of an absurdist detective, black preferred a lighthearted, old-school comedy. and, perhaps, it only benefited from it. the film argues, with childlike directness, that innocent pranks can be an effective way to fight evil, which is always too serious.";19 January 2022;10;['nihilistic', 'good', 'natured', 'black', 'most', 'endless', 'good', 'due', 'comedic', 'whole', 'ridiculous', 'grumpy', 'proper', 'big', 'absurdist', 'black', 'old', 'childlike', 'innocent', 'effective', 'serious'];0.1366666666666666

1249;kpt4001;"by and far the largest complaint i hear from people is the use of voice-over in film. many complain of how it destroys the purpose of a movie as a visual medium. ""the actors should convey emotion through their acting, not through voice-over,"" these critics might say. i argue that in certain cases, voice-over can make a film better. ""goodfellas"" is my proof that v/o helps a film (as well as terrific direction, masterful cinematography, schoonmakerian editing and a killer soundtrack, but those are givens in a scorsese flick). how else could we really understand henry hill's incredible story of prosperity and joy which eventually turns into one of paranoia and depression? ""goodfellas"" is the story of henry hill (ray liotta), a low ranking soldier (or something like that) in boss paul cicero's crew of brooklyn wise guys. it's also about his friends and partners in crime jimmy conway (robert de niro) and tommy devito (joe pesci) and his wife karen (lorraine bracco). it begins with good times spread around, but due to some poor decision making on everyone's part, the good times don't last long. ""goodfellas"" is a mix of black comedy and dark drama which is all the more affecting because of the humanity of the two main characters, henry and karen hill. karen is especially sympathetic due to her innocence. she tries to rationalize her husband's actions in her v/o, as henry explains everything he thinks in his v/o. back to the point of v/o: it is necessary for henry to speak his mind in v/o because as ""sopranos"" creator david chase said, these guys usually are lying when they talk to their fellow mafia members. the one thing i haven't mentioned is the incredible acting by the whole cast. liotta and bracco shine here more than anyone else in the cast. (yeah, pesci is the most memorable part of this movie according to many other people, but he was much better in ""raging bull"" as was de niro*. that's saying something about ""raging bull"" because pesci won an oscar for this film.) everyone else here was great too. overall, goodfellas is a must see for any scorsese fan. it's my favorite movie of his and i think his magnum opus. marty grew up around these people, so who better to tell their story? *robert de niro is excellent movie he does. he probably even did research on the cia and the florist industry for ""meet the fockers"".";23 June 2007;10;['large', 'many', 'visual', 'certain', 'terrific', 'masterful', 'schoonmakerian', 'scorsese', 'incredible', 'wise', 'good', 'poor', 'good', 'black', 'dark', 'main', 'sympathetic', 'necessary', 'fellow', 'incredible', 'whole', 'more', 'memorable', 'many', 'other', 'well', 'great', 'scorsese', 'favorite', 'magnum', 'excellent', 'florist'];0.3861428571428571

1257;loverboy4u_17;"when people talk to me about movies, i have this tendency to remember my favorite movie in the same genre. so the other day me and 3 of my friends just sat down and discussed the best in all the genres. first we started in fantasy and the winner hands down was lord of the rings and then we went to gangster genre, godfather was the obvious choice and then my friend said goodfellas . i had heard of the movie but never got down to see it, so i went and rented the movie. the next thing i know, i have gone to a music store and bought the vcd. in case you don't get my drift, this movie is awesome! goodfellas is a movie directed by martin scorsese who has another classic, 'raging bull' starring robert de niro under his belt. the movie's main cast consists of ray liotta playing the role of henry, de niro playing the role of james conway better known as jimmy and joe pesci playing the role of tommy. the movie has many other memorable characters but they are too many to mention here. the beginning of the movie itself is awesome. you have jimmy, tommy and henry going in a car and they hear voices from the trunk. they get out and open the trunk and see that the guy they just 'whacked' is still alive. tommy takes a knife and stabs him continuously and jimmy shoots the entire magazine into him. jimmy is witnessing all this and says 'as far back as i can remember, i've always wanted to be a gangster.' superlative stuff! then begins the movie. flashback to the time when henry was a kid. he is fascinated by the way the gangsters live their life and he manages to get a job at the place where the gangsters used to hang around and soon he rises up the ladder and becomes a partner of jimmy and tommy. he is also trusted a lot by polly who is the head honcho of the 'gangster family'. we are shown glimpses of the extravagant life that these guys live. tipping 100 dollars, carrying wads of cash, huge apartments, fast cars, guns, the works. then during one of the 'jobs' henry messes with the wrong guy and finds himself in the prison with many other of his friends including polly. that's when he gets into the wrong business the drugs and narcotics business. then begins a sequence of events which destroy the gangsters and his life. i will stop there as revealing the plot will not make you watch the movie which i definitely want you too! ray liotta has given a performance which he will never better in his life. he has given a very powerful performance and probably he is the only guy in the film you might feel sorry for. the way he laughs in the movie also adds to his performance. the laugh is so 'gangster like'. the other thing that struck me about his performance is his transformation after getting into the narcotics business. it's so real. you have to see it to know it. joe pesci won the oscar for this movie for the best supporting actor. another performance which will not be surpassed by him. he is the foul mouthed and short tempered gangster. he was by far my favorite and most interesting character in the movie. the scene where he tells henry 'but, i'm funny how? funny like a clown? i amuse you? i make you laugh? i'm here to fuc*in' amuse you?' was a really superb scene and pesci was wonderful in that. needless to say, pesci's character shoots lots of bullet and uses a lot of 'f' words. robert de niro? what do you want me to say ? it is robert de niro! wonderful as always. de nero's character is opposite to that of pesci's character. he is the calm, calculative man. he kills almost all his 'friends' when he makes big heist and wants to cut off all the 'links' pointing towards him. the scenes where he interacts with henry are probably his best scenes. there are some scenes in this movie which will remain in my memory for ever. the foul mouthed tommy goes to the honchos house thinking that he is going to be made( sort of a promotion) and when he goes into a room and realizes that he is going to be killed, all he says is , 'oh, no' !. then there is the other scene where henry goes and beats up the guy who teases his girlfriend! then there is the other scene where you are shown how jimmy got rid of his friends who were linked with his big robbery. they first show 2 bodies in the garbage processing machine, then the dead bodies in the car, the dead body in the meat van. oh, this movie is such a master piece. i don't usually do this in my movie reviews, but this movie has so many cool and good dialogues. i would like to share a couple with you. henry - you know, we always called each other goodfellas. like, you'd say to somebody: 'you're gonna like this guy; he's all right. he's a goodfella. he's one of us.' you understand? we were goodfellas, wiseguys.' tommy - he said, 'no, you're gonna tell me something today, tough guy.' i said, 'all right, i'll tell you something: go fuc* your mother!' there are too many of such lines too tell. if you want more, check out the quotes section. move over godfather, there's new number one in loverboy's list.";3 May 2002;10;['favorite', 'same', 'other', 'good', 'obvious', 'next', 'awesome', 'main', 'many', 'other', 'memorable', 'many', 'awesome', 'alive', 'entire', 'superlative', 'honcho', 'extravagant', 'huge', 'fast', 'wrong', 'many', 'other', 'wrong', 'powerful', 'only', 'sorry', 'other', 'real', 'good', 'foul', 'mouthed', 'short', 'favorite', 'interesting', 'funny', 'funny', 'superb', 'wonderful', 'needless', 'wonderful', 'opposite', 'calm', 'calculative', 'big', 'good', 'foul', 'mouthed', 'other', 'other', 'big', 'dead', 'dead', 'many', 'cool', 'good', 'other', 'right', 'tough', 'many', 'such', 'more', 'new'];0.2254602907380685

1259;gchan91;martin scorsese collaborated with nicholas pileggi on this 1990 adaptation of wiseguy, pileggi's nonfiction book about gangsters in brooklyn, and in terms of narrative fluidity it may well be the most accomplished thing scorsese's ever done. set between the mid-50s and the mid-80s, the semi-fictionalized story centers on a half-irish, half-sicilian mafia recruit (ray liotta)--who narrates along with the jewish woman (lorraine bracco) he eventually marries--and the other gangsters in his immediate circle (joe pesci, robert de niro, and paul sorvino). paradoxically, the violent, amoral world the film depicts may be the darkest scorsese has ever shown, but the surface mood is lighter than any scorsese film since alice doesn't live here anymore.de niro performance is brilliant as a charming paranoid mobster and joe pesci's unforgettable.people think goodfellas is similar to the godfather but this focuses more on the blue collar side of the mob.instant classic.;17 August 2008;10;['narrative', 'accomplished', 'semi', 'half', 'irish', 'half', 'jewish', 'other', 'immediate', 'violent', 'amoral', 'dark', 'light', 'scorsese', 'brilliant', 'charming', 'paranoid', 'similar', 'blue'];0.0608974358974359

1265;IuniaSt;masterpiece... 10/10 i will accept any other point of view only if it is very well argued. that is because i loved maths as a child and i still do now. 1.director-scorsese is a genius.as a child, i liked to get near people like goodfellas. it is the same world as this one directed by s. i had the same feeling.that means there's nothing fake in this movie=real art 2.actors-robert de niro, joe pesci and paul sorvino-three monsters i adore. ray liotta...mmm...a real time mob playboy any healthy woman or girl would go crazy after (although in real life i understood he is a quite nice guy) 3.action-brilliant well driven. it is a dream world...but only for wise guys! the only thing that troubled me is that after the incident with the fbi secretary and jail experience, the golden age ended. nothing would ever be the same for goodfellas. what scared me the most is that it was a stupid incident. not a big event or a big change.no, something very easily to happen. why did henry choose to be a runner? why he ended up the hunted and he had to do that stupid choice? after the incident, that something just broke up. they lost the paradise.in the first half-before the incident-everything was in its right place, i had a feeling of secure and optimism and happiness. in the second half, after the incident, everything was upside down, i was scared, i needed to find a way out. i would not have made the choice henry made. if i had the time, i would see this movie every day. i am sure that each time i see it, i will discover a new detail which escaped me the last time. i recommend it to everyone who is smart, tough and enjoys watching a very well done movie. definitely best mob movie of all times!!! congratulations, mr. scorsese!;11 July 2008;10;['other', 'same', 'same', 'fake', 'real', 'real', 'healthy', 'crazy', 'real', 'nice', 'brilliant', 'wise', 'only', 'golden', 'same', 'most', 'stupid', 'big', 'big', 'hunted', 'stupid', 'first', 'right', 'second', 'scared', 'sure', 'new', 'last', 'smart', 'tough', 'good'];0.1124028749028749
1266;jdice11;"one of the most famous lines in goodfellas is ""ever since i can remember, i always wanted to be a gangster."" it turns out that goodfellas shows that what one may ultimately want may not be the best for them. as a young boy henry hill looked up to the ""gangster"" life. there were many aspects of the ""gangster"" lifestyle that attracted henry. a gangster does what he wants with no regard to anyone else. gangsters often operate in groups or ""families."" it was when henry takes his first job working at the local pizza shop that he was first introduced to the gangster life. henry witnessed interaction between different gangsters and started to yearn for the lifestyle of a gangster. henry's yearning became more evident when he began taking on small ""odds and end"" jobs for the owner of the pizza shop. as a man in his early twenties, henry continues on his quest for what he thought would make the ""perfect"" life as a gangster. the fame associated with the gangsters he witnessed as a young boy is what initially attracted him and now he started to experience the gangster life. henry continued his experience by continuing to work jobs for mob bosses, such as frankie carbone. henry continued working these ""gangster"" jobs, even after he was disowned by his mother and father. as henry continued through his twenties, he continued obtaining everything that he wanted, including a gorgeous wife, cars, money, and respect. the wife, the cars and the money are all things that gangsters work hard to obtain and now henry had obtained them. henry continued to work hard and to build his wealth, as shown in the scene where henry and all of his friends are gathered around a table and they dumb a huge bag of money on the table. this was after he and his friends pull off one of the biggest heists in history. with this wealth, henry began to start new business ventures that would ultimately prove to be bad decisions. like previously stated, gangsters do whatever they want to do. this sometimes even occurs against the ""boss'"" orders. one of the pivotal parts of the movie is when the boss, frankie, finds out the henry went against his wishes and was now in trouble. frankie helps henry one last time, and then tells him that he is turning his back on him. this isn't the first time henry is smacked in the face. frankie turning his back on henry begins to show that henry could potentially be on the down fall. it was after this point that henry begins to watch his back wherever he goes. this even occurs around his friends, jimmy and tommy. this type of behavior might be seen as unordinary, especially around people that are friends. another pivotal part of the film is towards the end. it is after henry and his family go into the witness protection program. henry and his family enter the program because henry ""folds"" on frankie and jimmy. you can see the tension through a high angle shot that is focusing on frankie and jimmy in the courtroom. this truly shows that henry holds the power. henry and his family enter the program and are immediately moved away from new york. the viewer is able to see that henry has lost everything. as henry is on the porch, the camera begins to zoom in and henry says that he is now a ""nobody."" this shows that he has come so far, and at the end he is not what he wanted to be. henry looks as though he has lost everything and like he has hit rock bottom. goodfellas shows that you may want something, but it may not always be the best choice for you. much like the film scarface, it turns out that the money, the fame, and the gangster life it not a good decision. ""ever since i can remember, i always wanted to be a gangster"" was not a good choice for henry. he lost everything and now feels that he is a ""nobody."" it turned out that all of henry's hard work and dedication to be a gangster did not get him what he wanted. ultimately, it made him a ""nobody.""";17 July 2008;10;['famous', 'good', 'young', 'gangster', 'many', 'gangster', 'first', 'local', 'different', 'evident', 'small', 'early', 'perfect', 'young', 'such', 'gangster', 'gorgeous', 'huge', 'big', 'new', 'bad', 'pivotal', 'last', 'first', 'down', 'pivotal', 'high', 'able', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'hard'];0.2534186694531522
1267;kjamking;"not only is this movie a masterpiece in cinema history and quite possibly the most charming and honest mob movie of all time but it also checks all the boxes for cinematic brilliance. firstly, the cinematography is outstanding due to the unbeatable combination of micheal ballhaus and scorsese's guiding hand that also helped shape another one of my favourite titles, the departed. both movies showed great camera work and a certain flare for the unique angle or unorthodox composition. the acting is also superb with joe pesci delivering his boldest performance to date. he plays the role of an insecure sociopath with an unexpected charm (although he took on a similar character profile in casino). however the story absolutely steals the show with a captivating account of the rise and fall of small time gangster henry hill, in a manner only scorsese could perfect. admittedly i am a huge fan of the rise and fall (especially the fall) but this movie will intrigue and demand your full devotion to each character. the soundtrack embeds every vital moment in the movie to your memory with a classic song that subtly dictates the tone of the scene and strongly sets the atmosphere for the time period which spans over three decades. watching a ""hit"" being performed by a stone cold gangster, shadowed by a soft love song in the background, can dramatically effect the way you feel about the killer. however, an unmistakable achievement of this movie is it's ability to tell the truth unlike other famous titles such as the godfather which shamelessly romanticises the outcome of a life on the wrong side of the law. the film never fails to engage the viewer all throughout and follows an underlying tale of how the morality of even the organised crime sector of society has its black and white patches,as well a very large grey area. in all, goodfellas is the benchmark of mob movies but also an all time great in movie history for its pure cinematic brilliance.";18 August 2008;9;['charming', 'honest', 'cinematic', 'outstanding', 'unbeatable', 'micheal', 'favourite', 'great', 'certain', 'unique', 'unorthodox', 'superb', 'bold', 'insecure', 'unexpected', 'similar', 'small', 'huge', 'full', 'vital', 'classic', 'cold', 'soft', 'unmistakable', 'other', 'famous', 'such', 'wrong', 'underlying', 'black', 'white', 'large', 'great', 'pure', 'cinematic'];0.1836617405582922

1270;Edg9624;"martin scorsese's energetic and powerful style of film-making reached its apex with the 1990 release of goodfellas, the film considered his third masterpiece (following raging bull and taxi driver). it is arguably his greatest work, and it will inarguably live forever as the ultimate execution of his film-making style. the ultra-tight, choppy editing of long-time scorsese collaborator only adds to the excitement of this riveting tale of small-time new york mobsters spanning three decades. henry hill (ray liotta) grew up around the mob figures he eventually identified himself with, and became one of them at a very early age. he became partners and friends with local legend jimmy 'the gent' conway (robert de niro) and tommy devito (joe pesci), also at a young age. liotta's performance is one of a man that is blinded by material excess and permanently shaped by the violent and assertive people with which he surrounded himself. he rises, falls, rises again and falls again all within the 150-minute narrative of the film, and his story is the epitome of the old adage ""crime doesn't pay."" de niro is subdued, yet stunning as jimmy conway. his lack of attention from pundits and fans is only because he disappeared so deeply into the role, you weren't aware you were watching a robert de niro performance. pesci is nothing short of extraordinary as tommy devito, an irrationally violent man who abuses his abilities as a mob figure to the point of going too far. he meets his comeuppance in one of the great build-ups and payoffs of all time. scorsese's oft-visited themes of moral ambivalence and male assertiveness have never been so prevalent, and every single shot of the film has a purpose. the tracking shot of henry and wife karen entering the copacabana nightclub still remains one of the great all-time long takes, as we are introduced to his world just as karen is. there are several great sequences, including a montage of dead bodies seamlessly set to ""layla"" and henry's coked-up follies in the ""may 5, 1980"" sequence that demonstrates the virtuosic vision and talent that scorsese possesses. it's a crime that scorsese was not awarded the oscar for directing and best picture. it was undoubtedly the best film of 1990, and is arguably the best film of the 1990s. it is a seminal piece of film-making that influenced the ""vcr"" generation of tarantino, p.t. anderson and several others, and remains the most exhilarating and power-packed 2 1/2 hour film since its release. for an unflinching look at the effect of power and excess on people, look no further.";16 January 2008;10;['energetic', 'powerful', 'third', 'great', 'ultimate', 'ultra', 'tight', 'choppy', 'long', 'scorsese', 'riveting', 'small', 'early', 'local', 'young', 'violent', 'assertive', 'old', 'stunning', 'aware', 'short', 'extraordinary', 'violent', 'great', 'moral', 'male', 'prevalent', 'single', 'great', 'long', 'several', 'great', 'dead', 'virtuosic', 'scorsese', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'seminal', 'several', 'exhilarating'];0.178921568627451

(it opens friday at selected theaters.) scorsese has hardly been marking time in the 10 years between the two; ""after hours"" and his ""life lessons"" segment of ""new york stories"" showed just how much he has matured, grown more intelligently ironic and is even more astonishingly in command of his craft.

1290;luisk1989;goodfellas by director martin scorsese is by far my most favourite gangster movie of all times. it's one of those movies that, despite its runtime of over 2 hours, i can watch again and again without ever getting bored at any time. what it clearly sets it above other masterpieces of this genre like 'the godfather' is that every scene gives me something. while many other movies of its kind tend to have scenes that get a bit tiresome or just aren't that interesting or entertaining, 'goodfellas' succeeds to deliver top-notch entertainment until the end. this is, of course, thanks to the extremely well written script and to the perfect cast. ray liotta, joe pesci and robert de niro who play the main characters give so good performances, that i could not think of any other actor to play any of those roles and the rest of the cast is equally good. the movie has a perfect pacing which is also thanks to the narration of henry hill alias ray liotta. his voice accompanies us through the whole movie and is definitely a huge fun factor. he delivers his story so well that you virtually live through this movie with him. when he describes how he got into the organization and what it's like to be a wiseguy, you really comprehend and feel it. then there are the technical aspects of the movie. the camera work is brilliant with very long tracking shots and scenes without a cut which take you as an invisible spectator along through the scenes. and last but not least there's the music. scorsese makes use of well-known pop music of that time, which really adds to the atmosphere as a whole. in the end, 'goodfellas' is my favourite scorsese and gangster movie as well. there are very few movies (of that length and scope) that manage to deliver such a constant and high entertainment value from start to finish, but this is one that does.;5 July 2012;10;['favourite', 'bored', 'other', 'many', 'other', 'tiresome', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'top', 'perfect', 'main', 'good', 'other', 'good', 'perfect', 'whole', 'huge', 'technical', 'brilliant', 'long', 'invisible', 'last', 'least', 'favourite', 'scorsese', 'few', 'constant', 'high'];0.2209027777777778

1294;andrewneo300;"one of the finest films in history, martin scorsese's goodfellas is a true phenomenon and stands out as the leading film in the gangster movie genre. the film tells the story of the life of mobster, henry hill, portrayed by ray liotta, and his and his fellow ""wiseguys"" jimmy(robert de niro), tommy(joe pesci) and boss paulie(paul sorvino). the casting for the film is absolutely spot on,as every character is played with complete conviction and credibility. everyone in the film has insecurities and conflicting emotions shown throughout, and whats amazing about these characters is how their personalities lead them into dissolution. despite how disturbing these mobsters are, the maniacal and unpredictable joe pesci especially, there is something likable about them, and even as liotta's character slowly goes from rise to fall into a life of excessive drug abuse, it still feels as if he is the protagonist in the film. another actor deserving a mention for a brilliant performance in the film is lorraine bracco, who plays karen, henry's first wife, from first meeting her character when she goes out with a reluctant henry, you wouldn't believe throughout all the troubles she sticks by henry and eventually succumbs to his lifestyle, as quoted ""it turns her on"". the sense of family in the mob is ever present in the film, with paulie acting as a father figure for henry, who is inspired by jimmy and tommy, and the three embark down a violent road of crime, from robberies to murder, meanwhile getting married and having children. another brilliant feature of the film is the soundtrack, a brilliant selection of songs spanning over twenty years that set the scenes. from tony bennett's ""rags to riches"" to derek and the dominoes' ""layla"", each song is combined perfectly to comment on the actions in the film. the screenplay for the movie, based on nicolas pileggi's book ""wiseguy"" is completely flawless, gripping and intense throughout, keeping the audience fixated on how the characters are going to respond or take action next. personally, for me this is martin scorsese's best film and one of my favourite films, it captures the life of this young boy turned gangster perfectly with iconic scenes again and again, making it a memorable spectacle to watch.";22 February 2013;10;['fine', 'true', 'complete', 'conflicting', 'amazing', 'maniacal', 'unpredictable', 'likable', 'excessive', 'brilliant', 'first', 'reluctant', 'present', 'violent', 'married', 'brilliant', 'brilliant', 'flawless', 'intense', 'good', 'favourite', 'young', 'iconic', 'memorable'];0.3475

1306;cito500;"goodfellas is lauded as an amazing film, better than the godfather and possibly the greatest mobster film of all time if not the greatest overall film. this is ridiculous. our protagonist, henry hill (ray liotta), says he always wanted to be gangster. when he joins the mob, he and his friends experience the high-standard and high-risk life of gangsters. so the film follows his new life till its end. i'll agree the directing and writing was impressive. acting was well-performed too. the narrative told through the voice-over of henry hill and occasionally his wife (lorraine bracco) is enjoyable and the general progression of the storyline is good. nice pacing, etc. i was definitely interested and the movie kept me submersed. the biggest problem with this film, for me, were the characters. almost none of them were likable. henry hill was a drug-addict, and sold drugs even though his long-time friend and boss paulie cicero specifically told him not to. hill constantly gets into arguments with his wife, once threatening to kill her, and yet constantly cheats on her. he's always going on about how regular people are losers who don't know how to get on in life and acting like they deserve to have their livelihood taken from them. that's another thing: he steals whole shipments from truck drivers and airports. now i like gang movies as much as the next guy. the same goes for dark, depraved films. they're interesting. but i finished this movie with a unsatisfied, irritated feeling. i don't know how anyone could like these characters. by the end of the film i was waiting to see them all get their comeuppance. tommy devito (joe pesci) is a maniac. he kills people left and right and for just mildly insulting him. he brutally murdered his life-long friend billy batts. tommy shot and killed a kid because the boy told him to ""go f*** yourself"" and that was because he had already been shot in the foot by devito and the man just kept making fun of the kid. sure the boy (his name was spider) wasn't a teenager, but he was definitely in his twenties, probably early twenties. not to mention morris kessler and that other guy from the restaurant. devito owed both of them money and when they patiently asked for it, he killed one of them and nearly killed the other. i wasn't sad when devito got ""whacked"" instead being made. i only wished his death was a little more painful instead of a simple shot to the head. anyway, henry's wife karen was also a bit of an jerk. she also threatens to kill him, and while most of her motives are reasonable, she doesn't have many redeemable traits. the same goes for pretty much all of the other main characters. jimmy conway (robert de niro) was unlikable and trigger-happy. paulie was probably the only main character who wasn't a complete jerk. he, at least, had some common sense. i know this is a gangster film, and this is based on real-life events and maybe its bleak violence could be considered ""edgy."" but this is definitely not better than the godfather or other gangster films like the untouchables. at least the characters in the godfather were likable. they had a sense of honor and reason. i liked vito corleone, i liked michael and sonny and a bunch of the other characters. when they killed, it was for a better reason than these lunatics. when some of them got killed, i felt sad for them. i guess the movie's overall production value is good, but it doesn't redeem it and it certainly doesn't make it better than the godfather. if you're going to make characters who do horrible things, you have to do it for a better purpose. there needs to be depth or reasoning. this whole thing was needlessly mean-spirited. for me, the despicable characters ruined the whole experience. for you, it may not. that's just my opinion.";2 August 2013;5;['amazing', 'well', 'great', 'great', 'overall', 'ridiculous', 'gangster', 'high', 'high', 'new', 'impressive', 'enjoyable', 'general', 'good', 'nice', 'interested', 'big', 'likable', 'long', 'regular', 'whole', 'next', 'same', 'dark', 'interesting', 'unsatisfied', 'irritated', 'right', 'long', 'sure', 'early', 'other', 'other', 'sad', 'little', 'painful', 'simple', 'most', 'reasonable', 'many', 'redeemable', 'same', 'other', 'main', 'unlikable', 'happy', 'only', 'main', 'complete', 'least', 'common', 'real', 'bleak', 'edgy', 'well', 'other', 'least', 'likable', 'sonny', 'other', 'well', 'sad', 'overall', 'good', 'well', 'horrible', 'well', 'whole', 'mean', 'spirited', 'despicable', 'whole'];0.0977470834250495

1308;mckelv03;"the film, goodfellas, is a modern day gangster film brilliantly directed by martin scorsese. the film is sure to be an instant classic and stars ray liotta, as henry hill, robert de niro as jimmy conway, and joe pesci as tommy. the film, a crime drama, is based on a true story and chronicles henry hill as he transitions into a gangster family. this film has a character driven theme with a plot based on the business of being a gangster. the characters are presented like family members and the ""family"" business revolves around protecting people who cannot, for various reason, reach out to local law enforcement. the golden rule in this family business is to ""never rat on your friends and always keep your mouth shut"". the film unfolds in a series of flashbacks spanning from 1955 to 1970 and opens with henry hill, as a young man. he recounts his fascination with the gangster lifestyle and what drew him deeper into ""the family business"". as a young man, the fascination was with the power associated with being affiliated with the gangsters. he was earning very good money and gaining respect along the way. to a young henry hill, his new found gangster family were well dressed gentleman who always had money and were respected in their community for ""sharing"" their wealth and protecting the innocent. the film goes on to introduce the other members of the ""family"". pauly, played by paul sorvino, is the head of the ""family"" and keeps everyone in line and earning to support the entire business. henry's mentor in the business is jimmy, and jimmy liked to steal. jimmy did his business as a gentleman, paying for his tip-offs and treating his ""victims"" with respect. he would rob the trucks and sell off the goods, insuring that everyone got a piece and making everyone happy with ""the deal"". tommy is henry's cohort in crime as they develop their side of the business together. tommy introduces henry to his wife karen, played by lorraine bracco, and they live like brothers and raise their families in the suburbs. karen, as henry's wife, is more than happy to turn her head to the family business as long as it suits her needs. the editing, and specifically the transitions, are essential to this movie as the movie spans a thirty year time period. the editing throughout this movie is key for these transitions as there is much back and forth between the current time frame of the film, as well as the history leading up to those points. this back and forth editing allows for the character of henry hill to be fully developed and provides the viewer the history behind the character and the choices that he ultimately makes. as a result of the frequent flashback series, there is also significant voice-over narration throughout the movie. during the first half of the movie, the background of the henry hill character is told via several flashback scenarios. the film opens with a flashback sequence that takes the view back to henry's childhood. the adult voice of henry is noted as the younger version of henry's childhood plays out. this sequencing continues to explain how henry met his wife, got married, had children, and delved further into the family business the story is brilliantly told makes it is easy to understand how a young and impressionable henry gets pulled into the business. as the story unfolds, the viewer begins to feel the increasing pressure that henry is under to continue to earn for this family partners. as the film ends, it is evident that henry has broken the golden rule of the family business and has turned into his own worse nightmare. as with all families, things may look pretty on the outside, but rarely do you find one without a set of problems.";21 September 2013;9;['modern', 'sure', 'instant', 'true', 'various', 'local', 'golden', 'young', 'deep', 'young', 'good', 'young', 'new', 'dressed', 'innocent', 'other', 'entire', 'happy', 'more', 'happy', 'essential', 'key', 'current', 'frequent', 'significant', 'first', 'several', 'young', 'easy', 'young', 'impressionable', 'under', 'evident', 'golden', 'own', 'bad'];0.2051423324150596

1326;dgold3111;"*warning: some spoilers are contained in the review below* what's so great about being a gangster? what are the perks? well, if you're a ""goodfella"" or one of the ""wise guys,"" you'll be able to let everyone know. martin scorsese's goodfellas (1990) is by far one of the greatest gangster movies made today. scorsese is the director of other films such as shutter island, the departed, and wolf of wall street. along with these great films, goodfellas has received many awards, including an academy award for best actor in a supporting role. scorsese is able to bring the element of fear to the audience, but at the same time allows them to emphasize with a group of gangsters. watching this film, i realized that it doesn't have a structure. there is no concrete beginning, middle, or end, which is what keeps the audience tuned in throughout a long movie such as this one. the start of the film begins with a scene that likely (and as we find out later, does) come during the middle of the movie. we are started off with three of the main characters, henry hill (ray liotta), jimmy conway (robert de niro) and tommy devito (joe pesci) driving in a car with what we discover is a dead body in the trunk, followed by the voice of a young henry hill saying, ""as far back as i can remember, i always wanted to be a gangster."" this background narration of his voice foreshadows that he is going to take us back to square one, to the days that he knew he wanted to be one of them; part of the mafia. the cinematography of the film is what creates the elements and moods that the audience feels while watching the film there are many scenes in the film that are long shots; which are shots taken without any editing. watching a film, that foremost, is considered to be more of a story than have a plot line, is much more interesting to watch through long shots. these shots are able to make an audience feel more connected to the characters in the film. the audience is able to follow different characters in the film and see exactly what they are doing, where they are going, and who they are dealing with, all in one shot. what really kept me interested in goodfellas is how hard it is to determine who are the protagonists and who are the antagonists. i enjoy a challenge and i enjoy watching a movie that makes me think. since the film is so long, and there are only so many main characters, it takes a longer time to unravel their secrets, personalities, and lifestyles. after watching the entire film, i left still not knowing for sure if i would consider any of the characters to be protagonists. throughout the film, we see nearly each character either; steal, murder, do drugs and/or make all sorts of illegal deals. then again, this is what kept me on my toes. this is why this movie is different from all of the others. there doesn't have to be a specific hero or villain. it's truly depicted on how the audience interprets the movie. you are never completely positive which person was doing the right thing in any situation. another thing this film does wonderfully is provide a great social commentary about the mafia versus the government. considering that this movie is based off a true story and book; wiseguy: life in a mafia family; it is considered to be a semi documentary. containing some truth and factual details to the events in the film; it is able to shed light on the inner networks of the mafia. we, as an audience, are able to see inside a group that most people would fear, but as we watch we consider emphasizing with them instead. we see how the mafia is intertwined with small businesses, big businesses and especially the government. it was complete corruption. during the final trial scene with henry hill testifying against his longtime friend, jimmy conway, hill makes a comment where he admits that they paid off policemen, lawyers, and judges. they got away with everything because they were feared by everyone around them. the entire movie revolves around the commentary that all outsiders feared them, but once you were in, you loved them, and they were family. by the end, i left the film not sure whether or not i should feel bad for the gangsters who were murdered, sent to jail, or sent to the witness protection program; or whether i should have been happy justice was served. that feeling that i had was exactly why i recommend this movie to anyone who wants to think critically; to anyone who appreciates a challenge with their inner-self while watching a film. if you appreciate action, violence, loyalty and betrayal, love and unfaithfulness; this movie is calling your name.";20 October 2014;8;['great', 'wise', 'able', 'great', 'other', 'such', 'great', 'many', 'good', 'able', 'same', 'concrete', 'middle', 'long', 'such', 'main', 'dead', 'young', 'many', 'long', 'more', 'interesting', 'long', 'able', 'connected', 'able', 'different', 'interested', 'hard', 'long', 'many', 'main', 'long', 'entire', 'sure', 'illegal', 'different', 'specific', 'positive', 'right', 'great', 'social', 'true', 'semi', 'factual', 'able', 'inner', 'able', 'most', 'small', 'big', 'complete', 'final', 'longtime', 'entire', 'sure', 'bad', 'happy', 'inner'];0.2165997638724911

1329;torbec01;"goodfellas is definitely one of the best gangster movies i have ever seen. martin scorsese directed this film perfectly with a pistol whipping cast. this film is based on a true story about henry hill, and how he strives from a kid to an adult to be a gangster in the life of the italian mafia. the film is set between 1955 and the late 1970's in east new york, brooklyn. the cast is filled with some of the biggest stars of the early nineties. including ray liotta, who played the main character henry hill. along with robert de niro as jimmy conway, also known as jimmy ""the gem"", and joe pesci who played tommy devito. these actors do an outstanding job on screen of portraying the classic gangster theme. i could not be distracted throughout watching this film. it literally sucked me into the story. martin scorsese did an outstanding job with the cast, production, music, and the story of the gangster life in new york. henry hill wanted to be a gangster since he was a kid. watching the gangsters around the neighborhood, he desired more and more to be like them. he was intrigued from the start and wanted a life of no limits. henry, jimmy, and tommy were a great trio of hardcore gangsters who demanded respect and didn't take crap from anyone. the film is full of countless gangsters with a great script and superb music and sound. the soundtrack really pulled me into the era of the 60's and 70's. the costumes and clothes were done very well. the costume and makeup design mirrored the era very well. the film also had a great amount of gangster crime and violence that kept my attention the whole time. the lighting in the film was mostly dark. some of these scenes were in a club and bars so it matched perfectly for a gangster setting. scorsese also did well during a scene where the trio was digging up an old friend and the lighting was dark and foggy. the lighting in this scene also had a red tint to it. another great scene was a classic slow motion up close shooting by tommy devito. you can see each empty shell fly out of the pistol in slow motion. the communication of the brutal violence of the mafia was well received. overall, the film had every element of the gangster life. the film told the story very well and kept me entertained as much as when i was watching the godfather. both are classic gangster films that will never be forgotten for years to come.";17 March 2015;9;['good', 'true', 'italian', 'late', 'big', 'early', 'main', 'outstanding', 'classic', 'outstanding', 'more', 'great', 'hardcore', 'full', 'countless', 'great', 'great', 'whole', 'dark', 'old', 'dark', 'foggy', 'red', 'great', 'classic', 'slow', 'close', 'empty', 'slow', 'brutal', 'classic'];0.1782738095238095

1335;bethbrusk-40261;"the movie, goodfellas, is the true story of henry hill, a former american mobster. henry (ray liotta) was born into a working class family in brooklyn, new york. henry knew from an early age that he wanted more out of life than simply struggling to make ends meet. when, as a teenager, he had the opportunity to run errands for the lucchese crime family as a means of earning money, he immediately got a taste of the life he so desperately wanted to lead. henry dropped out of school to begin working for the lucchese crime family full-time. after his first arrest, henry learned the most important rule of living life as a mobster: ""never rat out your friends, and always keep your mouth shut."" henry quickly made his way through the ranks of the lucchese crime family, and became very successful in his new career. henry eventually spends time in prison, and ends up getting involved in a side business of selling drugs, which went against the wishes of the lucchese crime boss, paulie (paul sorvino). in the end, henry is forced to turn against his crime family, and leave the mob life that he always wanted to lead in order to save his own life. goodfellas depicts the rise and downfall of henry's mob career, and the demise of his way of life. the theme of goodfellas is a focus on the character development of henry hill, and his desire to live life as a rich and successful gangster. the storyline is presented as a linear flashback of henry's life, narrated by henry himself. henry believed that ""being a gangster was better than being the president of the united states."" it was the only thing that he ever wanted to do. henry believed that being a gangster would allow him to achieve the highest level of success that he valued most: respect. henry wanted desperately to be ""a somebody in a neighborhood full of nobodies."" the desire to have the respect of those around him was henry's motivation to become a gangster. henry admired the mob boss, paulie, for the respect that he garnered the respect that henry so desperately wanted to attain. henry began working at the cabstand and the pizzeria that paulie owned, and worked through the ranks of the mob's organization, from parking cars, to making deliveries, to carrying out important tasks. henry liked the respect he received from others in the neighborhood due to his association with top gangsters. he stated, ""people looked at me differently, and they knew i was with somebody. i didn't have to wait in line at the bakery on sunday morningthe owner knew who i was, and no matter how many people were in line, i was taken care of first."" henry's motivation was the respect that he earned in being a gangster. henry's compulsive desire for money, social status, and success led him to start a side business of drug dealing, which was something that paulie strictly forbade, and went against his ""family."" eventually, henry gets busted for dealing drugs, and the police have enough evidence of his involvement with drug dealing that he is looking at a life sentence in prison with no parole. paulie becomes angry because henry had lied to him and disobeyed his command to stop the drug business. paulie tells henry that he has to turn his back on him, meaning that his relationship with the lucchese crime family is over. knowing that he, karen, and their children are marked targets, henry saw no other choice but to break his trust with the lucchese crime family and enter the witness protection program so he could divulge information about his dealings with the mob. if he didn't, henry knew it would just be a matter of time before he and his family were killed. in the end, henry lost his trust with the people he had worked with for a lifetime, and was forced to turn his back on them, and more importantly, the life he loved the most. he was forced to break the most important rule in the life of a mobster never rat out your friends, and always keep your mouth shut. the use of cinematic techniques help to define henry's character throughout the movie, and support the theme of the rise and fall of henry's mob career. director, martin scorsese, used unique camera angles to show the development of henry's character, and the rise of henry's mobster status. in the first scene that reveals an adult henry, the camera angle is shooting henry from the bottom, looking upward, giving henry the appearance that he is larger than life, and has been raised to mobster status. another cinematic technique used to further develop henry's character is through the viewer gaining insight into henry's internal actions. the entire film is told through henry's perspective, and the viewer has insight into henry's deepest thoughts about his own actions and the actions of those around him. goodfellas is a study in how henry's greed and desire for status and respect ultimately leads to his downfall. for henry, even harder than breaking trust and turning against his crime family, was the loss of the way of life he had become so accustomed to, as henry states in the final scene: the hardest thing for me was to have to leave the life. i still love the lifeand now, it's all over.there's no action i have to wait around like everyone else i'm an average nobody. i get to live the rest of my life like a schnook. henry lost everything he had ever wanted out of life. as the movie fades, you see the end result of henry's deal with the witness protection program living in suburbia, he is now forced to live the boring life of the people he used to mock the life of a

1349;jonjergens;"""goodfellas"" is a movie based on the life story of henry hill, played by ray liotta, and his involvement in the new york mafia. henry's main partners throughout the movie are tommy (joe pesci), james conway (robert de niro), the boss paul (paul cicero) and his wife karen (lorraine braco). the movie revolves around a few different plot points as henry moves through the mafia. at the beginning, henry is a teenager and responsible for small things, such as parking cars or selling stolen property. as he grows up he becomes fully entrenched into the mafia. the film does a great job of showing the family atmosphere of the mafia, especially showing the distinction between their public marriage and their private affairs, or ""fridays are for girlfriends"" routine. as henry gets deeper into the drugs, you can see his physical appearance change. their house, which was once very simply designed, becomes designed with wild colors and arrangements, representing the craziness of their lives. the settings continue to get more and more convoluted until he is finally arrested. as he has to choose between his mafia family and his wife and kids, you can understand how much he felt he lost - his entire identity. another method that was extremely effective was that throughout the movie, henry narrated, explaining different actions of the mafia, what things meant, and how he interpreted things. karen also narrated at the beginning, explaining her attraction to henry, but giving a vivid account of how she interpreted the mafia from the outside, showing how different the two views were at the time. this was in contrast to a similar movie series, ""the godfather,"" where very little narration took place. both were effective ways of communicating the action, however the narration in ""goodfellas"" ensured that the audience knew what was going on the entire time, whereas ""the godfather"" allowed the audience to make up their own minds. overall, ""goodfellas"" was an excellent film. the life in the mafia is always a bit of a mystery, and the film brought to light many different aspects of the life, from how they make money, to the killings, and their deep family life. the techniques the director used amplified in many ways henry's life and his eventual arrest and the events thereafter. they helped form a bond with his character that almost made you feel sympathetic to him, and allowed the audience to really enter into the mafia lifestyle.";25 April 2016;8;['main', 'tommy', 'few', 'different', 'responsible', 'small', 'such', 'great', 'public', 'private', 'routine', 'deep', 'physical', 'wild', 'more', 'convoluted', 'much', 'entire', 'effective', 'different', 'vivid', 'different', 'similar', 'little', 'effective', 'entire', 'own', 'excellent', 'many', 'different', 'deep', 'many', 'eventual', 'sympathetic'];0.1915229885057471

1391;TheQuietSpectre;the best scorsese movie by far in my humble opinion, goodfellas is a movie that takes the viewer in an unprecedented wild trip of crimes committed senselessly and, sometimes, for the absolute silly reasons. is a movie that deglamorized the mob and showed us what really it is being a member of it. the acting, writing, atmosphere, and the perfect direction by scorsese makes the movie an enduring mark in the crime genre and history of film in general.;23 September 2018;10;['good', 'scorsese', 'humble', 'unprecedented', 'wild', 'absolute', 'silly', 'perfect', 'general'];0.24375
1392;johnft;if viewers think this movie belongs in the same breath as the godfather, they are sadly mistaken. on a scale of 1-10 (10 being best), i would rate goodfellas a 6.0. the godfather is an 11. the best thing going for goodfellas is the casting of de niro. he is perfectly cast as a tough gritty gangster. joe pesci should stick to comedy, i.e. my cousin vinny or home alone. pesci is not convincing as a maniacal mobster. he is almost cartoonish. pesci's tommy devito versus luca brasi is a huge mismatch. ray liotta is mediocre as the character henry hill. paul sorvino plays his mafia kingpin character as tongue-in-cheek. don't compare him to brando's corleone. the musical score, screen play, cinematography and directing is slighly above average. afi 2008 had this movie rated 92nd all time (way too high). btw - they had the godfather rated # 2 all time, one spot too low.;16 November 2018;6;['same', 'mistaken', 'good', 'good', 'tough', 'gritty', 'convincing', 'maniacal', 'cartoonish', 'huge', 'mediocre', 'musical', 'average', 'high', 'low'];0.1184259259259259
