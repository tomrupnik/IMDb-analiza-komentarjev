0;MartinHafer;"""pulp fiction"" is a brilliantly crafted film. the many separate vignettes all are quite compelling and fit together wonderfully. and, on top of that, the script and acting are exceptional. and, most importantly, the film is wildly original and very, very stylish. the only reservations i have are minor. first, while this is a very, very good film, i can't see why it is ranked #5 all-time on imdb. this seems wildly overrated and too often more recent films seem to dominated imdb's top 250. second, this film is certainly not for everyone, as in spots it is tremendously violent (like any tarantino film) and should not be viewed by kids or the overly sensitive. because there are so many reviews for the film already, i won't bother to try to give a synopsis of the film or do an in-depth analysis.";13 March 2010;10;['many', 'separate', 'compelling', 'fit', 'exceptional', 'original', 'stylish', 'only', 'minor', 'good', 'overrated', 'recent', 'top', 'violent', 'tarantino', 'sensitive', 'many'];0.2636904761904762
1;TheLittleSongbird;what can i say? this film is amazing, and i would go further and say it is my favourite quentin tarantino film, and one of my favourites of the 90s. the cinematography and scenery are spellbinding, and the soundtrack is brilliant, one of the best soundtracks in a tarantino film actually. the plot is every bit as compelling as that for reservoir dogs, while the dialogue is endlessly quotable and quite hard-boiled. the direction is superb, as are the performances. as excellent as uma thurman, bruce willis and christopher walken are, the film's best actors are john travolta and samuel l.jackson who are unforgettable. pulp fiction also has a wealth of characters and crossplots that is really quite astonishing. all in all, brilliant. 10/10 bethany cox;9 December 2010;10;['amazing', 'favourite', 'tarantino', 'brilliant', 'good', 'tarantino', 'compelling', 'reservoir', 'quotable', 'superb', 'excellent', 'good', 'unforgettable', 'astonishing', 'brilliant'];0.74
2;Leofwine_draca;"quentin tarantino's gallery of grotesques is definitely a strange film to watch. breaking many of the modern rules of a film - there are four interlocking stories instead of one, the subject matters tackled are extremely adult and may not be to everybody's taste - it's a wonder that the film succeeds, but in the end pulp fiction has to be one of the best films of the 1990s. as much as we would like to ignore it, this is what the world is like today, full of drugs, violence and hostility, and it's about time a film faced up to the real world. pulp fiction does just this. i liked three of the stories, but the one involving travolta and thurman left me cold i'm afraid. for a start, it's far too long and needlessly talky (about nothing in particular), and could have been cut down a lot. it seems to take ages to get to the actual horror of the piece (thurman's drug overdose and subsequent heart injection), and when that moment comes, it's over extremely quickly. there is no particularly memorable dialogue here, either. the surrounding story, where the couple hold up a restaurant, is perfectly set up, and the final moments, where jackson holds up the robbers himself, does show some of tarantino's genius as jackson quietly discusses the situation with his would-be robbers in a matter-of-fact way. the story of travolta and jackson trying to clear up their 'mess' is an excellent piece of black comedy, well-timed and with a scene-stealing performance from harvey keitel as the wolf. bruce willis' story is very good too, with some unexpected twists in the tale and some harrowing scenes. there's a catchy jukebox score and an ensemble cast to liven things up too. the cast list is a reading of '90s talent: john travolta in his comeback film; samuel l jackson was relatively unheard-of then; uma thurman proved herself as a woman to be reckoned with; bruce willis lent another world-weary performance to his cv, and none the worse for it; ving rhames also proved himself as an up-and-coming actor; tim roth and amanda plummer were cool and hysterical in equal measures; harvey keitel stole the show as clear-up man; quentin tarantino put in a twitchy cameo appearance which wasn't as nearly as bad as everybody said; eric stoltz was memorable as a stoned drug addict...the list is endless, really. there are other names i miss out in the interests of space. while tarantino's rapid-fire dialogue is as sharp as ever (his decision to have the hit men talk about normal, everyday things like quarter pounders and big macs instead of ""gangster stuff"" was very clever), it is the succession of odd images which really stay in the mind, such as travolta accidentally blowing apart someone's head; willis and rhames fighting, escaping into a spare-part shop and getting attacked; thurman's adrenaline injection and the hysteria surrounding it; and finally roth and plummer getting the tables turned on them. all of these moments help to make pulp fiction an endearing slice of cinema, which i'm sure will be remembered as a minor classic in years to come.";18 October 2016;9;['strange', 'many', 'modern', 'adult', 'good', 'full', 'real', 'cold', 'afraid', 'long', 'talky', 'particular', 'actual', 'subsequent', 'memorable', 'final', 'excellent', 'black', 'timed', 'good', 'unexpected', 'harrowing', 'catchy', 'ensemble', 'liven', 'unheard', 'weary', 'bad', 'up', 'cool', 'hysterical', 'equal', 'clear', 'twitchy', 'bad', 'memorable', 'stoned', 'endless', 'other', 'rapid', 'sharp', 'normal', 'everyday', 'big', 'clever', 'odd', 'such', 'spare', 'adrenaline', 'endearing', 'sure', 'minor'];0.0439189189189189
3;SnoopyStyle;ringo (tim roth) and yolanda (amanda plummer) robs a diner. vincent vega (john travolta) and jules winnfield (samuel l. jackson) are thugs working for marsellus wallace (ving rhames). they pick up a mysterious briefcase but an incident requires cleaner the wolf (harvey keitel). marsellus is paying butch coolidge (bruce willis) to throw a boxing match. vincent is told to entertain the bosses' woman mia (uma thurman). this is quentin tarantino's big breakout. i saw this in the theater and probably even before 'reservoir dogs'. i definitely saw 'true romance' before this but i had no clue who to praise for the dialog in that movie until i put two and two together. this is a cinematic explosion. many tried to copy his style but none exceeded him. it is super cool. it's got the time jumble that adds so much fascination to the movie. again many films try to copy it but few succeeds like this. it has to be one of the iconic movies of the 90s.;18 December 2015;10;['mysterious', 'clean', 'big', 'reservoir', 'true', 'cinematic', 'many', 'cool', 'jumble', 'much', 'many', 'few', 'iconic'];0.2366666666666667
4;Hitchcoc;"it took fifteen years and a subscription to netflix to finally get around to seeing this film. it was well worth the wait. if all one were to see is the byplay between samuel l. jackson and john travolta, it would be worth the price of admission. but this is only part of the incredible effect this film has. i don't even like gore in movies; i avoid it. but tarentino weaves a culture of violence where there is actual humanity. we care about these bad guys. there is scene after scene of people being pushed to the limit. the very idea that the boxer, played by bruce willis, would risk everything to retrieve a watch that has been transported on two occasions, shove up someone's ass, is amazing. and very, very funny. i can't begin to list all the wonderful scenes. the opening dialogue is incredible as trovolta and jackson are on their way to do a hit. they have virtually no respect for human life, yet they, themselves, are very human. the date scene with uma thurman with the adrenaline shot. the crazy's in the pawn shop. and, the effort to clean up the car after blowing away a kid in the back seat, the issue being that a guys wife would come home and be very unhappy to find a dead body and a blood filled car in the garage. it sounds horrible and makes me sound sick. i found fargo to be a hilarious film as well. is there something wrong with me?";7 December 2009;10;['worth', 'worth', 'incredible', 'tarentino', 'actual', 'bad', 'very', 'amazing', 'funny', 'wonderful', 'incredible', 'human', 'human', 'back', 'unhappy', 'dead', 'horrible', 'sick', 'hilarious', 'wrong'];0.0675396825396825
5;Horst_In_Translation;"""pulp fiction"" is an american film from 1994, so this one has its 25th anniversary this year and the director here is of course mr. quentin tarantino, who made this film around the age of 30 and it was his 3rd filmmaking effort already, although most people have not really heard of his first work and only know reservoir dogs from his very early years. anyway, this one here is the one that not only brought him a palme d'or, but also introoduced him to and kept him at the oscars for years, no decades to come. until this day, in fact. so lets take a look at what is most memorable about pulp fiction. i think last night was maybe the third time i watched this movie and the first time at a theater. it's a really long film at over 2.5 hours, but it does feel shorter for sure and that is almost a given as this film is still in the imdb top10 hightest-rated movies, currently at #8, but it was even top5 a few years ago i think. anyway, by now it's been rated by 1.7 million voters. enough said about the movie's popularity. so many have seen it. as for the film's success with awards bodies, i already mentioned something, but it also needs to be said that tarantino won a screenplay oscar, golden globe and bafta for his writing and that is of course a huge trifecta achievement and he was really young back then, so truly nice that he certainly delivered in the decades afterwards. i cannot really think of one filmmaker these days around the age of 30 with such a bold unique approach to filmmaking. you can really see in almost every scene how big of a film nerd tarantino is. and his cast here profited a lot from that too. travolta got an oscar nomination. he deserved it. uma thurman did too and i am not so sure about her. love her in kill bill and recent films where she is a scene stealer with very little screen time when working with lars von trier, but i don't know if her performance here is really good enough for a nomination, even if i am quite fond of her in general. and then there is samuel l. jackson of course. everybody who knows him (only) as nick fury needs to see his works with tarantino. he is so good in here, such a memorable character, easily the best from the film. and he worked a lot with q afterwards too. his turn in the foxx/dicaprio/waltz western is also magnificent. but back to this one here: i would say basically the first scene when he and travolta enter the apartment is when the film is at its best. judging from this one only, i would have given 4 stars out of 5 and said it is one of my favorite films of the year, but sadly it does not stay that great when we have the butch scenes (even if also for willis, it is a contender for career-best) and also the long sequence with travolta and thurman and also the final scene at the restaurant again with slj. now i would like to speak about a few very specific scenes and moments and, in general, inclusions that stayed in my mind here. first of all, the restaurant with all these waiters in costume was amazing. i totally wanna go there. did not even recognize buscemi as buddy holly, even if i knew he worked with q in reservoir dogs. another great actor. same for harvey keitel, even if he is not one of my favorites like buscemi. still mr. wolf is such an icon. when slj's character hears marsellus is sending the wolf, it is so hilarious. we know immediately that dude is a respectable fella who knows exactly what he is doing. i'd be happy to have mr. wolf bark orders at me and he also would have deserved his own film. i think he had a little cameo in another tarantino work. this character has aged really well, just like the film as a whole. then the food: the kahuna burger even makes me as a vegetarian immediately wanna take a bite. and that milkshake at the restaurant! totally worth it. kinda hilarious by today's standards how five bucks is a lot of money for a milkshake back then. but boy is it worth it. even vincent agrees. speaking of vincent, there is a lot i can say about him. not just his funny posture at the wallace residence that has been used for many memes, but also for example how keeping stuff secret when everybody goes their own way is something that occurs twice after somewhat memorable events during which characters are in life-threatening situations. you will know what i mean when you see the scenes. but an act of courage and integrity by one character (even if it is indirectly also about saving one's own life in both scenarios) saves the other person too. as for tarantino: he once again also acts in here just like he did in some of his movies, also the much later one with waltz, slj and leo i mentioned earlier. there his inclusion is probably even more fun than here. but i still loved how he makes fun of himself directing in this one we got here during the water splashing scene near the end when he is basically directing keitel in-character. hilarious moment. coincidence is also a big factor in this film we have here. what if... can be asked on so many occasions. what if the girl (the stunning maria de medeiros) had not forgotten the ring? vega would not have been killed and actually this really put major emphasis on slj's character's decision. had he not retired, could he have been there too, killed butch and saved vega? what if vega had not left the gun in the room? what if butch had never run into marsellus when driving back to his girl. what if all these bullets had not missed the two during the apartment? what if vega had not accidentally killed the boy in the car. no tarantino and keitel in this film then. and they would not have ended at the restaurant where in the end the circle really closes and even if i do prefer chronological films most of the time, there is no denying the lack of chronology here works very well. for example we see vega knowing he is going to die later on. charming moment also between willis and travolta when they meet for the first time. okay, now one aspect and recurring joke i want to talk a bit about too.: vincent vega's toilet breaks. every time he takes a bathroom break, catastrophe ensues outside really. be it mia oding, the guys at the restaurant launching their robbery or butch entering the apartment making toast for himself. or indirectly also the guy at the apartment who storms outside. okay this is not vega taking a toilet break, but still the bathroom is really an aspect there too. this really shows you the bizarre humor tarantino includes in his movies all the time. kinda symbolic how toilets are significant here. and vega apparently also does not have the best bladder or bowel movement with hof often he goes. he even asks for a toilet break at his dealer's apartment after they reached an agreement. hilarious stuff. there are many other scenes about which you will laugh. like for example when we see marsellus with heavy injuries from the accident ""walk"" towards butch in order to kill him and he walks like a zombie basically firing left and right. or the toast moment i just mentioned giving us a parallel on what/who is finished that very moment. or also the anecdote told by walken's character about the gold watch. i mean it is meaningful, even historically meaningful in a sense, but at the same time it is also a reference on a guy hiding a watch for years in his butthole. it's kinda gross humor, but never childish fart humor or something like that. there is so much creativity and even intellect to it that it is a really great achievement and i am happy tarantino received all this awards recognition for his work here. by the way, it is also a rare occurence that he is not the only one credited with the script. finally, still one minor scene that stayed in the head for me, namely how they say when they enter the apartment (where a familiar face from ncis is in btw.) they should have brought bigger guns because there are many thugs inside (also referenced later when there was one more than they expected, so q even delivered in terms of mathematics) and with how vega actually brought a big gun for one enemy (i.e. for a big gun) to butch's apartment, but it wasn't enough, so taking care of your gun and situation is eventually more important than what kind of firearm(s) you bring. and the (non-chronological) ending scene is also memorable not just again for jackson (even if i prefer him laying actual gun vengeance on people), but also because it is pretty much the only scene and sequence in which nobody is injured and people leave the restaurant all safe and sound, despite all the potential violence that could have happened in this scene, which also shows again that slj's character has sort of found his path to god. and there is no bloodshed. this would be all for my review then. i am a bit sad the film did not stay as strong as it started, but it is still a big fun ride and i recommend checking it out to everybody, even if it is not one of my favorites from tarantino. slj's portrayal alone makes it worth watching i think and if you are one of the 3 or 4 on this planet who haven't seen it yet, then totally go for it or i will lay my vengeance upon you! thumbs up.";3 December 2019;6;['american', 'most', 'first', 'reservoir', 'early', 'memorable', 'last', 'third', 'first', 'long', 'short', 'sure', 'few', 'many',

""pump fiction"" saved the career of john travolta that was in the ostracism and put on the spot quentin tarantino after the cult ""reservoir dogs"". the complex screenplay with four entwined story has shown to the world the brilliance of quentin tarantino. my vote is ten. title (brazil): ""pulp fiction tempo de violencia"" (""pulp fiction: time of violence"")";20 April 2014;10;['powerful', 'scared', 'fifth', 'golden', 'many', 'sadistic', 'favorite', 'last', 'good', 'weak', 'forr', 'good', 'reservoir', 'complex'];0.2583333333333333

9;gavin6942;"quentin tarantino presents his masterpiece: interwoven tales of a washed-up boxer, some bodyguards to powerful crime kingpin, and others who cross their path on this fateful day. featuring an all-star cast: john travolta in his best role (relaunching his dead career), sam jackson in his defining role (still trying to outdo himself fourteen years later), christopher walken, uma thurman, bruce willis, ving rhames, steve buscemi, tim roth and more.

(sadly, i don't think he ever recovered after he became famous. subsequent films -- ""jackie brown"", ""kill bill"" and ""death proof"" -- all have a certain charm to them, but are not close to being on the level of ""dogs"" or ""pulp"".) although i've seen this movie, or at least bits of it, a dozen times, i think the most recent may be the most interesting. i watched it with a young woman who saw bruce willis and asked who he was. i said, ""bruce willis."" she asked who that was. i listed a few of his bigger films (""die hard"", ""armageddon"", etc.) but she said she had not seen them. how a woman in her 20s does not know bruce willis or any of his movies is beyond me, but it got me wondering: would ""pulp fiction"" be a different film if i didn't recognize the majority of the actors? walken, for example, appeals to me because he's walken. would his monologue be as good if delivered by someone else or by walken when i didn't know him by name? curious thought. if you haven't seen ""pulp fiction"", see it. tarantino is a better writer than a director, but this film offers probably his best directing to date and some superb writing. he is very dialogue-intensive, which i think alienates some viewers (particularly in ""death proof""), but give him a fair shake. this film defined the 1990s and continues to be influential in film today. pay attention and you'll be sure to see why.";18 June 2008;9;['powerful', 'fateful', 'good', 'dead', 'defining', 'more', 'many', 'tarantino', 'idiosyncratic', 'many', 'bad', 'reservoir', 'close', 'famous', 'subsequent', 'certain', 'close', 'least', 'recent', 'interesting', 'young', 'few', 'big', 'different', 'walken', 'walken', 'good', 'walken', 'curious', 'tarantino', 'well', 'good', 'intensive', 'fair', 'influential', 'sure'];0.2233766233766234
10;jboothmillard;"i think the title of the film relates to foreign new wave film, and magazines, well the film starts with the definitions. anyway, this is a brilliant crime drama from oscar winning writer (along with roger avary) and oscar, bafta and golden globe nominated director quentin tarantino. the story begins with what will be a continuing scene towards the end where pumpkin (tim roth) and honey bunny (amanda plummer) plan the robbery of the cafeteria they are in. after the opening credits, with the song ""jungle boogie"" we see hit men vincent vega (oscar, bafta and golden globe nominated john travolta) and jules winnfield (bafta winning, and oscar and golden globe nominated samuel l. jackson) on their way to see one of their boss's associate's to retrieve the stolen valuable briefcase (we never see what it is, but from the reflecting colour it looks like gold), asking questions about their boss, marsellus wallace (ving rhames), and after jules popular bible passage recitation killing two of the double-crossers. it then skips to butch coolidge (bruce willis) who is paid to throw a boxing match, and vincent comes in, leading to another story. vincent is taking marcellus's wife mia (oscar, bafta and golden globe nominated uma thurman) for the evening, in which they win a dance contest, she snorts what she thought was cocaine, but it was heroin, and she is revived with adrenalin at the house of drug dealer lance (eric stoltz). it then flashes back to (what would be the opening of the film) young butch receiving his father's watch from capt. koons (christopher walken) who tells him they both shoved it up their arses to keep it safe. then it forwards to butch's fight, and he did not throw it, and he escapes the city, there is a moment where butch has to go back to his house when his girlfriend fabienne (maria de medeiros) forgot his watch, and he kills vincent who was waiting for him. driving back though, he also encounters marcellus himself, but before they can kill each other, they are kidnapped and tied up by two homosexuals, one is zed (the mask's peter greene). butch manages to escape and save marcellus from continued torture and male rape, and this is when their dept is settled, as long as butch leaves town for good. the final flashback goes back to just after jules has killed lance, and another guy from the cupboard comes out shooting, but no bullets hit. after killing him, and taking marvin (phil lamarr) with them, they have another problem where vincent accidentally shoots their hostage. to help clear up the mess they go to the house of jimmie dimmick (tarantino) and call for help from the guy who can ""solve problems"", winston 'the wolf' wolfe (harvey keitel). they manage to clear up the mess, and have to wear new, dorky clothes, and going to a cafeteria everything seems fine, till pumpkin and honeybunny start the robbery (that you saw at the beginning), and eventually after a long chat and guns pointing jules and vincent stop them, before leaving, and that is the end. phew! i would have explained it all in the chronological order, but that would be complicated for those who don't know it. also starring rosanna arquette as jody and steve buscemi as buddy holly. tarantino's direction and script, where characters seem normal, e.g. talking about popular culture (like burgers) is brilliant, all actors are perfectly cast, and it is just an unmissable mainstream film. the memorable quotes, besides jules's bible recitation, ""bring out the gimp"" and ""they call it a ""royale with cheese"".""

11;Tweekums;"this film from quentin tarantino tells the intertwining stories of a couple of gangsters, their boss's wife, mia, and a boxer who is meant to throw a fight. there is little in the way of plot; we just observe their lives for a few days. the two gangsters are vincent vega and jules winnfield and they work for marsellus wallace; early on vincent and jules discuss an incident where marsellus threw another man out of a fourth floor window for allegedly giving his wife a foot massage something that makes vincent nervous as marsellus has asked him to take mia out for the night while he is out of town. the evening goes well until they get back to mia's house and she overdoses on vincent's heroin while he is in the bathroom. the second story follows butch the boxer who rather than throwing a fight for marsellus beats his opponent to death. he knows he has to get out of town but first he must return home to retrieve his watch that has been in the family for generation. this puts him in a dangerous place when he bumps into marsellus. finally we see events that took place earlier after vincent accidentally shoots somebody in a car and he and jules have to get some help from 'the wolf'. as i said earlier this isn't about plot; that isn't to say nothing happens though quite the opposite. there is a decent amount of action; some of it sudden and shocking as well as great characters. it is these characters that the film is really about. the cast does a fine job; most notably john travolta and samuel l. jackson who are on top form as vincent and jules; uma thurman is also impressive as mia wallace as is ving rhames as her husband. bruce willis does a fine job as butch and harvey keitel puts in a memorable performance as 'the wolf'. the non-linear way the story is told isn't confusing; i rather liked how the opening and ending scenes were concerned with the same event and chronologically took place in the middle of the story. quentin tarantino's dialogue is realistic but cool; i liked how the characters talked about mundane things; it made them feel far more real than if they had only talked about things relevant to the plot as characters in most films do. overall i'd definitely recommend this film; it is gripping, full of great characters and dialogue and contains many unforgettable scenes it does however contain material that will offend many people; most notably a lot of swearing and liberal use of 'the n-word' as well as some shocking moments.";16 August 2016;9;['little', 'few', 'vincent', 'winnfield', 'marsellus', 'fourth', 'vincent', 'nervous', 'second', 'dangerous', 'decent', 'shocking', 'great', 'fine', 'top', 'impressive', 'fine', 'memorable', 'non', 'linear', 'confusing', 'same', 'realistic', 'cool', 'mundane', 'real', 'relevant', 'most', 'full', 'great', 'many', 'unforgettable', 'many', 'liberal', 'shocking'];0.1889423076923077
12;ccthemovieman-1;from what i gather, and my own reaction, people either love this movie or hate it. strangely, i have been on both sides of the fence with this film. i never look at it in the same light, for some reason. at first i hated it and on a second chance, really liked it. then the same two things happened on the third and fourth viewings until i finally stopped. this is an extremely profane film laced with a lot of dark humor. i have a machine that can filter out much of the profanity and i often appreciate dark humor, but blowing a guy's brains out in the back seat of a car is funny? what am i missing? two things i will say: the film doesn't lose me despite being two-and-a-half hours. there are no boring lulls and the dialog is fascinating in parts, mainly between john travolta and samuel l. jackson. their discussions are unique, to say the least, and one certainly remembers uma thurman's role and travolta slamming a syringe into her chest. with 240 f-words and the lord's name in vain 28 times, i miss a lot of sentences with the filter. it's still an interesting film.....in a perverse way. the other thing: yes, there is some dark comedy in here but overall this should not be labeled a comedy, or god help us all.;23 March 2006;6;['own', 'same', 'second', 'same', 'third', 'fourth', 'profane', 'dark', 'much', 'dark', 'back', 'funny', 'boring', 'fascinating', 'unique', 'least', 'vain', 'interesting', 'perverse', 'other', 'dark'];0.0323529411764705

15;BandSAboutMovies;"there are movies and then there are forces of pop culture nature. pulp fiction is just such a film. while so much before influenced it, nothing after would ever be the same. in its wake, so many films tried to xerox its non-linear narrative, ultraviolence and wildly veering plot points. pretty much not a single one of them is halfway decent by comparison. tarantino took some scenes that roger avery intended for true romance and decided that none of the film would appear in true order. for many, it was the first film they had ever watched that had monologues and conversations that were at the same time about everything and nothing all at once. while tristar pictures turned down the film, it became the first movie that miramax would fully finance. why would tristar not want to make this film, particularly after tarantino had become so big after reservoir dogs? roger avary said that the studio had issues with nearly every part of the movie, as they basically said, ""this is the worst thing ever written. it makes no sense. someone's dead and then they're alive. it's too long, violent and unfilmable."" i wonder how the person that said that felt after pulp fiction was voted as the winner of the palme d'or at the 1994 cannes film festival and was nominated for seven oscars. obviously, this film was also a commercial success, remaking the career of john travolta and causing people to take notice of the acting skills of uma thurman and samuel jackson. there's a moment in this film that determines whether or not you like and understand tarantino. before they enter jack rabbit slim's, mia wallace (thurman) asks if vincent vega (travolta) is square and she illustrates that point with her fingers. suddenly, the movie becomes animated and dashed lines illustrate her point and realism fades away. in this small moment, you either think that this is the dumbest thing you've ever seen, totally pretentious or completely and utterly awesome. i fall into the latter category and began cheering the moment it happened on screen. pulp fiction begins with a diner being held up by ringo (tim roth, who was in tarantino's reservoir dogs) and yolanda (amanda plummer, so i married an axe murderer) before we move into jules winnfield (jackson) and vega (travolta, in a role originally intended for michael madsen, who had played the other vega brother, mr. blonde, in reservoir dogs) taking a briefcase back for their boss marcellus wallace (ving rhames, con air), after a long discussion of what mcdonald's calls their food in europe. what's in that briefcase? all that we learn is that the lock for it is 666, but it's a macguffin - a term invented by english screenwriter angus macphail and popularized by alfred hitchcock. the case was originally going to have diamonds in it, but that's kind of boring. instead, it opens to have a strange glow. tarantino has been very coy about what it really is, even doing an interview with his friend robert rodriguez where they cut out the real answer before his fellow grindhouse director says that the knowledge of what is really in the case radically changed how he saw the film. there are plenty of theories of what's really in that case. if we extrapolate that tarantino was influenced by kiss me deadly, then it's a nuclear device. it's been compared to the trunk in repo man. and an internet rumor began that it's really marcellus wallace's soul as evidenced by the band-aid on the back of his neck which is supposedly where the egyptians believed the soul resided. the two bring the briefcase to their boss, marsellus, but first, he bribes butch coolidge (bruce willis) to do the job in his next match. then, the boss goes out of town but asks vega to show his wife a nice time. how nice of a time? after all, he threw a man out a window just for giving her a foot massage. about feet - this is the movie where tarantino reveals his foot fetish. i'm not being rude or sly; it's 100% obvious upon watching the film. before the date, vega buys heroin from lance (eric stoltz), who is out of balloons, so he puts it in a baggie. this will be important after the date of dinner and dancing at the aforementioned 1950's pop culture diner jack rabbit slim's. their dance scene here - taken almost move from move from fellini's 8 1/2 scene where barbara steele dances with mario pisu - is more than just a simple physical scene. for a moment in time, it freezes reality and makes us think back to why we love travolta the actor and not just vincent the character that he is portraying. when we see him, we don't just see every role that he has ever played. we are fixated on the role that we first fell in love with, tony manero from saturday night fever, bringing back fond thoughts of what it was like when to see the actor on the dance floor. vega is obviously enamored of mia and feels that things could feel the same with her, so he plans on simply leaving. however, she snorts the heroin - thinking it's coke - and nearly dies. it takes a needle of adrenaline right to her heart to fix things, as much as they can be fixed. while all this is going on, butch wins the fight and kills his opponent. as he escapes in a taxi, its driver (pittsburgh native angela jones, who graduated from the same college that i did, point park, and would go on to play the same character in the film curdled, as well as date slash) asks him what it's like to kill a man. butch has told his girlfriend fabienne (maria de medeiros, who was anais nin in henry and june) to get everything ready to run away, but she forgot his gold watch, which we learn his father smuggled in a very uncomfortable place, along with captain koons (christopher walken), who tells him the story of the watch in a flashback. butch must go back home, where he encounters vega reading modesty blaise on the toilet. one barrage of bullets later and he's on the run, but when marcellus wallace crosses his path, he decides to hit him with his car. both injured, marcellus begins shooting at butch, who runs into a pawnshop. maynard (duane whitaker, one of the racist cops in tales from the hood), the owner, ends up taking both by gunpoint and ties them up in a room where his partner zed (peter greene, who was in the mask) takes marcellus from behind while the gimp (stephen hibbert, who was married to julia sweeney at the time, who also shows up briefly as the daughter of monster joe; joe was going to be played by dick miller, but that scene was cut) watches over butch. butch overpowers the man in the bondage suit and decided to go back and save his enemy, using a sword to kill maynard while marcellus grabs a shotgun and shoots zed, wounding him just enough so that he can call some of his worst men to get revenge. they agree that butch can leave, but can never come back to los angeles. he grabs zed's bike, gets his girl - who really has caused so much of this mess because she acts like a child - and gets out of town. why does butch save the man who made his life hell? because in tarantino's mashup universe, protagonists live in the symbolic universe of the japanese samurai, where honor is more important than anything. leaving marcellus to have his manhood further destroyed and then killed isn't the death that a warrior deserves. it's no accident that of the weapons offered, which also include a hammer, a chainsaw and a bat, he takes the sword. back in time, as they get the briefcase, jules and vincent surviving an attack at brett's apartment when a man somehow misses them every single time. they argue over whether this was a miracle or not, which leads to vincent accidentally shooting marvin (phil lamarr, the voice of green lantern john stewart on the justice league cartoons). they decide to visit jules' friend jimmie (tarantino), who is stressed about his wife coming home from work. that means that the cleaner, winston wolfe (harvey keitel), must come and do his work by disposing of the evidence. that issue dealt with, the dup come back to the diner at the beginning of the film. jules decides that he's going to retire and walk the earth like kane from kung fu, which vincent finds ridiculous. as he goes to the bathroom, the couple we met earlier start to rob the place. vincent returns and this leads to a mexican standoff, but jules successfully uses his newfound love of peace to diffuse the situation and everyone leaves alive. the bible passage that jules quotes isn't exactly from the good book. it's more paraphrased and also harkens back to the lessons that sonny chiba would deliver before vanquishing evil in his films. pulp fiction got its start as a trilogy that would be written by avery and tarantino, but would also have a third director. it was inspired by mario bava's black sabbath, which is another portmanteau film. tarantino's original story, black mask, ended up becoming reservoir dogs. avery's story pandemonium reigns is the gold watch story within this film. there's no score to the film, but instead a pastiche of near underground american music. there's a ton of surf rock in this film, as tarantino felt that it sounded like the themes of italian spaghetti westerns. this is also the beginning of the incredibly self-referential universe of tarantino films. vincent vega and mr. blonde being brothers, red apple cigarettes and big kahuna burgers show up in many of his films and mia wallace's tv pilot fox force five is either a tease for kill bill or places that film as a fictionalized part of an overall narrative. for kids that grew up reading comic books or loving when tv shows crossed over, this would become an entirely new obsession. throw in the fact that this movie references every movie that came before it and you get the reason why we're devoting an entire week to these films. pulp fiction is 25 years old this year. it doesn't feel that way. it achieves that rarest of movie dreams - utter timelessness.";22 July 2019;10;['pop', 'same', 'many', 'non', 'linear', 'single', 'decent', 'true', 'true', 'many', 'first', 'same', 'tristar', 'first', 'big', 'bad', 'dead', 'alive', 'long', 'violent', 'unfilmable', 'commercial', 'tarantino', 'square', 'small', 'dumb', 'pretentious', 'awesome', 'latter', 'reservoir', 'other', 'reservoir', 'marcellus', 'long', 'english', 'alfred', 'boring', 'strange', 'tarantino', 'coy', 'real', 'fellow', 'deadly', 'nuclear', 'marcellus', 'next', 'nice', 'nice', 'tarantino', 'rude', 'obvious', 'important', 'aforementioned', 'more', 'simple', 'physical', 'tony', 'fond', 'enamored', 'same', 'same', 'same', 'ready', 'uncomfortable', 'modesty', 'marcellus', 'racist', 'bad', 'much', 'symbolic', 'japanese', 'important', 'single', 'green', 'clean', 'ridiculous', 'vincent', 'mexican', 'newfound', 'alive', 'bible', 'good', 'sonny', 'tarantino', 'third', 'black', 'original', 'black', 'reservoir', 'near', 'underground', 'american', 'tarantino', 'italian', 'referential', 'tarantino', 'red', 'big', 'many', 'overall', 'comic', 'new', 'entire', 'old', 'rare', 'utter'];0.0400718494468494

18;hitchcockthelegend;"it kind of feels redundant trying to write a review for pulp fiction as it approaches its 20th birthday. as a film it needs no introduction, it won the palme d'or at cannes, won a bafta and academy award for best original screenplay (tarantino), and garnered a whole host of other awards and nominations. box office beef was meaty and its reputation even now shows no sign of waning (it currently sits at number 4 on the imdb top 100 list), it is by definition one cool mofo of a movie, a picture loved by a cross section of demographics. but why? pulp fiction oozes humour, romance, violence and stylish flourishes. it remains compulsive viewing throughout; even as it threatens to get submerged in its own complex structure. film lover tarantino takes a number of low life and unfortunate characters from los angeles, mainlines then with movie cliches, and then amazingly breathes new life into them. it knowingly winks at b movies from the past yet always remains fresh on its own terms. i myself having just revisited the film after a 5 year gap can attest to just how well it holds up, laughing at the dialogue, perched on the edge of the seat as violence starts to rumble, and yes, singing along with that most catchy of soundtracks. yet for all its flashiness and hipster chattering, there's one thing that often gets overlooked when talk of pulp fiction's greatness arises. that of a basic human urge to survive or find salvation, tarantino's main characters may be bottom feeders or scummy operatives of the underworld, but there's love and needing beating slowly in its dark heart before the drugs and violence take a hold. neat trick that from tarantino, brilliant in fact. 10/10";13 February 2012;10;['redundant', 'good', 'original', 'tarantino', 'whole', 'other', 'cool', 'stylish', 'compulsive', 'own', 'complex', 'low', 'unfortunate', 'new', 'fresh', 'own', 'most', 'basic', 'human', 'main', 'bottom', 'scummy', 'dark', 'neat', 'tarantino', 'brilliant'];0.2026515151515151

20;Doylenf;"pulp fiction is the sort of tale right up quentin tarantino's dark alley of a fictional mind. all of his criminals speak the profanity-laced dialog with such effortless ease that it seems perfectly natural after the first five minutes to hear the ""f"" word and the ""n"" word spoken with regularity by a very competent cast of actors. there is no such thing as political correctness in his vocabulary, so it's an audacious piece of work. tarantino weaves the tales of several characters, not all of whom are related, until eventually the tales do dovetail together to make a common pattern out of the jumbled narrative. it's all done in brisk, good story-telling style to keep the viewer interested throughout the two-and-a-half hour running time. the dark humor is present in almost every situation you can think of involving murder and mayhem and somewhere, in all the bible readings that samuel l. jackson quotes, there's a message about redemption that seems to be the raison d'etre for the final scene in the diner. uma thurman has delicious fun with the role of a gangster's moll who sniffs a little too much white powder in the ladies room while on a date with john travolta. the two of them get a chance to demonstrate their prowess with romantic comedy in this wonderful sequence where they go to a '50s-theme restaurant with an art deco ambiance and some '50 icons like marilyn monroe, ed sullivan and mamie van doren doing their stuff while platters are served. they also indulge in a twist dance contest which, naturally, they win. it's the lightest moment in a film with plenty of dark twists and unpredictable shoot-outs that are a blend of violent gore and gales of laughter. harvey keitel has a fine time with the role of a ""cleaner-upper"" who gives instructions on how to wipe the blood off messy crime scenes. bruce willis is excellent as a boxer who fails to lose the match and has to go on the lam to escape the wrath of a crime boss. his brutal treatment at the hands of a sadistic hardware store owner and his sick pals is one of the most lurid episodes of the many layered story. they don't call this ""pulp fiction"" for nothing!! despite the disturbing scenes of violence, it manages to be a highly entertaining mix of crime and comedy that keeps rolling along toward a satisfying ending in the diner where the first scene involving tim roth and amanda plummer took place. summing up: more likely to have broadest appeal for young male viewers who like their crime stories raw, real and unpredictable. original, inventive and understandably awarded a great many honors when released.";15 September 2007;7;['dark', 'fictional', 'such', 'natural', 'first', 'competent', 'such', 'political', 'audacious', 'tarantino', 'several', 'common', 'jumbled', 'brisk', 'good', 'interested', 'dark', 'present', 'bible', 'final', 'delicious', 'little', 'much', 'white', 'romantic', 'wonderful', 'twist', 'light', 'dark', 'unpredictable', 'violent', 'fine', 'clean', 'upper', 'messy', 'excellent', 'brutal', 'sadistic', 'sick', 'lurid', 'many', 'layered', 'disturbing', 'entertaining', 'first', 'likely', 'broad', 'young', 'male', 'raw', 'real', 'unpredictable', 'original', 'inventive', 'great', 'many'];0.1088135938135938
21;LeonLouisRicci;influential and inventive this was so fresh and new in style that it caught viewers and critics off guard and aghast and they hardly knew what to say. that never could be said about the maverick writer/director quentin tarantino. his films, to this day, are driven by words. his dialog flows fluently and without restraint dominating scenes creating sometimes unbearable suspense that usually leads to violent eruptions of varying degree. this, his second feature, is not without moments of self-indulgence that threaten to bore or at the very least are unnecessary. the wordsmith sometimes is guilty of just a bit too much ego. here there are scenes that are clunky, embarrassing, and absolutely could be excised without loss. the bedroom scene with bruce willis and friend comes to mind. the final third of the bondage/rape scene just talks way too long. the watch as heirloom scene with the young butch is clunky. the director's cameo as jimmy is quite bad and reeks of overwriting (gourmet coffee), and bad acting. maybe a few others. but these are minor extensions of good scenes that are to be critical, bloated. but that hardly keeps this from being an exercise in style and a completely new wave of making movies. it is sharp and serpentine, colorful and cool. there is a youthful, playful energy that was lacking at the time in filmmaking that was forever stimulated and forced on to a new path of artistic angst. for that this will be remembered as not just a fad, but put a new face on film that is needed now and then to shake things up.;6 July 2013;9;['influential', 'inventive', 'fresh', 'new', 'aghast', 'unbearable', 'violent', 'second', 'least', 'unnecessary', 'guilty', 'much', 'clunky', 'embarrassing', 'final', 'young', 'clunky', 'bad', 'bad', 'few', 'minor', 'good', 'critical', 'bloated', 'new', 'sharp', 'serpentine', 'colorful', 'cool', 'youthful', 'playful', 'new', 'artistic', 'new'];-0.0418484848484848

23;zardoz-13;"writer and director quentin tarantino's ""pulp fiction"" qualified as a revelation when it came out in 1994, and time has not diminished the impact of this landmark film. this crime melodrama about a pair of philosophical hit men, a treacherous boxer, a cocaine-snorting drug dealer's wife, and a cleaner shifts back and forth between tragic drama and helium comedy with irony galore. if tarantino had not made any other movie, he would still have been assured a niche in cinematic history with ""pulp fiction."" he juggles four complicated plot lines about an eccentric gallery of characters who are all low-lives in one way of another living on the fringe of society, whether they be murderers, thieves, narcotics dealers, sexual perverts, or small-time, pistol-wielding crooks. ""pulp fiction"" defies chronological time because tarantino stages everything out of order. this fractured form of storytelling might alienate those spectators accustomed to chronological order. not one minute of this marathon two hour and forty-five minute audacity is dull. ultimately, tarantino and co-scenarist roger avary received the oscar for best original screenplay, while the academy of motion picture arts and sciences nominated tarantino for best director, the film itself for best picture, john travolta for best actor, sally menke for best editing, and samuel l. jackson and uma thurman respectively for best supporting male and female roles. over ten years later ""pulp fiction"" is still outstanding, largely because it is such a timeless tale of amoral mayhem. tarantino's quotable dialogue, his articulate underworld thugs, and his archly sardonic take on life retains its vivacity. inspite of the scrambled up stories, tarantino plots everything very carefully, foreshadowing situations and predicaments, with characters facing the consequences of their actions. tarantino inspired a generation of movie makers, but none of them have come close to eclipsing his masterpiece. ""pulp fiction"" opens in a restaurant with ringo/pumpkin (tim roth of ""reservoir dogs"") discussing the various problems involved in the art of robbery with his girlfriend yolanda/honey bunny (amanda plummer of ""the prophecy"")and their impulsive decision to rob the restaurant. colorful credits follow and tarantino introduces us to jules (samuel l. jackson of ""shaft"") and vincent (john travolta of ""saturday night fever"") as vincent talks about the difference between what hamburgers are called in amsterdam. a quarter-pounder is called a royale with cheese and most food is referred to using the metric system. they arrive at an apartment where they are supposed to pick up an attache case from four twentysomething guys as a part of a deal that went south. jules questions brett (frank whaley of ""the doors"") about the guy's questionable business practices with jules' boss marsellus wallace. all the dumbfounded brett can utter after he witnesses jules shoot one of his friends on a sofa in cold blood is the word ""what?"" jules warns him not to say ""what"" again. nevertheless, brett says ""what"" five times and jules puts a bullet in his shoulder. vincent and jules retrieve the mysterious suitcase, but not before another guy bursts from the bathroom with a ""cannon"" like revolver and fires indiscriminately at them. the guy misses each time and jules and vincent blow him away and leave with the case and another bystander, marvin (phil lamarr of ""old dogs"") after they kill brett.";21 May 2010;10;['qualified', 'philosophical', 'treacherous', 'clean', 'tragic', 'other', 'cinematic', 'eccentric', 'low', 'sexual', 'small', 'chronological', 'tarantino', 'fractured', 'chronological', 'dull', 'tarantino', 'co', 'scenarist', 'good', 'original', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'male', 'female', 'outstanding', 'timeless', 'amoral', 'quotable', 'articulate', 'sardonic', 'tarantino', 'reservoir', 'various', 'impulsive', 'colorful', 'tarantino', 'most', 'metric', 'questionable', 'cold', 'mysterious', 'old'];0.1491379310344827

28;TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews;"this is probably the hardest movie for me to rate and review; how do you review a film where about half of it is great, and the rest(which pretty much means the other half) is awful? i decided to rate it a 5, since that seems to be the sensible thing to do in this situation. like a few others have said, tarantino's style is hip and makes you, the audience, feel hip. the dialog, the editing, the violence... the problem is, it's empty. the dialog is entirely superficial, which is ok if there's not too much of it or what there is there to be superficial. but here it carries half of the scenes. the dialog scenes(as pretty much everything else in the film) is very dull, visually. the camera doesn't move and rarely changes angle, and it's something that'll make you fall asleep, if the pointless, shallow dialogs don't do so first. the editing is daft as well. the violence is so over the top that you almost have to be mentally disturbed not to be affected(read: repulsed) by it... is that why it's there? does tarantino want to gross out his audience? is that what it's about? the length and pace is horrible. i don't believe i've ever managed to sit through the entire thing attentively. the problem is not the length itself as much as what appears to be tarantino yelling at his audience ""you want to see my movie? well, you better prepare to sit there for what feels like 10 hours straight!"" just to ensure that there are no misunderstandings; that was a metaphor. tarantino doesn't *actually* yell at the audience. it just feels like it. the whole film feels like it's trying to get somewhere, to say something, but then the film is over, and it forgot to tell us what it was. the film is anticlimactic throughout(quite an achievement... usually only the end of a film is anticlimactic), and when it's done, you'll be saying to yourself ""that's it? what the heck was all that hype about?"" the truth is, in my opinion, a small group of tarantino fans got together, and started 'converting' anyone they could find to love the film, and suddenly, this had taken over the general opinion on the film. everybody thinks it's great, but no one can really explain why. i have yet to meet someone who've explained why tarantino's films supposedly are great. now don't get me wrong; i don't have anything against the guy. i like several of his films; jackie brown, from dusk 'till dawn and kill bill 1&2. the problem here is that the film lacks any real substance. none of the characters are likable, not even slightly. they are killers, drug-dealers, psychos and morons. the film has the typical non-linear time-line which tarantino utilizes in virtually all of his films. however, here it seems redundant, like it was just tagged on for no actual reason. both volumes of kill bill were great because of good use of this; pulp fiction is not, because of the use of aforementioned effect is seemingly pointless here. the actors all play exactly the same type of character that they always play, with one or two possible exceptions. samuel jackson plays the 'violent, loud-mouthed individual with an unusual belief or philosophy' what do you know, that came right off his trademark section of his biography on this very site. john travolta is the usual cool guy. ving rhames is the typical tough black guy, same as always. do i need to go on? if you've read everything up to this point, you might think i hate this movie... i don't. i just dislike half of it. and that's just the thing... i can't entirely hate this. the scenes with travolta and jackson are pretty good, a few of the lines in the film are quotable, and most of the characters are well-cast. there you have it; half bad, half good. better than reservoir dogs, but not as good as jackie brown and not even in the same league as the two kill bill films. i recommend this only to tarantino junkies. everyone should stay away, unless they are crazy about one or more actors in the film. if you do see it, only see it once and try to pay attention(even though it's really hard). 5/10";13 November 2004;5;['hard', 'great', 'other', 'awful', 'sensible', 'few', 'empty', 'superficial', 'ok', 'much', 'superficial', 'dull', 'asleep', 'pointless', 'shallow', 'horrible', 'entire', 'tarantino', 'straight', 'whole', 'anticlimactic', 'anticlimactic', 'small', 'tarantino', 'general', 'great', 'great', 'wrong', 'several', 'real', 'likable', 'typical', 'non', 'linear', 'redundant', 'actual', 'great', 'good', 'aforementioned', 'pointless', 'same', 'possible', 'violent', 'loud', 'mouthed', 'unusual', 'very', 'usual', 'cool', 'typical', 'tough', 'black', 'same', 'good', 'few', 'quotable', 'most', 'bad', 'good', 'well', 'reservoir', 'good', 'same', 'tarantino', 'crazy', 'more', 'hard'];0.0190555555555555

35;mm-39;this director peaked when he made this film, i do not think he will ever be able to out do pulp fiction. this films timing, cast, and story mixed perfectly, like a good meal. it is a combination of talent and luck to make a film like this. the timing is incredible, for it was released in the mid 90's during the hight of political correctness. harrison ford could not pick up a gun in the movie clear and present danger. swearing, any bad stereo types of characters was tabu. the film industry was getting very boring, and this shocker came out. i was surprise there was no protests over this film. the swearing, racial slears, violence, drug use, and rape pushed this film to new lows. this film is well made not from cheap shock value. the shock value is a by-product of the sleazy characters. it is the scripts characters and the story make this film mind blowing, and fresh. the acting is incredibly strong, no one could a ford this cast now, because all the actors where either up and coming or over the hill during this film, and luckly instead of watching a actor get paid 20 million and the film suffers, we see a very strong cast. the 4 stories all melt into one, and the films message is about choices in life, along with a anti violent message. unlike many movies of that time it does not preach this message, which insults the viewer, but brilliantly makes a subtle message.;19 February 2001;9;['able', 'good', 'incredible', 'mid', 'political', 'clear', 'present', 'bad', 'boring', 'racial', 'new', 'cheap', 'sleazy', 'fresh', 'strong', 'strong', 'anti', 'violent', 'many', 'subtle'];0.0923351158645276

37;SimonJack;"the modern-day movie public seems entranced with the in-your-face barbaric and crude film style of quentin tarantino. the writer-producer-actor definitely has talent, and an imagination. but films such as this that have long-running dialogs - some sensible but mostly far-fetched, need to have a solid plot to be interesting. the plot of ""pulp fiction"" is very weak - almost pointless. and when the long stretches of cinematic street philosophy are punctuated with brutal scenes of blood and guts, i don't find much of anything entertaining. i enjoy great mysteries, including some of the better film noir. but for the gore and guts movies to be good and have appeal, they must at least have an interesting plot and very good screenplay. ""reservoir dogs"" was such a tarantino movie. but this plot has scenarios that bounce around in a weak screenplay. while there's a thin thread that connects some parts, others don't mesh. so, it comes across as a few short stories put together, some of which have the same characters. an example of this is when christopher walken's captain koons tells a tall story to a young boy named butch coolidge. two scenarios or so later, butch is a full-grown boxer played by bruce willis. other scenarios happen out of order, or in reverse order. this seems to be a style with tarantino, and one that some movie critics and buffs think is a great talent. i think it's a technique meant to grab an audience where the writer can't figure out a way to do it with a straight story chronologically. this sort of sets on end the long-standing teaching and methods of storytelling, writing, and playwrighting. and, there are a number of people who still prefer the chronological order of stories. we don't mind the use of flashbacks which are clearly identified as such. but wide changes in time or order, back and forth, from one scenario to another is confusing and says the author couldn't come up with the right ending. so, he or she used some weird techniques to make an ending superfluous. and, some of these films really don't have endings. this film could have started or ended just about anyplace within the screenplay. tarantino or the director just needed to shuffle the pages. it ruins what might be a good story for me. as for the acting in this film - what's so outstanding about characters spewing vulgarities back and forth, or screaming and intimidating people with foul threats in running expletives? seems we all have a tantrum streak within us. ""pulp fiction"" isn't an enjoyable or entertaining film. it is a look at the underworld of drugs, thugs, blood and guts. the only thing i can see that might attract such near adulation for this film is the huge and diverse cast. but i'll take any number of other types of films that can entertain with solid plots, screenplays with civility, and great acting.";14 September 2019;2;['modern', 'barbaric', 'crude', 'such', 'sensible', 'fetched', 'solid', 'interesting', 'weak', 'pointless', 'long', 'cinematic', 'brutal', 'much', 'entertaining', 'great', 'well', 'good', 'least', 'interesting', 'good', 'reservoir', 'tarantino', 'weak', 'thin', 'few', 'short', 'same', 'tall', 'young', 'other', 'reverse', 'tarantino', 'great', 'straight', 'chronological', 'such', 'wide', 'right', 'weird', 'superfluous', 'tarantino', 'good', 'outstanding', 'foul', 'enjoyable', 'entertaining', 'only', 'such', 'huge', 'diverse', 'other', 'solid', 'great'];0.1077678571428571
38;christopher-underwood;i was prompted to watch this again after seeing the director's latest, once upon a time ... in hollywood. clearly this earlier film was more innovative and likely more influential than the later film will prove to be. i find once upon a time a more enjoyable watch but the significance and importance of this is undeniable. twenty-five years on and the groundbreaking affect it has had on hollywood makes it easy to forget just how revolutionary this street talking, time lapsing, audacious film was. everyone is great, even tim roth and jackson, keitel, willis, travolta and thurman all excel. all the scenes, effectively split and mixed are good and the diner bookends a genius idea. there is more humour (just) and more cute dialogue than in the latest film but for me this is, inevitably, a slightly less mature work with the fantastic editing covering the odd rough spot.;21 August 2019;9;['late', 'early', 'innovative', 'influential', 'later', 'enjoyable', 'undeniable', 'easy', 'revolutionary', 'audacious', 'great', 'mixed', 'good', 'din', 'more', 'cute', 'late', 'mature', 'fantastic', 'odd', 'rough'];0.2291666666666666
39;Mr-Fusion;"i can absolutely understand why pulp fiction has achieved the lofty cultural status it has. even if you don't like some of the subject matter or tarantino's seedy underworld, this is an exceedingly well-written movie; very violent and occasionally hilarious. the situations are absurd and there's great dark humor that arises because of this. and qt knows how to go from ridiculous to tense and unsettling at the drop of a hat. it's unbelievable how much enjoyment can be had from two people talking, and the movie is driven by these very conversations. and this is one bulletproof cast, right down to its bit parts. even the violence is so over-the- top and in such bizarre situations that you can't help but laugh at how nonsensical it all is. this movie has grade-a dialogue (it's quotable beyond measure), the jumbled narrative works extremely well for the movie's unexpectedly connected stories, and it went a long way in defining the '90s (it certainly redefined dick dale's misirlou). not a bad movie, either. 8/10";2 October 2014;8;['lofty', 'cultural', 'subject', 'seedy', 'violent', 'hilarious', 'absurd', 'great', 'dark', 'ridiculous', 'tense', 'unsettling', 'unbelievable', 'much', 'very', 'such', 'bizarre', 'nonsensical', 'quotable', 'jumbled', 'long', 'bad'];-0.1322222222222222
40;StevePulaski;"quentin tarantino's pulp fiction is a work of postmodern art. it's unlike any film i've seen before, and because of that, i commend it for not searching for a blueprint or a formula to tell its story. tarantino tells the story from pure originality, and like many of his future films, pulp fiction is told with a non-linear narrative making it hard to explain the plot. it's better to just introduce the characters and go from there. the story is about very different people whose lives intertwine with one another over the course of a few days. the characters first introduced are pumpkin (roth) and ""honey bunny"" (plummer) who are talking in a dinner with plans to conduct a heist. we then cut to two detectives named vincent vega (travolta) and jules winnfield (jackson) who are trying to retrieve a briefcase they can bring to their boss marsellus wallace (rhames). wallace has his own chapter in the film as well. him and prizefighter butch coolidge (willis) strike a deal where butch accepts a large amount of money to throw an upcoming fight. while wallace is tied up in this deal, vega goes over to meet and take to dinner the lovely mrs. mia wallace (thurman). a series of events happen, causing dismay among vega which lead to some very well-written and well-acted sequences. being that the film is conducted in a very nontraditional style, pulp fiction is a task to follow sometimes. my advice; watch it and just go along with it. if you feel inclined to look up how it played out on the internet go ahead, or if you want to give it a rewatch that is fine too. viewing multiple clips for a second time, i think i finally understand it more, but a lot of questions you'll still be asking after repeated viewings. one of the most famous questions is ""what's in the briefcase?"" that is recovered by vega and winnfield in the early scenes of the film. i'm sure when writing the film tarantino himself didn't know what he wanted to put in the briefcase. i'm also sure he didn't think it would blow up into such a debacle on the message boards and through word of mouth. what truly makes pulp fiction worthwhile is the genius dialog. tarantino cranks out the best script possible combined with enough wit and violence to please the most demanding and picky action-film fan. one moment the two are discussing why a quarter pounder with cheese from mcdonalds is called a ""royale with cheese"" in france. next, they are threatening violence if a victim asks the question ""what?"" again. why do i not condone constant swearing and gratuitous violence in other films, but for some reason award a perfect score to a film that is made up of it? because pulp fiction shows how it should be done. it depicts realistic situations, handled intelligently and with wit and soul. it doesn't utilize them for the purpose of being monotonous or dreary, but to advance an already crafty storyline. the character are under such stress it only makes sense that they are constantly shouting four letter words. is it necessary? not really. but pulp fiction isn't just about swearing. it proves that true cinema still exists and that even a story that appears choppy and inconsistent on paper can still produce one of the best films of the decade. starring: john travolta, samuel l. jackson, uma thurman, harvey keitel, tim roth, amanda plummer, maria de medeiros, ving rhames, eric stoltz, rosanna arquette, christopher walken, bruce willis, and quentin tarantino. directed by: quentin tarantino.";24 November 2011;10;['postmodern', 'tarantino', 'pure', 'many', 'future', 'non', 'linear', 'hard', 'well', 'different', 'few', 'pumpkin', 'own', 'large', 'upcoming', 'lovely', 'nontraditional', 'inclined', 'fine', 'multiple', 'second', 'famous', 'winnfield', 'early', 'sure', 'sure', 'worthwhile', 'tarantino', 'good', 'possible', 'enough', 'demanding', 'picky', 'constant', 'gratuitous', 'other', 'perfect', 'realistic', 'monotonous', 'dreary', 'crafty', 'such', 'necessary', 'true', 'choppy', 'inconsistent', 'good'];0.211136712749616

43;MovieAddict2016;"quentin tarantino's ""pulp fiction"" is the quintessential example of great movie making, assorted using various constructive techniques that elevate the film to the highest possible level, stretching the boundaries and pushing upwards. like all great directors, q.t. lets the film and its subsidiaries stand on their own. a lesser director might employ cheap gimmicks and plot devices to move the story onwards at a brisk pace, but ""pulp fiction"" is a dark action, comedy, and/or drama that clocks in at two hours and thirty-four minutes. and not a single minute is wasted on material we think could have been shortened or cut. it's one of those rare motion pictures that leaves you wanting more, which only welcomes another immediate viewing to let everything sink in a second, third, or even fourth time. a lesser director than tarantino might also force his characters into saying things they would not normally say, or into actions they would not normally act out in real life. instead, tarantino does something brilliant and seldom executed: he actually lets his characters evolve on-screen, and actually engage in every day conversations. most critics interpret this as quentin stopping to insert unnecessary (albeit entertaining) dialogue segments. they're wrong. the dialogue is strong, but it's there for a purpose. the difference is that dialogue in a movie such as ""the presidio"" isn't real at all. the characters enter, move the plot forwards through speaking or acting, then proceed to repeat this in following instances, as if they're following the back of a mouth wash bottle (""rinse, spit, repeat""). quentin does something else, by eavesdropping on his characters when their dialogue does mean something. no doubt jules and vincent have much to say about many things, but most of the time it is not relevant to the story. one must keep in mind that we actually hear little about jules and vincent, and even less talk between them. but when we do hear these things, it's strikingly true and purposeful. and this is what so many people miss when viewing ""pulp fiction"" -- the witty dialogue has become universally regarded as the strongest ever written, and while that may very well be correct, the idea that it is pointless is absurd. quentin is subtle in the way he introduces his speeches; when jules (samuel l. jackson) and vincent (john travolta) spend some two or three minutes discussing how the french translate the term ""quarter pounder with cheese"" due to the metric system, it is amazingly deliberate: quentin later uses this same reference for jules before he and vincent assassinate a group of young crooks who have stolen a briefcase from marsellus wallace (ving rhames), one of the town's major kingpins. there are essentially three stories in ""pulp fiction,"" intertwined between one another. it opens with honey bunny (amanda plummer) and her boyfriend (tim roth) hatching a plan to rob a restaurant. by their reasoning, no one ever bothers with restaurants, just banks, so why not take advantage of them ""with their pants down""? the stick-up proceeds, which is when the famous titles roar forward and we find ourselves following jules and vincent, who work for marsellus, who has paid championship boxer butch (bruce willis) to fall in his upcoming match. but butch has a better plan: bet loads of money on himself, beat the other guy to a bloody pulp, and run away with his money. he almost gets away with it when he accidentally crosses paths with marsellus once more, resulting in a rape scene to rival that in ""deliverance."" back to the dialogue. it is the driving force of the film, complementing the plot and allowing its characters to grow on us in ways we never imagined they would. it's the way in which the dialogue is deliberated that varies from most other examples of deliberation. for example, is it coincidence that we just so happen to overhear jules and vincent discussing the big mac and quarter pounder with cheese? no. but our instincts tell us that it seems very real, as if tarantino went around filming real people, then edited together scenes where the dialogue could bear some sort of importance to the plot. there are different levels of dialogue -- plot-driven, and realistic -- but all dialogue is in service of its plot, just as all of what we say to our friends or family has a deeper meaning and will no doubt relate to the matter at hand. all dialogue relates to a larger scheme, and so does the dialogue in ""pulp fiction."" it's just more casual and subtle than most movies. it's not pointless, but it's not deliberate, which is a fine line to try and balance on. quentin does so successfully, crossing the finish line with enthusiasm, which is no doubt part of what elevates ""pulp fiction"" above so many other motion pictures of its genre. 5/5.";3 April 2004;8;['quintessential', 'great', 'various', 'constructive', 'high', 'possible', 'great', 'own', 'less', 'cheap', 'brisk', 'dark', 'single', 'rare', 'more', 'immediate', 'second', 'third', 'fourth', 'less', 'tarantino', 'real', 'brilliant', 'most', 'unnecessary', 'entertaining', 'wrong', 'strong', 'such', 'real', 'much', 'many', 'most', 'relevant', 'little', 'less', 'true', 'purposeful', 'many', 'witty', 'strong', 'correct', 'pointless', 'absurd', 'subtle', 'french', 'metric', 'deliberate', 'same', 'young', 'marsellus', 'major', 'famous', 'upcoming', 'well', 'bet', 'other', 'bloody', 'most', 'other', 'big', 'real', 'real', 'different', 'realistic', 'deep', 'large', 'casual', 'subtle', 'most', 'pointless', 'deliberate', 'fine', 'doubt', 'many', 'other'];0.1247534013605442

45;Red-Barracuda;"it almost goes without saying that pulp fiction was one of the most influential and iconic films of the 90's. in all honesty it probably was the very top film in this regard. i can still remember seeing it for the first time and being amazed. i had loved quentin tarantino's earlier reservoir dogs but thought he had upped the ante even higher with this movie. seeing it again recently i have to say it remains an incredibly well made and entertaining bit of cinema. and even though i have enjoyed all of tarantino's films since, there is no doubt in my mind that his three 90's crime films tower above all of his post millennium filmography. in those ones he seemed to integrate his obsession with pop cultural references into strong stories, as opposed to nowadays where his movie references have become so blatant and full on that they have become an actual handicap of sorts. pulp fiction is the movie where he best showcases his style in a movie that is consistently brilliant from start to finish. it's essentially three stories entwined. all on the face of it standard crime cinema tales where something goes wrong but tarantino focuses on unusual details that make them completely original. the chief aspect that differentiates them from others is his brilliant dialogue that is never afraid to go on non-plot related diversions in ways that utterly humanises the thuggish bad guys that populate his film. the script is full of pop cultural references, inventive profanity, witticisms and even many moments of wisdom. tarantino's primary gift, and the one he will be remembered for, is his gift for dialogue. you get the impression that actors are instructed to deliver their lines word-for-word; this isn't a film that feels improvised in any way. on some very odd occasions this can result in some lines feeling a little forced but the pay-off is massive, as the script is quite simply genius in many ways. this great writing has created some excellent iconic characters. it doesn't do any harm either that the acting is top level throughout. well, with the exception of tarantino's cameo that is he's pretty terrible and should really never act. but otherwise its quality all the way with standout turns from samuel l. jackson, john travolta, bruce willis, harvey keitel, christopher walken and uma thurman. jackson probably steals the show with the character jules but travolta is very impressive and convincing as vincent vega you really believe he is a pretty nasty bit of work under the charm. thurman and willis play typical film-noir characters, namely the femme fatale and the boxer who throws the fight both are excellent. while keitel and walken have cameo roles, with the former as the very memorable mr wolf, while the latter is in an extremely funny role as an ex-soldier who wore a watch up his butt. so what's it all about? well the title says it all really because this is an unashamed bit of pulp fiction but a wonderfully original presentation of it. its influence is other movies such as italian poliziotteschi and american film noir, with a huge post-modernist make-over. films specifically referenced include the italian connection (a black and white gangster hit men are sent to sort a situation out) and kiss me deadly (a plot revolves around a suitcase that when opened has a mysterious glow). it is essentially a crime-comedy, with a real focus on humour. this means that some of the strong violence is played simultaneously realistically but also for comic effect. while the staggered time-line is constructed for maximum impact. it is, for example, a pretty rare thing for a film to kill off a character (vincent) and then go back in time a little to watch his exploits in another escapade. we know he is doomed but can't help but completely forget this fact. it's one of many reasons that this film stands out. one of the very best of the 90's and tarantino's masterpiece.";1 February 2014;10;['influential', 'iconic', 'top', 'first', 'amazed', 'early', 'reservoir', 'high', 'made', 'entertaining', 'post', 'pop', 'cultural', 'strong', 'blatant', 'full', 'actual', 'good', 'brilliant', 'standard', 'wrong', 'tarantino', 'unusual', 'original', 'chief', 'brilliant', 'afraid', 'non', 'plot', 'thuggish', 'bad', 'full', 'pop', 'cultural', 'inventive', 'many', 'primary', 'odd', 'little', 'massive', 'many', 'great', 'excellent', 'iconic', 'top', 'terrible', 'impressive', 'convincing', 'nasty', 'typical', 'femme', 'excellent', 'walken', 'former', 'memorable', 'latter', 'funny', 'unashamed', 'original', 'other', 'such', 'italian', 'huge', 'post', 'modernist', 'italian', 'black', 'white', 'deadly', 'mysterious', 'real', 'strong', 'comic', 'maximum', 'rare', 'little', 'many', 'good'];0.1990395480225988

47;Pjtaylor-96-138044;pulp fiction is often hailed as one of the best movies ever to be made. it's constantly praised for it's masterful script, and in my opinion deserves to be so. but the film often feels as though it isn't actually about anything. some scenes feature dialogue that appears entirely random and never comes back into play. indeed, i sometimes wonder if tarantino just wrote about whatever he wanted to. despite all this, however, the movie is cohesive and surprisingly gripping. on top of that it's decidedly realistic: while the characters go through strange things and they aren't exactly your average joes (afterall, two of them are assassins and another is a boxer on the run from a mob boss), the situations and reactions could happen in the real world. once you accept that vincent is an assassin for the mob, it's very plausible that he'd talk about foreign mcdonald's with his partner, shoot up some dudes and then have to save his boss' wife from a heroin overdose. so while the conversations may seem unrelated to anything, they actually cement each character in the world that tarantino has created and help them feel real. the acting is also great across the board. my favourite has to be samuel l jackson as jules. the guy knows how to embody the character that tarantino envisioned, but simultaneously makes every line of scripted dialogue feel like ad-lib. jules acts and sounds like a real person, in what is a perfect blend of script and actor. the other actors do a great job too, even if they only appear for one scene. christopher walken played it serious in a scene where the dialogue took a turn for the silly (discussing hiding a watch up his ass). i also loved harvey kietel as mr.wolf, the man who fixes things. his scene was one of the highlights of the movie, and it was largely due to his expert delivery. overall, pulp fiction is a movie driven by its witty and unique script. you may struggle to find a message hidden within it, but i believe that there is one there (jules' monologue at the end presents the fact that he has made a clear moral choice of not to kill, and butch shows heroism when given the chance to simply escape.) in the end, though, it's not about that. it's simply about enjoying the gripping characters and crazy events that tarantino has dreamt up. 8/10;18 September 2014;8;['good', 'masterful', 'random', 'cohesive', 'realistic', 'strange', 'average', 'real', 'plausible', 'foreign', 'unrelated', 'real', 'great', 'samuel', 'real', 'perfect', 'other', 'great', 'serious', 'silly', 'due', 'witty', 'unique', 'clear', 'moral', 'crazy'];0.1941666666666666

50;ElMaruecan82;"writing is an instinct quentin certainly possesses, and with ""pulp fiction"", his second film, he made a sensational break-through entrance in the great directors' joint. his influence on movies in the late 90's and early 00's is indisputable and even after 16 years, the freshness and originality of ""pulp fiction"" never ceases to strike. the film is thrilling, entertaining and darkly amusing from the beginning to the ending. indeed, ""pulp fiction"" is just one of these films where things reach such a level of whatever makes movies worth being admired; on the top of that : writing. this is what makes ""pulp fiction"" rhymes with perfection and what most defines the tarantinesque style. chapter 1. the cannolis of the nineties. writing is the special ingredient. when characters talk in a tarantino film, the subtlety is that it makes you think it has nothing to do with the plot, that it's totally irrelevant, when in fact it is totally irrelevant and random yet it serves the plot. one golden rule in screen writing is that what you put must be related to the story : tarantino throws away this rule and still respects it. the discussion about the little differences and how they call hamburgers is mentioned again when jules asks brett about it and till now, vega's ""royale with cheese"" still resonates as the canolli's quote of the 90's. the foot massage discussion finds another relevancy as it helps to characterize marcellus's sensitivity and electrify the whole interaction between jules and mia. the gold watch story, makes butch' burst of anger totally understandable when fabienne admits she forgot it. there were 1000 ways to make us learn about the gold watch story, tarantino takes a legendary actor telling us with such conviction we don't know if we're supposed to laugh or take it seriously. deeper than that, notice how the divine intervention that saves jules and vincent's asses, inspired different reactions and the one who decides not to retire will ultimately be killed. god seems to play with fate like tarantino with plot devices. notice how jules' decision will save ringo and pumpkin and lead to an ezekiel's bloodless recitation. and of course, the reappearance of the two robbers at the end of the film is another tribute to quentin's creative trademark: non-linear narrative structure. sure quentin didn't invent that, but he transcended it, making it an element of entertainment and total unpredictability. we'll go back to unpredictability later. chapter 2. from ""misirlou"" to ""surf rider"" music is one of the key qualities of quentin tarantino films. it's like a second casting, quentin casts his music like he does for his female characters. what would have been this film without the dazzling ""misirlou"" start, without ""girl, you'll be a woman"", and the iconic ""you never can tell"" featuring one of the weirdest but most memorable and reenacted cinematic dance sequences. quentin doesn't embarrass himself by choosing a composer or a grandiloquent score, no, he drains his inspiration from pop culture, from existing songs that would have probably sunk into oblivion if there weren't touched by tarantino's selective instinct. the music is like a second language in his film, and it sure mixes perfectly well, with the dialogs. whenever i hear the shrill voice of honey bunny shouting "" last one of ya"" i immediately imagine ""misirlou"" starting, like the emblematic hymn of the 90's. but music ain't the only one element ejecting the movie from the land of normality chapter 3. perfection : from head to foot. tarantino is the goddamn casting fairy of them actors no seriously, he has like a magic power, who else could have made travolta resuscitating after his ""look who's talking"" career? who else could have made samuel l. jackson look so bad-ass with this ridiculous wig? who else could have convinced ving rhames to re-enacts ned beatty's deliverance? oh, i should get to the point, who else can make so close to perfection female castings, covering all tastes of women we can imagine : from the hypnotic uma thurman, to the hysterical yolanda, to the punky pierced jody, from the sweet and tender fabienne to the sensuous lips of esmarelda villalobos, they're all defining a specific feminine charm. and thanks, mr. tarantino to make us finally assume out little fetishism chapter 4. black humor and white towels unpredictability relies on what i would call the little differences that makes ""pulp fiction"" a classic film. it has this thing in common with other masterpieces like ""the godfather"" or ""citizen kane"", where every single scene is a classic, from a to zed. the meaning of the title, the robbery preceding the opening credits, the mysterious glowing stuff inside the briefcase, the foot massage discussion, the square visual effect, the dance contest, mia's feet walking on the floor, the adrenaline shot, the coolidge vs. hoover fight, esmarelda's feet stepping on the accelerator, fabienne's oral wish, fabienne's f sweet accent, vincent's death, marcellus crossing the road with his box of donuts, zed and maynard, the gimp, marcellus's medieval speech, zed's demise, marvin now that was unpredictable, who could see that coming? should we laugh? yes, 'cause it's funny as hell. it was an accident, as if it was supposed to be an excuse. the whole movie and what follows is the ultimate proof that this film is a masterpiece of comedy; the whole ""bonnie"" situation creates so many gags, including the memorable appearance of winston wolf. this part sacred ""pulp fiction"" as a great film; and the last minutes made it a classic. end of story. when jules and vincent leave the restaurant, with the ""surf rider"" song starting, you know your eyes have been watching something new and fresh, something that will change the face of movies for a bunch of years to come. just for ""pulp fiction"", quentin tarantino deserves to be admitted in the directors writers' hall of fame.";7 February 2011;10;['second', 'sensational', 'great', 'late', 'early', 'indisputable', 'entertaining', 'amusing', 'worth', 'most', 'special', 'tarantino', 'irrelevant', 'irrelevant', 'random', 'golden', 'tarantino', 'little', 'whole', 'understandable', 'legendary', 'such', 'deep', 'divine', 'different', 'tarantino', 'bloodless', 'creative', 'non', 'linear', 'sure', 'total', 'key', 'tarantino', 'second', 'female', 'misirlou', 'iconic', 'weird', 'memorable', 'reenacted', 'cinematic', 'selective', 'second', 'shrill', 'last', 'emblematic', 'only', 'tarantino', 'goddamn', 'magic', 'bad', 'ridiculous', 'close', 'female', 'hypnotic', 'hysterical', 'punky', 'pierced', 'sweet', 'sensuous', 'specific', 'feminine', 'little', 'black', 'white', 'little', 'classic', 'common', 'other', 'single', 'mysterious', 'square', 'visual', 'hoover', 'oral', 'sweet', 'medieval', 'unpredictable', 'funny', 'whole', 'ultimate', 'whole', 'many', 'memorable', 'sacred', 'great', 'last', 'new', 'fresh', 'tarantino'];0.0851756966991341

54;bowmanblue;it may sound odd finally getting round to 'reviewing' 1994's 'pulp fiction' as there's really little that can be added to everything that's been said about it over the years. yes, it's a true masterpiece which has - and will always, i would imagine - stand the test of time. but is it for everyone? it's quentin tarantino's second film as writer/director and, even with all the greats he's turned out since, most people will say that it's probably his best (and i'd agree). however, if there's actually someone out there who hasn't seen it and doesn't even know anything about it, how would you describe its story? i guess you could call it a 'gangster' film with various stories which span different characters which are skillfully (if loosely!) woven together. it's also filmed out of 'chronological' order, meaning that a character may die halfway through, only to return later on in the film simply because the end of the film is technically set before the mid-way point. confused? stick with it. it's worth it. if you check out the main poster associated with 'pulp fiction' you'll see the - now iconic - image of uma thurman's character to sell it. even though she is indeed a 'central' character to the plot, you'll notice a whole load of famous names in the small print, including john travolta, bruce willis and - of course - samuel l jackson (in what was totally his 'breakout' role). this is definitely an 'ensemble' cast and, due to the multiple story threads, not all these names will be on screen for as long as you might like them to be. however, that doesn't mean that anyone turns in a bad performance. 'pulp fiction' has made it's mark on not only the box office and takings, but also on popular culture. it's either quoted or lampooned to this day and most people will 'get' any references made to everything from the numerous quotable lines to the crazy outlandish settings the characters find themselves in. due to the extreme circumstances involving very 'adult' themes, this film is not for children. and it's all the better for it. this is because it will - hopefully - limit those who just don't 'get' it. for all its greatness, it's not an easy watch. you can't just have it on in the background while you idly check your instagram account on your phone. you really need to invest your time into your viewing to get the most out of it. because of that it's not for idle viewers. it's made to be watched properly (and then debated afterwards, no doubt - people still wonder what was in the briefcase to this day!). if you're not a fan of violence, bad language, drug-usage or films that play with the element of storytelling in order to mix things up a little, then you may find much of 'pulp fiction' a little hard to watch. however, even if you're not sure about it, i would advise at least giving it a go, simply because it one of those rare films where audiences and critics actually agreed that it was a 'true' masterpiece. plus, as i've eluded to, samuel l jackson's performance is worth a viewing on its own, let alone with all the other amazing performances as well. they don't make them like this any more. even tarantino has never - quite - managed to recapture what he managed here.;20 August 2019;10;['odd', 'little', 'true', 'second', 'most', 'good', 'various', 'different', 'chronological', 'mid', 'confused', 'worth', 'main', 'iconic', 'central', 'whole', 'famous', 'small', 'breakout', 'multiple', 'bad', 'popular', 'most', 'numerous', 'quotable', 'crazy', 'outlandish', 'extreme', 'well', 'easy', 'most', 'idle', 'bad', 'little', 'much', 'little', 'hard', 'sure', 'least', 'rare', 'true', 'worth', 'own', 'alone', 'other', 'amazing'];0.0943376068376068

58;CuriosityKilledShawn;now that it's almost 23 years later can we have a level-headed point of view on this movie? the hype machine in 1994 went into maximum overdrive with pulp fiction in a way that has rarely been repeated, even in a world over-saturated with easily accessible and multiple forms of media. for years people have regarded pulp fiction as if it is somehow far beyond any kind of criticism. it's time for scrutiny. as a 150-minute series of vignettes within vignettes it makes for good entertainment the first few viewings, but i've seen pulp fiction from beginning to end about 10 times now and i can honestly say i am done with it. the trashy nature of the stories and the wider world that the characters inhabit is a nice homage to the dime novels of the 1950s and other trash cinema of the era. and i mean trash. pulp fiction takes virtually no inspiration from anything with an ounce of class. don't be fooled by the all-star cast and the larger- than-life characters. for years people have been quoting the screenplay as if it were a breathtaking breakthrough in movie dialogue. it's not. if anything it is far too wordy. the editor should have been a little more liberal in cutting down the talking. there is an utterly pointless interaction between travolta, thurman, and buscemi about a $5 shake that seems to go on forever. it adds absolutely nothing to scene at all and i cringe whenever i hear it. i can't believe i am even wasting my time bringing it up in this review, but it's a good example of frequent nothingness that should have been excised. tarantino also seems to have an inability to reign in his actors here, leaving them to ham their way over the boundaries which gives many characters an unfocused, disconnected, and confusing riff. travolta in particular seems off and alienating. he was probably just happy to get work at the time but there's no reason for why the rest of the cast didn't question the overwritten material. it's also very dull to look at. jack rabbit slims appears to be the only set specifically designed for the movie, which is why there is a colorful vibrancy to this scene that is found nowhere else. almost every other shot takes place at street level in the most mundane parts of los angeles without any sense of location. the lazy panavision photography just plonks the camera down at standard angles and indulges in far too much steadicam for its own good, all while never giving us much in the way of geography. it's very frustrating. pulp fiction is competent with unique inspirations, but the movie has almost no original ideas and it has been massively over-regarded for far too long.;3 March 2017;6;['maximum', 'accessible', 'multiple', 'good', 'first', 'few', 'trashy', 'wide', 'nice', 'dime', 'other', 'breathtaking', 'wordy', 'little', 'liberal', 'pointless', 'good', 'frequent', 'many', 'unfocused', 'confusing', 'particular', 'happy', 'overwritten', 'dull', 'colorful', 'other', 'mundane', 'lazy', 'standard', 'much', 'own', 'much', 'frustrating', 'competent', 'unique', 'original', 'long'];0.1498611111111111

62;kevin_robbins;pulp fiction (1994) is a movie i recently rewatched on hbomax. the storyline follows a series of characters within the same circles whose worlds are about to collide. we follow two hitmen running errands for a gangster of sorts. that said gangster has a fix in with an aging boxer who has plans of his own. we also see a desperate couple looking for efficient ways to make money...like robbing restaurants. this movie is directed by quintin tarantino (django) and stars john travolta (grease), samuel l. jackson (do the right thing), uma thurman (kill bill), ving rhames (mission impossible), bruce willis (die hard) and tim roth (the hateful eight). the storyline for this picture is magnificent, intricate and well written in every way. the dialogue is so clever and witty. the acting is out of this world and every character is believable and mesmerizing. the cast truly couldn't have been better selected. the situations are so random and well portrayed. the cinematography, camera angles, colors and settings are all perfect. there's nothing i would change about this movie and would easily score this a 10/10 and call this an all time great american film.;15 July 2021;10;['same', 'about', 'own', 'desperate', 'efficient', 'right', 'impossible', 'hateful', 'magnificent', 'intricate', 'clever', 'witty', 'believable', 'mesmerizing', 'random', 'perfect', 'great', 'american'];0.2418367346938775

66;The-Sarkologist;i remember a number of years ago i was having a discussion with a friend from church about how pulp fiction is a story of a hitman who finds god. yeah, it is actually like that in part, but i do feel that there is more to this film than just jules having an epiphany and becoming a christian, though it is interesting to see the contrast between him and vincent, since there is an extended discussion between the events in brett's apartment and whether what happened was due to divine intervention, or just luck. i also remember the first time i saw this film - it was actually in the cinema when it had just hit the screens. i had seen the trailers and really wanted to see it, namely because of the trailer, and having just watched the trailer (though i suspect that it wasn't the original one that i saw on television all those years ago) i can sort of see why i was attracted to it. mind you, what surprised me that night at the cinema was firstly that it was packed, and secondly when we left there was a huge line outside that snaked out of the cinema. this really surprised me considering that i didn't expect this film to be in the league of films where screenings would be packed out on opening night. mind you, one thing that i have to say when i saw the film that first time was that i didn't get it. in fact, i get the feeling that most people who watched the film that night didn't get it either, and i suspect that was because of the comments that were coming from the people who were waiting to go and watch the film we, and the rest of the cinema, filed out. the thing is that pulp fiction is an experimental film, and it certainly follows on from reservoir dogs. it is a crime film dealing with criminals, but the discussions that the criminals have painted somewhat well rounded characters. in fact, it undermines the concept of the bad guy simply being one dimensional entities that simply exist for good guys to kill. actually, the thing about this film is there isn't actually a character that would be termed as being good, at least none of the major characters. each of them exists in the realm of the criminal underworld, yet many of them do things that are considered selfless. not all of them, since vincent acts from his own self interest, whereas butch, despite being hunted by marcellus, decides to head back and save him, though one could argue that he did this to extract a favour from marcellus, which he eventually does. one interesting thing is the use of restrooms in the film. whenever vincent goes into a restroom something bad happens, but that is not always the case. for instance, when marcellus' wife goes into the restroom, when she returns her food is on the table, and she makes the classic quote 'don't you love it when you come back from the restroom and your food is on the table'. this isn't the case with vincent, because when he comes back from a restroom, marcellus' wife is oding, the diner he is in is being held up, and of course, he gets shot as well. conversations are interesting as well, and tarrantino actually weaves this idea into the conversation between vincent and marcellus' wife. this is the idea that when two people are together they have to always be talking, as there seems to be this idea that silence is uncomfortable. she is actually rebelling against that but suggesting that silence doesn't need to be uncomfortable, and that we should actually get used to just sitting in silence and appreciating each other's company. of course, there is also the idea of the struggle between divine intervention and luck. jules recognises his life as being divine intervention, and upon reaching that realisation decides that he will change his life according to this. vincent, on the otherhand, rejects this, and as it turns out it is to his detriment. most of the bad things that happen to vincent, such as marcellus' wife, and of course his death, happens after that conversation. sure, there is the scene where he accidentally shoots the guy in the back of the car, but that goes to further demonstrate the differences between marcellus and jules - jules follows the wolf's instructions, while vincent complains, such as when he asks the wolf to say please. finally i should mention the minutiae, namely because tarrantino loves his minutiae. for instance, there is the coffee, where they have a discussion about the good coffee that jimmy purchases, which sets up the scene where the wolf makes a hand gesture to suggest that yes, the coffee is pretty good. there is also the bit at the beginning where pumpkin addresses the waitress as 'garcon' to which she replied 'garcon means boy'. however, it was the heroin scene that was pointed out to me, because when he purchases it, the dealer says that he doesn't have any balloons, so he will have to package it another way, which vincent agrees. now, apparently, one of the reasons marcellus' wife mistook it for cocaine is because heroin is packaged in balloons, and cocaine in bags, and because it was in a bag, she thought it was cocaine. mind you, there are numerous discussions about this on the internet, so i'll leave it there. anyway, this is a pretty awesome film, and ended up having a huge impact upon cinema since. it has also become a cult classic, and despite the fact that at first i didn't get it, and as such, didn't like it, over time i have really come to appreciate the artistry that this film represents.;25 October 2021;9;['more', 'interesting', 'extended', 'due', 'divine', 'first', 'original', 'huge', 'first', 'most', 'experimental', 'reservoir', 'rounded', 'bad', 'dimensional', 'good', 'good', 'least', 'major', 'criminal', 'many', 'selfless', 'vincent', 'own', 'interesting', 'bad', 'classic', 'din', 'interesting', 'uncomfortable', 'uncomfortable', 'other', 'divine', 'divine', 'most', 'bad', 'such', 'such', 'good', 'jimmy', 'good', 'numerous', 'awesome', 'huge', 'cult', 'such'];0.1721813725490196

69;slightlymad22;i just finished watching pulp fiction tarantino nails his screenplay again. this type of talent is not taught at a screenwriting class. you either have it or you do not. sadly too many people are making movies today, who do not have it, and there are too few talents like tarantino. too many movies these days just seem to say things to advance the plot. the dialogue here is genius, brilliantly funny (you laugh at the dialogue, even though he does not seem to be going for a laugh) and no two characters sound the same, everyone has their own way of talking. i'm appreciating the dialogue so much more watching them again. i think this was the first time i watched a movie that was so non linear. i think everything i had watched before this went from a to b with possibly a flashback explaining something. this changed everything!! after this we had great movies like the usual suspects and monento. but it is not just the structure to pulp fiction that makes it great, it does not put a foot wrong. whilst this movie revived john travolta's career, it's samuel l jackson who steals the show. every time i watch the movie i think he should have won the oscar. then i watch ed wood, and think martin landau deserved it. my opinion on this one, really comes down to which of the two movies i last watched. harvey kieren (in his second tarantino flick) is great as winston wolf (i really wish he did not parody this role in tv ads) tim roth (also in his second tarantino flick) and amanda plummer fun and i can not believe i never noticed it was steve buscemi (also in his second tarantino flick) as the waiter buddy holly at jack rabbit slim's. pulp fiction was a massive hit. it grossed $107 million (against an $8 million budget) at the domestic box office to end the year, as the 10th highest grossing movie of the year.;11 August 2019;9;['many', 'few', 'many', 'funny', 'same', 'own', 'first', 'non', 'great', 'usual', 'great', 'wrong', 'second', 'tarantino', 'great', 'second', 'tarantino', 'second', 'tarantino', 'massive', 'domestic', 'high'];0.2061111111111111

72;tomgillespie2002;"i remember that back in the mid-90's, when tarantino-mania was in full swing, the motor-mouthed former video store clerk-turned-auteur was always surrounded by controversy. his two movies, reservoir dogs (1992) and pulp fiction were portrayed as cruel, violent and sadistic by the media, while movie critics swooned over his pulpy, reference-heavy characters and innovative dialogue. over 20 years later, tarantino's films seem laughably mild compared to the casual ultra-violence of most 18-rated movies regularly released today. but while reservoir dogs can arguably be dismissed as a marvellously scripted and meticulously acted rip-off of city on fire (1987), pulp fiction seems as fresh as the day it was released. the black-suited duo of vincent vega (john travolta) and jules winfield (samuel l. jackson), and the misty-eyed gangster's moll mia wallace (uma thurman) have been reduced to movie icons, adorning the walls of students and making it easy to forget just how well written they are. tarantino is fascinated by the humdrum of these casual killers' lives, and their conversations about cheeseburgers, foot- massages and what constitutes a miracle sparkle with invention, intelligence and laugh-out-loud humour. it makes these cartoon characters, who seem they have been ripped straight from the pages of a book found in a dime-store book shop, seem real. even though they have just shot two unarmed men in cold blood, you would still want to buy them a cup of coffee and pick their brains. pulp fiction, as i'm sure you already know, tells three intertwining stories out of chronological order. after successfully obtaining a briefcase belonging to their boss, hit-man vincent vega is given the responsibility of looking after the big man's wife, mia, for the night. he takes her to a retro diner where they talk pop culture and dance to chuck berry, and the night's events then take an unexpected turn. travolta makes for an astonishingly sweet killer and heroin addict, and this story in particular sizzles with sexy dialogue and real chemistry between travolta and thurman. the now-infamous scene of an improvised adrenaline shock still has the power to make you wince, while remaining funny and utterly absurd all at the same time. the second story, 'the gold watch', focuses on ageing boxer butch (bruce willis), who after failing to follow thorough with his role in a thrown boxing match - organised by vincent's boss marcellus wallace (ving rhames) - flees to the safety of a hotel room and into the arms of his lover fabienne (maria de medeiros), who he intends on whisking overseas along with his wad of stolen loot. however, upon realising that fabienne has failed to pack the gold watch handed down to him through many generations and eventually by his father's friend captain koons (christopher walken), he must return home to reclaim it. the events that transpire are some of the most outlandish work tarantino has ever done, filled with gunfire, mutilation, rape, and a gimp. such relentless brutality may have been off-putting, but tarantino keeps you reassured that it's okay to laugh at what you're seeing, that it's only a movie. it's a textbook lesson in black comedy. the narrative then jumps back in time to vincent and jules in the aftermath of the hit seen at the start of the movie. after an extremely gory accident, they are forced off the road and seek the hospitality of jimmie (played by tarantino himself). they hire professional fixer winston wolf (harvey keitel), who races against the clock to clean up the mess before jimmie's wife arrives home from a night shift. the film climaxes at the diner shown in the opening scene, as vincent and jules's quiet breakfast is interrupted by a husband and wife stick- up team (tim roth and amanda plummer). the third segment is the funniest and features the most memorable dialogue, as winston tries to motivate an objectionable vincent (""pretty please, with a cherry on top, clean the f*****g car,""), and jules educates his new foe's following the life-altering miracle he believes he has just witnessed. featuring highly on practically every 'best of' list from 1994 to the present, pulp fiction needs no introduction and i doubt it ever will. though i have enjoyed all of tarantino's movies with the exception of 2007's tedious death proof (though it fares better when viewed in its grindhouse entirety), i don't rate him as a truly great film-maker, as i don't feel he has ever managed to shake his compulsion to homage. but pulp fiction is undoubtedly a masterpiece, like nothing else made before or since (though many attempts have been made in vain). a thrilling exercise in style and substance, beneficial to cinema as a whole and responsible for re- igniting a few careers on the way. i cannot see tarantino ever topping his achievements here, but then again his movies never fail to surprise me. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com";8 April 2015;10;['full', 'mouthed', 'former', 'reservoir', 'cruel', 'violent', 'sadistic', 'heavy', 'innovative', 'mild', 'casual', 'ultra', 'most', 'reservoir', 'fresh', 'suited', 'misty', 'eyed', 'easy', 'tarantino', 'casual', 'loud', 'real', 'unarmed', 'cold', 'sure', 'chronological', 'big', 'unexpected', 'sweet', 'particular', 'sexy', 'real', 'infamous', 'adrenaline', 'funny', 'absurd', 'same', 'second', 'marcellus', 'many', 'outlandish', 'such', 'relentless', 'tarantino', 'okay', 'black', 'gory', 'tarantino', 'professional', 'quiet', 'third', 'memorable', 'objectionable', 'top', 'new', 'good', 'present', 'tedious', 'great', 'many', 'beneficial', 'whole', 'responsible', 'few', 'tarantino'];0.0652832674571805
73;eddie_baggins;for a film that's not about much or anything in particular at all, it's incredible just how much of a mark the at the time largely unknown quentin tarantino's film has made on the industry with line upon line of memorable and endlessly quotable dialogue, it's perfectly pitched dark humour and a collection of characters that've made their way into popular culture from bible quoting hit-man right through to a leather clad gimp. pulp fiction is well and truly a one of a kind movie, a film born out of the imagination of tarantino and his co-writer roger avary that could never be imitated or matched no matter how many times the imitators would try (and there have been many) and as time continues to ever so surely tick on from its original 1994 release that would see the film not only win the canne's film festival's palme d'or but be nominated for 7 academy awards in which it won tarantino his first ever oscar (for best original screenplay), it's a testament to the everlasting value of the film that it continues to be such a joy to watch these 22 years later. the 154 minute film still wizzes by on the back of its unending supply of quick witted jokes and bizarre circumstances, while its eclectic group of characters who sometimes run across each other's paths for better or worse are well and truly as fun as they could've ever been, whether they be likable or not. pulp fiction really did once and for all set in concreate the talents of tarantino as the writer and director of actors, as his venture to the sun bleached streets of la resurrected and redefined a number of careers with its success. it's been well spoken about for a number of years at just how important pulp fiction was to the at the time stagnating careers of john travolta (who got to dance his way back into stardom), samuel l. jackson and bruce willis but tarantino showcased his chops as a leader of talent by injecting this wild tale with memorable turns (however brief) from the likes of uma thurman, tim roth, harvey keitel, ving rhames and even christopher walken. it's a star-studded cast no doubt, but tarantino handles each one of them perfectly and they show unbridled happiness getting to deliver his and avary's home run hitting script right out of the park. as a movie fan you've likely seen pulp fiction numerous times (i know i have) and there's very little that could be said in an argument against its joys as a cinematic trip like no other. a film joy ride you'll be taking for years to come, pulp fiction is deserving of its classic regard and spot on many a film fans top 10 lists. not too bad at all for a film with nothing but an endlessly mysterious briefcase tying it all together. 5 bare feet out of 5;7 September 2016;10;['much', 'particular', 'incredible', 'much', 'unknown', 'memorable', 'quotable', 'dark', 'popular', 'bible', 'well', 'kind', 'writer', 'many', 'many', 'original', 'first', 'oscar', 'good', 'original', 'everlasting', 'unending', 'quick', 'bizarre', 'eclectic', 'other', 'well', 'bad', 'well', 'fun', 'likable', 'tarantino', 'important', 'wild', 'memorable', 'brief', 'tarantino', 'unbridled', 'numerous', 'little', 'cinematic', 'other', 'classic', 'many', 'bad', 'mysterious', 'bare'];0.2071614583333333
74;didi-5;the world of movies did not begin and end with 'pulp fiction' and quentin tarentino is not a genius. that aside, and taking this movie as what it is, a penny dreadful on the screen, it does become perversely enjoyable. there's the cafe where 50s idols serve dinner (buddy holly, marilyn monroe, mamie van doren, jayne mansfield) and where mia (uma thurman) and vincent (john travolta, undergoing a renaissance after years out in the cold) dance the twist to chuck berry's 'it was a teenage wedding ...'. there's vincent's hip black partner jules (a sleek and cool samuel l jackson), and the town's big guy - and mia's husband - marcellus (ving rhames). and then there's butch, who gets the film in an interesting twist part way through, and he's bruce willis, who was everywhere the time this movie got made. and there's the inept hold-up duo - tim roth and amanda plummer - as 'ringo' and 'honey bunny', the really chilled mr wolf (harvey keitel), and a cameo from tarentino himself as jimmie. does all this mean the movie is any good? well, there's a body in a car without a head, and an o/d to urge overkill's 'girl, you'll be a woman soon', and zed's dead, baby, zed's dead. it's a comic party with f words. salivating kids may boggle at this and call it the most influential film ever - it isn't, but it is one of the most referential.

75;southdavid;"my tarantino retrospective continues with ""pulp fiction"" a film i know well, and love. having been slightly underwhelmed by ""reservoir dogs"" a few weeks back i was delighted to find that ""pulp fiction"" is as iconic as ever. told with a convoluted timeline, ""pulp fiction"" revolves around two hitmen, jules winnfield (samuel l jackson) and vincent vega (john travolta), who recover a briefcase for their boss, the criminal kingpin marcellus wallace (ving rhames). several calamities befall them as they attempt to return the case. wallace then arranges for fading boxer butch coolidge to take a dive in a prize fight, when butch double crosses him, wallace goes after him, which has extreme and unexpected outcomes for both of them. iconic really is the only word that fits. each scene is chocked full of quotable dialogue and legendary moments of cinema. so many sections have been parodied in things like ""the simpsons"" and ""spaced"", the film is a juggernaut of popular culture. the jumping backwards and forwards in time, help take what is a relatively straightforward story to the next level. there is a good time to be had just mentally putting the film together again in the correct order. visually, it's a step up from ""reservoir dogs"" as the camera is much more dynamic that it was, travelling with characters through sets and shooting locations. performance wise too it's a lot better, flush with the success of ""dogs"" q.t was able to keep the best from that cast, but also attract some enormous talent. samuel l jackson is probably the standout. . and this is probably the best performance of his career. every line, every intonation, every eye bulge is (and here's that word again) iconic. the music choices are fabulous - just as they were with ""dogs"". every song fits the tone of directly into the scene perfectly. it's not totally perfect though. tarantino's scenes in front of the camera make me cringe. he's not a good actor, and on top of that his use of the n-word seems a bit egregious, or that a character like jules would let him get away with it. that though doesn't spoil what is quite simply one of the greatest films of all time, perhaps even the only true masterpiece in tarantino's catalogue (i'll see as i check out the rest).";3 February 2020;10;['tarantino', 'reservoir', 'few', 'delighted', 'iconic', 'convoluted', 'criminal', 'marcellus', 'several', 'double', 'extreme', 'unexpected', 'iconic', 'only', 'full', 'quotable', 'legendary', 'many', 'popular', 'straightforward', 'next', 'good', 'correct', 'reservoir', 'dynamic', 'wise', 'flush', 'able', 'good', 'enormous', 'good', 'iconic', 'fabulous', 'perfect', 'good', 'egregious', 'great', 'only', 'true'];0.365

79;johnnyboyz;"there isn't much that can be added that hasn't already been said when it comes to the modern masterpiece that is pulp fiction. i suppose to some it's one of those films that you specifically remember when you first heard about it; when you first saw it; where you were when your first saw it and what the circumstances were at that time. given it has become so popular and so influential in its own retrospect with so many people having seen it so many times as individuals, it carries that sense of accomplishment and historical significance, perhaps not only on a level of cinema as a whole but to a culture to a generation of active filmgoers post 1994. i can remember first seeing pulp fiction the night before halloween, 2003. i think up until that point i was naive or immature when it came to cinema. here was a film that gave me a prod; a wake up call to do with films as a whole. here was a film that, i suppose, brainwashed me into a realisation that films didn't have to be progressive, linear, big on action and set pieces or of an entertainment value. to have pulp fiction take me through a roller-coaster ride of out of sync story telling (something i hadn't experienced in a film up until watching this); dialogue said by characters breaking down images of stereotypes; humour so black it has the power to make you put your hand over your mouth and shake your head in sheer embarrassment that you might find certain content even mildly amusing and just a continual flow of action, reaction and spontaneity that captivated me was a film experience i am wary i may never experience again. and while 2001: a space odyssey came close to delivering that same 'wow' experience about a year ago, you have to spare a thought for today's generation and their experience. through certain websites that give you unlimited amounts of videos, you can instantly access all of pulp fiction's 'best bits' in a fragmented and spontaneous manner. i don't know how popular or well endowed certain video websites were back in late 2003, i didn't use the internet as much back then, but i went into that initial pulp fiction viewing with absolutely no knowledge of any scene i was about to witness and came out someone who was suddenly into films; realised films could be different, almost experimental. i realised films could be influenced by previous ideas and these things called film 'movements' that were around decades before. so watching pulp fiction now recalls that first viewing and not the many after it, all of which were motivated perhaps out of feint hope i might be taken on that same, initial roller-coaster ride. watching this film recently for the first time in about three years and having learnt and read a great deal more about the film and films that influenced it, it's no real surprise that i do feel it is one of the best ever made. pulp fiction taps into cinema of past years but reinvents and updates thus influencing a whole new brand of 'type', something evident in the late nineties but certainly now, in the new century. the manner in which the dialogue is delivered and the dialogue period seems less-so a gimmick with age than it did when it first came out. the manner in which director tarantino audaciously flips from realism to escapism, often in one shot, is unheard of and best seen with mia's visual 'square' imitation and the frequent title cards popping up to contradict the urban realism of everyday dialogue and long tracking shots of realistic people making their way through everyday locations. pulp fiction recalls a lot of tarantino's work prior to pulp fiction. it begins in a diner (ala reservoir dogs and natural born killers); contains characters whom are young, in love couples that enjoy killing people/robbing places; contains mexican standoffs (again ala reservoir dogs and natural born killers) and carries that popular culture aura that just balances the film on that edge between realism and escapism in a way only tarantino could at the time. pulp fiction is a postmodernist explosion of sorts; combing genres of romance, crime, gangster and comedy into one package. characters plant seeds of doubt in the audience's minds ranging from a potential date with mia (thurman) to the menace that surrounds the character of marsellus wallace (rhames) and what he might do when certain betrayals are made. one new thing i noticed when re-watching it recently was the manner in which christopher walken's character prior to his monologue 'hopes he (a young butch) will never have to face a situation like that (in a pow camp) and take on certain responsibilities.' this echoes butch's ultimate act of redemption that is to come in the sense he will be a prisoner (of war, i suppose) and will have to take on certain acts of responsibility in being a saviour all motivated through the want for the gold watch around which the story is entitled. another item could be the way in which blatant violence is set up to be ignored for a bigger deal such as when a bystander is shot accidentally by marsellus after a car crash (but the concentration is the chase after it) and a certain individual has his head blown off (but the concentration is the very bloody car interior and what they will now do). pulp fiction is essential viewing for anyone that even remotely considers themselves 'into' cinema. the european influence and contemporary referencing is second to none culminating in pulp fiction: one of the greatest american films ever made.";14 September 2008;10;['much', 'modern', 'first', 'popular', 'influential', 'own', 'many', 'many', 'historical', 'active', 'first', 'naive', 'immature', 'progressive', 'linear', 'big', 'sync', 'black', 'sheer', 'certain', 'amusing', 'continual', 'wary', 'same', 'wow', 'certain', 'unlimited', 'good', 'fragmented', 'spontaneous', 'popular', 'certain', 'late', 'much', 'initial', 'about', 'different', 'experimental', 'previous', 'first', 'many', 'same', 'initial', 'first', 'great', 'real', 'good', 'past', 'whole', 'new', 'evident', 'late', 'new', 'unheard', 'visual', 'square', 'frequent', 'urban', 'everyday', 'long', 'realistic', 'everyday', 'natural', 'young', 'mexican', 'natural', 'popular', 'postmodernist', 'potential', 'certain', 'new', 'young', 'certain', 'ultimate', 'certain', 'blatant', 'big', 'such', 'certain', 'bloody', 'essential', 'european', 'contemporary', 'second', 'great', 'american'];0.1285317968416559

82;Movie_Muse_Reviews;"when quentin tarantino turned pulp fiction into cinematic art, everything changed. the auteur's second feature film marked the beginning of the rise of independent film in the '90s, but more importantly, it proved that the gratuitous sex, drugs, cursing and violence associated with ""low brow"" fiction could in fact be utilized intelligently for a higher artistic purpose. essentially, ""pulp fiction"" proved that gratuitous genre films can be provocative and have something to say. ""pulp fiction"" is three connected short stories sandwiched between a fourth story cut in half and used as a prologue and epilogue. the brilliance of tarantino's screenplay (with story help from roger avary) comes not merely from this structure, but the way these three distinct acts tie together in unexpected, poignant ways. act i, ""vincent vega and marsellus wallace's wife,"" is the film's most memorable. the stylization, the quotable dialogue and uma thurman's tantalizing presence as mia wallace stand out as the film's hallmarks, even though when weighed on the whole, this act has the least to do with the weightier, more meaningful components of the film. it begins by introducing us to vincent (john travolta) and jules (samuel l. jackson), two black tie hit men working for wallace (ving rhames) who are on their way to interrogate some young men who appear to have stolen a valuable briefcase of wallace's. en route, they discuss such asinine things as the level of intimacy in a foot massage and what a mcdonald's quarter-pounder is called in paris, firmly routing the story in what appears to be meaningless drivel. the feel echoes tarantino's ""reservoir dogs"" in a lot of ways. we then follow vega in a classic ""take out the boss's wife but don't lay a finger on her"" story filled with romantic tension that goes majorly awry. act ii, ""the gold watch,"" introduces us to aging boxer butch coolidge (bruce willis) as wallace asks him to throw an upcoming match. we also learn about butch's father's lucky gold watch, a family heirloom with a crazy history. there's a noir aspect to this part of the story, as butch of course decides not to throw the fight and run away with his girl (maria de madeiros), but the reckoning we expect takes a series of unbelievable turns. as we make sense of the chaos, notions of good vs. bad luck and good vs. evil or bad vs. ****ing evil start to appear, even as it plays for pulp entertainment. act iii, ""the bonnie situation,"" takes jules and vincent down a peg as they too get ""lucky"" but then must deal with a mistake that requires the help of a fixer named wolf (harvey keitel). the whole ordeal has jules contemplating the notion of divine intervention, and we begin to see all the events in the film as being either about luck, coincidence, divine intervention, or any other number of ways you can look at twists of fortune. by digging into the story and uncovering these deeper themes, tarantino transforms everything else about the film from hollow pulp fiction to rich pulp fiction. he proves that meaning can come even from the perverted, salacious material. a notion of social responsibility even sneaks its way in by the end. as a director, tarantino impressively wields suspense in the form of anticipated violence. it has remained his calling card ever since. nobody can craft a modern day mexican standoff like he seems to effortlessly do in every film. he also delivers on that anticipation of violence in a satisfying way. he goes big, but he never goes so far as to completely rip us out of this story. the greatest of great films always have unforgettable scenes that are somewhat inessential if not tangential to the story. vincent and mia twisting in the '50s-themed restaurant to chuck berry's ""you never can tell;"" christopher walken's cameo relaying the story of the gold watch to a young butch tarantino's creative choices really pop out, which happens when you've crafted an excellent story. yet the literary quality that tarantino brings to this curse-filled and violent film is it's crowning achievement. even just the honey bunny (amanda plummer) and pumpkin (tim roth) scenes that bookend the film have so much to say about fate and free will, and the things that happen to vincent whenever he takes a bathroom break with a pulp magazine seem to offer a meta-commentary on the entertaining distraction typically associated with these kinds of genre films. ""pulp fiction"" really tore down walls for filmmakers exposed to and inspired by pulp and other ""lesser"" forms of entertainment who wanted to grow up and make art. it certainly gave tarantino an audience to keep telling these kinds of stories. from spaghetti westerns to kung fu movies, he finds a depth and richness to them and channels that into his own storytelling. ""pulp fiction"" happens to be his finest example as well as one of his first. ~steven c thanks for reading! visit movie muse reviews for more";25 March 2017;10;['cinematic', 'second', 'independent', 'gratuitous', 'low', 'high', 'artistic', 'gratuitous', 'provocative', 'connected', 'short', 'fourth', 'distinct', 'unexpected', 'poignant', 'memorable', 'quotable', 'least', 'weightier', 'meaningful', 'black', 'young', 'valuable', 'such', 'asinine', 'meaningless', 'reservoir', 'romantic', 'awry', 'upcoming', 'lucky', 'crazy', 'noir', 'unbelievable', 'good', 'bad', 'good', 'bad', 'evil', 'lucky', 'whole', 'divine', 'divine', 'other', 'deep', 'hollow', 'rich', 'salacious', 'social', 'modern', 'satisfying', 'big', 'great', 'great', 'unforgettable', 'inessential', 'tangential', 'themed', 'young', 'creative', 'excellent', 'literary', 'violent', 'much', 'free', 'meta', 'entertaining', 'other', 'less', 'own', 'fine', 'first', 'more'];0.1018484848484848

85;videorama-759-859391;"in a hundred years, pf is still gonna be remembered as an ultra cool movie. it's like something qt has ever written and never will again. it's a refreshing wild, exciting movie experience. the movie's brilliant dialogue has you hooked from the word ""go"". so many people love pulp fiction, but if you asked them what's about, it'd be interesting to hear their answers. in a nutshell it's three stories, it's about losers, fighting the odds, but the losers are characters we become involved about. some of them we even admire. we have two professional hit men, who cross paths with a pathetic couple of losers, who this time, decide to rob a restaurant. you'll like how this scene pans out. the other loser is willis, a down on his luck, boxer, who's asked to throw a fight, but good old pride, has him doing the opposite. this is just a cool movie through and through, qt's follow up to 'dog's' with some of the same attire, though surprisingly not as gory, as compared to 'dogs', or especially true romance, or nbk. it's occasional, some of it shocking, esp the 'blowing off head scene' when a sorry shot accidentally goes off from vince vega's (john travolta's) gun, with little expense of remorse for the poor sob, and the wolf (a great harvey keitel in a great character role) is called upon at short notice to clean up the mess. travolta deserved his oscar nomination, as did jackson (a bloody underrated and fine actor) as his sidekick, jules. it's a 154 minute thrill ride, (exact same running time as jackie brown) amidst style, dancing, burger trivia, injecting, and some ludicrous scenes, one a shootout, others involving zed and the gimp, that's leads to a reconciliation between willis, and his rival, head baddie, marcellas wallace, (the excellent ving rhames) which was another one of the movie's surprises. walken again appears as a colonel, delivering a great monologue, involving a watch, hidden protectively, in not the healthiest of storage places. the dancing between jt and ut at the hip burger place, is another unforgettable scene. the story just cruises along, and we just let ourselves be taken along for the ride, up until it's clever, no, not dejavu end. every performance is as great as the last in a movie hit, that may never ever, ever die. qt's finest moment. watch.";12 November 2013;9;['ultra', 'cool', 'refreshing', 'wild', 'exciting', 'brilliant', 'many', 'interesting', 'involved', 'professional', 'pathetic', 'other', 'good', 'old', 'cool', 'same', 'true', 'occasional', 'shocking', 'sorry', 'little', 'poor', 'great', 'great', 'short', 'oscar', 'bloody', 'underrated', 'fine', 'exact', 'same', 'ludicrous', 'excellent', 'great', 'unforgettable', 'clever', 'great', 'last', 'fine'];0.2055147058823529
86;Anonymous_Maxine;**spoilers**tarantino has one of the most recognizable styles of any director working today, and pulp fiction is considered by many to be his greatest work yet. it is a conglomeration of tarantino's own infatuation with the movies, as it is more about movie life than real life. one of the few little factoids that i know about tarantino is that, like myself, he spent some time working in a video store and, like myself, spent a lot of his time watching old action films and horror films and pulp fiction films. pulp fiction is about the things that are in movies like that rather than real life. we have a lot of people put into extraordinary situations that do not have a lot of parallels with reality, but they are so well written and presented that we are more than willing to overlook this. one of my favorite things about pulp fiction is the way it presents several different storylines and mixes up the chronology of the film, which enormously increases the re-watch value. the film starts off with tim roth and amanda plummer playing a married couple who decide to rob a diner in broad daylight. the opening credits begin just as they stand up and bring out their guns, and we don't go back to this diner until more than an hour later in the film, when vincent and jules (john travolta and samuel l. jackson, both in possibly the greatest roles of their entire careers) finally show up after going through some serious situations of their own. bruce willis stars as a boxer who was supposed to go down in a big fight but killed his opponent instead, and now the bookies are after him. his absolutely adorable girlfriend, played by maria de medeiros, plays the part of the significant other who just doesn't understand butch's (willis) urgent need to leave, like right this second. this leads to some interesting situations where butch is stuck trying to hurry her out of the house and calm her down at the same time, and we as the audience are stuck wishing that she would shut up and get the hell out of the house while at the same time wishing there was some way she could be made to feel better. one of the biggest strengths of the film is the way the stories are all tied together. vince and jules, for example, after paying a visit to some guys who screwed their employer, take one of them hostage, only to have vince accidentally shoot him in the face while asking him a casual question in the car. they take the bloodied car to their friend jimmie's (tarantino) house, and go through one of the more amusing scenes in the film trying to get the car clean before jimmie's wife comes home, finds a bunch a gangsters in her house doing a bunch of gangster sh*t, and divorces jimmie. tarantino, as has become a tradition of his, plays one of the best roles (although also one of the smallest, which is also common) in the film, as a normal guy who just wants to live a normal life without people showing up at his house at 8 in the morning with a bloody car and a dead body. harvey keitel shows up playing the role of the wolf, and does his job of cleaning up messes like the one vince and jules have on their hands (and their clothes, and their car). here is a guy that knows exactly what he's doing, and he works quickly and efficiently and hates to be slowed down by people who prefer politeness ('pretty please, with sugar on top, clean the f**kin' car.'). eventually it gets clean, the mess is solved, and in order to clear their minds (and so jules can continue to contemplate the miracle that saved them from being shot by a guy who burst out of a closet and emptied his gun into the wall behind them at point blank range), they go to a diner to get some breakfast - the same diner that ringo and yolanda were robbing in the opening scene of the film. everything that has taken place up to this point in the movie, except for the robbery itself, took place before the robbery, and now we're right back where we started. (spoilers) it takes a few viewings to really get this movie straight because it is so complex and intricate, but i'm pretty sure there are something like four or five different stories operating at the same time, and it becomes even harder to get straight because some of them mix in with other ones. butch has to make a desperate trip back to his apartment to retrieve a wristwatch that has more than a little bit of sentimental value, and when he gets there, he finds vincent there, once more taking on a job that's just a little over his head. not only is this guy not able to travel with someone in the back seat without shooting him in the face, but he also seems to have a hard time staking out someone's apartment without using the bathroom and leaving his machine gun on the kitchen counter. not the smartest character, but certainly one of the most likable that travolta has ever played. in pulp fiction, the characters are not given dialogue that is meant only to further the plot. in many instances, it is there literally for no other reason than to show them having casual dialogue which often has absolutely nothing to do with the story. jules and vincent discuss at length the names of burgers at mcdonalds' in france, the definition of a miracle, and the acceptable difference between a woman's foot and her holiest of holies. granted, at least two of these have direct meaning to the plot, but when you see how deeply into the subjects vince and jules go, it becomes more and more clear that they are talking just to be talking. but the thing that really brings out the quality of the script is that no matter how long anyone goes on about one subject, it never once gets boring. all of the actors involved deliver some of the best performances of their careers, and much of the reason for this is because the roles fit them perfectly and the script is written so well. it's full of drugs, violence, blood, crime, murder, sex, and guns, but never once even approaches anything gratuitous. things like this are very often condemned by our society, and with good reason, if they are thrown into a movie just to advance a weak story, but in pulp fiction there is nothing thrown in without reason and nothing that is put in to make up for weakness anywhere else. but while it does have good reason to have everything in it that's there, the film is certainly not for everyone, because even the most logically placed violence and blood and killing is going to be hard for some viewers to take, so you should be forewarned. but the rest of you, as they say, are going to love it.;15 January 2003;10;['recognizable', 'many', 'great', 'own', 'more', 'real', 'few', 'little', 'tarantino', 'old', 'real', 'extraordinary', 'more', 'willing', 'favorite', 'several', 'different', 're', 'married', 'broad', 'more', 'great', 'entire', 'serious', 'own', 'big', 'adorable', 'significant', 'other', 'urgent', 'interesting', 'stuck', 'same', 'same', 'well', 'big', 'casual', 'tarantino', 'amusing', 'clean', 'tarantino', 'good', 'small', 'common', 'normal', 'normal', 'bloody', 'dead', 'clean', 'blank', 'same', 'few', 'complex', 'intricate', 'sure', 'different', 'same', 'hard', 'straight', 'other', 'desperate', 'more', 'little', 'sentimental', 'vincent', 'more', 'little', 'able', 'back', 'hard', 'smart', 'likable', 'many', 'other', 'casual', 'acceptable', 'holy', 'direct', 'clear', 'boring', 'good', 'much', 'full', 'gratuitous', 'good', 'weak', 'good', 'hard'];0.1116795366795366
87;Vartiainen;quentin tarantino's magnum opus and a film that inspired countless imitators. a film that is one of those everyone knows intimately, without ever having seen a minute of it. a film where four completely separate tales intertwine as their characters go on about their criminal, immoral lives. to talk about the story or the plot would be foolishness. you cannot really explain it in any meaningful way without spoiling it completely. besides, you already know approximately how it goes. if, however, you're young enough or hermit enough that you don't know, i can at least try my level best. it opens with two low-end robbers sitting in a diner and talking about their next gig. as they stand up to put their plan into action, we cut to two completely unrelated dudes talking about the differences between fast food product names in different countries. doesn't sound that riveting, but it strangely is. the two dudes are gangsters. hit men on their way to lay some vengeance on some unhappy souls. the real genius of the film starts to reveal itself when these stories start to intertwine. suddenly one of the gangsters meets the boss's wife from another story or the boxer is actually working for the same guy the two gangsters are. the stories are also told out of order, bringing a whole new level of meta knowledge to the viewing experience. one of the best examples of storytelling i've ever seen on film. i also really like the inconsequential scenes. like the talk about burgers in the beginning or the taxi drive the boxer takes after his last match. the latter scene adds absolutely nothing, except perhaps deepening butch's character a little bit, but it's such a great scene that i don't want it to be cut away. the taxi driver, esmeralda, is such a captivating character. almost like the protagonist of a completely different movie suddenly wanderer into this film. and they're all like that. they don't add a lot to the plot, but they're absolutely necessary for the style, the mood and the texture the film has. pulp fiction is a great film. one of my all-time favourites. it's one hundred percent tarantino and is one of those films you can watch over and over and still find something new you didn't notice before or had already forgotten because the film is so full of details to appreciate. it is violent and gory, and certainly not for the squeamish, but it's also lethally charismatic and suave. just like a gangster film should be.;12 January 2016;10;['magnum', 'countless', 'separate', 'criminal', 'immoral', 'meaningful', 'young', 'least', 'low', 'next', 'unrelated', 'fast', 'different', 'riveting', 'unhappy', 'real', 'same', 'whole', 'new', 'meta', 'good', 'inconsequential', 'last', 'latter', 'little', 'great', 'different', 'wander', 'necessary', 'great', 'tarantino', 'new', 'full', 'violent', 'lethally', 'charismatic'];0.1013548951048951

93;freemantle_uk;pulp fiction is great movie, quentin tarantino's best. it is multi-layered, having a number of stories involved in the movie. the stories involved in the movie include vincent (john travola) and jules (samuel l. jackson) going out on a hit and accidentally killing a man in their car and thereby having to sort of the mess, vincent having to entertain mia wallace (uma thurman), taking her to a 50s themed restaurant and ends up taking a heroin overdose and vincent having to save her life, butch (bruce willis) crossing paths with gangster marsellus wallace (ving rhames) and end up having to work together and a robbery of a restaurant by a couple which happens at the beginning and the end of the film. pulp fiction has many of the traits that make tarantino such a good writer/director: there great dialogue and humour, there is a number of stories and tarantino never tells a story straight (this was done in reservoir dogs, jackie brown and kill bill), good casting, violence and a great soundtrack. tarantino was also not scare to look at some dark plots such as male rape and the underbelly of crime. because of pulp fiction travola's career got a kickstart (a simpsons' joke at the time was that travola was working a 70's themed bar), made samuel l. jackson a household name and got him an oscar and help made the careers of uma thurman and rhames. because of the way the story is set out pulp fiction needs to be watched a number of times, which in my mind normally a good thing because it makes you think and pay attention. it also has good lines in the film, such as the royale with cheese conversation and good moments of comedy and dark humour. a moment i really like is when marsellus wallace sees butch in a car whilst he was crossing the road. as well because of the film i have the fun loving criminals' song from the film on my ipod, with the beginning of the film as well.;5 May 2008;10;['great', 'good', 'multi', 'layered', 'themed', 'many', 'tarantino', 'good', 'great', 'reservoir', 'good', 'great', 'dark', 'such', 'male', 'themed', 'good', 'good', 'such', 'good', 'dark'];0.4533333333333333

99;MaxBorg89;"and the oscar goes to...forrest gump? with all due respect, gump may be a very good film, but both the shawshank redemption and pulp fiction were more deserving of winning best picture of 1994 (as well as some other awards). now, the latter may have been too innovative, weird or extreme back then, but the french knew what they were doing when pulp received the palme d'or at the cannes film festival, beginning its route to being recognized as one of the most influential pictures of the '90s (alongside fight club, it's also my all-time favorite movie). whereas reservoir dogs, quentin tarantino's debut film, told one story by jumping back and forth in time (similarly to stanley kubrick's the killing), his second masterpiece gets more ambitious, combining separate episodes in a non-linear way: it starts with two thieves (tim roth and amanda plummer) discussing new places to rob; then there are two gangsters, vincent vega (john travolta) and jules winnfield (samuel l. jackson) who fulfill various assignments for their boss, marsellus wallace (ving rhames) while talking about foot massages and french cheeseburgers (a smart and funny detour from the stereotyped taciturn hit men we are used to); later, vince has to take marsellus' wife mia (uma thurman) out for dinner, with shocking and hilarious results; and finally, there is also a boxer (bruce willis) who is trying to sever his ties with organized crime. and somehow all these events are connected, in unexpected, genuinely amusing ways. the chronological structure might irritate some viewers, but fundamentally the plot is merely an instrument to allow the characters to interact. and what interaction: tarantino's dialogue is sharp and exhilarating, showing that when you hand it to the right people even the most absurd subject is a pleasure to listen to. from jackson quoting the bible (""and i will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger..."") to an awesome argument on how to get rid of a corpse (at which point the director himself, playing a minor role, delivers the priceless line: ""did you see a sign outside my house that said ""dead n**gger storage""?""), pulp fiction has one of the most quotable scripts of all time. how ironic then, that the film's most iconic and talked-about scene is completely wordless: travolta and thurman dancing to chuck berry's you never can tell. it's the one sequence everybody knows, even if they haven't seen the movie, and it is still a great scene, largely thanks to the perfect chemistry between the two stars, and the rest of the cast lives up to the task as well: jackson in particular is at his raging best, and he's easily matched by travolta (whose career was dangerously close to a shameful end before he was offered the part of vince), while the qt veterans (roth, harvey keitel) and newcomers (willis and, in a surreal monologue, christopher walken) slip into their roles as if they were wearing tailored suits. as for thurman, look no further than the restaurant conversation between mia and vince to understand why she was the first and only choice to play the lead in kill bill. witty, grotesque and brilliant (often at the same time), pulp fiction is a seminal '90s flick and without a doubt tarantino's best work. there have been several rip-offs since then, but those are best ignored: nothing can match the sheer genius of the original, a film to watch, love and watch again.";23 October 2005;10;['forr', 'due', 'good', 'deserving', 'good', 'other', 'latter', 'innovative', 'weird', 'extreme', 'influential', 'favorite', 'second', 'ambitious', 'separate', 'non', 'linear', 'new', 'various', 'french', 'smart', 'funny', 'stereotyped', 'shocking', 'hilarious', 'organized', 'unexpected', 'amusing', 'chronological', 'sharp', 'exhilarating', 'right', 'absurd', 'great', 'furious', 'awesome', 'minor', 'priceless', 'dead', 'quotable', 'ironic', 'iconic', 'wordless', 'great', 'perfect', 'particular', 'good', 'close', 'shameful', 'surreal', 'tailored', 'first', 'grotesque', 'brilliant', 'same', 'seminal', 'good', 'several', 'sheer', 'original'];0.2399580915538361

104;barnabyrudge;"for better or for worse, pulp fiction changed forever the cinematic landscape of its time, not to mention times thereafter. it was followed by a deluge of copycats and wannabes, none of which quite matched the staggering bravura of this film we really are talking here about a movie which epitomises that old dictum ""the original and still the best"". in this nonlinear trilogy of gangland stories stuffed to the brim with crackling dialogue, pop culture references, stylised gunplay and jet black humour quentin tarantino delivers an audacious and endlessly watchable movie, at once rewriting and redefining the whole style of the crime genre. the first story deals with hit men jules (samuel l. jackson) and vincent (john travolta) as they track down a briefcase full of 'something valuable', stolen from their boss marcellus wallace (ving rhames) by a group of young opportunists. later that evening, against the advice of jules, vincent escorts marcellus's wife, mia (uma thurman), on a dinner date which spirals out of control with almost tragic consequences. the second story follows down-at-heel boxer butch (bruce willis) who has been bribed by marcellus to throw a fight. butch doesn't keep his end of the bargain, pummelling his opponent to death in the ring before making a hasty getaway. later, butch attempts to flee from the city but first needs to retrieve a family heirloom a precious watch from his apartment. his attempts to recover the watch set into motion a crazy chain of events involving rednecks, gimp masks and a samurai sword! the third and final thread jumps back in time and follows jules and vincent once more, this time showing how they make a thorough hash of bringing in one of the young dudes who attempted to steal marcellus wallace's fortune. with an unexpected corpse on their hands, they need help from 'cleaner' the wolf (harvey keitel) to mop up their little problem. and even then, their eventful day is far from over as, next, they inadvertently get caught up in an impromptu coffee shop heist masterminded by pumpkin (tim roth) and honey bunny (amanda plummer). while the narrative structure of pulp fiction is devilishly clever, the plot itself doesn't matter much in the grand scheme of things. the plot merely provides a backdrop against which the characters can interact the film generates infinite fascination in its rich yet random conversations, where the characters chat casually about things like foot massages, european fast food joints, classic tv shows, piercings and why pigs are filthy animals, plus much, much more. whatever else you say about tarantino, he's the best there is when it comes to writing terrific passages of dialogue there's nothing in cinema quite like a tarantino conversation. choosing a favourite performance from the remarkable ensemble work is almost impossible; everyone is in dynamic form, though it is perhaps jackson, as the bible-bashing, smart-mouthed hit-man jules, who leaves the most lasting impression. his career post- pulp fiction has been, quite simply, a twenty year success story. there's an abundance of terrific individual scenes too the adrenalin- shot-to-the-heart sequence in which vincent saves mia from a drug overdose; the clean-up of marvin's corpse after being accidentally shot by vincent; christopher walken's unforgettable single-scene cameo in which he describes the history of butch's gold watch it would take too long to list all of the film's many wonderful vignettes; let's just say it overflows with great moments. different viewers will take from it their own particular favourites. if reservoir dogs hailed the emergence of a fiery raw talent in tarantino, pulp fiction marks a quantum leap in style, control and story-telling bravado. it remains a brilliant film, only tarantino's second behind the cameras but still a strong contender for his best.";26 March 2014;10;['well', 'bad', 'cinematic', 'staggering', 'old', 'original', 'good', 'nonlinear', 'black', 'audacious', 'watchable', 'whole', 'first', 'hit', 'full', 'valuable', 'marcellus', 'young', 'tragic', 'second', 'hasty', 'precious', 'crazy', 'third', 'final', 'thorough', 'young', 'marcellus', 'unexpected', 'clean', 'little', 'eventful', 'impromptu', 'narrative', 'clever', 'grand', 'rich', 'random', 'european', 'fast', 'classic', 'filthy', 'much', 'more', 'tarantino', 'good', 'terrific', 'tarantino', 'favourite', 'remarkable', 'ensemble', 'impossible', 'dynamic', 'jackson', 'smart', 'mouthed', 'lasting', 'terrific', 'individual', 'unforgettable', 'single', 'long', 'many', 'wonderful', 'great', 'different', 'own', 'particular', 'reservoir', 'fiery', 'raw', 'tarantino', 'quantum', 'brilliant', 'second', 'strong', 'good'];0.1517548957452804

111;davidmvining;"much like reservoir dogs, pulp fiction works so well because of its structure. in tarantino's freshman effort, he used the out of time elements to break up the one set monotony and provide lighter tonal moments here and there. in pulp fiction, it's used at the behest of thematic material, and i think it works on a whole different level. it's sort of an anthology film, but the three sections a little too interconnected to just lay it like that. they're connected through a similar set of characters that appear in, or are talked about, in all three, but also with the common theme of choice in the face of fate. in every story, from the dual framing devices (the cafe and the shootout over the suitcase) to the three main stories, characters are presented with inflection points in their lives, and they chose to go one way or another. vincent vega has come back to los angeles from several years as ""the man in amsterdam"". one of his first tasks is to take his mob boss's wife, mia wallace, out for dinner, to provide her with company while her husband, marsellus wallace, is out of town. there's an connection between them that caps with them both dancing in a twist contest in the wonderfully grotesque nostalgia restaurant jack rabbit slim's. vincent refuses to take the next step, though. we're not quite sure if mia would go to bed with vincent (the way she talks about her husband demonstrates her fidelity towards him), but her willingness isn't the point. the point is vincent's desire to make a move. he feels it's within the realm of possibility, but he refuses to take that step. of course, he never really gets the chance because mia has found vincent's stash of heroin and snorted it, which was simply too much for her system and she began to overdose. this leads to the most famous scene in the movie where vincent has to puncture mia's breastplate with a six inch needle in vincent's drug dealer's house. it's a great moment of tension with a fantastic shock. taking a step back from that description of the first major third of the film, i think we can see in microcosm why pulp fiction works so well. we have fantastically written characters. we have an exploration of the central theme playing out dramatically. we have some spectacle in the form of the needle episode. it's a marvelous combination of entertainment, character work, and strong thematic material wrapped together extraordinarily well. the second third deals with butch, a boxer we saw talking with marsellus wallace in the first. this also takes place after the third section. butch has agreed to throw his fight, but he used the quasi-public knowledge of the agreement to cleanup on the odds and win big by winning the fight. he's prepped and ready to go, talking lightly with his girlfriend fabienne as they spend the night in a hotel talking about the nature of attractiveness (really, her desire for a pot belly), and make fun of each other. he's set for life, and he knows it, but something's wrong. his father's watch is missing, left behind at the apartment. christopher walken actually started the story with a telling of the history of that watch (the famous ass watch scene), which he delivers wonderfully. it also sells the importance of the watch to butch so that when he suddenly loses his cool and decides to brave what should surely be certain death to get it back, we get it. it makes sense. he has to go get it. there's no other choice. he goes back, gets it, gives vincent a chest full of led from vincent's own gun, and then accidentally happens across marsellus wallace as he drives away. there's fate again, presenting butch with a situation where he has a choice. after a car crash and a limp-filled foot chase, the two end up trapped in the basement of two perverts (one a cop) who proceed to rape wallace. butch uses his opportunity to escape and has another choice. he could leave, scot free, or he could free wallace. he does the right thing, grabs a samurai sword, and cuts down the perverts (and their gimp with a solid punch to the face). wallace returns this favor by letting butch go. they will break ties and have no more to do with each other. the third is where the thematic material comes out most and comes to the best conclusion. even though it happens before the rest of the movie, the path that jules follows and how he ends the film is the culmination of the ideas flowing through it. we pick back up with vincent and jules in the apartment with the briefcase. an unknown gunman jumps out and fires, emptying his gun in their direction but hitting nothing. after the darkly comic episode where they have to clean up brains from the back of their car, vincent and jules settle down in the cafe that started the film as jules talks about their miraculous escape and how he plans on facing that with the rest of his life. vincent considers it a freak accident, but jules sees it as a sign from a higher power. he's been given an opportunity and a choice, and he's going to take a new path in response to it. he demonstrates that new path by allowing the robbers from the beginning of the film to leave with their lives. thinking back over the rest of the movie, we realize the order of events as they played out chronologically and discover that vincent died after the ending of the movie, at butch's hands. if jules had kept on his path without diverting it, ascribing the freak gun event as mere happenstance instead of a sign, jules might have died there too. the universe reached out to both vincent and jules, and it was only jules who read the sign correctly to run off to be like caine from kung fu. so, sitting back, what is pulp fiction? first, it's a story that's told out of order chronologically but is arranged in a way that heightens its emotional and thematic impact. it's very well acted, filled with wonderful conversations between well-drawn and interesting characters. it's dotted with great moments of excitement, the kind you expect from a good time at the movies. it's an entire package of entertainment, thematic weight, and great characters. no wonder it made such a splash.";25 November 2019;10;['reservoir', 'light', 'tonal', 'thematic', 'whole', 'different', 'little', 'similar', 'common', 'dual', 'main', 'several', 'first', 'grotesque', 'next',

113;gcd70;"quentin tarantino is a cinematic genius! if you don't believe me just treat yourself to his fantastic ""pulp fiction"", a dark, sharp, black as black comedy thriller concerning a few days in the lives of some desperate la characters. our prodigious director co-wrote the script (with roger avary), which contains some absolutely brilliant dialogue. this supreme black comedy has such a distinct laconic wit that you'll find yourself breaking up at the most gruesome and disturbing of scenes. the film's thriller element is at times chillingly effective, creating with ease heart pounding tension that will have you fidgeting in your seat and drying your hands on the legs of your trousers. the story itself, or three stories in one actually, is a fascinating tale of double-cross which will completely involve you, as will the equally fascinating character study which lies within the intriguing plot. there are some amazing people in ""fiction""! the total un-predictability of the movie works to perfection, as tarantino controls and manipulates his audience whilst entertaining brilliantly throughout. he deliberately unsettles us early so that we're never comfortable, then draws us in effortlessly as the narrative unfolds. the finale is very satisfying (more than so), yet leaves you itching and pleading for an encore. this is highly addictive cinema! you never know who's gonna do what to whom, where the next sucker punch is coming from nor the next razor sharp line. the bold format works excellently, with the non-chronological sequence being a real plus. apparently the original concept was to have the script 'linear', but the fact that this removed some main characters early in the piece was found to be unsatisfactory, and so a re-write was ordered. the result is astonishingly effective, and the editing is truly inspired, maintaining the ideal pace. tarantino's film is graphically violent yet superbly visual, containing some startling cinematography and much effective imagery, including one particular hard drug scene that leaves a marked impression. finally, one of the film's strongest points is the powerful acting. amanda plummer and tim roth are first on the scene giving us two great performances as the picture's initial desperate criminals. as a hippie drug dealer and his severely body-pierced wife, eric stoltz and rosanna arquette both make solid impressions, as do harvey keitel and tarantino himself. in the more pivotal roles are bruce willis as reckless boxer butch, ving rhames as crime-lord marsellus wallace, uma thurman as the sexy drug-fiend mrs. wallace and john travolta as marsellus' italian hit man vincent vega. all give strong showings. frank whaley and christopher walken also drop in on the action, but the plum role goes to samuel l. jackson as jules winfield. jackson gets all the very best lines and the most interesting character by far, and his performance is sensational, worthy of acknowledgment at the highest level. i could go on and on about what i consider to be the film of 1994 by a long shot. quentin tarantino will have you eating out of the palm of his hand. even though the black comedy gangster thriller is a well worn genre, the movie's amazing originality will blow you out of the theatre, while its confronting and astounding style and layout will really keep you thinking. what a rush! sunday, december 11, 1994 - knox district centre friday, february 10, 1995 - village centre melbourne monday, february 27, 1995 - kuhio twins honolulu having seen tarantino's violent, graphic landmark ""pulp fiction"" four times, i must confess that even though it is a remarkable piece of story telling, it does tend to wear a little thin. without the surprise element with which he so easily manipulates his audience first time around, tarantino must rely on the depth and genius of his writing, and the shrewdness of his direction and the editing. in this light ""pulp fiction"" does tend to be over long and perhaps over indulgent, and may have even worked just as well in chronological order (haven't i changed my tune). on the other hand, all the outstanding performances certainly hold up to repeat viewings. as the thinking man's gangster, samuel l. jackson delivers a veritable tour-de-force in what is possibly the performance of 1994. john travolta's showing is stylish and controlled, uma thurman proves herself to be a real handful, overdosing or otherwise, bruce willis and ving rhames are both ideally cast and make the very most of their characters, amanda plummer and tim roth (honeybunny and pumpkin) are incredible in their small roles (you could make a movie spin-off based on those two!), christopher walken's walk in is significant but rather drawn out, and both eric stoltz and rosanna arquette are terrific as the young marrieds selling and doing drugs (every scene of theirs is extremely funny). one may conclude that ""pulp fiction"" could have been just as effective twenty minutes shorter, but who's complaining. the film is ultra-violent, so the squeamish should avoid it, as should those who don't enjoy contemplative, thought provoking cinema. movie goers really need to be alert to put all the pieces together, and also to appreciate all the philosophical dialogue from jules and vincent. most will find tarantino's small talk both ingenious and amazingly true to life, as well as incredibly hilarious. sunday, july 9, 1995 - waverley pinewood cinema";29 January 2008;8;['cinematic', 'fantastic', 'dark', 'sharp', 'black', 'black', 'few', 'desperate', 'la', 'prodigious', 'brilliant', 'black', 'distinct', 'laconic', 'gruesome', 'disturbing', 'effective', 'fascinating', 'double', 'fascinating', 'intriguing', 'amazing', 'total', 'tarantino', 'comfortable', 'satisfying', 'more', 'addictive', 'next', 'next', 'sharp', 'bold', 'non', 'chronological', 'real', 'original', 'linear', 'main', 'unsatisfactory', 'effective', 'ideal', 'violent', 'visual', 'startling', 'much', 'effective', 'particular', 'hard', 'marked', 'strong', 'powerful', 'first', 'great', 'initial', 'desperate', 'hippie', 'severely', 'solid', 'pivotal', 'reckless', 'sexy', 'italian', 'strong', 'good', 'interesting', 'sensational', 'worthy', 'high', 'long', 'black', 'worn', 'amazing', 'astounding', 'violent', 'graphic', 'remarkable', 'little', 'thin', 'first', 'tarantino', 'light', 'long', 'indulgent', 'chronological', 'other', 'outstanding', 'veritable', 'stylish', 'real', 'most', 'incredible', 'small', 'significant', 'terrific', 'young', 'funny', 'effective', 'short', 'ultra', 'violent', 'contemplative', 'alert', 'philosophical', 'most', 'small', 'ingenious', 'true', 'hilarious'];0.1688636363636363

117;Steffi_P;"cinema is not like rock and roll, but once or twice in a generation someone will come along and try to reinvent cool for the screen. in our generation, just such a personage is quentin tarantino, a writer-director who raised the snappy, witty dialogue of the gangster genre to the level a cunning art. pulp fiction is arguably his signature movie. it has a screenplay of perfect construction, full of symbolism and tiny elements that play off one another throughout the two-and-a-half hour runtime. as with tarantino's debut, reservoir dogs, the dialogue is a continual complement to the action, in contrast to cinema's usual actions-over-words ethos. there are actually often more words then are strictly needed, for the sake of rhythm or emphasis, such as uma thurman saying ""five, as in there's 1-2-3-4-5 of us"". one of the best things about the pulp fiction screenplay is that, though ostensibly a gangster movie, it's also very much not. there is much of the mundane aspects of criminality, such as lance asking his wife for baggies and twisticks, and the irony of hoods relying upon a cleaner and an underworld medic for things they got up to when off-duty, as it were. tarantino's style as a visual director is, for the most part, beautifully simple. in an era where edits seem to come every two seconds, pulp fiction features some refreshingly long takes. it's a very minimalist style he doesn't show us anything we don't really need to see. during the kahuna burger exchange, he breaks it down to just two opposing but contrasting shots, a close-up of samuel l. jackson and the mid-shot of brad with jackson and travolta before and behind him. some scenes open with just a series of close-ups, and for much of the movie, sets and scenery are barely noticeable. this puts the focus totally on the actors, something that is all too often forgotten in the more showy, technical movies of the modern age. that's not to say backgrounds never matter. once in a while there is a brilliant something-or-other to be noticed, like the game of operation in lance's house, standing out amid the dull-coloured bric-a-brac for a second or two. the reams of dialogue and this attention given to actors puts a burden on the cast that has similarities to that in a stage play. and as with classic stage acting the performances here are certainly exaggerated, a kind of heightened version of reality, albeit a world away from theatrical hamming. uma thurman particularly stands out, sparkling with energy and delight, and a flirtatious frisson with an also-impressive john travolta. michael madsen was the original choice for the role, but travolta has a somewhat softer approach that is just right. finest of all though is surely samuel l. jackson, who has this brilliantly menacing stillness, contrasting with a rhythmic, shifting tone in his words. jackson is to tarantino what laurence olivier is to shakespeare; he can speak the lines as if he's actually thinking them. my only problem with pulp fiction is it's sometimes too clever for its own good, filled with too many embellishments, too many attempts to be outstanding and different. there are some moments that just seem almost twee in a way, like when thurman's ""square"" is literally drawn on the screen. but by-and-large pulp fiction is a work of much filmmaking genius, and it's hardly surprising that creativity as vibrant as this will come bubbling through the seams here and there.";20 January 2012;8;['cool', 'snappy', 'witty', 'cunning', 'perfect', 'full', 'tiny', 'continual', 'usual', 'more', 'such', 'good', 'much', 'mundane', 'such', 'visual', 'most', 'simple', 'long', 'minimalist', 'open', 'close', 'much', 'noticeable', 'more', 'showy', 'technical', 'modern', 'brilliant', 'other', 'dull', 'second', 'classic', 'exaggerated', 'theatrical', 'flirtatious', 'impressive', 'original', 'soft', 'right', 'fine', 'menacing', 'rhythmic', 'tarantino', 'olivi', 'only', 'clever', 'own', 'many', 'many', 'outstanding', 'different', 'square', 'large', 'much', 'surprising', 'vibrant'];0.2047348484848484
118;ShootingShark;vincent and jules are two hit men who work for bigshot marsellus wallace. in the space of a few days they must chaperon mrs wallace on a drug-fuelled night out, track down a boxer named butch who's reneged on a promise to throw a fight, follow through on a hit which turns very messy, and thwart a hold up in a diner they're having breakfast at. pulp fiction is rightly hailed as a masterpiece of filmmaking, a movie which is almost jaw-dropping in its scope, intensity, originality and black humour. what impresses me most about it i think is not all the brilliant dialogue or bravura technique (although those are sensational), but just the balls it takes to make a film so daring. there are too many examples of this to mention, but to kill off your main character halfway through and then bring him back later for action which takes place previously, or to have a story which seems to be on the waterfront but then abruptly turns into deliverance requires real courage and vision. i can think of only a few big-budget pictures which take as many risks (say 2001). tarantino is so confident in his storytelling abilities and so focused on every tiny element of his movie that his energy permeates on down through the cast and crew with the result that everyone does the very best work they can. the huge ensemble of players are all terrific, with jackson stealing the show as the fiery gangster jules, but everyone is superb, from travolta and thurman's goofy dance floor routine to the morbid cabbie played by jones to tarantino's own little turn as nervous jimmie. there are many moments in the film which are ridiculous, but unlike many modern films which try to wink knowingly at the audience, tarantino both pushes the absurdity to unheard of lengths but also crucially makes his actors play it as straight as they can. hence, butch is the most hackneyed of all stock characters - the washed-up fighter - but the way his situation is developed is utterly unique and we are riveted with his progress. a simple device like a glowing briefcase (which isn't even original, it comes from robert aldrich's kiss me deadly) both entrances us and distracts us with hitchcockian ingenuity whilst the director manipulates us into exactly where we should be, or floors us with another shock or razor-sharp slice of dialogue. if nothing else, tarantino illustrates that too many directors are too timid, too conventional, too scared of doing something that will confuse or alienate an audience, instead of plundering cinema for all the artistic and entertainment value it has to offer. trivia - the travolta character is the brother of mr blonde / vic vega (michael madsen) in reservoir dogs. a rare example of a deserving winner of the academy award for best screenplay, and a great mad crime movie.;7 August 2011;8;['bigshot', 'few', 'messy', 'black', 'brilliant', 'sensational', 'daring', 'many', 'main', 'real', 'few', 'big', 'many', 'confident', 'tiny', 'good', 'huge', 'terrific', 'fiery', 'superb', 'goofy', 'routine', 'morbid', 'own', 'little', 'nervous', 'many', 'ridiculous', 'many', 'modern', 'unheard', 'hackneyed', 'unique', 'simple', 'glowing', 'original', 'deadly', 'hitchcockian', 'sharp', 'tarantino', 'many', 'timid', 'conventional', 'scared', 'artistic', 'rare', 'deserving', 'good', 'great', 'mad'];0.2537863756613756

122;Jeremy_Urquhart;"perhaps before i start talking about why i think pulp fiction works on so many levels, i should mention briefly how i came to watch the film. pulp fiction was a film i had heard of at a very young age, and i'm not quite sure why. i had also wanted to see it for a very long time- again, i'm not quite sure why. maybe the mere fact that it was r-rated and notorious for its violence perked the interest of my 14-year-old self. nevertheless, i got round to watching it about a month before my 15th birthday- incredibly late at night on an occasion where i found myself home alone. i recall being blown away by the film, but also somewhat overwhelmed and confused. i had never seen anything like it before, and walked away from it being kinda sure i'd enjoyed it. i couldn't say for sure though. still feeling curious about the film, and the many mysteries relating to it that i'd failed to determine on my first viewing, i re-watched the film just a couple of months later. and something just clicked for me- i fell in love with the film. everything about the movie suddenly worked for me, and i found the second viewing to be perhaps the shortest two and a half hours of my life i've ever experienced. my own sense of time was warped and bended to the extent that it was in the film itself. that very night it somehow became one of the greatest things i had ever watched; one of the only films i'd seen that i barely hesitated to call a masterpiece. since then i've watched it another six or seven times- almost once a year- and i continue to feel motivated to watch it because i honestly feel like i get something new out of it each time i watch it. spoilers ahead, by the way. i plan to get fairly in-depth with my review of this movie, so just a warning for those that haven't seen it. one of the great things about pulp fiction is its refusal to fall under any particular genre or category of movies. it feels like a comedy when jules and vince discuss fast food and foot massages for nearly ten minutes it feels like a thriller during several segments, notably the scene where mia overdoses on heroin and the climactic mexican stand-off in the restaurant- two sequences that would have even alfred hitchcock on the edge of his seat. the crime genre is represented through the character's actions- most of the cast are criminals in one way or another, whether they murder, steal, or take generous helpings of class-a drugs. the infamous gimp scene feels straight out of a horror movie. this collage of various movie genres is one of the things that makes the movie stand out- by themselves, certain scenes may feel familiar, but when they're all blended together so well like they are in pulp fiction, the end product ends up feeling unique. this is true for most of quentin tarantino's films- he borrows elements from different genres, and homages/ references dozens of older movies in order to create something that feels unique, even if most of the individual elements themselves aren't too original. i can see why some people may not be a fan of the fact tarantino essentially steals from the lesser known works of those who came before him, but for me, i love it- i think he just makes it work due to the fact that his encyclopaedic knowledge of film allows him to borrow from so many sources. if he simply referenced about a half dozen or less films for each one of his movies, then i think that would start to feel like plagiarism. now, i could go on about the acting, the screenplay, the direction, and the glorious soundtrack, but really, what's there to say about these elements of the film that haven't already been said? tarantino's screenplay is one of the most acclaimed and quoted from the past couple of decades, and deservedly won him his first oscar. his direction has been similarly praised, and the soundtrack has become iconic- most impressive of all is that tarantino chose music that goes so well with the images they accompany. and yes, the acting is phenomenal- the film features what is almost certainly samuel l. jackson's best performance, one of bruce willis' most interesting performances of his long and successful career, and some great work from uma thurman. even the supporting actors are memorable, including harvey keitel, tim roth, and ving rhames as marsellus wallace (who's arguably the film's main character- think about it; without him, none of the three main stories would exist- butch ripped off marsellus wallace, vince took out wallace's girlfriend on a date that eventually went horribly wrong, and vince and jules were assigned to retrieve the mysterious briefcase for wallace). and of course, who can forget that pulp fiction single-handedly made john travolta cool again- an absolutely monumental achievement. of course travolta did eventually succeed in making himself a joke again a few years later when he made battlefield earth, but that's another story (or perhaps better left for another review)? as i said, i could indulge in commenting on these areas of the film, but if you've seen the movie you probably already know how good they are. pulp fiction is also one of the most discussed film's of the past 20 years, so you've likely already come across reviews or rabid tarantino fans who've gushed about why the film works so well, and how fantastic all the various components of the film are. so instead, i'm going to backtrack back to my point about seeing something new in the film upon every new viewing, and explain what i took away from the movie on my most recent viewing. pulp fiction was always controversial for its violence, with some criticising its depiction of assaults, shootings, beatings, and exploding heads. but for me, i found the film to have an almost anti-violence message of sorts, and i only realised this on my most recent viewing. now bear with me, because i know that sounds like a somewhat ridiculous claim, but i have my reasons. pulp fiction may be violent, but it doesn't promote violence. sure, the violence may be somewhat stylised and at times over the top, but that doesn't mean the film is saying that violence is something trivial. violent acts in the film are often shown to have consequences for those that commit them. vince's carelessness with his gun- an instrument of violence- causes marvin's head to be blown off in the backseat of jules' car, which leads to a near twenty minute detour in which they must take the car to jimmy's house and consult ""the wolf"" to assist them in cleaning the car and disposing of the gory evidence. marsellus' desire to get revenge on butch by presumably killing him leads them both to the basement of the rednecks- indeed, they are both fighting each other in the redneck's store when they are taken captive. but in the climax of the film, where guns are being pointed at several characters in the middle of a tense mexican stand-off, not a single bullet is fired. one would expect the tension to be eventually broken and the bullets to start flying, especially if one has seen some of taratino's other movies that end in explosive and violent climaxes (see reservoir dogs, inglorious basterds, death proof, django unchained, and kill bill volume 1). but instead, jules, who we've seen to be ruthless and unafraid to kill earlier in the movie, believes himself to be a changed man after miraculously surviving a hail-storm of bullets from a criminal that looks a little like jerry seinfeld and so instead decides to defuse the situation peacefully. he talks down pumpkin and honey-bunny from killing or robbing anyone, and insists that his dim-witted associate vince refrain from hurting anyone too. he delivers an absolutely stunning monologue where he ponders the bible reading he quoted so confidently earlier in the movie, and it's damn-near poetic. it sends a shiver up my spine every time i watch that scene, and indeed, jules' speech works. the two robbers get up after jules gives them some money from his famous wallet, and then leave. jules and vince do the same a few moments later. not a shot is fired. no one is killed. it's an absolutely beautiful scene. it may have been tempting for tarantino to give the film a ""wild bunch-esque"" ending, but instead he refrained, and i'm glad he did so. the climax to pulp fiction is absolutely stunning- fifteen minutes of tension, almost poetic dialogue, and brilliant acting, especially from samuel l. jackson. and it took me seven viewings just to notice how beautifully peaceful the ending of the film was. and that's why it's my favourite film of all time- i get new meaning from it, or appreciate different areas of it every-time i watch it. if you've never seen pulp fiction before, i implore you to go watch it. and if you have seen pulp fiction before, i implore you to go watch it again.";20 April 2020;10;['many', 'young', 'sure', 'long', 'sure', 'mere', 'notorious', 'old',

124;Movie-ManDan;pulp fiction continues to top lists of the best movies ever. it continues to mesmerize everybody that sees it. it continues to be seen as the best movie the cast has ever been in and the best movie tarantino ever directed. people that either watch movies on occasion or watch movies as hobbies love this. people with thorough knowledge of film love it even more. i would consider pulp fiction to be the best film of the 1990s, beating out other classic in that decade such as schindler's list and terminator 2. like most tarantino films, he does not put everything in chronological order. that is a genius movie on his behalf that forces the viewer to stay until the end. even those very, very, very few that don't like pulp fiction were obligated to stay till the end. that is also what made tarantino's first movie, reservoir dogs, so thrilling. also, tarantino shows his knack for awesome dialogue that only he can deliver. pulp fiction has three parallel story lines: the first deals with a couple called ringo and pumpkin (tim roth, amanda plummer) that are also thieves. they open up the film discussing the pros and cons of robbing a restaurant. the scene is brief, but the characters and dialogue is memorable. vincent vega and jules winfield (john travolta, samuel l. jackson) are two hit men sent to retrieve a briefcase for their boss, marcellus wallace (ving rhames), containing a golden object that is not shown nor told. another genius movie on tarantino's behalf. a few deaths and survivals along the way have them questioning their beliefs. this is probably the funniest story. pulp fiction has sometimes been labelled as a dark comedy. this is the story with most of its elements. this also has the one with the best and grittiest look. soon after the incident, vincent is asked to entertain wallace's wife, mia (uma thurman), while he is out of town. they have a good time, until she overdoses on heroin that vincent got from his drug dealer, lance (eric stoltz). although a small story, the dialogue is just as sick as in the other stories and the character development is very deep. although this is the only bit with mia, she is developed deeper and stronger than many characters in full films. the last is about club fighter, butch coolidge (bruce willis). wallace pays him a hefty sum to throw a fight, but after having a crazy dream, bets the money on himself and fights so hard that he kills his opponent. he goes on the run with his girlfriend (maria de medeiros) from wallace. this is the story with the most excitement and the least amount of comedy. some bits are shocking, but all fit together. bruce willis as butch is just as badass and heroic as john mcclane. as i mentioned earlier, the all stories are done out of order, but are all tied in in a very intelligent way. writing memorable dialogue like this is very hard, creating awesome characters is even harder, while making the movie look good and putting it out of order is the easy part. pulp fiction has everything a good movie should have to the extreme that barely any other have achieved. only tarantino could do a movie this good.;5 January 2015;10;['top', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'thorough', 'good', 'other', 'such', 'most', 'tarantino', 'chronological', 'few', 'first', 'reservoir', 'thrilling', 'awesome', 'parallel', 'first', 'brief', 'memorable', 'marcellus', 'golden', 'few', 'dark', 'most', 'good', 'grittiest', 'good', 'small', 'sick', 'other', 'deep', 'only', 'deep', 'strong', 'many', 'full', 'last', 'hefty', 'crazy', 'most', 'least', 'shocking', 'badass', 'heroic', 'intelligent', 'memorable', 'hard', 'awesome', 'hard', 'good', 'easy', 'good', 'other'];0.2232776089159067
125;Galina_movie_fan;"i just love ""pulp fiction"". i loved it when i saw if for the first time back in 1994 with my then 13-year old son in the theater, and i loved it again when i saw it last weekend on tv. every time i see it, it seems to get better and better. i am fascinated by the incredible pace, witty dialogs, and brilliant writing - every piece of the puzzle falls in the right place, and in the end i don't care a bit about the mysterious case. ""pulp fiction"" is a glorious example of the fact that there is no low subject for art. it is amazing how a work of art can consist of so many trashy elements, which is alluded to in the title of the film. it is populated by characters that came from the pages of cheap ""pulp fiction"" novels - gangsters, philosophical hit men, drug addicts and drug dealers, dangerous and sensual mistresses, naive girlfriends, crooked prizefighters with hurt prides and prized golden watches with long and deep histories. tarantino and his co-writer roger avary took the cliches of hundreds of films, comic books and twenty-five-cent paperbacks and by magic of their talents turned them into something fresh, sparkling, clever, funny and incredibly enjoyable. i should mention tarantino's taste for music - the soundtrack for ""pulp fiction"" (as for all of his films) is just killer. and last but not least - how well tarantino works with his actors, in this film everybody shines. there are no bad performances in ""pulp fiction"". for me, it is a perfect film and a true source of joy, one that i've experienced dozens of times and am always ready for again. i've read many times on these boards that ""tarantino is a rip-off artist"", that ""he takes bits and pieces (not influences) from other movies."" i often think of him as of a young boy who loves to play with his toys. for him, the toys are the old movies that he adores and he brings his love and admiration of these films to his own work. he is not greedy; he invites us to share his love, to play together, to have as much fun watching his films as he did while making them. tarantino does not make profound statements or ask eternal questions, but what he does do is entertain, and he does it marvelously - with style, class, irony, wit, and talent. when i am in the presence of a great work of art i know the feeling, and tarantino's film is a great work of art that happened to be very enjoyable. i cannot resist. like any time of day is a good time for blueberry pie, any time of day and any day of the week is a good time to watch and enjoy ""pulp fiction"".";21 April 2006;10;['first', 'old', 'last', 'well', 'incredible', 'witty', 'brilliant', 'right', 'mysterious', 'glorious', 'low', 'amazing', 'many', 'trashy', 'cheap', 'philosophical', 'dangerous', 'sensual', 'naive', 'crooked', 'hurt', 'golden', 'long', 'deep', 'tarantino', 'writer', 'comic', 'fresh', 'sparkling', 'clever', 'funny', 'enjoyable', 'last', 'least', 'well', 'bad', 'perfect', 'true', 'ready', 'many', 'tarantino', 'rip', 'other', 'young', 'old', 'own', 'greedy', 'much', 'profound', 'eternal', 'great', 'great', 'enjoyable', 'good', 'good'];0.2575783972125435

129;PredragReviews;'pulp fiction' is a beloved film that made tarantino's career, plus revitalizing john travolta's career in the process. the storytelling is masterful as well, with three distinct stories coming together in unusual ways to complete the scrambled narrative. and each individual story takes such wild turns, upending cliches in every instance possible, that the end result is a movie that compels the viewer to return for additional viewings. the casting is also first-rate, including john travolta (vincent vega), samuel l. jackson (jules winnfield), ving rhames (marsellus wallace, the mob boss), uma thurman (mia.. she appeared in kill bill series 9 years later), bruce willis (butch coolidge, the aged boxer). cameos included harvey keitel (winston wolfe, problem fixer), christopher walken (captain koons), steve buscemi (buddy holly look-alike) and of course quentin himself as jimmie. the plot is non-linear and features a number of bizarre stories that connect the main characters. these all involve two hit men vincent and jules, crime lord marsellus wallace and boxer butch coolidge. the main stories include vincent taking wallace's wife out and the trouble it leads too, 'the gold watch' which sees butch having to throw a fight and find his watch with some serve consequences, and 'the bonnie situation' (my favourite) where vincent and jules must dispose of their bloody car. in between these we get a robbery at a diner and a number of preludes. all the stories mix wonderfully and are packed with hilarious lines, intense drama and downright weird circumstances. despite the massive cast, the acting is phenomenal. john travolta re-launched his career as the super cool vincent and samuel l jackson is amazing too, with some of the best lines in film history. bruce willis is great and ving rhames is utterly convincing with uma thurman hanging loose as his wife. tim roth and amanda plummer have great chemistry and brilliant lines, while harvey keitel is wonderful as the problem solving wolf. the small supporting roles are excellent. eric stoltz is hilarious as drug dealer lance, equally funny is christopher walken and peter greene is creepy as can be as sadist zed. the script can't be praised enough. there are some absolutely hysterical lines and ingenious pop culture references. lines like ''royale with cheese'', ''zed's dead baby, zed's dead'' and ''i love you pumpkin, i love you honey bunny'' are all as quotable as movie lines get. tarantino uses music expertly again, ''jungle boogie'' and ''son of a preacher man'' are great. the films main power is that fact that it manages to mix so many diverse genres together so effectively, there are elements of drama, thriller, comedy and satire along with the powerful characters and complex plot which transform pulp fiction into one of the all-time greats. overall rating: 9 out of 10.;5 April 2017;9;['beloved', 'masterful', 'distinct', 'unusual', 'scrambled', 'individual', 'such', 'wild', 'possible', 'additional', 'first', 'aged', 'non', 'linear', 'bizarre', 'main', 'main', 'butch', 'favourite', 'bloody', 'hilarious', 'intense', 'weird', 'massive', 'phenomenal', 'cool', 'amazing', 'good', 'great', 'convincing', 'great', 'brilliant', 'wonderful', 'small', 'excellent', 'hilarious', 'funny', 'walken', 'creepy', 'hysterical', 'ingenious', 'dead', 'quotable', 'tarantino', 'jungle', 'preacher', 'great', 'main', 'many', 'diverse', 'powerful', 'complex', 'overall'];0.2560975609756098
130;Matt_Layden;"pulp fiction is a movie that grabs you by the throat and won't let go till the end. with it's great cast, incredible direction and unique ( at the time) dialouge, tarantino has created a movie that will go down in film history as one of the best and will be remember for years to come. pulp fiction is 3 stories interconnecting. vincent vega and jules winnfield are two hit men on the hunt for a briefcase whose contents were stolen from their boss, marsellus wallace. marsellus is out of town, and he's gotten vincent to take care of his wife, mia. that is, take her out for a night on the town. butch coolidge is a boxer who's been approached by marsellus and been told to throw his latest fight. pumpkin and honey bunny are two lovebirds/thieves who have decided to rob the restaurant they're currently eating at. but the restaurant doesn't turn out to be as easy as the other places they've robbed. this is a film that has intense moments that will have you on the edge of your seat, case in point, the overdose scene where they need to inject a shot of adrenaline into mia's heart. the close up tension from tarantino and dialouge will have you on the edge of your seat no matter how many times you have seen it. what pulp fiction does so well is blend this with comedic scenes and basically ""nothing"" scenes which make it more real then other films that we see. tarantino manages to get great performances out of mediocre film stars like travolta and willis, who steal the show. but not without the supporting cast of so many great and talent actors, who fit their characters to perfection. samuel l. jackson is jules, and no one else. what makes it more interesting is that the three stories connect and are told not in order, so multiple viewings are needed to understand the film as a whole, and with it's length, you would expect it to drag on in certain scenes, but with it's witty dialouge and the superb cast in those scenes you are nothing feeling like it's going on too long. tarantino has pulled off a great film and i believe will never top it, this film is the best film of the 90's and one of the best films of all time.";16 August 2005;10;['great', 'incredible', 'unique', 'tarantino', 'good', 'vincent', 'late', 'easy', 'other', 'intense', 'overdose', 'close', 'tarantino', 'many', 'comedic', 'real', 'other', 'tarantino', 'great', 'mediocre', 'many', 'great', 'interesting', 'multiple', 'certain', 'witty', 'great', 'good', 'good'];0.3957199546485261

139;DeeNine-2;"well, it rocks, i guess. it jumps. it moves. it's flashy and clever. the acting is excellent. the direction is interesting... i could write a book, but what i kept thinking was how much the audience worships not just the violence, but the power. how much they love the fascist criminal, the mob boss who must be obeyed and shown loyalty to. uma thurman is just decadently sexy. john travolta is amazingly lovable as a ""low-rent"" hood and bruce willis is believable as a prize fighter who turns the tables and wins the fight instead of throwing it (and, in an up-to-date spin, bets on himself-seems right! how come they never did that before: they probably did, i just missed it.). samuel jackson is interesting as the bible-quoting black hit man. naturally they make us root for the bad guys; indeed the bad guys are almost always the heroes in the modern hollywood. we can really explore ourselves only as bad guys. the pro-mo's for cigarettes, heroin, cocaine, booze and decadence are getting a little thin, however. a hollywood movie, a commercial flick, is always a cliche. the art part comes from doing spins on the cliche, in putting a new twist on the old bull****, on the old standards. ironically interesting was the sensuous indulgence of dinner for travolta and thurman. he's shot heroin, she's done a few lines, they smoke some pot, they smoke some cigarettes, but they really get off on milk shakes and vanilla cokes, steaks and hamburgers. poor hollywood. they've done it all and now must find real indulgence in fat, salt, sugar and meat, which for the stars really is an indulgence. if your life span is only sixteen to about thirty-five, then the forbidden things really are fat, salt, meat and anything else that puts on the weight. cocaine and cigarettes can't hurt you because by the time the ill effects kick in, your career is over anyway.

140;Howlin Wolf;"... let's clear one thing up first: i happen to believe that this movie is not as good as ""reservoir dogs"". ""rd"" had a clearly defined story and aim. i'm not so sure this does. it feels more like an exercise by mr tarantino, demonstrating just how audacious he can be. is there anything wrong with such flashiness when the result is this entertaining? not in the slightest. ""the gold watch"" segment did nothing for me, and in my opinion should have been left out of the final cut, much as i like christopher walken. the rest of the movie without exception is a tour de force of controlled direction (tarantino always knows where the film is going, even if his audience doesn't) understated but powerful acting, and moments of bizarre humour. i could quote the dialogue verbatim here, but there is simply too much quality and not enough space. this was also sam jackson's breakout role. for that we should be thankful, because the man is 'star quality' personified... no amount of superlatives can come close to encapsulating the feeling that most of you will get when watching the movie for the first time. it is an absorbing experience, almost like you have stepped into a much cooler vr sim of real life. repeated viewings do not seem to dull its stark vitality. those of you who abhor it for its casual attitude to violence miss out on its good points that do not contain violence; namely, realistic yet captivating dialogue, flawless character development and bravura directing. it is much more than the glorification of gangsters and their subculture, a la ""lock, stock... "" and its ilk. calling it the best movie ever made is hollow and unsubstantiated praise that i will not garner it with. one thing that can not be denied is that from its arrival it changed our perceptions of what cinema can mean to all people. despite this, as i said, i don't think it can compare equally with ""reservoir dogs""...";25 January 2002;10;['good', 'reservoir', 'sure', 'audacious', 'wrong', 'such', 'entertaining', 'slight', 'final', 'powerful', 'bizarre', 'much', 'enough', 'breakout', 'thankful', 'most', 'first', 'cool', 'real', 'stark', 'casual', 'good', 'realistic', 'flawless', 'more', 'good', 'hollow', 'unsubstantiated', 'reservoir'];0.2380952380952381
141;sme_no_densetsu;"quentin tarantino's ""pulp fiction"" is a film that needs no introduction. one of the best films of the nineties, it made tarantino ubiquitous and landed an impressive seven oscar nominations. the film is comprised of three related stories. one story involves hit men vincent vega (john travolta) & jules winnfield (samuel l. jackson) as they pay a visit to some 'business partners' of their boss, marsellus wallace (ving rhames). another story revolves around vincent vega once again as he is instructed to take the boss's wife (uma thurman) out on the town while he's away. the remaining story focuses on an aging boxer (bruce willis) whom wallace has bribed to throw his next fight. as you can see by the names mentioned above, the cast is chock full of talented individuals. travolta, jackson & thurman all got awards recognition, though none of them were lucky on oscar night. in my opinion, jackson in particular should have won an oscar for what is arguably the best performance of his career. the rest of the cast includes the likes of tim roth, harvey keitel & christopher walken. definitely an enviable cast. the film's sole oscar win was for the original screenplay, which is arguably the film's strongest point. the script is loaded with memorable dialogue, the plot is original and the film manages to elevate itself above other crime films by mixing violence & redemption. it is not hyperbole when this screenplay is ranked among the very best of all time. as for tarantino's direction, that's superbly handled as well. the film looks great and it also sounds great. the soundtrack is exceptional, including standout tracks by dick dale (""misirlou""), kool & the gang (""jungle boogie""), urge overkill (""girl, you'll be a woman soon"") and chuck berry (""you never can tell""), among others. all in all, ""pulp fiction"" is a top-notch film whose high stature is unquestionably warranted. needless to say, if you've never seen this movie you owe it to yourself to do so post-haste.";26 August 2009;9;['good', 'tarantino', 'ubiquitous', 'impressive', 'next', 'full', 'talented', 'lucky', 'oscar', 'particular', 'good', 'enviable', 'sole', 'original', 'strong', 'memorable', 'original', 'other', 'good', 'great', 'great', 'exceptional', 'jungle', 'top', 'high', 'needless', 'post'];0.4111904761904761

143;Screen_Blitz;"quentin tarantino has taken a spot as one of the best and most influential directors of all time. two years after his success with his debut film reservoir dogs, he took his director skills up to next level in this incredibly unique black comedy black comedy pulp fiction. boasting a strong ensemble cast of actors including samuel l. jackson, john travolta, bruce willis, tim roth, amanda plummer, harvey keital, uma therman, ving rhames, christopher walken, maria de medeiros, and eric stoltz; this bold genre-bending piece demonstrates tarantino exercising his unique style of direction in arguably his most polished fashion yet. told in a nonlinear perspective, this film follows three interconnecting story lines centering on a wide range of characters in their life of crime in the city of los angeles. followed by a tense introduction of two restaurant robbers (played by tim roth and amanda plummer), we are introduced to two tuxedo-suited hit men vincent vega (played by john travolta) and jules winnfield (played by samuel l. jackson) as they make a hit for their mob boss marcellis wallace (played by ving rhames) that goes awry. this is followed by vincent vega on a platonic date with marcellis's wife mia (played by uma thurman), next storyline introduces us to a championship boxer butch coolidge (played by bruce willis) and his girlfriend fabienne (played by maria de medeiros); followed by the aftermath of vincent and jules's mob hit where they meet with jules' friend jimmy (played by quentin tarantino himself) and winston wolfe (played by harvey keital) to help them out of their predicament. when it comes to writing sharp dialogue and a long range of exotically colorful characters, that is where director quentin tarantino's cinematic expertise shines the brightest. in other words, he proves more than capable of writing a finely masterful screenplay and translating on screen in the most engaging manner possible. unlike this previous film 'reservoir dogs' which centered on a group of unhinged criminals in the aftermath of a jewelry store robbery, this film sees tarantino expands upon his narrative scope with a slightly more lighthearted tone; though a relatively heavy amount of violence and four-letter words. the story sets in two hit-man played by former 'grease' star john travolta and the ever-popular samuel l. jackson as they are embark on their way to a mob hit while trading in some philosophical discussions consisting of clever pop culture references including the now-famous ""royale with cheese"". the rest of the dialogue consists of some snappy monologues and bold one-liners formulated by tarantino's edgy script. many of the characters, almost all of which are distinct archetypes with a morally gray area, embrace in tarantino's nonlinear series of vignettes that all lead to moments of both shock and unexpected laughter, but with plenty of memorability. among the wildly large ensemble cast, john travolta and samuel l. jackson are easily the duo is stand out. these two embrace such an engaging chemistry on their opening scene with their top-notch dialogue and darkly funny nature, and travolta also claims an opportunity to establish a clever chemistry with uma thurman in a following storyline featuring eric scholtz as a drug dealer who must come to travolta's aid when his date with thurman goes awry. bruce willis gives a smart, but perhaps less memorable performance as an ailing boxer who faces a fateful encounter with marcellis wallace, played by ving rhames who plays the role in a solid fashion. christopher walken makes a brief appearance as a vietnam war veteran in a flashback sequence, but doesn't have much offer beyond his few minutes of screen time. maria de medeiros as the girlfriend of bruce willis's character embraces a fine performance, but sadly is given a whole lot to do. one of the biggest surprise is quentin tarantino who makes a brash cameo as a friend of samuel l. jackson in one vignette set after the horrible carnage that ensues in jackson and travolta's mob hit. finally, there is tim roth and amanda plummer as the bonnie and clyde-like couple who explode on screen in an electrifying restaurant robbery leads to a sassy showdown, with semi-funny results. pulp fiction is a masterfully entertaining cinematic piece that marks not the best of quentin tarantino's efforts but by far one of the best films in cinematic history. it is a film overflowing with plenty of substance, solid performances, colorful dialogue, and a spectacular amount of cinematic surprises; although it's audacious humor and occasionally unpleasant nature can proved to be for offensive for some. in the end, it places tarantino on the high ranks of hollywood's ladder.";2 May 2015;10;['good', 'influential', 'next', 'unique', 'black', 'black', 'strong', 'ensemble', 'bold', 'unique', 'polished', 'nonlinear', 'wide', 'tense', 'suited', 'awry', 'platonic', 'next', 'sharp', 'long', 'colorful', 'cinematic', 'bright', 'other', 'more', 'capable', 'masterful', 'engaging', 'possible', 'previous', 'reservoir', 'unhinged', 'tarantino', 'lighthearted', 'heavy', 'former', 'popular', 'philosophical', 'clever', 'famous', 'snappy', 'bold', 'edgy', 'many', 'distinct', 'gray', 'nonlinear', 'unexpected', 'large', 'ensemble', 'top', 'funny', 'clever', 'awry', 'smart', 'memorable', 'fateful', 'solid', 'brief', 'much', 'few', 'fine', 'whole', 'big', 'horrible', 'like', 'electrifying', 'sassy', 'semi', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'cinematic', 'good', 'good', 'cinematic', 'solid', 'colorful', 'spectacular', 'cinematic', 'audacious', 'unpleasant', 'high'];0.1678853914447134
144;pyrocitor;"when a previously unknown young filmmaker named quentin tarantino barged onto the movie-making scene in 1992 with a unique, quirky, disturbing and groundbreaking film called reservoir dogs, a noticeable change could already be seen soon after in the film industry on the whole. cheap imitations of tarantino's hit began to be seen, films with more stylized dialogue, harsher senses of humour usually coupled with brutal violence became much more commonplace and acceptable in the mainstream cinema. (a prime example being tony scott's 1993 hit ""true romance"", also written by tarantino) yet if reservoir dogs was a hit, than pulp fiction was something entirely more, snatching up the prestigious palme d'or award at the cannes film festival and making a huge smash impact on movie viewers and the film industry on the whole, spawning generations of cult followers and would be imitators. despite the relentless praise tarantino and his most prized film have been awarded, upon viewing over a decade later, pulp fiction still manages to intrigue and fascinate, with its blinding originality of narrative, and wonderfully convoluted screenplay. no matter how terrible or disgusting the myriad of characters on display here, we never fail to be utterly fascinated by them, and after the movie has run its two and half hour course, we are left only wanting more darkly comical and fiendishly interesting pulp tales to feast our eyes and ears upon. one also remarks on how deeply the movie has permeated modern pop culture simply by noticing all of the scenes that are referenced, whether it be by the simpsons, saturday night live or other movies, such scenes as the 50s dance scene with travolta and thurman,the ""you know what they call a quarter pounder with cheese in france?"" scene with jackson and travolta and bruce willis and ving rhames being bound and gagged by red rubber balls, only by seeing the movie will one truly understand how often it is referenced by so many sources. the movie truly defines the meaning of the term ""ensemble cast"" as well, with superb and incredibly memorable performances all around. john travolta is great as spaced out, almost child like vincent, who seems constantly on a different page as all surrounding him in the role that single-handedly re-ignited his career, and breakout star samuel l. jackson is similarly terrific as his partner with a tendency for religious rants, fully deserving their oscar nominations. tarantino favourite uma thurman is also terrific as a spoiled mobster's wife, and bruce willis gives an excellent, engaging performance as 40s style boxer butch. then there's the myriad of excellent supporting players, with such familiar faces as harvey keitel, tim roth, ving rhames, amanda plummer, tarantino himself... even a tiny cameo from an unrecognizable steve buscemi as buddy holly the waiter in the wonderful 50s dance club scene, and christopher walken delivering his utterly unforgettable monologue, one of the best and most memorable of all time. all in all, it goes without saying that pulp fiction is a modern classic of film-making, and despite all of the hype and endless praises, one still walks away from it remarking on how unique and wonderful a film it is. for those not deterred by the strong violence, frequent swearing and racial slurs that tend to be tarantino trademarks, pulp fiction should qualify as a ""must see"", if only to understand all of the references in modern pop culture and see what everyone is talking about. rest assured you will almost certainly not be disappointed. -10/10";25 August 2006;10;['unknown', 'young', 'unique', 'quirky', 'disturbing', 'groundbreaking', 'noticeable', 'cheap', 'more', 'harsh', 'brutal', 'commonplace', 'acceptable', 'prime', 'true', 'reservoir', 'more', 'prestigious', 'huge', 'relentless', 'tarantino', 'convoluted', 'terrible', 'fascinated', 'half', 'more', 'comical', 'interesting', 'modern', 'other', 'such', 'red', 'many', 'ensemble', 'memorable', 'great', 'different', 'terrific', 'religious', 'oscar', 'tarantino', 'favourite', 'terrific', 'spoiled', 'excellent', 'excellent', 'such', 'familiar', 'tiny', 'unrecognizable', 'wonderful', 'unforgettable', 'good', 'memorable', 'modern', 'endless', 'unique', 'wonderful', 'strong', 'frequent', 'racial', 'tarantino', 'modern'];0.243560606060606
145;oneguyrambling;"pulp fiction is rightfully renowned as a landmark in modern film. even when it was released in 1994 you just knew you were watching something that was changing the rules somehow. in essence the film was a series of delicious conversations between well crafted and memorable characters, punctuated by casual profanity, racist epithets and extremely adult topics, all set against an immaculately selected soundtrack of essential yet often obscure tracks selected from several decades. in between all this there were a few scenes of eye-opening violence and/or grown up situations. rather than go into detail discussing what pulp fiction was about i have decided to talk more about what it made. and i am not referring to box office or dvd sales pulp fiction: made me wonder what the band aid was for. made me and millions of others wonder what was in the case made jackrabbit slim's, big kahuna burger and red apple cigarettes household (fake) names. made exploded penises the new severed ear. made an urge overkill cover 'that od song' and worse still made the rebels the unfortunate soundtrack to interracial male rape. furthermore, it; made bruce willis and john travolta legit hollywood stars again.

147;Rabical-91;it would pointless for me to describe 'pulp fiction' in exact detail as the basis for the film as been extensively posted elsewhere on the net. it is probably the most popular of quentin tarantino's films, possibly due to the influence it had on not only other film creators but also on music groups, particularly fun lovin' criminals, who used the opening sequence of the film as part of their 1996 chart hit 'scooby snacks'. personally, i do not rate it as highly as tarantino's later hit 'kill bill' but all the same i enjoyed it and compared to tarantino's dreadful 'from dusk till dawn', is a masterpiece. as someone far too young to have seen it on its initial release, i did not see it until i was in my teens when my family acquired a vhs copy of it. admittedly, i found some of it too difficult to follow but i found it worth watching for the action and the presence of the stunningly beautiful uma thurman, who with her mid-length black hair and flexible dance moves made my heart throb ( amongst other things, pardon the expression ). aside from the violent action, there is also a fair deal of humour on display, such as the dance sequence between john travolta and uma thurman in the diner, the sight of samuel l. jackson's character's personalised wallet emblazoned with the slogan 'badass motherf**ker!' and the scene used both at the opening and closing of the film in which a couple of bandits' attempts to rob a diner are foiled. one or two scenes make for uncomfortable viewing such as uma thurman's character almost dying after overdosing on heroin or ving rhames being raped by a corrupt police officer. i have not seen 'pulp fiction' for some time so my review is based on my memories of it. i do remember enjoying it very much. samuel l. jackson, uma thurman, tim roth, amanda plummer, ving rhames and bruce willis are among the best players in the film. i am not a fan of quentin tarantino on a personal level ( he strikes me as being something of a creep ) but one cannot deny that he is an excellent filmmaker. his next big hit came in 1997 with 'jackie brown' which also featured samuel l. jackson and in 2003 thurman took on the lead role for the superb 'kill bill'. just one thing that puzzles me about 'pulp fiction'. just what was it exactly that was it in the briefcase that travolta opened?;2 October 2017;9;['exact', 'popular', 'other', 'fun', 'same', 'dreadful', 'young', 'initial', 'difficult', 'worth', 'beautiful', 'mid', 'length', 'black', 'flexible', 'other', 'violent', 'fair', 'such', 'personalised', 'uncomfortable', 'such', 'corrupt', 'good', 'personal', 'excellent', 'next', 'big', 'lead'];0.0433333333333333

152;baumer;"warning: does contain spoilers. before i go into how great this film is, i have to first tell you something that i know everyone thinks but so few have commented on, and that is the performance of ving rhames. for those of you that have seen this film, you all know what i am going to say is the gospel, for those of you that haven't, if you ever see a film for a singular performance, see two films. one is tombstone because of val kilmer and the other is pulp fiction for rhames. his portrayal of marcellus wallace is one of the greatest performances in the history of motion pictures. his mannerisms, his dialect, his virility, his coolness and his ruthlessness all should have given him the best supporting actor oscar that year, even over samuel jackson. just think back to some of this lines, some of his actions and some of his facial expressions. this is the epitome of greatness and if i could pick 5 performances in the history of film that are the embodiment of powerful interpretations and believability, this would easily be up there. just look at the scene when jules talks to him after the marvin problem. jules is freaking out and wallace calmly responds "" i'm on the m*****f***a, go back inside and chill them niggas out, i'm sending in tha wolf. "" as he delivers the line he is serenely sitting in his backyard with his cool shades covering his malicious eyes and he is wiping his mouth with an expensive hanky. his delivery is perfect and when you listen to him you don't think this is a ruthless killer, he is just a guy next door with a very nice house. and what makes it even better is that they are two gangsters talking about alleviating the bonnie situation before she gets home. these are two bad ass criminals that are in the business of killing people and they are attempting to save a man's marriage by removing a dead body from the garage. that is just dripping with contradictions, but it works because of the writing and because of the delivery, mostly by rhames. another scene that demonstrates his grasp of his character is the rape scene. when he finally gets around to his comeuppance against "" billy boy "", he spits out his dialogue with such venom that while you are cheering his triumph, you are actually worried for zed and his soon-to-be-living-his-shortass-life-in-agonizing-pain-rapist situation. and then when he talks to butch, he is fair and thankful for butch's assistance but cannot forget how butch betrayed him. "" oh that what now. i'll tell you what now. there is no me and you. you leave town tonight and when you be gone you stay gone. you lost all your l.a. privledges. "" ving rhames is my favourite part of the film ( besides the ridiculously intelligent and original script ) and quoting him is now a daily regimen at work with my other friends that like the film. i think tarantino is so smart for casting rhames in this role and what it makes it that much better is knowing that rhames is one of the most humble men in hollywood, remember when he gave back his emmy to jack lemmon as he tearfully said that he hadn't paid enough dues yet and lemmon was one of his idols? the man can do no wrong in my eyes. he is one of a kind. as for the rest of pulp fiction, this is a film that will often be imitated but never duplicated. that is an old cliche but it is so true in this case. it is completely original and without a doubt, what makes it so original and so great is simply the writing. what other film can have gangsters talking about foot massages and the importance of them just before they are about to perform a hit. what other film can describe in great detail what a pilot for a film is and then talk about a man that fell through a four story window and develop a speech impediment, all before entering into a room to ramble on about the bible and how tasty the burgers are before executing them with extreme prejudice. there is a simple and definitive answer to that question, no film. pulp fiction takes violence and surrounds it with every day conversations with people that seem to be in a different world yet they jump through some strange porthole and into ours by discussing things like blueberry muffins, how good coffee is, cleaning a blood smeared car with domesticated products that are located under jimmy's sink, oral pleasure, speaking bora bora, getting day jobs as opposed to robbing banks, being cool like fonzie and five dollar milkshakes. how and where tarantino thought of this script is beyond me, all i know is that my film life and even my life is richer now that i have seen pulp fiction. i can understand why this film was passed over at the oscars for forrest gump, but in most people's opinion this was the best film of 1994. i loved gump and shawshank redemption but i also loved pulp fiction and if it would have won best picture that year i would have been just as happy. pulp fiction is one of the best films ever made and it will be remembered into the new millennium and my bet is that when film people are talking about the best films of the last 200 years ( when it is about to turn 2100 ) pulp fiction is going to be one of them mentioned. when you can have christopher walken talk with a straight face about hiding a watch in a place that was not meant to store medal, have amanda plummer and tim roth talk seriously about robbing a restaurant, have travolta and jackson talk about walking the earth like kane in kung fu, have eric stoltz shout at his wife to find his little black medical book before he gives a shot to an o.d-ing uma thurman, have harvey keitel appear in a full tuxedo at 8:00 am and then appear on the scene to ""solve problems"" have tarantino appear himself as a guy that knows the difference between gourmet coffee and the crappy stuff his wife buys, have bruce willis decide what weapon he is going to use to stop the bad guys, have ving rhames talk about having a guy pop out of a bowl of rice and ""pop a cap"" in someone's ass if he shows up in indo-china and have it all make sense, well you have something special. pulp fiction isn't a movie, it is an experience, it is a gift to true film fans. this may not be for everyone as some people forget this is a film and they think it is a documentary on life and they get offended because it is not about love and honesty and morals and all that other crap that exists in some hollywood films. this is a film that takes all that you have ever known about film and bludgeons it to death with a pen and paper. it redefines what is acceptable and what is off beat and all it asks you to do is enjoy this film for 2 and a half hours. i did, immensely, and i think most people will, and have. if you really have not seen this, then you are robbing yourself of one of the best cinematic experiences in the history of film. this is easily one of the best films ever made. how anyone can disagree is beyond my understanding and i can't see how you can truly call yourself a film fan if you can't see the brilliance of this film.";15 November 1999;10;['great', 'few', 'singular', 'tombstone', 'other', 'marcellus', 'great', 'facial', 'powerful', 'cool', 'malicious', 'expensive', 'perfect', 'ruthless', 'next', 'nice', 'bad', 'dead', 'dripping', 'such', 'worried', 'shortass', 'agonizing', 'fair', 'thankful', 'butch', 'gone', 'favourite', 'intelligent', 'original', 'daily', 'other', 'tarantino', 'smart', 'well', 'humble', 'enough', 'old', 'true', 'original', 'original', 'great', 'other', 'about', 'other', 'great', 'tasty', 'extreme', 'simple', 'definitive', 'different', 'strange', 'good', 'oral', 'cool', 'tarantino', 'rich', 'forr', 'most', 'good', 'good', 'happy', 'good', 'new', 'good', 'last', 'about', 'walken', 'straight', 'little', 'black', 'medical', 'full', 'crappy', 'bad', 'special', 'true', 'other', 'acceptable', 'most', 'good', 'cinematic', 'good'];0.2187055176461956
153;classicalsteve;"toward the beginning of the film, bruce willis' face appears inside the sleaziest of bars in the san fernando valley. but instead of the self-confident and wise-cracking characters he played in ""moonlighting"" and ""die hard"", he dons a very different mask. we notice willis is not speaking but listening. listening to a voice of authority, played by a lesser-known actor, ving rhames as some kind of underworld kingpin. and then we understand. willis is listening to a superior. willis nods and speaks very little; he is subservient to this voice, and the willis we have come to know is no longer willis but a pawn in a much larger game in which he does not wield much power. this is one of my favorite scenes with willis, showing his range as an actor and being able to descend from higher stardom into the lower depths of humility. we learn that willis is being paid off for some kind of act. the envelope containing the payoff money is presented by the kingpin, whose face is yet unseen. just as he is about to hand the goods over, he immediately jerks it back. willis does not try to grab the payment but sits patiently waiting for the superior to hand him the goods. willis knows he cannot have the payment until the superior is ready and willing to give it to him. the gesture is a symbolic reminder of who is really in power, and it's not willis. willis' humble scene captures well the flavor of the entire film called ""pulp fiction"", a masterpiece of sub-culture drama but definitely not for all tastes. characters and story are all spontaneous. these people live on the edge on the darker periphery of american reality. instead of going to football matches, they kill people in sporting events. instead of having drinks at the hilton, they overdose on intense psychedelics. and if they aren't careful, they may end up either on the business end of some hit man's .45 or in a remote dungeon where people are into s & m. this is certainly not for those whose favorite movie is ""the sound of music"" and their favorite music is sung by doris day. samuel jackson and john travolta play two hit men in service to the kingpin underworld lord. but they never discuss their missions. instead they banter about all kinds of irrelevant subjects, like the names for american burgers on the menu in paris. this chit-chat is a breath of fresh air, and probably a lot more realistic, than other films in which characters are discussing ""the plot"" ad infinitum. the hit men's stories intersect with another plot line involving bruce willis, a boxer who is on the take from the same underworld lord to throw a fight. but these are just the bare bones. throughout the film, the hit men, the boxer and the kingpin weave an intricate tapestry of plots and subplots told in a non-linear style. part of the beauty of pulp fiction that ranks it one of the most innovative of films is that it collates as a movie puzzle. events occur out of sequence rather than told in a straight linear fashion. scenes happen in the middle of the film that are the end of the story. the first and last scenes of the whole film, which are in my opinion the best, are the middle of the story, not the end. and yet the events of the last half of the first scene are not shown until the very end which turns out to be the last scene of the movie, but not the last scene of the story. prior to pulp fiction, i don't know if there existed any american movies daring enough to pull such cinematic misdirection and make it work. some european filmmakers may have done this, but rarely such an innovative structure has occurred in american feature films. and yet, tarantino makes it work, and you understand by film's end how all the pieces fit together. the collation is similar to tarantino's first production, reservoir dogs, but he takes those innovations to the next degree. because of the subject matter, not everyone will be able to enjoy pulp fiction. but i think that's a mark of a great film, which is ironically what hollywood studio executives try to avoid. hollywood wants everyone to like a film, not just some people. but the price paid for this curtailing to everyone's tastes is a marked lack of visionary works. luckily, someone saw the value of ""pulp fiction"" and gave it the funding to allow it to happen. the result is one of the most tantalizing of cinematic experiences but not the kind of movie you'll give your grandmother.";26 September 2010;10;['sleazy', 'confident', 'different', 'superior', 'subservient', 'large', 'much', 'favorite', 'able', 'high', 'low', 'unseen', 'about', 'superior', 'ready', 'willing', 'symbolic', 'humble', 'entire', 'sub', 'culture', 'spontaneous', 'dark', 'american', 'intense', 'careful', 'hit', 'remote', 'favorite', 'favorite', 'kingpin', 'irrelevant', 'american', 'fresh', 'realistic', 'other', 'hit', 'intersect', 'same', 'bare', 'intricate', 'non', 'linear', 'innovative', 'straight', 'linear', 'first', 'last', 'whole', 'good', 'last', 'first', 'very', 'last', 'last', 'american', 'such', 'cinematic', 'european', 'innovative', 'american', 'similar', 'first', 'reservoir', 'next', 'subject', 'able', 'great', 'marked', 'cinematic'];0.1721016483516483

155;mattymatt4ever;"i just bought the ""pulp fiction"" collector's edition dvd boxed set, and i was glad i did. not only does it include this great movie, but it also contains an interview with quentin tarantino on the ""charlie rose"" show, an interview with him and michael moore at the independent spirit awards and even a trivia track. it would've been way cool if it included director's or actors' commentary, but i still felt it was worth my money--especially since i got it for a good price at $19.99. anyways, back to the movie. this is an inspired, truly original work of art that doesn't appear like the traditional work of art. this can be considered an art film, but it's not an art film that bores you with pretention after pretention and has almost no momentum to keep it going. this film has plenty of momentum. even at 2 hours and 30 minutes, i had trouble hitting the ""pause"" button. first of all, the cast is topnotch. as many know, this is the film that re-launched john travolta's career. and that's great, being that he's one hell of an actor, and this is one of his best performances--the ultra-cool vincent vega. ironically enough, he was only paid about 10,000 dollars (give or take) for this movie, being that it was shot on a modest budget--though it rarely shows. and now he's a multi-millionaire. i think travolta owes more than a ""thank you"" to mr. tarantino. samuel l. jackson is also terrific as the ultra-hip jules winnfield. he has some of the best lines, which i will get to later. bruce willis gives one of his best performances, showing that as well as a great movie star he's also a terrific actor. tim roth and amanda plummer are great in the opening and closing scenes, though i wish their accents could've been a tad less thick. harvey keitel makes a moderately short but memorable appearance. ving rhames is thoroughly convincing as the terrifyingly evil marscellus wallace. eric stoltz and rosanna arquette have some funny moments as travolta's drug-dealing buddies. and uma thurman--though not a very beautiful actress--is perfect as the free-spirited, coke-snorting mia wallace. my favorite element of this movie? (and i'm sure i'm not alone on this one) the dialogue, of course! ""pulp fiction"" has some of the most memorable dialogue in movie history. tarantino has an incredible knack for writing dialogue, as shown before in movies like ""reservoir dogs,"" ""true romance"" and ""from dusk till dawn."" after watching this movie twice (since purachasing the dvd), there are some lines i simply cannot shake out my head. these are some of my favorite quotes: ""my name is pitt, and yo a*s ain't talkin' your way out of this s**t."" ""does he look like a b**ch? i said, 'does he look like a b**ch!'"" (after the cab driver asks butch--bruce willis--what his name means) ""this is america. our names don't mean s**t."" ""pulp fiction"" is the perfect balance of dark comedy, crime drama, romance and action. it's a wild, perfectly enjoyable ride that you will never forget. ok, so this movie does go into the love-it-or-hate-it category. i personally love the movie, but there is the minority that don't think too much of ""pf."" whenever you have a movie that's 2 hours and 30 minutes long, packed with dialogue, packed with profanity and doesn't bombard its audience with gratuitous visuals, you can't expect everybody to embrace it with open arms. in a short while, i've fell in love with tarantino's unique, realistic and profane writing/directorial style. others can't quite handle it. i still don't understand the whole violence issue. in the average movie, you see about 20 guys getting blown away with machine guns all within a 3-minute scene. most of the violence here is left to the imagination. well, i guess people have a strong imagination. my only criticisms are a few slow moments and one cheesy attempt at rear-screen projection (during the bruce willis cab scene) in which the cab is obviously not moving and you see black-and-white footage (probably from an old movie) in the background. but i still consider this a great movie, and one i'm proud to include in my dvd collection. i can't wait 'til the special edition of ""reservoir dogs"" comes out this week, so can buy it and the ""jackie brown"" dvd to complete my tarantino collection. and is the soundtrack great or what! i actually bought the soundtrack before i bought the movie, and i fell in love with the music just as much. it includes such greats as al green's ""let's stay together"" and ""jungle boogie."" and who can forget that great ""pulp fiction"" theme? it was interesting to find out that the song wasn't composed specifically for this movie, and that it did actually exist beforehand. my score: 9 (out of 10)";25 August 2002;9;['glad', 'great', 'independent', 'trivia', 'cool', 'worth', 'good', 'inspired', 'original', 'traditional', 'pause', 'many', 'great', 'good', 'ultra', 'cool', 'modest', 'multi', 'more', 'terrific', 'ultra', 'hip', 'good', 'good', 'great', 'terrific', 'great', 'thick', 'short', 'memorable', 'convincing', 'evil', 'marscellus', 'funny', 'beautiful', 'perfect', 'free', 'spirited', 'favorite', 'sure', 'alone', 'memorable', 'incredible', 'reservoir', 'true', 'favorite', 'perfect', 'dark', 'wild', 'enjoyable', 'much', 'long', 'gratuitous', 'open', 'short', 'unique', 'realistic', 'profane', 'directorial', 'whole', 'average', 'most', 'strong', 'only', 'few', 'slow', 'black', 'white', 'old', 'great', 'proud', 'special', 'reservoir', 'tarantino', 'great', 'such', 'great', 'interesting'];0.330801209372638
156;marcin_kukuczka;"action films have become popular in the last few decades of cinema history. while among a considerable number of audience, these movies play a decisive role of entertainment, there are also people who claim that they are not very innovative due to the constant themes built upon murder and sex. therefore, if you see pulp fiction without much insight, you will surely have this impression: it is a movie of no linear content, so much filled with decadent aspects of murder, vulgarity, crimes, drug abuse and sex. however, having seen pulp fiction in a more detailed way, you strangely realize that this movie is unique, stands on its own; in other words, you begin to realize that it is quite something. since so many people have already discussed the content, it would be useless to analyze it now. i'd like to concentrate rather on something more extravagant and courageous for the reviewer: the intentions of the director and all the staff. these different but deadly vivid stories which strangely link the main characters together and which finally change the lives of some do not appear to be something extraordinary, moralistic, overwhelming and exceptionally convincing. they are simply a depiction of criminal life in american metropolis. this is life, not its ideal, its model but real life filled rather with decadence than virtue! the characters seem to follow the advice that marsellus wallace (ving rhames) gives once to the boxer named butch (bruce willis) ""f*** ambition"" and fill their days with crimes, sex, and drugs. yet, the very core of those events is a single moment affecting the future, affecting the mind, the universe of a reality. in this respect, the whole movie is a ""mosaic"" fiction of these single moments that seriously influence not only the events depicted but also the viewer's psyche, the viewer's thoughts. thanks to obscene script and lurid stories but good performances, we are all led to the specific world of pulp fiction. the viewer is intensely with butch (bruce willis) in his ""gold watch"" sequence as well as with vincent vega (john travolta) when he meets mia (uma thurman) at jack rabbit slims'. you may not agree with these fictitious decadent worlds, yet you have to accept them, absorb them, you have to shout ""i do not care for the rest"" when you decide to see pulp fiction ... that is a particular power of the movie, something many other films of the genre are short of. if you ask me what moments i liked, i'll tell you something pretty unconventional but true: ""ignore your perception of film for the time you watch this one!"" it's an entirely different movie called by some ""a movie of the mob."" it is tarantino where you either love his moments or despise them. the ""gold watch"" story is terrific when a boxer becomes so much absorbed by the watch he got from his father. can you imagine that value of historic gift the father gave to his son? he kept it even in the most ""taboo"" parts of his body. butch-fabienne moments are wonderfully hilarious and nicely sensual. i also liked mia-vincent meeting and her words about silence at the table. the final scene is very good, too. is it a renewed shepherd? perhaps an odd one but appealing one? what a look at god and faith! however, it seems crucial to state that pulp fiction by quentin tarantino also has its serious dangers (perhaps it is even too leniently said). this is a movie where exaggeration and the lack of good taste are really present. for instance, the rape on marsellus wallace is a very disturbing moment. i also detested mia's overdose and injection that she gets in the house of vincent's drug dealing friend. besides, i highly criticize the sequence ""the bonnie situation"" with the plot of one body - no head and the characters clean the blood flooded car from the parts of brain. this is tarantino, you may justify. however, i am certain that there are lots of people who will rather concentrate on this facet expressing a strong criticism and no one, even people who consider pulp fiction a masterpiece, cannot ignore that opposite viewpoint - the movie is filled with graphic violence. but of course, when watching pulp fiction, you cannot skip one thing, certainly: the special mood so characteristic of tarantino. it is something which, as i have mentioned before, many detest, but which allows you, as a viewer, to experience the movie, to watch it memorably even though it is filled with so much violence and disturbing visuals. although tarantino got worse in years, this is purely the very best example of his ""unspoiled"" individual vision. i'm not his fan but this aspect quite impressed me in pulp fiction - to be able to invite a viewer to something pretty personal, powerful, and thought provoking. as disgusting as a murder for some, as pleasant as a foot massage for others... a movie on its own though a film like many others but, at the same time, a movie like no other: that's, i think, what best defines pulp fiction with its strong and weak points";15 June 2008;7;['popular', 'last', 'few', 'considerable', 'decisive', 'innovative', 'constant', 'much', 'linear', 'decadent', 'detailed', 'unique', 'own', 'other', 'many', 'useless', 'extravagant', 'courageous', 'different', 'deadly', 'vivid', 'main', 'extraordinary', 'moralistic', 'overwhelming', 'convincing', 'criminal', 'american', 'real', 'very', 'single', 'whole', 'mosaic', 'single', 'obscene', 'good', 'specific', 'gold', 'fictitious', 'decadent', 'particular', 'many', 'other', 'short', 'unconventional', 'true', 'different', 'tarantino', 'terrific', 'historic', 'taboo', 'hilarious', 'sensual', 'final', 'good', 'odd', 'crucial', 'serious', 'good', 'present', 'marsellus', 'disturbing', 'tarantino', 'certain', 'strong', 'opposite', 'graphic', 'special', 'characteristic', 'many', 'det', 'much', 'disturbing', 'bad', 'good', 'unspoiled', 'individual', 'able', 'personal', 'powerful', 'disgusting', 'pleasant', 'own', 'many', 'same', 'other', 'good', 'strong', 'weak'];0.1425324675324675

162;Stampsfightclub;two hit men are caught up in a life of religion and tv whilst their big time boss marcellus wallace (ving rhames) has trouble with his trusted boxer. almost 16 years old and quentin tarantino's hard hitting crime drama is still a fresh reminder of how to tackle a hard hitting crime picture. technical ingenuity has moved on obviously since the nineties, only looking at other crime pictures such as sin city shows how green screen and star power can produce results and yet here, a quickly shot low budget cult production has grossed millions and still tops numerous polls and it is down to its script and director and great collaboration of actors for doing so. tarantino, better known then for his scripting for films such as true romance and natural born killers then, exploded into the film industry with this picture that glorifies violence, promotes hard drug use and defies bible connotations, and all the while being somehow light hearted and consistently original. the opening contemplation of restaurant robbery is certainly an idea never covered in any film i've ever seen and after a memorable credit sequence with fast rhythm we see the two main stars chatting on their way to a confrontation. john travolta and samuel jackson make a true great pair of hit men who are simply chilling and talking about burgers and tv pilot shows and the eventual emergence of what they are about to do evaporates on the screen. jackson's bible speech and his converse with the group of guys is brilliant scene stealing bravery and power. when the cannons of the gun are unloaded the film literally explodes in an array of flinching violence and directional mastery from tarantino and when we remerge at this story later on from the film, the subject of violence gets a thorough working. when studying media a few years ago this was often a big reference to the emergence of on screen violence. looking at it now 16 years from release it is perhaps soft-core contrasted to many modern horror flicks and the odd crime film with tarantino developing into more apparent bloodshed, especially in kill bill. but whilst we have uncomfortable drug overdoses and brutal target practice the film does not sidetrack its way from delivering a story with real life purpose and intelligence. with a good soundtrack and useful collaboration of artistic shots, especially travolta after shooting up in the car, this has tarantino on artistic but down to earth. the little things make the big memory. the scene in the restaurant when travolta and thurman are conversing about comfortable silences and milkshakes, the hidden agenda of store workers in willis' story, and that initial story of restaurant robbery all collate in a way that is energetic, funny and powerful meaning. whilst many say tarantino continues to improve, i maintain this is his most original and quotable film that will simply never age and be continued to be enjoyed for many years.;24 February 2010;9;['big', 'marcellus', 'trusted', 'old', 'fresh', 'technical', 'other', 'such', 'green', 'low', 'numerous', 'great', 'tarantino', 'such', 'true', 'natural', 'hard', 'bible', 'light', 'hearted', 'original', 'memorable', 'fast', 'main', 'true', 'great', 'chilling', 'eventual', 'about', 'bible', 'brilliant', 'directional', 'tarantino', 'thorough', 'few', 'big', 'soft', 'many', 'modern', 'odd', 'tarantino', 'apparent', 'uncomfortable', 'brutal', 'real', 'good', 'useful', 'artistic', 'tarantino', 'artistic', 'little', 'big', 'comfortable', 'initial', 'energetic', 'funny', 'powerful', 'many', 'original', 'quotable', 'many'];0.1725543478260869

166;krorie;"most movies, like most novels and musical compositions, have a beginning, a middle, and an end. but a gifted, creative director/writer such as quentin tarantino can convolute time and come out with a new kind of animal. and look what james joyce and the stream of consciousness writers such as william faulkner did with time in their works. another great movie ""momentum"" did it all backwards, starting at the end and ending at the beginning and it worked like magic. when i first rented ""pulp fiction"" when it was first released on vhs i watched it late at night and fell asleep right after the jack rabbit slim sequence. when i awoke the story was back on the hit scene with vincent and jules still talking about quarter pounders and big macs. i thought the tape had rewound itself and so turned off the player. i didn't finish the movie until a few months later. then i realized tarantino was merely playing with time. in lesser hands ""pulp fiction"" would be too episodic, but tarantino makes it all work. in the end we have a happy closing knowing that tragedy lies ahead because we have already seen that part in the middle. vincent and jules have to be the most garrulous hit men ever to appear in the cinema. they are debating the difference between oral sex and giving a lady a foot massage on their way to a kill. jules, the spiritually misguided soul, continues to rattle on until eventually told to shut up when they arrive at the cleaners. with tarantino at the controls all this seems to fit in when the final play is made. this element could have easily degenerated into prattle. although there are many other levels of interpretation, i see this film as mainly a farce filled with dark humor and pathos, not just a farce on gangster movies in general but on our brave new world, centered on urban decay, corruption, exploitation, and perversion, filled with raw sex, drugs, and violence. the relationship between butch and his woman points to another direction of love, compassion, and fulfillment. note also that butch goes back to help the man who was out to kill him because his morals wouldn't let him leave marsellus to the rapists just as they wouldn't let him throw a fight. the watch is symbolic of eternal values that rise above the glitter and garishness of the ephemeral. going back for the watch could have cost butch his life but it and the values it represents were more important to him. in the end these values win out. even vincent has moments of compassion and tenderness, especially when with mia. jules almost goes full circle, but the viewer is left with a feeling that he is not totally sincere in his awakening following his brief encounter with death. butch and his woman seem to be the only two who are able to get completely free from sin city. each decade has movies that define the era. think of ""rebel without a cause"" for the 1950's or ""casablanca"" for the 1940's. for me ""pulp fiction"" defines the 90's. all the things that were wrong for america are touched on by tarantino, yet he provides the means of escape to what america should be. the world of the 90's was almost like a cheap book, or a book of pulp fiction as such a work was called once upon a time, showing the underbelly of urban life but with a way out. there is an exit. sartre's ""no exit"" doesn't work here. redemption is possible, hopefully a more lasting redemption than the one jules claims to have discovered. all he really has is a suitcase with contents that glitter when opened. butch has the watch with eternal values. tarantino wisely uses surf music from the 60's to highlight the gritty life of beach bums, now street bums, who think of themselves as warlords and urban supermen...but, hey, it's all pulp fiction in the end.";26 November 2005;10;['most', 'most', 'musical', 'middle', 'gifted', 'creative', 'such', 'new', 'such', 'great', 'hit', 'big', 'few', 'less', 'episodic', 'tarantino', 'happy', 'garrulous', 'oral', 'misguided', 'final', 'many', 'other', 'dark', 'general', 'brave', 'new', 'urban', 'raw', 'symbolic', 'eternal', 'important', 'full', 'sincere', 'brief', 'only', 'able', 'free', 'rebel', 'wrong', 'tarantino', 'cheap', 'urban', 'possible', 'lasting', 'eternal', 'tarantino', 'gritty', 'urban'];0.172980847980848

172;MihaiSorinToma;the lives of several characters with a different background intersect in four separate stories, told in an unique way. it's a type of movie you don't encounter often, judging by the cast that it has, the dialog it features and even the way it presents its action. it's a movie which presents its plot in a very unusual way (separating it into 4 different but somehow related sequences), in a very explicit way, both dialogue and action, with some highly experienced and very expressive actors which simply shine, creating an one of a kind atmosphere which makes you feel like you're part of the action, keeping you entertained and even amused like myself throughout its whole length. i acknowledge the quality of this movie, but, and this is a huge but, i simply do not understand the overall hype which surrounds it, the huge mass of fans and lovers of it and thus, the final rating it has overall. as i said before, i know it is a quality product, but i also have to say that from my point of view, it is very much over-appreciated. the plot itself is quite disappointing, presenting a series of events which ultimately intertwine but which do not carry a high level of interest, meaning or even depth. to be frank, the plot is quite lame. what makes it apparently shine are the actors which do a flawless job, but by itself, it's a mediocre set of stories. furthermore, the satisfaction it gives throughout and even in the end is quite below average i must say. it indeed kept me entertained and made me laugh quite a lot, but this is not enough to make it a masterpiece as almost everybody say it is. if you put it into another perspective, it's just a movie full of violence an foul language which actually gives more f words than transmitting something deep through its plot. it is without doubt a good movie, but its level of fame and acclaim by the audience simply puzzles me.;25 March 2017;8;['several', 'different', 'intersect', 'separate', 'unique', 'unusual', 'different', 'related', 'explicit', 'experienced', 'expressive', 'kind', 'entertained', 'whole', 'huge', 'overall', 'huge', 'final', 'disappointing', 'high', 'frank', 'lame', 'flawless', 'mediocre', 'average', 'enough', 'full', 'foul', 'more', 'good'];0.1972916666666666
173;TheNorthernMonkee;"spoilers if a survey was to be carried out, of people's favourite directors, the odds are the list will include steven spielberg, woody allen, bob zemeckis, alfred hitchcock, peter jackson, ron howard and francis ford coppola. if the survey was to be changed however so that people were asked to name the director they considered to define ""cool"", there's little doubt that quentin tarantino would be nominated for nine times out of ten. after working for a few years in a video store, tarantino would go on to create some amazing films. writing and directing ""reservoir dogs"" (1992), ""jackie brown"" (1997) and the ""kill bill"" films (2003 and 2004), tarantino would become viewed as the ultimate film style guru. whilst personally, his top film is the previously mentioned ""reservoir dogs"" however, to the majority of the world, his ultimate film is his 1994, oscar nominated, ""pulp fiction"". tarantino's ""pulp fiction"" tells a web of stories revolving two hit men (john travolta and samuel l jackson), their boss marsellus wallace (ving rhames) and their gangland associates. showing this combination of stories in a different order to their chronological order, the film shows us the highs and lows as we experience a couple of days in their lives. the beauty of ""pulp fiction"" is simply this idea of it's order. whilst most films are obviously designed to run in one straight story, an order where a character dies and that is the end of the actor's participation, ""pulp fiction"" works against the grain because the stories are connected in different ways to each other. we are shown conclusions to stories before the whole events play out (travolta's outcome for example), and we are shown events from different points of view (travolta and jackson talking on one side of a restaurant whilst tim roth and amanda plummer plan their robbery across the room). this sense, almost of dramatic irony, is superb because at times we feel this awareness at events whilst at others we try to explain to ourselves why certain background surroundings happen as they do. the film, in effect, leaves us guessing until the end conclusion. tarantino's films are always amazing because they are just so well written. in the opening scenes to ""reservoir dogs"", tarantino manages to get practically the entire films characterisation resolved through two brief arguments about madonna and about tipping. by doing this, he gets us to know the characters before the plot even begins. in ""pulp fiction"" he repeats this process to a lesser effect with a random conversation between travolta and jackson. at the beginning of the film, these two are travelling to a job and as they go they discuss europe and the metric system. we learn about the characters whilst we listen to this amusing, if random, story of the french equivalent to the quarter pounder burger. finally, the other thing worth saying about ""pulp fiction"" is the way tarantino manages to get such good acting performances. whilst in ""reservoir dogs"" tarantino gets superb performances out of buscemi, keitel, roth and madsen, in ""pulp fiction"", he manages the impossible act of rescuing john travolta's career. in the build up to tarantino's film, travolta's career has practically disappeared into weak films about talking children. all this changes however when tarantino hires him to play vincent vega. putting a strong element of charisma and scepticism into vega, travolta puts in a career high performance and even receives an oscar nomination for his trouble. the film over all would receive seven nominations in the 1995 academy awards, but put against some tough competition (oscar friendly ""forrest gump"" and the amazing ""shawshank redemption""), the film comes away with only the one oscar for the script. if the oscar for director was given to the wrong man, there's little doubt that travolta was worthy of the award which would end up in the hands of tom hanks. travolta isn't alone however in the superb performances. gathering a jaw dropping cast, tarantino gets outstanding performances from fellow oscar nominees in the form of uma thurman and samuel l jackson, as well as rhames, bruce willis, harvey keitel and tim roth. basically ""pulp fiction"" is a jaw dropping movie. whilst on a personal note, tarantino did a slightly better job on ""reservoir dogs"" (1992), any sort of major comparison between the two would be harsh. both fiction and dogs deserve to be up there in a list of the all-time greats. if you've never seen either film, then you should make the time. tarantino is a legend and in ""pulp fiction"" he has created a beauty.";8 September 2004;10;['favourite', 'alfred', 'cool', 'little', 'few', 'amazing', 'reservoir',

185;jdkraus;"people that i know call ""pulp fiction"" unique but one of the best movies ever made. i've only see two films by quentin tarantino, and they were both of the kill bills. i liked both movies as the ""popcorn loving"" action and dark comedy junkie that i am. so i expected something along that line for ""pulp fiction"". it is far from it. the best way i can describe this film is a non-chronological list of stories combined together with roller-coaster circumstances. yes, there is some action. and yes, there is a lot of wicked humor. but what held my attention was the brilliant script by quentin tarantino (who won the oscar for it in 1994). even more so, the all-star cast flourished it with some stunning performances. john travolta shed a whole new light on his acting ability as the cynical hit man, vincent vegas. bruce willis as the boxer, butch is in a sense a protagonist, but also a man determined to do whatever it takes to get what he wants, even if it means killing. uma thurman is simply marvelous as the amusing drug addict mia. also included is: ving rhames, christopher walken, and harvey keitel are all nice additions to the film. of all the performances, i found samuel l. jackson's to be the best. i always remember samuel l. jackson as zeus in die hard 3, but as jules in pulp fiction, he is larger than life. he's cool and funny, but also philosophical and the only character that changes his values towards the end of the film. he was snubbed at the oscars. i was so captivated by the film that i did not even bother to realize that the movie was over two and a half hours. i can't help but say this is a great film. it is not my favorite, but i will agree that this should stay on the top ten at imdb's top 250. 10/10";14 May 2008;10;['unique', 'good', 'dark', 'good', 'non', 'chronological', 'wicked', 'brilliant', 'stunning', 'whole', 'new', 'cynical', 'determined', 'marvelous', 'amusing', 'nice', 'good', 'large', 'cool', 'funny', 'philosophical', 'only', 'great', 'favorite', 'top', 'top'];0.381549971767363

188;tomimt;quentin tarantion's pulp fiction is a movie containing several stories which cross each other in one point or another. vincent vega (john travolta in his comeback role) is an assassin, who has just returned from europe. he and his associate jules (always wonderful samuel l. jackson) are doing a gig for their boss marsellus (ving rhames). they gotta get back a briefcase, containing something precious. mia (uma thurman)is a girlfriend of marsellus, who is trusted in the care of vincent in her night out. butch (bruce wills perhaps in one of his best roles) is an aging prize fighter, who has to make his one, last big fight. and honey bunny (amanda plummer) and pumpkin (tim roth) are just two petty robbers, who are about to rob a cafe. all these stories cut each other in someplace of the film, so it all isn't as random as it might sound like. dialogue is the key to this film: tarantino has managed to write conversations about such common thing as giving someone a foot rub, making it interesting and full of views you wouldn't normally think of. but there is more than just dialogue: there's action and some drama and situations, which are so surprising and sudden that you just don't see them coming until they hit you in the face. this all is perfected with good direction and great musical choices. and before i end this rant, i wanted to share my favourite moment with you: captain koons (christopher walken) gives butch his family heirloom, left him by his father, who was, and died, in the same vietcong prison camp koons was. top notch film.;21 May 2005;9;['several', 'other', 'associate', 'wonderful', 'precious', 'good', 'last', 'big', 'petty', 'about', 'other', 'random', 'such', 'common', 'interesting', 'full', 'more', 'surprising', 'sudden', 'good', 'great', 'musical', 'favourite', 'same', 'top', 'notch'];0.2476190476190476

191;elicopperman;"quentin tarantino remains as one of the most unique modern filmmakers. the films he's directed are known for their nonlinear storylines, satirical subject matter, overabundance of violence, punchy dialogue, pop culture references and songs from the 60s to the 80s. so in order to find the one that embraces it all, look no further than his most beloved feature, pulp fiction. made as a tribute to film-noir comics and pulp magazines, the film won the palme d'or at the cannes film festival the same year it was released. with that said, many consider this to be tarantino's magnum opus, and i definitely agree. the plot itself is divided into thee different segments that are told in non chronological order. the first one details mob hitmen vincent vega (john travolta) and jules winnfield (samuel l. jackson), whom share their own philosophical discussions with one another. their story is intertwined with their boss, marsellus wallace (ving rhames) and his actress wife, mia (uma thurman). the second one details struggling boxer butch coolidge (bruce willis) and his loved one fabienne (maria de medeiros). and the third one details vince and jules fixing a murder problem with master fixer winston wolfe (harvey keitel) and encountering an anxious robber couple, ""pumpkin"" (tim roth) and ""honey bunny"" (amanda plummer). with all of these storylines around, the film works based on what happens to each character. the mystery angle is played as each narrative comes afloat, making the viewing experience shockingly suspenseful. since this film is well known for the character interactions, it's no brainer that the dialogue is extensive, charismatic, snappy and heavily intriguing. each character has their own personal views on life and other subjects that make one ponder a lot, especially jules, as his arch becomes quite theoretical to the point of wanting him to make ease with himself. i think my personal favorite storyline revolves around butch, since the macguffin behind his tough guy persona is what ends up driving his arch forward the most. in addition to having such a bittersweet life waiting for him, all the crap that happens to the guy always has me worried about his well being. the funny thing is, we don't know what will ever happen to most of the characters. many of their arches just sort of conclude without a resolution, which appropriately displays the uncertainty of what will become of them to keep the audience wondering. there's no denying how much this film makes use of its relatively small budget, and it looks amazing. the usage of camera angles, fast paced editing, lighting and panning really help elevate the already unpredictable flow that the movie set in stone. the cinematography by andrzej sekula successfully recreates the gritty underground homage to the hardboiled crime novels that inspired the feature. not to mention, while there is no original score, the film makes heavy usage of the rock & roll and pop soundtrack that tarantino loves to showcase in his work. depending on the situation, any of the recordings are very crucial to the postmodern pizazz that the film established. several films have been built around already existing songs like the blues brothers and yellow submarine, and this film is no exception; it utilized them wonderfully through style and substance. even though reservoir dogs was tarantino's directorial debut, i think this film took what was good and bad about that feature and kicked it up to eleven. pulp fiction is a fantastically well crafted crime flick that took the genre to new heights that were never before achieved back then. many filmmakers have tried and failed to recreate the magic of this film's versatility, but of course, you can never truly recapture lighting in a bottle like that again. given that this year makes the feature's 25th anniversary, i think you should do yourself a favor and give it a watch if you're yet to see it yourself. it might surprise you for better or worse, but the shear experience of it will never leave your mind.";6 January 2019;10;['unique', 'modern', 'nonlinear', 'satirical', 'punchy', 'beloved', 'same', 'many', 'magnum', 'thee', 'different', 'non', 'chronological', 'first', 'own', 'philosophical', 'second', 'third', 'anxious', 'suspenseful', 'known', 'extensive', 'charismatic', 'snappy', 'intriguing', 'own', 'personal', 'other', 'theoretical', 'personal', 'favorite', 'tough', 'most', 'bittersweet', 'worried', 'funny', 'most', 'many', 'much', 'small', 'amazing', 'unpredictable', 'gritty', 'underground', 'hardboiled', 'original', 'heavy', 'crucial', 'postmodern', 'several', 'yellow', 'reservoir', 'directorial', 'good', 'bad', 'new', 'many', 'well', 'bad'];0.1382335257335257

195;Maniac-9;quentin tarantino has proven to be the best director since martin scorsese came on the scene in the 1970's. the movie stars some of today's biggest stars, e.g. john travolta, samuel l. jackson, bruce willis, uma thurman, and ving rhames. plus the absolutely hilarious and cool scene with christopher walken telling young butch the importance of a gold watch.;5 August 1998;10;['good', 'big', 'hilarious', 'cool', 'young', 'gold'];0.3299999999999999
196;movieguy1021;controversy is usually good for movies. it's helped push movies to box office success just to see how bad they actually were, and i think that that is one of the ways pulp fiction has become so immensely popular. i've heard multiple people musing about the excessive violence, the drug use, the language, and more. so i really wanted to see pulp fiction beforehand, but curiosity piqued my interest. i have to say that all of the hype didn't really add anything. it wasn't very violent (or it could be that i'm just desensitized to violence, but besides one scene, i've seen worse on tv), the language just seemed to flow normally (or maybe it was because i had seen bad santa the day before and it had about the same concentration of language), and the drug usewell, i expected it for it is a movie about drug abusers. pulp fiction is less a complete movie than a series of interrelated stories, the most interesting of which is jules winnfield (samuel l. jackson) and vincent vega (john travolta) as two gangsters who often have pointless conversations. butch coolidge (bruce willis) is a boxer who accidentally kills his opponent in the ring and then he realizes the thrill of killing people. marcellus wallace (ving rhames) pays butch to throw that fight, but when he kills the guy, marcellus gets jules and vincent to whack him. along the way, vincent has to take marcellus's wife mia (uma thurman) out, and along the way she od's. got all that? there is one thing that tarantino can do that no one else i've seen can do efficiently. he can work with time so well that you don't even notice it. christopher nolan first tried it in following, unsuccessfully, and then executed well in memento. however, there, he held our hand throw it, while tarantino just lets it rip and hopes we can figure it out for ourselves, which we can do. that adds to the already thick layer of coolness that is in pulp fiction. each character is memorable, especially jules, who quotes from the bible right before killing someone. it's just a very hip experience. pulp fiction cheerfully takes cliches, chews them up, and spits them out in a whole new vein. like what kill bill did in the beginning, with the retro opening to set the mood, pulp fiction is halfway between an homage to gangster films and parody. also, it's a trendsetter. the classic dance scene between vincent and mia at jack rabbit slim's (which is a parody of all of those stupid throwback restaurants) has been parodied itself, as has the scene where vincent and jules are talking about mcdonalds' quarter pounders. in addition to the layer of coolness, pulp fiction also has a lot of humor in it, much of it at times when you know you shouldn't laugh but you do, and also out of situations that you wouldn't laugh at usually. i'm sure some of the parts i laughed at were just because i wasn't expecting something to happen, or maybe i just have a morbid mind, but a lot of the humor came out of the violence. everyone in the cast had amazing chemistry with each other, which added believability to a somewhat unbelievable story. the only reason that pulp fiction did not get a perfect score is that one scene with butch and a cab driver went on for too long and did little to service the plot. knowing me, though, i'll soon change the rating, but it can still be said that pulp fiction is one of the most influential movies of the 1990's. my rating: 9/10 rated r for strong graphic violence and drug use, pervasive strong language and some sexuality.;2 December 2003;9;['good', 'bad', 'popular', 'multiple', 'excessive', 'more', 'violent', 'bad', 'bad', 'same', 'complete', 'interrelated', 'interesting', 'pointless', 'marcellus', 'tarantino', 'thick', 'memorable', 'bible', 'whole', 'new', 'classic', 'stupid', 'much', 'sure', 'amazing', 'other', 'unbelievable', 'only', 'perfect', 'long', 'little', 'influential', 'strong', 'graphic', 'pervasive', 'strong'];0.0419065656565656

203;dragokin;when pulp fiction hit the theaters it had an incredible word-of-mouth recommendation. and palme d'or cemented its reputation. bear in mind, it was before internet was relevant and watching movies online was possible. therefore it was a must see. and after the movie i was satisfied but also asked myself self: was that it? some years down the line i've seen more contemporary tv shows from the us and it became clear why pulp fiction stood apart. as the title suggest it is a pulp novel brought to screen, done brilliantly, if you accept there is an extraordinary way to do a below-average thing. why the critics saw a masterpiece in it is hard to explain, but it simply isn't. there were other things where pulp fiction excelled. for example, the soundtrack became an inevitable part of any cd collection at the end of the 20th century. the way i understood tarantino after watching some interviews, he is a movie buff and makes movies he always wanted to see. although not the only to try this approach, he is one of the lucky few that made a living out of it. overall, pulp fiction is an exercise in marketing. the title, as well as author's statements, suggest it is an entertaining movie. however, a lot of people read higher meaning into it, elevating it's reputation to being one of the best movies of all times.;25 August 2013;6;['incredible', 'relevant', 'possible', 'satisfied', 'more', 'contemporary', 'clear', 'extraordinary', 'hard', 'other', 'inevitable', 'only', 'lucky', 'few', 'entertaining', 'high', 'good'];0.2339215686274509
204;ronakkotian;it's crazy to think how i've never seen pulp fiction until a few days ago. it's crazy how it's one of the last tarantino movies i've seen and the fact that it still holds up is mindblowing. pulp fiction is a collection of four stories that interwine which include a boxer, two hitmen, a gangster and his wife and two bandits. the amazing part of pulp fiction is how brilliant each scene and each character is. each scene has iconic written all over it. i thought the film was going to be overly violent but that's not the case. it's just characters talking but it's the dialogues that make it so engaging. seeing john travolta and samuel l. jackson talk about cheeseburgers and foot massages for a couple of minutes make them feel like ordinary people rather than just hitmen. there is a feeling of realism between each character interaction. it's something moves steadily without losing momentum at any given point. then you have characters that only appear for a short amount of time like mr. wolf and they have such a huge and memorable impact on the film. if this isn't quentin tarantino's best screenplay, i don't know what is. another aspect that caught my attention was the excellent soundtrack. it's no surprise for a tarantino film to have great song choices and placements but there's something about the songs in pulp fiction that work so well with each scene they're embedded into. it's absolutely perfect. the film's narrative is very interesting as it goes back and forth with each chapter. each chapter, by the way, is fantastic. all of them are filled with terrific moments and iconic scenes that makes it difficult to lose interest. if that wasn't enough, the performances will surely win you over. it's great to see john travolta and bruce willis give stellar performances especially after seeing them in the films they're currently doing. samuel l. jackson has never been better and the rest of the extraordinary ensemble cast are at the top of their game. i love seeing filmmakers express their love for cinema within each of their films and tarantino has been consistently doing that, creating memorable movies his entire career. pulp fiction will remain his masterpiece for years to come. now that i think of it, it's no surprise how well pulp fiction holds up to this day. after all, it is a timeless classic.;4 July 2020;10;['crazy', 'few', 'crazy', 'last', 'tarantino', 'amazing', 'brilliant', 'violent', 'ordinary', 'short', 'huge', 'memorable', 'good', 'excellent', 'tarantino', 'great', 'perfect', 'interesting', 'fantastic', 'terrific', 'iconic', 'difficult', 'enough', 'great', 'stellar', 'well', 'extraordinary', 'ensemble', 'memorable', 'entire', 'timeless'];0.2397435897435897

209;departed07;"pulp fiction changed the way how movie buffs go to the movies; at first we had ""the godfather"" in which it dealt with how organized crime was run, then ""taxi driver"" which showed how people can never figure out what is wrong with an individual; in ""pulp fiction,"" what quentin tarantino manages to capture is how life itself is a comic book and how it affects everybody in life. the film's prologue begins with a dialog conversation between pumpkin(tim roth) and hunny bunny(amanda plummer) about robberies in various places: banks, liquor stores, gas stations, etc., except that nobody ever bothers robbing a restaurant for which they are insured and that customers carry a lot of cash. after the prologue, we are introduced to two different characters; jules winfeld (samuel l. jackson) and vincent vega (john travolta), who are hit men in search of a briefcase by their boss marcellus wallace (ving rhames) after being held hostage by a group of wanna-be gangsters that suffer the consequences after failing to answer questions by jules. the second part of the story is concentrated on john travolta's character vincent, as a heroin user, he buys drugs off his buddy lance(eric stoltz)and has to take the boss's wife mia wallace(uma thruman) out to dinner in which vincent is uncomfortable at first until mia forces her guest to dance with her, and that is when both characters become attracted to each other(not literary, but more like friends). after dinner, they both go back to mia's house where she is wearing vincent's coat and notices the heroin in his jacket and mistakes it for cocaine. now to get his boss's girlfriend alive, vincent seeks the help of lance in which he tells vincent to force a needle in her heart in order to stay alive. (i'll leave the next part for you to discover). the third story is the most weakest in my opinion, involving bruce willis's character butch coolidge, a boxer who made a bargain with marcellus that if he loses, he gets to leave with $100,000. unfortunately the plan backfires leaving butch and his girlfriend on the run from the gangsters; which makes it more possible since his girlfriend forgot the watch that his father used in the war. now with little time, butch goes back to his apartment to get the watch and escapes from peril and sees marcellus on the street. as butch is trying to escape, marcellus follows him into a pawn shop where they are capture by racist rednecks that have their fun with marcellus... i won't be giving out anymore clues to what happens, but let me assure the readers out there, pulp fiction is one hell of a ride. the film not only is a renascence towards bringing back actors such as john travolta, but it brought a new career out of samuel l. jackson, uma thruman, and the director himself, quentin tarantino. backed up with a great soundtrack, and numerous references to great movies, tv shows and the world, pulp fiction is a classic by my book.";22 June 2003;10;['organized', 'wrong', 'tarantino', 'comic', 'various', 'different', 'marcellus', 'second', 'uncomfortable', 'literary', 'alive', 'alive', 'next', 'third', 'weak', 'possible', 'little', 'racist', 'such', 'new', 'great', 'numerous', 'great'];0.0380980861244019

220;Al_The_Strange;"pulp: the word itself conveys a sense of roughness, grittiness, blood and gore, and some serious edge. pulp fiction refers to a type of literature printed on cheap wood pulp paper, often telling violent or offensive stories. the film pulp fiction recycles the style and content of the pulp magazines of old, to produce a fresh new series of bloody crime sagas. pulp fiction is very liberal with its violence - going so far as having good guys, bad guys, and innocent bystanders getting shot up without any legal consequences. the film is also very liberal with its bad language - there are f-bombs and sexual dialogue galore. parts of the film are pretty shocking. make no mistake, there is definitely a lot of pulp in pulp fiction. beneath its blood-soaked surface, the film can be surprisingly light and upbeat, thanks to its playfully witty dialogue and constant stream of ironic situations. it is a comedy at its core - not a comedy that ever makes me laugh out loud per se, but there are plenty of memorable and amusing lines throughout. above all, it's just funny the way things turn out in this film. seemingly unrelated characters run into each other, crazy stuff happens, and the outcome can be quite surprising at times. that being said, i've always felt this film has a pretty weird and random series of stories. it's a series of nested short stories - one story starts, then another, then another, then it goes back to the previous one, until finally connecting back to the scene in the film's opening. the narrative is purposefully mixed-up, jumping around a few different characters with their own situations, which ultimately connects to each other. each story is pretty interesting though: the bulk of the film focuses on a pair of hit men, who terrorize and murder some dudes to retrieve a mysterious briefcase. this story is ultimately interrupted by the next, in which one of the hit men takes the crime boss' wife out, and interesting occurrences take place (including some of the awesomest dancing ever). my favorite of the lot is the episode involving the golden watch, in which a boxer tries to flee from town to evade the boss' wrath, but has to go back to retrieve his father's pocket watch. crazy things ensue. the film's last stretch returns to the briefcase situation, in which even crazier things ensue, and the characters contemplate the greater meaning of everything that's happened. there is a method to the madness, and it works sublimely. with constant biblical references and quotes, the film digs up some subtle themes regarding life and morality. the entire film illustrates the futility of a life of crime; only a few characters escape unscathed, thanks to whatever redemption they manage to find for their wrongdoings, but most everybody else suffers a tragic end from their own wrongdoings. in the end, i felt this film underscored a strong message about living the good life, especially in the shadow of organized crime (which is effectively demonized). jules says it the best when he says, ""the truth is you're the weak. and i'm the tyranny of evil men. but i'm trying', ringo. i'm trying' real hard to be the shepherd."" this film uses pretty solid photography and interesting editing. i feel it captures the ambiance of the locales extremely well. acting is strong: john travolta, samuel l. jackson, bruce willis, and uma thurman are all striking in their respective roles. writing shows excellent wit, with its plethora of great lines and conversation, and great nuance, with its plotting and narrative. this production has very real-looking sets, props, and costumes. music is really hip too. pulp fiction is a pretty weird and violent animal of a film, but it seems to get better the more i see it. if you can stomach the pulp, then it's certainly a must-see. 4.5/5 (entertainment: good | story: very good | film: very good)";5 August 2013;9;['serious', 'cheap', 'violent', 'offensive', 'old', 'fresh', 'new', 'bloody', 'liberal', 'good', 'bad', 'innocent', 'legal', 'liberal', 'bad', 'sexual', 'shocking', 'light', 'upbeat', 'witty', 'constant', 'ironic', 'memorable', 'amusing', 'funny', 'unrelated', 'other', 'crazy', 'surprising', 'weird', 'random', 'short', 'previous', 'few', 'different', 'own', 'other', 'interesting', 'mysterious', 'next', 'hit', 'interesting', 'awesome', 'golden', 'crazy', 'last', 'crazy', 'great', 'constant', 'biblical', 'subtle', 'entire', 'few', 'unscathed', 'most', 'tragic', 'own', 'strong', 'good', 'good', 'weak', 'evil', 'solid', 'interesting', 'strong', 'respective', 'excellent', 'great', 'great', 'hip', 'weird', 'violent', 'well', 'good', 'good', 'good'];0.0991620752984389

226;lagudafuad;"this academy award winning screenplay was done by quentin tarantino, the story is nonlinear and the screenplay is rich and the movie is full of stars. tarantino's dream of making the movie look bigger than it actually is was achieved. made with 8.5 million dollars, the movie looked like it was made with more. the story arc although it curves around 3 main and distinctive people and 3 main distinctive stories, it still has a way of reeling you in and keeping you attentive without losing you along the way. meant to be a trilogy of three shorts, rather than a full length feature, it was first written by roger avary in the fall of 1990, while tarantino worked on the script development 2 years after, the movie was then picked up for production by columbia tristar, who later dropped the movie because they felt the movie was too long, out of place and it was too low budgeted, before the producer bender shipped it off to miramax. the movie is depicted in a nonlinear tale also the narrative is presented out of sequence it is about three main characters. we have first a mob hit-man vincent vega (john travolta) who was hired to kill butch coolidge (bruce willis). then we have a prizefighter butch coolidge, who double crossed a mobster by winning a bout that he took money for throwing. and the last main cast jules winnfield (samuel l. jackson) is vincent's partner who felt he has heard a calling from god to leave the hit-man life, when he was shot and the shooter misses. each story is interwoven and intersects at various parts; if well put together the movie makes one whole complete picture. before this, john travolta was losing his edge in his movies and willis was finding it hard to make a good movie after many big budget flops, after this flick they both got their edge back. for financing miramax (the films distributors) totally financed the film, and paid all the main actors the same per week wage regardless of their status. the movie was a huge financial success making over 200 million from its 8.5 million production and it was a good introduction to tarantino's film style of nonlinear story arc. pulp fiction is a nice addition to movies on your shelf; it won an academy award and a bafta award for best original screenplay for both quentin tarantino and roger avary. it also gave samuel l. jackson a bafta award for best supporting actor. www.lagsreviews.com";20 December 2012;8;['nonlinear', 'rich', 'full', 'big', 'more', 'main', 'distinctive', 'main', 'distinctive', 'full', 'long', 'nonlinear', 'main', 'last', 'main', 'shooter', 'interwoven', 'various', 'whole', 'complete', 'hard', 'good', 'many', 'big', 'main', 'same', 'huge', 'financial', 'good', 'nonlinear', 'nice', 'good', 'original', 'good'];0.2608024691358024

234;diac228;"read this loud and clear: pulp fiction will never ever happen again. the impact, the delivery, the timing, and the overall stamp it has placed in cinema history can never be duplicated. see, there are bad movies, good movies, great movies, and trailblazers. the trailblazers are films that jump-start a movement, revolutionize the industry, change the landscape of motion pictures, and delivers an impact whether immediate (star wars) or down the road (fight club) that never exits the general consensus. wizard of oz, 2001: a space odyssey, psycho, jaws, star wars, raiders of the lost ark, the graduate, and goodfellas are all examples of films that are trailblazers. none of these films have any contemporaries, they are their own category and all films of similar genres become compared to them. pulp fiction is a 90s indie trailblazer that absolutely altered the entire culture of movies by crafting what at the time was easily one of the most jarring, unexpected, stylish, and wholesome cinematic experiences ever witnessed. pulp fiction was a low-budget flick with such high aspirations that 1994 didn't know how to handle it. the soundtrack (among the best in film history), the unexpected blend of violence, drugs, and realistic dialogue, the surprises, the utter lack of chronological order, the style, the tone, and the overall look of pulp fiction made it stand out not just among the films of the 90s, but everything preceding it. it talks like a scorsese movie, moves like a 1950s italian neorealism flick, paces like a spaghetti western, and breathes like an underground comic book come to life. pulp fiction is tasty cinematic soup. pulp fiction knew it was cool before the viewer did. pulp fiction knew that its audience was going to put up with the 150 minutes of dialogue because the characters were so strong, the story lines were unique, and there were so many details (explained and unexplained) that it required multiple viewings to catch it all, and jump-started urban legends and mysteries that remain unsolved to this day. it was a movie that created its own culture and fanbase that would follow madman quinten tarantino for the entirety of his career---through the ""bad"" (death proof) and the good (django unchained). everything in this movie works. the cast was downright phenomenal and nearly miraculous considering the budget (bruce willis, samuel l. jackson, john travolta, and christopher walken in one movie??!!). the dialogue was sharp, witty, brutal, and breathes life into each character you see within the pulp-influenced saga. the directing by tarantino was practically flawless as he makes transforms the camera into a curious witness by mixing in a barrage of close-ups, long shots, and spastic movement that never feels like its framing a shot but more so just following the story along where ever the action was going. this movie literally has it all: sex, violence, drugs, rock n' roll, dancing, singing, crime, morality issues, romance, revenge, monologues, potential miracles, shootouts, dark humor, dozens of film references, and even a couple glimpses of the california underworld that most people would rather not know about. and all this was accomplished without a hollywood budget. there was a slight sense of amateurism that gave the movie an edge, like a black sheep in the meadows of the film industry. this would inspire an entire wave of budding, ambitious, and hopeful filmmakers that also had their stories to tell and didn't want to cater to the typical hollywood output or abide by its rules. pulp fiction is a b-movie setup executed like an underground masterpiece from the dialogue-heavy start to the sudden finish. you can't duplicate this. i couldn't duplicate this. tarantino could never duplicate this. pulp fiction is one of the greatest films ever made, and a perfect storm of innovative filmmaking that lifted 1994 into one of the best years of film that has ever existed---and launched an entire era of indie filmmaking that still has its effects on the industry today. pulp fiction is as absolutely cool as its gets.";25 September 2014;10;['loud', 'clear', 'overall', 'bad', 'good', 'great', 'immediate', 'general', 'own', 'similar', 'entire', 'jarring', 'unexpected', 'stylish', 'wholesome', 'cinematic', 'low', 'such', 'high', 'good', 'unexpected', 'realistic', 'utter', 'chronological', 'overall', 'scorsese', 'italian', 'spaghetti', 'western', 'underground', 'comic', 'tasty', 'cinematic', 'cool', 'strong', 'unique', 'many', 'unexplained', 'multiple', 'urban', 'unsolved', 'own', 'tarantino', 'bad', 'good', 'phenomenal', 'miraculous', 'sharp', 'witty', 'brutal', 'flawless', 'curious', 'close', 'long', 'spastic', 'potential', 'dark', 'most', 'slight', 'black', 'entire', 'ambitious', 'hopeful', 'typical', 'underground', 'heavy', 'sudden', 'tarantino', 'great', 'perfect', 'innovative', 'good', 'entire', 'cool'];0.1683898305084745

'pulp fiction' is tarantino's carnival of funny, but equally abrasive nihilism. this is a film which has a surprisingly firm backbone of morality beneath the crazy and deranged surface. tarantino is constantly on the lookout for characters who make a choice to turn their back on their meaningless lives of nihilistic violence and look for honour and a purpose. the characters who make that choice are allowed to ride off into the sunset, while the characters who decide to not change and stick to their meaningless cyclical lives of never-ending crime and violence are burdened with unenviable fates. there is a method to the madness. tarantino makes the film and the characters infinitely rich. however while doing all this, he never stops having fun. there are endless film references, pop culture references and other stuff that signifies the film's self- consciousness which constantly make the viewer feel the fact that they are watching a film, a piece of fiction through tarantino's eyes and not anything attached to reality. some people tend to trivialise the structure of the screenplay by calling it a gimmick. but as far as i'm concerned the structure of the screenplay is essential and indispensable in the context of the narrative and in the context of how tarantino wants to drive home the themes that he is exploring. in a nutshell........ yeah, 'pulp fiction' is a masterpiece, it's a bad mother#*%@er.;2 May 2017;10;['precise', 'perfect', 'precise', 'perfect', 'funny', 'abrasive', 'firm', 'crazy', 'tarantino', 'meaningless', 'nihilistic', 'meaningless', 'cyclical', 'unenviable', 'tarantino', 'rich', 'endless', 'other', 'concerned', 'essential', 'indispensable', 'bad'];0.0716666666666666

(i really ought to stop doing that!) even before i started college, i knew just how overrated it was. sure enough, i was right! this ""film"" has a convoluted and boring storyline, standard to terrible acting, and a dull soundtrack to attempt to tie this diarrhea stain together. the plot is about the lives of two mob hitmen, a boxer, a gangster, his wife, and also a pair of diner bandits whose stories are intertwined in four different narratives. yes, it's just as jumbled and confusing as it sounds. right off the bat, the storyline is way too complex. plus, to make matters worse, it's told out of chronological order. i suppose it wasn't confusing enough! that being said, there are a few different films out there that showcase it's storyline out-of-order that have been done a whole lot better than this ""movie"". a perfect example is, ""memento"" (2000). that one was told in a random fashion. however, as the movie progresses the big picture is gradually revealed and it makes sense. however, ""pulp fiction"" is essentially ""memento"" done wrong. since the story is told out-of-order, it amounts to nothing but confusion, too many plot threads and no morals. it's basically just a bunch of uninspired dialogue and violence without a message. look, i'm all for that. had it been told in sequential order, it may have been more on the right track. but, deciding to put it in random order just shot this ""film"" in the foot! some of the dialogue was so stupid, that it didn't even feel real. wow, i never thought i would say something like that about a movie! there's one scene where our main characters are discussing a big mac sandwich. why? it serves no purpose and it amounts to nothing. there are many scenes like that, but that one is probably the most unnecessary. to tell you the truth, that's the best word to describe this ""film""; unnecessary! i was not invested for one minute, nothing appealed to me, it wasn't entertaining, it was not coherent and it dragged on for way too long. film making 101: if you're going to write and produce a movie with an out-of-order plot, you better be sure you know what you're doing. you need to be an expert to craft such a complex story! as for the acting, it's just as mangled as the plot. here we have an all-star cast, and all of them went to waste. what a shame! the cast includes: john travolta, samuel l. jackson, uma therman, ving rhames, christopher walken, bruce willis and even more. when i saw the cast list, i was excited and thought: ""with all of this acting talent, they can't possibly screw it up!"" but somehow, they actually did. none of their performances could save this poorly written and conceived ""movie""! it's almost like they were told to forget that they were actors and just limp their way through, hopefully equating to a performance. no, you need effort, otherwise, you get lazy acting as a result of forced and tired film making decisions. the soundtrack is about as random as you can get. fun-fact: this is one of those few movies where there is no traditional film score. they use mainstream music for it. sometimes that can work, and sometimes it can't. granted, there are a few songs in this ""movie"" that i do like. but even then, they just sounded like they were added in at the last second haphazardly. now, let's get to the only two good elements in this pile of filth. the only good things are the sets/locations and the special effects. all of the sets/locations are great and give this ""film"" a decent atmosphere. as far as the special effects go, all of them are very well-done and still hold up today. they may get a little cheesy at times, but overall, they have aged very well.

241;EthanBJones_03;"'pulp fiction' - 1994 directed by quentin tarantino{reservoir dogs} starring john travolta{carrie; grease}, samuel l jackson{jurassic park; jungle feaver} and bruce willis{die hard; hudson hawk} plot overview: vincent vega (john travolta) and jules winnfield (samuel l. jackson) are hit men with a penchant for philosophical discussions. in this ultra-hip, multi-strand crime movie, their storyline is interwoven with those of their boss, gangster marsellus wallace (ving rhames) ; his actress wife, mia (uma thurman) ; struggling boxer butch coolidge (bruce willis) ; master fixer winston wolfe (harvey keitel) and a nervous pair of armed robbers, ""pumpkin"" (tim roth) and ""honey bunny"" (amanda plummer). i think that the best way for me to describe this movie is as follows: ""i don't know why that happened, but it did; and i like it"". because that is pretty much my reaction to everything in this movie. from the chitchat to the dance scene: very little in this movie makes sense contextually to the plot but i really like it in that weird way. there is no reason for half of what does happen to happen, but what does happen happens so what's the point in trying to complain? as far as my major praises go, it has to be to quentin tarantino. the man is a literal directing and stylistic god. his movies look so crisp and fantastic, and each of them have such a unique and interesting stylised look towards them. the way he frames shots is excellent; the editing is immaculate; the lighting is flawless: tarantino movies are some of the most stylish movies that have ever been made, and are a huge factor in the reason why pulp fiction is such a great movie. even though they are great directors, kubrick, hichock, spielberg, scorcese, fincher, coppola, welles - none of them could recreate the magic of pulp fiction, because tarantino is the only man alive capable of doing so. another major praise i can award the film is the sensational performances from all the cast. john travolta is excellent as vincent vega and really shows that the man is capable of doing 'actual films' *cough* battlefield earth, yeah i know it came out after pulp fiction - be quiet *cough*. accompanying travolta is my personal favourite performance in this film: samuel l jackson as jules. holy jesus was jackson amazing in this movie. he sells every single scene he is in and was easily one of the best parts of this movie. the sheer raw emotion that he elicits at points makes me think that it wasn't acting; it was genuine frustration and anger. also in this film is uma thurman{dangerous liaisons; mad dog and glory}. thurman was, surprise surprise, excellent in this movie. despite not having a huge role, she sold every scene she was in and consistently gave me goosebumps in the simple way her and travolta communicated. a man whom i did not know was in this movie was the great bruce willis. i knew that travolta and jackson and thurman were all in this movie so i already knew they had some solid actors and a good cast. but then willis showed up and i was blown away. we all know the man has impeccably action chops with the legendary film 'die hard', but up until now i hadn't really seen his dramatic capabilities. and let me tell you, he didn't disappoint. there are point in this movie were, similar to jackson, i didn't actually believe that willis was acting: merely existing. his performance was that authentic and realistic. a couple actors who had more minor roles but still did excellent jobs were ving rhames{the people under the stairs; dave}, harvey keitel{reservoir dogs; taxi driver}, tim roth{reservoir dogs; vincent and theo} and ammander plummer{so i married an axe murdered; joe versus the volcano}. each of them definitely deserves praise for their performances. the story for this movie was amazing. the point of it still escapes me but i'm pretty sure that was apart of tarantino's genius intentions. i love the fact that it doesn't give you all the answers and the fantastic way the film is structured. like seriously! i usually like non-linear storytelling but this takes the cake for some of the most interesting method of storytelling that i've seen. of course, i won't spoil it. but rest assured that it is certainly rewarding to watch, granted that you're paying attention! a more minor praise that i can award this movie is the dialogue. it is so good. dialogue is usually one of tarantino's strengths so i guess it's not a surprise but that doesn't detract from the sheer quality of it. just something as simple as discussing cheeseburgers or asking about a watch are elevated to memorable scenes, purely based on tarantino's phenomenal skill in writing. i do have one flaw with this movie, but it's not really a flaw. i think that the second act can feel a little disjointed and not work that well when watching the film for the first time. granted, it does make sense overall, but that doesn't change the fact that it feels very misplaced and out of context. the is doubly apparent when you consider its content differs completely from acts i & iii. again, this isn't a major complaint and i still love this movie, but it's something i think deserves a mention. overall, i loved this movie. it's a modern day classic, and we have the cinematic genius quentin tarantino to thank for that. his style, his direction, his dialogue and his script are all perfect and are knitted together like a flawless quilt. it's remarkable how good the man is at what he does. i highly recommend this movie'. i'll rate 'pulp fiction' 10 'royales with cheese'!";28 October 2017;10;['philosophical', 'ultra', 'hip', 'multi', 'strand', 'nervous', 'armed', 'good', 'little', 'weird', 'major', 'literal', 'stylistic', 'crisp', 'fantastic', 'unique', 'interesting', 'stylised', 'excellent', 'immaculate', 'flawless', 'tarantino', 'stylish', 'huge', 'great', 'great', 'fincher', 'tarantino', 'only', 'alive', 'capable', 'major', 'sensational', 'excellent', 'capable', 'actual', 'quiet', 'personal', 'favourite', 'amazing', 'single', 'good', 'sheer', 'raw', 'genuine', 'mad', 'excellent', 'huge', 'simple', 'great', 'solid', 'good', 'legendary', 'dramatic', 'similar', 'authentic', 'realistic', 'more', 'minor', 'excellent', 'amazing', 'sure', 'fantastic', 'non', 'linear', 'interesting', 'minor', 'good', 'sheer', 'simple', 'memorable', 'phenomenal', 'second', 'little', 'disjointed', 'first', 'misplaced', 'apparent', 'major', 'modern', 'cinematic', 'tarantino', 'perfect', 'flawless', 'remarkable', 'good'];0.3229456205559146

247;Rammstein-2;"i remember when i first went to see this film. i had seen ""reservoir dogs"" fairly recently, and was expecting the same type of criminals, the same twisted but very funny dialogue and the same kind of realistic and disturbing violence. and boy, did i get it. it doesn't get much better than this. in it's genre (gangster-comedy-parody-action-whatever), it is the undisputed number one, its greatness not remotely threatened by anything. i can't even remotely discern what will top this. the characters are stunning, and the actors play them so well it was hard to imagine travolta as anything else for a while (especially since he has yet to make a single decent film after this one). the cast list is impressive, and it is great to see tarantino crediting their fantastic acting skills by giving each and every one a pivotal role in the plot (christopher walken, tim roth, eric stoltz, rosanna arquette and so on). the dialogue is the best i have ever heard. the funny, weird and obtuse topics of discussion are handled with excellent care, making what seems like a really dumb discussion very realistic. not to mention hilarious. quotes from this film still haunts every day of my life. i have a friend who can't stop saying ""i'm on the mother*****r"" whenever he's set to do something. ""hezekiel 25:17"" is forever burned into my memory. the music is excellent. tarantino continues to give the music a prominent role by using radios, stereos and the famous dance sequence - the music is constantly on somewhere in the background, in the story, in the plot. as far as the story goes, it couldn't be much better. it's fairly simple, but the timeline is sewn together in a very special and extravagant way (one that made my father totally hate this film), giving the viewer something to think about until the question is resolved. excellent and, i imagine, something difficult to pull off so well. the sad part is that i don't think tarantino will ever top this himself. i know it's a bad thing to say and think, but i just can't imagine anything in this genre that will come close to puzzling a story, a dialogue and characters together like this film does. reaches a honorable number 5 on my cross-genre scale of the best movies ever made.";13 December 2000;10;['reservoir', 'same', 'same', 'twisted', 'funny', 'same', 'realistic', 'disturbing', 'well', 'undisputed', 'stunning', 'hard', 'single', 'decent', 'impressive', 'great', 'tarantino', 'fantastic', 'pivotal', 'good', 'funny', 'weird', 'obtuse', 'excellent', 'dumb', 'realistic', 'hilarious', 'excellent', 'tarantino', 'prominent', 'famous', 'well', 'simple', 'special', 'extravagant', 'excellent', 'difficult', 'sad', 'bad', 'honorable', 'cross', 'genre', 'good'];0.1975468975468975

253;OttoVonB;"three worlds collide. vincent (travolta) is an assassin for criminal king marcelus wallace (rhames), whose wife mia (thurman) he is dangerously flirting with, against better advice from partner jules (jackson). pumpkin (roth) and hunnie bunnie (plummer) are two psycho lovers, not far removed from tarantino's creations in true romance. butch (willis) is a washed-up boxer, indebted to wallace after he refuses to fake defeat. there is one fundamental element that either makes tarantino excellent or irritating, depending on the film: his almost nerdy knowledge of film lore. starting off as a geeky video store clerk, tarantino became a noted screenwriter (recicling many a conversation from his video store days in his film dialogue: culture debates, comic/film references etc.), then director (this time referencing films, mostly the french new wave, us blacksploitation, chinese/hong kong kung fu and japanese samurai pics). more often than not, he injects a global coherence that is unique, which, coupled with a deft hand at directing actors, makes for awesome cinema. other times, the result is simply embarrassing.

258;jamiedarlow-37510;an absolute classic in every sense and a must see for anyone even vaguely interested in films! a non-linear narrative following various characters including two hitmen vincent vega and jules winnfield (john travolta and samuel l jackson) a mob boss marcellus wallace and his wife mia (ving rhames and uma thurman) and a boxer named butch coolidge (bruce willis). they all have stories that are seemingly unrelated but come together subtly through their lives intertwining. it's masterful cinematic story telling, holding buckets of style while also making time to explore its characters and delve into their personalities underneath the crime plot lines. the dialogue is insanely good and the lyrical flow of it keeps you enthralled throughout. i remember when i was a young kid fascinated by the grown up world of tarantino's films. my fantastic mother let me watch all of his catalogue apart from this one until i was older (due to the distressing gimp rape scene) and there was so much built up for when i became of age to finally watch this masterpiece. it certainly didn't disappoint and it was my favourite qt picture to date. it's rightly become a huge staple in pop culture while also maintaining serious rewatchability and classic status.

265;Jackpollins;pulp fiction is a movie that works perfectly as a comedy, a crime movie, a thriller, a drama, a romance, an action film, and a mystery all mashed into one. it's four connecting tales of a hit-man named vincent (john travolta), a gangster's wife named mia (uma thurman), a boxer named butch (bruce willis), a man named jules (samuel l. jackson) and diner bandits named lance and jody (eric stoltz and rosanna arquette). it connects perfectly, vincent falls for mia, butch knows vincent, and jules, lance, and jody- well see the end for yourself. the movie is a masterpiece, only a genius can think of this stuff. this movie is violent, brutal, sickening, and i love it. in fact, i can't see how anyone can hate this. never has a movie been so perfectly done. never has someone done such flawless work. it manages to be a great crime movie that is also funny and poignant (yes, it's extremely poignant). the movie has great potential, and uses it to its fullest extent. it's such a good movie, it's almost mind blowing how good it is. a movie of this caliber can only be summed up in four words: best movie ever made.;18 August 2009;10;['violent', 'brutal', 'such', 'flawless', 'great', 'funny', 'poignant', 'poignant', 'great', 'full', 'good', 'good', 'good'];0.2788461538461538
266;jcbutthead86;puip fiction is easily one of the greatest films ever made and a flawless unforgettable masterpiece of cinema and filmmaking. filled with excellent direction,great performances from the cast,a perfect well-written screenplay and an amazing soundtrack,pulp fiction is one of my favorite films and is quentin tarantino's greatest film and a masterpiece. set in los angeles,california,pulp fiction tells three interconnected tales set in the crime world that involve two hit-men vincent vega(john travolta)and jules winnfield(samuel l. jackson),mia wallace,(uma thurman),a gangster's wife and aging boxer butch coolidge(bruce willis)and all four have to deal with violence,death and redemption. pulp fiction is without a doubt one of the greatest films ever made a flawless and unforgettable film that is an instant masterpiece and classic from the very moment that you watch. pulp fiction is great film because while the film is in the genre of crime drama,it's a little more than that because it's a film that mixes categories. it's an epic and violent crime drama,a stylized gangster film,a film-noir,a surreal black comedy,a tale of revenge,redemption and fate,an homage and tribute to movies that came before it. quentin tarantino takes elements of those genre that i mentioned above and turns them on their heads giving viewers a film that is original,imaginative and unconventional and doesn't play by the rules and that is one of the things i love about the film. pulp fiction changed the way i looked at films because before i saw pf movies had plots and stories that moved from a to b but pf was the first film i saw that was told in a unconventional structure that tells the story in a back and forth fashion like chapters in book or a novel. what i love about each of the three stories(vincent vega and marcellus wallace's wife,the gold watch and the bonnie situation)in the film is how wild and unpredictable they all are and how in some ways oddly enough each story is a morality tale with a dark and funny twist. each story has a wild spin on violence,drugs and sex and the things that happen in all of the stories will disturb but at the same time you are riveted and glued to the screen. the four main characters in the movie pulp fiction,vincent,jules,mia and butch are among the best characters tarantino has ever conceived because each character is cool and with brilliance. vincent and jules are classic characters because despite being hit men are stylish characters with unique personalities who have hilarious conversations about fast food joints,hamburgers,foot massages and tv pilots and the dialog between the two is funny and memorable. mia wallace is one of the few female characters in the film but when she's on screen you never forget her because she is beautiful and charming and when watch mia and her date with vincent you can tell that she is flirting with vincent and playing mind games because we don't know if mia likes vincent or if vincent likes mia and that's one of the mysteries of the film. butch coolidge is a great character because he's an antihero that is rooted in the spirit of film noir as a character who is caught in big circumstances that are beyond his control and he has to do what he has to do to survive and fight back. all four characters are amazing,powerful and iconic and help define the movie and after you see pulp fiction you will never forget any of them as long as you live. the screenplay by tarantino(which won an academy award for best original screenplay)is brilliant and perfect with tarantino each of the main characters great dialog that is fresh and original with a lot of funny black humor that is smart and creative. the violence in the film is brutal and shocking but at the same time funny and morbid and matches surreal over the top tone of the film. the ending of the film is powerful and captivating because while it is intense it's also calm and collective and makes you think. a wonderful ending. the whole cast is perfect. john travolta and samuel l. jackson are excellent and brilliant as vincent vega and jules winnfield,two cool hit-men. tavolta and jackson are great together. uma thurman is wonderful as mia wallace,marcellus' wife and has great chemistry with travolta. bruce willis is fantastic as butch,a tough boxer with an honor code and moral ambiguity. harvey keitel is great and cool as winston wolf,a man who solves problems. ving rhames is great and intimidating as marcellus wallace,a local crime boss. tim roth(pumpkin)and amanda plummer(honey bunny)are wonderful and funny as boyfriend/girlfriend robbers. eric stolz and rosanna arquette are fabulous as lance,vincent's friend and drug dealer and jody,lance's wife. christopher walken is great in his small role as captain koons,a soldier that visits butch. maria de medeiros does a fine job as fabianne,butch's girlfriend. the direction by quentin tarantino is excellent and wonderful with tarantino always moving the camera with long tracking shots either straight forward or with hand held photography and using close ups and slow camera movements giving the film a great style. amazing direction by tarantino. the soundtrack is masterful and one of the best soundtracks in film history with songs by dick dale and the del tones(misirlou),kool & the gang(jungle boogie),al green(let's stay together),chuck berry(you never can tell),dusty springfield(son of a preacher man),neil diamond,(girl,you'll be a woman soon),the centurians(bullwinkle part ii),link wray(ace of spades,rumble),the lively ones(surf rider),the slater brothers(flowers on the well),the revels(comanche)and more. fantastic soundtrack. in final word,if you love quentin tarantino,crime dramas or cinema in general,i highly suggest you see pulp fiction,an excellent and brilliant unforgettable masterpiece of cinema that you can watch again and again and deserves to be in every movie lover's collection. highly recommended. 10/10.;12 July 2013;10;['great', 'flawless', 'unforgettable', 'excellent', 'great', 'perfect', 'amazing', 'favorite', 'great', 'interconnected',

267;zeekwunlau;the narrative of the whole story is ups and downs. hold the audience's attention very well. each character has different meanings in different stories and seems to be shaped into different personalities. from beginning to end, the characters haven't changed, but we have seen more of the characters' stories. it can be said that quentin's understanding of the script and the lens expression has reached a certain height. in fact, from the structure of the film, it is understood by individuals. ah, echoing from beginning to end, very powerful. elementary school students know that the composition is echoed from beginning to end, and play in a loop. so to take this bragging, i think it is insulting quentin's level. when i watch this movie, i see quentin's understanding of the characters. gangs, boxing, drugs, underground culture. these things that seem far away from the lives of ordinary people have been put on the screen. the first caught the eye, but it looked vulgar. in fact, the characters have their own principles and abacus. no bad guy is stupid, and no policeman is just. so the whole movie has a lot of dialogue. dialogue is an important code for explaining information, and it is also an important way for the audience to understand the characters. so quentin worked hard on the conversation, the conversation in the restaurant, the conversation in the car, the conversation during the murder, etc. all dialogues are expressing the character's character, and not only the dialogue is used to express the speaker's character, but also the dialogue is used to shape the character of a character who has not yet appeared. all these conversations endow the characters with soul. it so happens that they are all interesting souls. in the real world, there are many people who are lonely, and there are few interesting souls. so, how attractive should these people on the screen be to us. and the weird advancement in the story doesn't seem reasonable. but after understanding the dialogue information, all these non-common senses seem to be explained. after all, there are few normal people. it can be said that they are all weird characters. the weird director made great works again. in the end, for the audience, we are all passers-by in the restaurant. we eat in the restaurant while enjoying these stories away from life. the most indispensable group in the world is the group that eats melons. in particular, the more fresh the story, the more we cannot bear our curiosity, and the more i want to know what will happen next. of course, this is just the appeal of the story. the story comes from the script, so i say the script of this movie is great. quentin's grasp of the rhythm and structure of the film is excellent. only under the combined effect of the two, did this excellent work. in short, is the story too exciting, or are we living too ordinary. like a lonely ant, peeping into the sparrow's eyes.;19 April 2020;9;['whole', 'different', 'different', 'different', 'more', 'certain', 'powerful', 'elementary', 'underground', 'ordinary', 'vulgar', 'own', 'bad', 'stupid', 'whole', 'important', 'important', 'interesting', 'real', 'many', 'lonely', 'few', 'interesting', 'attractive', 'weird', 'reasonable', 'non', 'common', 'few', 'normal', 'weird', 'weird', 'great', 'indispensable', 'particular', 'fresh', 'great', 'excellent', 'combined', 'excellent', 'short', 'exciting', 'ordinary', 'lonely'];0.1420238095238095
268;x_manicure_x;"why does everyone like ""pulp fiction"" so much? i've been watching this film at least a dozen times, but brilliant screenplay aside, i couldn't come up with concrete answers. after all, there does not seem to be any kind of message, the characters are mere caricatures, and the plot is so marginal that the film keeps going for one more hour after, everything is completely resolved. still, there seems to be something so fascinating that keeps the viewer hooked to the screen every time. the film could be described as an anthology of anecdotes and episodes from the l. a. underworld. tarantino introduces a dozen iconic antiheroes whose paths keep crossing, sometimes in the most surprising ways, with no plotline being particularly prominent. most of them seem nothing like cartoonish caricatures, but we gradually get attached to them as we learn a lot of both realistic and unusual facets of their personalities through the casual dialogues. some of them get killed off in the stupidest ways ever seen on screen, but still leave an indelible mark. there is this sensation that anything could happen, as every time things seem to get predictable enough, the story takes unexpected turns. the narration is mostly linear; there are some leaps back and forward in time that supposedly disoriented the viewers in 1994, but we are always given clear cues so that it is impossible to get lost. the camera also bothers to show us apparently insignificant dialogues and details only to get them explained later, mostly to trigger new situations or connect different plotlines. while the photography and art direction are not as mature as tarantino's later works, the eccentric editing choices and the spot-on use of music manage to make the difference here. combine this with the crisp writing and screenplay full of memorable lines, and you get one of the best post-modern black comedies of the last century. it's also interesting how a film that is essentially an incoherent collage of references and situations borrowed straight from other movies can at the same time be so quotable. sometimes it feels like ""pulp fiction"" is getting a bit too much credit for the wrong reasons, but it's undeniably one of the most memorable films of the '90s and a game-changer for mainstream filmmaking.";14 August 2021;9;['much', 'least', 'brilliant', 'concrete', 'mere', 'marginal', 'more', 'fascinating', 'tarantino', 'iconic', 'surprising', 'prominent', 'most', 'cartoonish', 'realistic', 'unusual', 'casual', 'stupid', 'indelible', 'predictable', 'unexpected', 'linear', 'clear', 'impossible', 'insignificant', 'new', 'different', 'mature', 'later', 'eccentric', 'crisp', 'full', 'memorable', 'good', 'post', 'modern', 'black', 'last', 'interesting', 'incoherent', 'other', 'same', 'quotable', 'much', 'wrong', 'memorable'];0.119297138047138

270;bix171;quentin tarentino's encyclopedic passion for noir films as well as seventies' television action shows is so powerful that you get giddy watching it and you have the sense that if no real ground is being broken, then at least 'pulp fiction' is a culmination of a host of ideas. linking together three stories (created by tarentino and roger avery but with tarentino getting the screenwriting credit) in a structure that can only be considered arcane for a film, he pulls out all the stops, cramming in as many references as he can to the pop culture that fascinates and repulses him. and working with his cinematographer, andrzej sekula, he creates an ugly, dirty los angeles underworld, the color baked out of it by a hot oppressive sun, in which his sordid characters (portrayed, among others, by john travolta, bruce willis and samuel l. jackson, each unforgettable) attempt to find value in their lives while wading through all the random violence and mistrust their world offers. if there are excesses--and there are, plenty of them--tarentino can be forgiven them this time because you get the feeling that this is his best shot and he has to make the most of it. he succeeds brilliantly.;11 February 2002;10;['encyclopedic', 'noir', 'powerful', 'giddy', 'real', 'least', 'tarentino', 'arcane', 'many', 'ugly', 'dirty', 'hot', 'oppressive', 'unforgettable', 'random', 'good', 'most'];0.08

277;Eternality;"what else is there to say about pulp fiction that has not been said? i am tempted to stop writing here but a one-liner review is never going to do justice to quentin tarantino's cinematic masterpiece. so, if you will, let me ramble. after the breakthrough at sundance that was reservoir dogs (1992), one would be hard-pressed to find a film-making talent as precocious as tarantino at that time. here was a man who, before he started making films, worked in a video store. such was his fascination for movies that he began to write stories while at work, obviously influenced by the culture he was immersed in. what happened afterwards was the stuff of legend. his ""stories"" became reservoir dogs, and two years later, he made the palme d'or winning pulp fiction at age 31. to my knowledge, the only american filmmaker i could think of who won the coveted cannes award at a younger age was steven soderbergh for sex, lies, and videotape (1989) at 26. the fear of making an explosive debut like reservoir dogs is that it is tricky to score again. with pulp fiction, tarantino not only scores but has created the perfect goal for himself. easily one of the top ten films of the nineties, pulp fiction is a lengthy film that weaves four stories together in a non-linear narrative structure that continues to impress with each viewing. the four stories are as follows: one, vincent vega (john travolta) and jules winnfield (samuel l. jackson) are two mob hit men who work for marcellus wallace (ving rhames), a ruthless gangster boss, and are assigned to retrieve an important suitcase. two, vincent is tasked by marcellus to take his wife mia (uma thurman) out for the night leading to an unexpected circumstance. three, butch coolidge (bruce willis), a boxer, betrays marcellus by not losing his match, and runs away with his betting money instead. four, two small-time robbers are dining in a restaurant when they decide to spontaneously rob its patrons. one way or the other, the four tales are linked to each other. expertly crafted by tarantino (who won an oscar for original screenplay together with co-writer roger avary), pulp fiction pushes the envelope for cinema writing, influencing a new generation of filmmakers such as alejandro gonzalez inarritu (amores perros, 2000; 21 grams, 2003). while it takes some time to understand what tarantino is trying to do, there is never a moment of confusion in his storytelling. the performances in the film are outstanding, and are made even more memorable by the brilliant interchange of dialogue among the characters. the signature tarantino verbal banter is laced with witty remarks and nonsensical debate over irrelevant issues from foot massages to quarter-pounder burgers. tarantino picks at the itsy-bitsy of american popular culture and brings his stylish brand of film-making to the forefront of that very culture he is trying to redefine. pulp fiction's lasting legacy lies not only in its imitable screenplay (there are so many quotable lines), but how it revitalizes a tired genre the gangster crime-thriller to suit contemporary tastes. as much as the film is about violence, drugs and sexual fetishes in suburban america, it is also a powerful tale of redemption, most notably encapsulated by a thought-provoking monologue by jules in the final act, which in itself, is a stunning closure to its prologue. score: 9.5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) all rights reserved!";12 July 2010;10;['cinematic', 'reservoir', 'precocious', 'tarantino', 'such', 'reservoir', 'only', 'american', 'coveted', 'young', 'explosive', 'reservoir', 'tricky', 'tarantino', 'perfect', 'top', 'lengthy', 'non', 'linear', 'narrative', 'marcellus', 'ruthless', 'important', 'unexpected', 'small', 'other', 'other', 'original', 'writer', 'new', 'such', 'tarantino', 'outstanding', 'memorable', 'brilliant', 'tarantino', 'verbal', 'witty', 'nonsensical', 'irrelevant', 'tarantino', 'american', 'popular', 'stylish', 'very', 'imitable', 'many', 'quotable', 'tired', 'contemporary', 'sexual', 'suburban', 'powerful', 'final', 'stunning'];0.1781221303948576

279;kylehaines96;director quentin tarantino gives us a cinematic master piece with the film pulp fiction an anthology movie that is not told in chronological order which is what i think is a great idea to keep the audience on their toes to see what happens next. the first story titled vincent vega and marcellus wallaces' wife follows vincent vega played by john travolta who is told by marcellus wallus played by ving rhames to take care of his wife mia wallace played by uma thurman. they go to a 50's style restaurant titled jack rabbiit slims where the famous twist contest happens. the story really escalates when mia has a heroin overdose and has to have an adrenaline shot. fun fact: the scene with vincent sticking the needle in mia was done by having john travota taking the needle out and running the film backwards because if he had actually jabbed it in he would have broken uma thurmans ribs. the second story titled the gold watch is about famous boxer butch coolidge played by bruce willis who is supposed to throw a boxing match but does not and ends up killing his opponent. he and his girlfriend fabienne played by maria de medeiors who are on the run by marcellus wallace. they eventually get kidnapped and get sexually assaulted by 2 psychos zed played by peter greene and maynard played by duane whitaker. butch ends up stealing zeds chopper saying the famous line, zeds dead baby, zeds dead. the third and final story titled the bonnie situation is about vincent vega and jules winnfield played by samuel l jackson who end up killing their friend named marvin played by phil lamarr and end up going to their friend jimmies house played by quenton tarantino and get help from winston wolf played by harvey keitel to clean up the mess before bonnie played by pam grier. they end up going to a diner which is being robbed by pumpkin played by tim roth and honey bunny played by amanda plummer. this is my favorite of the 3 stories. filled with crafty dialouge excellent story telling and great cast of characters this will always remain one of my all time favorite films. i definitely recommend this work of art. rated r for strong graphic violence and drug use, pervasive strong language and some sexuality. 2hrs 34min/154min. 275 uses of the f-word. ****/****;24 October 2011;10;['cinematic', 'chronological', 'great', 'first', 'marcellus', 'marcellus', 'famous', 'fun', 'second', 'famous', 'marcellus', 'famous', 'dead', 'dead', 'third', 'final', 'crafty', 'dialouge', 'excellent', 'great', 'favorite', 'strong', 'graphic', 'pervasive', 'strong'];0.3008333333333333
280;Silverzero;often deemed as one of, if not the, best movie of the 1990's, quentin tarantino's deliberately humorous and violent satire on the sleazy underworld of los angeles certainly lives up to the hype. often, similarly themed gangster movies can be slow in pace and boring in parts, but 'pulp fiction' is delivered in such a slick, stylised manner that you won't notice the two and a half-hour running time pass by. the oscar winning script is top-notch and brilliantly conceived. it's the jumping forward and back in time that makes the film work. only at the end of the film do you realise in what order the events took place. and the interweaving and overlapping comes in the form of three vignettes. they used the term 'series' of vignettes so that it would sound like more than three. it would have been smarter had it one or two more episodes, but as it is, all works quite well. the first is arguably the best. what makes this one work is the close attention to detail and memorable scenes that occur. the second story, 'the gold watch' is also quite good. this is shuffled in second when it's actually how the film closes. and the third vignette, 'the bonnie situation' is probably the funniest of the three. also thrown in there is the cafe robbery involving 'pumpkin' and 'honeybunny'. the actors are given tremendous material to work with, but the huge ensemble cast is perfectly chosen and is probably the best since 'magnolia'. the lead star, john travolta (oscar nominated for his part), is always perfectly believable and brilliantly styled as hit man vincent. but the performance isn't developed enough to consider above support. samuel l. jackson excellently portrays his counterpart, bible-bashing hit man jules. also lurking in there is uma thurman's exceptional delivery as the enigmatic, sassy femme fatale. surprising is the fact that bruce willis got the most screen time yet received the coveted 'and' credit. along with this, there is plenty of star-power from a supporting cast that would make robert altman weep. harvey keitel, rosanna arquette, eric stoltz, christopher walken, amanda plummer and tim roth round up the cast and all give ideal, noteworthy performances. quentin tarantino also does a near flawless job in the director's chair, bring just the correct amount of style, grit and humour. with quotable dialogue, memorable scenes and unforgettable characters 'pulp fiction' is a near masterpiece. working better in the more satirical moments, it probably isn't for the squeamish and definitely not for the easily offended. but if you want an offbeat, trendy ensemble thriller, then you won't go wrong with this. my imdb rating: 8.5/10.;25 July 2003;6;['good', 'humorous', 'violent', 'sleazy', 'themed', 'slow', 'boring', 'half', 'top', 'more', 'smart', 'more', 'first', 'good', 'close', 'memorable', 'second', 'good', 'second', 'third', 'tremendous', 'huge', 'ensemble', 'good', 'lead', 'believable', 'exceptional', 'enigmatic', 'sassy', 'femme', 'surprising', 'most', 'coveted', 'ideal', 'noteworthy', 'near', 'flawless', 'correct', 'quotable', 'memorable', 'unforgettable', 'near', 'satirical', 'trendy', 'ensemble', 'wrong'];0.309018759018759

287;luke-a-mcgowan;pulp fiction is apparently named for the low quality paper tarantino wrote his screenplay on. all i can say is thank you low quality paper for providing one of the top 30 finest films of the 1990s and may this film's endurance pay eternal homage to you. now lets dig into the good stuff. pulp fiction's non-linear story really boggled and irritated me the first time i watched it, but now i can't go without it. what on earth happened between the second scene, where vince and jules were so calmly in control, and third scene, where they rock up wearing loose fitting t shirts and boxer shorts. what on earth is the purpose of ringo and yolanda? keep watching. why was vincent all alone in butch's room? keep watching. the strategic placement of the bonnie situation is pure gold, because when we watch jules' decision to retire, we have already seen the trials, tribulations and ultimate tragedies that befall vincent without him. you can look through imdb's list of alternative casting choices for this movie, and whilst some may intrigue you, this movie would be completely different (and in my view worse) without travolta, jackson, thurman, willis, rhames, keitel, plummer, roth and even tarantino himself in the lead roles. every single one of them embodies their character and we could not go without them. john travolta is a sleazy, drug-addicted hit-man who is one hell of a dancer. uma thurman is equally good in as the alluring and composed boss' wife as she is in her overdose scene (which i maintain is one of the best put to screen). for samuel l. jackson, this is his moment - every single line he puts to screen is a quotable moment, and everything form his sculpted facial hair to his costume design becomes part of one of the most iconic characters of the 90s. it is one of 1994's greatest crimes that jackson lost the oscar to martin landau. no one stands around quoting bela lugosi, but you bet your sweet ass they can quote ezekial 25:17 in almost its entirety. but boy does this screenplay sound great. who knew a bunch of hit men could stand around and talk about cheeseburgers and foot massages and still make for fascinating cinema. the banter between travolta and jackson is gold. the confrontation with brett is cinematic platinum. tarantino is just so good with words. the screenplay not only eventful, but packed full of non-traditional events that there never will be a film like pulp fiction again. who'd have thought to throw in a pawn store rapist into the chase scene between wallace and butch? tarantino, that's who. i will not profess pulp fiction to be a perfect film. its not. the banter between butch and his girlfriend isn't nearly as entertaining as the rest of the film and i think it about ten minutes of footage could've been cut from that story. i also never really understood the point of the wolf, because he is called in to fix a problem that really shouldn't be that hard to fix. but they are small problems in a classic film and i won't dwell on them anymore. pulp fiction is special, its classic and if you haven't seen it, i'll buy you a dvd and send it to you so i can claim charity work. that this and the equally masterful shawshank redemption lost to forrest gump at the oscars is so unjustifiable that its almost funny. almost, but not quite.;1 June 2015;9;['low', 'low', 'top', 'fine', 'eternal', 'good', 'non', 'linear', 'first', 'second', 'third', 'loose', 'fitting', 'vincent', 'alone', 'strategic', 'pure', 'ultimate', 'alternative', 'different', 'tarantino', 'single', 'sleazy', 'good', 'alluring', 'composed', 'overdose', 'good', 'single', 'quotable', 'sculpted', 'facial', 'iconic', 'great', 'sweet', 'ezekial', 'great', 'fascinating', 'cinematic', 'tarantino', 'good', 'eventful', 'full', 'non', 'traditional', 'perfect', 'entertaining', 'hard', 'small', 'classic', 'special', 'masterful', 'forr', 'unjustifiable', 'funny'];0.3055232862375719

particular order. you really don't have any idea what this movie is about until it's over, and even then you wouldn't be able to explain it to someone else. suffice it to that pulp fiction revolves around the interactions of one of la's top gangsters (ving rhames), his girlfriend (uma thurman), his two best hit men (john travolta and samuel l jackson), their drug dealer (eric stoltz) a washed up boxer (bruce willis), a pair of small time thieves (tim roth and amanda plummer), and a briefcase of great value and unknown contents. in any case, the plot isn't what's important. it merely serves as a vehicle for blood drenched shootouts and fight scenes, dance offs, pop cultural asides, and fascinating conversations. the best known of these is of course the cheeseburger scene, in which vince and jules (travolta and jackson's characters) discuss the french terms for mcdonald's items while driving through a run-down section of la. on the face of it, their dialog may seem pointless, or lightweight, but that's exactly what's brilliant about it. from their conversation, you'd never guess that they're on their way to kill someone. they're just a couple of buds chatting it up. they could be going to dinner or a movie premier. but then they step out of the car, remove their guns from the trunk, and become all business. the sudden transition from cheeseburgers to contract killings is abrupt, completely unexpected, and absolutely brilliant. at other times, even in the wackiest settings, the dialog borders on the profound. take for instance jackson's old testament spiel before killing someone. ezekiel 25:17 would surely be the most awesome verse in the bible if it weren't cobbled together from three different verses. or take travolta and thurman's conversation at jackrabbit slim's. they're sitting in a booth shaped like a cadillac, being waited on by a buddy holly look alike, but they manage to achieve fairly deep insight into the awkwardness and discomfort we all feel when getting to know someone. to quote, ""why do we feel it's necessary to talk about bull**** to be comfortable. but before we're given too much time to ponder such matters, the film makes another abrupt turn, giving us an overdose scene that is both shocking and hysterical. it's like a keystone cops routine with a woman's life in the balance, if you can imagine such a thing. this combination of the horrifying and the hilarious is of course one of the trademarks of terantino's work. a similar dynamic is at work in the entire 'bonnie situation' section, in which terantino makes an extended appearance and gets what might be the pulp fiction's best line. and don't even get me started on the 'bring out the gimp' scene. besides the graphic violence and the fair amount of sexual content, some of which is thankfully only implied, language is also a big part of the movie's shock value. the people in this movie use more profanity than a high school freshman trying too hard to establish street cred. i lost count of the f-bombs somewhere around 100, and i wasn't even at the halfway point. yet not a single utterance ever seems unnecessary or added just to shock. instead, we get the feeling that this is just how these people talk, and why wouldn't they, given their lines of work. and in many cases the screenplay uses profanity to great comic effect, as with the aforementioned terantino delivered line, which derives its impact from a certain racial epitaph so charged that i dare not say it. honestly, i'm not sure that anything i write can do justice to this movie. few films have ever been as original, oddball, or memorable as pulp fiction. no other movie in the last twenty years has had the same impact on popular culture or spawned as many imitators. pulp fiction is to 70's exploitation films what indiana jones is to the pulp serials of the 30's and 40's. it will be likely be too much for many audiences, and for goodness sake keep it away from the kids, but for fans of any of the many genres this movie fits into it will come as a real treat.";10 January 2015;10;['previous', 'reservoir', 'most', 'violent', 'entertaining', 'nuts', 'violent', 'bizarre', 'good',

294;revival05;pulp fiction is a masterpiece from start to finish. a couple of hard boiled stories, are waved together by only such perfection as tarantino. now, i'm not going to say that big q is my favorite director, but there is no doubt that the man is a genius. just look at the script! and, just as in his other masterpiece reservoir dogs, the scenes and scenarios are harshly mixed up in one big mess. as a director, well, he's good but not that very original, with some exceptions like the pulp-dancesceen and the ending in dogs. his real magnificent lies in this adrenalin rush script. it is genius!!! pulp fiction is my second favorite after star wars (i'm not sure why i love that film, but hey, sue me) and it can't be compared to the rest of my top-movies, nor tarantino's others. from dusk till dawn is a big flat joke to this, also natural born killers (tarantino's story) and probably true romance too. jackie brown is a good film, but it's one million floors down from this movie. the nearest so far is reservoir dogs. the direction of dogs was better than pulp, but pulp fiction has got this screenplay that no other (and i do mean not one) has got. let's go on to... acting. well, i'll put it like this: a majority of the actors do their best roles ever, here is my pulp fiction acting-guide: travolta: definitely his best role so far. his portrait of vince is a classic. it's cool, funny and you just smile by satisfaction while he slither around mrs.wallace's house. and the dancing-scene is also notable. here we see that travolta's dancing king age is still not over. jackson: it's a hard choice, but i'm pretty certain that this is his best performance i've seen. he's around everywhere, so it's tough but he tops. still, it's easier concidering the fact that his performance is the best in the movie! the path of the ritcheus man is to be set on all sides... thurman: i have never been such a tremendous fan of uma thurman, but this time wer'e talking cool chick. it is a shame that she's only in like 1/5 of the movie. we should see more of her. keitel: no, mr.wolf isn't his best. i'm rooting for mr.white or the priest in from dusk till dawn. i know, it's a crap movie but the role is good. roth: yeah, mr.orange is better, but this one is on a good 2'nd place. rhames: his best role! without a doubt. marcellus wallace wer'e talking respect here. i'm gonna get medevil on your ass!!!!!! he is one tough bastard. his scene with willis was great, and every other scene he was into in this great, great movie. arquette: she isn't in this movie that much, but it is by far her best performance. stoltz: eric stoltz is a great actor, and i think every part he ever played is the best, and i'm sorry that he's not in this one that much. willis: bruce willis might do his best performance, and the most quality-role but i have a very hard time if i'll ever try to forget john mcclane. this is his second best role. well, let's not forget about eric roberts and quentin tarantino. or should we? yes, actually but let's try to focus on these two gentlemens too. ok roberts, everybody's hate victim and the biggest c-actor since dolph lundgren. and tarantino might be a groovy director/writor but he actually is quite pale as an actor. pulp fiction has also got blood and violence. it is a strong, foulmouth and shocking but also classic movie. if you really loved reservoir dogs... what are you waiting for??? i can guarantee (yes, i can make out a promise, sue me if this is wrong) that you'll at least like this movie. also: great sound and cool soundtrack. i first saw this movie four years ago, and it is still just as great. overall 10/10;5 June 2000;10;['hard', 'such', 'big', 'favorite', 'other', 'mixed', 'big', 'good', 'original', 'real', 'magnificent', 'second', 'favorite', 'sure', 'top', 'big', 'flat', 'natural', 'true', 'good', 'near', 'reservoir', 'well', 'other', 'good', 'good', 'cool', 'funny', 'notable', 'hard', 'certain', 'good', 'tough', 'easy', 'good', 'tremendous', 'more', 'good', 'good', 'well', 'good', 'good', 'marcellus', 'tough', 'great', 'other', 'great', 'great', 'much', 'good', 'great', 'good', 'sorry', 'much', 'good', 'hard', 'second', 'good', 'eric', 'tarantino', 'big', 'dolph', 'tarantino', 'groovy', 'pale', 'strong', 'shocking', 'classic', 'reservoir', 'wrong', 'least', 'great', 'cool', 'great', 'overall'];0.2821479774705581

""on the surface is a scruffy, violent and vulgar crime drama, but beneath it there all elements of comedy and just about everything else..."" directed in a highly stylised manner and incorporating three intertwining stories in non-chronological order, along with an outrageously good yet extremely irrelevant script, pulp fiction re-writes cinematic history, with its 'neo-noir' attitudes. tarantino crafts a modern yet vintage cinematic masterwork that is as unorthodox as unorthodox can be. here is a daring, young, new director not afraid to push cinematic boundaries, who creates a supremely influential picture that entertains, enthrals and leaves many in absolute awe. pulp fiction can be characterised as aimless: a group of lowlife, low key gangsters that talk about foot massages and alternative names of fast food burgers in other countries, while carry out dull yet bloody crime tasks. this film is the macbeth of the modern fast food culture, an obscenely poetic yet vulgar film that is so unconventional yet so darkly humorous, with a cast that drives the film's engines for two and a half ingenious hours of marvellous and vivacious cinema. tarantino's camera-work is praiseworthy, adapting an amateurish, scruffy look yet showing us exactly what we want to see, but leaves so much to the imagination. it is very interesting that we have generally received this film so highly. in fact we consider it as one of the best of all time and it probably is. irrelevant yet so beautifully rejuvenating picture that is greatly entertaining, mystical and funny. an example that a film can be made with such limited resources and be so successful both critically and financially. pulp fiction drains the imagination, it uses it as its tool of success. this is a cinematic triumph, a milestone in the history of film. tarantino is a genius; a mad genius but still a classified genius!!! -10/10-";7 October 2006;10;['top', 'joyous', 'tarantino', 'mainstream', 'scruffy', 'violent', 'vulgar', 'stylised', 'non', 'chronological', 'good', 'irrelevant', 'cinematic', 'tarantino', 'modern', 'vintage', 'cinematic', 'unorthodox', 'daring', 'young', 'new', 'afraid', 'cinematic', 'influential', 'many', 'absolute', 'aimless', 'low', 'key', 'alternative', 'fast', 'other', 'dull', 'bloody', 'modern', 'fast', 'poetic', 'vulgar', 'unconventional', 'humorous', 'ingenious', 'marvellous', 'vivacious', 'praiseworthy', 'interesting', 'good', 'irrelevant', 'entertaining', 'mystical', 'funny', 'such', 'limited', 'successful', 'cinematic', 'mad', 'classified'];0.035088335088335
296;higherall7;"president regan once was quoted as saying you can't argue with success and the honorable elijah muhammud was represented by spike lee as telling malcolm x to keep his mouth shut about a man who has won the love of the people. this seems like sound advice to me, but the time has come at last to give my two cents about a film known as pulp fiction. there are those who hate it and those who love it and those who shrug their shoulders not knowing quite what to make of it. i freely admit i belong to the third category. i don't revere it, i don't condemn it; and the way quentin tarantino bookends the movie with the beginning scene is kind of clever and interesting. but i sure don't see what all the hoopla is about. the stuff packed in between the two slices of narrative bread is not god awful or gems of shimmering brilliance, it's just standard shock-o-rama to me. i didn't mind watching it and would not mind watching it again except for all this undue emphasis on how important it is to film culture. i hope you will forgive me for not seeing it that way. pulp fiction is a cultural curiosity to me. sort of like the rocky horror picture show. i can think of half a dozen films i can more easily and wholeheartedly embrace and which more naturally duplicate my thoughts and feelings and deeply felt ideas. when i first saw pulp fiction, i was hoping at the end of the roundup there would be some kind of moral resonance to the whole thing, but it was simply too shallow to produce that kind of effect. it's more like a hodgepodge of cultural references, nearly all of which veer in the direction of the scatological. some of the references hit an emotional chord and some don't in my mind. i remember seeing let it be with my friend scott in black lake, michigan. this was a documentary about the beatles. i found the picture exhilarating because of how it recorded the incubatory introversion of the creative process the band went through before experiencing the celebratory extroversion of live performance. scott did not think there were enough exciting parts to hold his interest. i also remember seeing fellini's amarcord with louie whitehead and realizing while mentally comparing it to about a hundred films in a few seconds how remarkable it was that it did not focus on sex and violence to carry the story forward. that being so, louie was kind of dissatisfied with it and i confessed i did not think as highly of amarcord as i did of fellini's the clowns. all i can say is that different people of necessity have different tastes and sensibilities. my dissatisfaction with pulp fiction is that unlike kurosawa's film high and low there is no 'high and low'! all the characters are lowlifes, but represented as strong and resourceful while the so-called 'straight types' like the college students are represented as ineffectual and weak. pulp fiction completes the moral and cultural inversion first presented by francis ford coppola's the godfather, but this time played even more for laughs. i just don't see much value in all of this. i suppose if ned beatty could be sodomized in deliverance, owing to equal opportunity ving rhames could be sodomized in pulp fiction, but the truth is i would rather see him play someone like a.g. gaston, than someone like al capone. i enjoyed watching bruce willis chose between a chain-saw and a katana before rescuing rhames' character from the pommel horse, but even he comes across as a character of dubious honor. perhaps, i should not quibble about the whore with the heart of gold now being joined by the hit-man with the heart of gold. it is just that divine intervention for hired killers is too perverse and cruel a cosmic joke for me. samuel l. jackson and john travolta play fascinating characters as jules and vincent, but they seem more like supporting characters than leads. my problem with pulp fiction is that there did not seem to be any character, except for a few moments with bruce willis, i could wholeheartedly relate to and embrace. all of them, one way or another, seemed to be stained with sleaze or wallowing in it. uma thurman gives a creditable performance as the wife of marsellus wallace and christopher walken's off-color story is hilarious, but it all comes across as a world you want to handle in a glove or a puzzle box so as not to get any of it on you. tim roth and amanda plummer (bearing the name of a character in one of my three-act plays, by the way) depart a mexican standoff against jules and vincent with their lives and all their ill-gotten gains, but are they really any the wiser? leaving, they come across as an ersatz version of adam and eve exiting the garden of evil rather than eden. much has been made of the non-linearity of the narrative structure and no doubt something can be learned from tarantino's musical handling of his scenes. this leads me to conclude you can get people to believe and accept anything just by making the images flow in harmony with the musical score. once again, it seems to me i have seen non-linearity handled better in other pieces, most notably and recently in run, lola, run, but tarantino does a good job with it here. it is just when it comes time to deliver the moral of the story, pulp fiction seems to come up with insufficient funds.";12 February 2014;7;['honorable', 'sound', 'last', 'third', 'clever', 'interesting', 'narrative', 'awful', 'standard', 'undue', 'important', 'cultural', 'rocky', 'moral', 'whole', 'shallow', 'cultural', 'emotional', 'incubatory', 'creative', 'celebratory', 'live', 'enough', 'exciting', 'louie', 'few', 'remarkable', 'dissatisfied', 'different', 'different', 'high', 'low', 'high', 'low', 'strong', 'resourceful', 'straight', 'ineffectual', 'weak', 'moral', 'cultural', 'much', 'ned', 'equal', 'dubious', 'divine', 'perverse', 'cruel', 'cosmic', 'fascinating', 'few', 'creditable', 'hilarious', 'mexican', 'wise', 'ersatz', 'much', 'non', 'narrative', 'musical', 'musical', 'non', 'other', 'good', 'moral', 'insufficient'];0.1081093544137022

302;illbebackreviews;"to call 'pulp fiction' a great movie is simply said, not a fair judgment. pulp fiction is so much more than a movie and back in its release year, there had never really been a movie like 'pulp fiction' apart from perhaps quentin tarantino's masterpiece that was his directorial debut 'reservoir dogs' to describe 'pulp fiction' is like truly describing why you love chocolate. the plot to the movie is not easy to explain but simplistic to watch and understand. apart from such stylistic choices made by quentin tarantino that involves using music that adds to the tone of the movie, quentin tarantino's writing is far superior to any director working today. the dialogue in 'pulp fiction' is what i believe to be the greatest dialogue in cinematic history. it is easy for anyone to say, ""wow! i could do that. it isn't hard!"" but reallyno man on earth could use such entertaining dialogue in what is basically a dialogue based movie. there was not a minute of dialogue that bored me in the morning. the dialogue was harsh, it was hilarious, it was brutal, it was classical and yet, it was so clever. 'pulp fiction', turning 18 years old this year still has people that love this movie and even to this day, people repeat quotes from the movie. that's how catchy the dialogue is. the story is that based around two mob men who come across a hard day whilst trying to deliver something to his boss, a boxer whose life becomes at stake after a boxing match, a story of the mob leader, a story where one of the two mob men must take out the gangster's wife on a date and a story based around the opening scene, which is the restaurant robbery. pulp fiction is not an action movie nor is it a comedy. it has elements of both but tarantino is a master at blending elements from certain movies he particularly loves. the characters in this movie are all fantastic, with one of my favourite characters being the wolf! i just love that guy and harvey keitel really is amazing in that role. however, without a doubt the scene stealer in the movie is samuel l jackson as the amazing jules winnfield who steals the last 30-45 minutes of the movie. seriously, that part 'the bonnie situation' feels like a 10 minute scene. that isn't to say the rest of the acting is mediocre. that's just harsh. john travolta as jackson's sidekick in this movie is superb and is the other scene stealer, bruce willis as butch is brilliant, uma thurman as mia wallace is surprisingly perfect, tim roth and amanda plummer as the restaurant robbers are great as is every single member of the cast including director quentin tarantino in his cameo. the movie, at a run time of 150 minutes (2 hours) did not at any moment bore me which is amazing considering that i must pause the film at a time to look at how much i've seen. this movie was not like that, i sat down and before i knew it, the film was over! that's how amazingly paced and how entertaining the movie is with only a few gunshots and minimal violence presented in the movie. if you're looking for a big bloody action movie, check out tarantino's kill bill, but pulp fiction most certainly will disappointment those looking for big action movies to conclude this review here, it is almost factual and not opinion based in saying that 'pulp fiction' is easily one of the greatest movies ever made with almost no flaw at all with perhaps the greatest writing, one of the greatest stories and characters and brilliantly and flawlessly acted. the movie, at an immense 150 minutes kept me going through the whole movie staring in awe at how amazing this movie is- that is being said from a person who is watching this movie for his third time.";8 March 2013;10;['great', 'fair', 'more', 'directorial', 'reservoir', 'easy', 'simplistic', 'such', 'stylistic', 'superior', 'great', 'cinematic', 'easy', 'hard', 'such', 'entertaining', 'harsh', 'hilarious', 'brutal', 'classical', 'clever', 'old', 'catchy', 'hard', 'tarantino', 'certain', 'fantastic', 'favourite', 'amazing', 'amazing', 'last', 'mediocre', 'harsh', 'superb', 'other', 'brilliant', 'perfect', 'great', 'single', 'amazing', 'much', 'few', 'minimal', 'big', 'bloody', 'big', 'factual', 'great', 'great', 'great', 'immense', 'whole', 'amazing', 'third'];0.2346273291925466

305;mistoppi;my first memory of pulp fiction was when i was very young, and my father had borrowed the soundtrack, and he listened to it. and i still remember listening to the beginning, tim roth and amanda plummer's dialogue, followed by misirlou. i don't have any idea why it had such an impact on me, but i remembered that for so long. and the soundtrack of this film continues to enchant me! there are so many songs in this film that are absolute gold. i already mentioned misirlou, but one exceptionally beautiful track is girl, you'll be a woman soon by urge overkill. i saw pulp fiction for the first time three years ago. i was sixteen then. but this time i did notice there were several details i missed - or have since then forgotten. it's great how you can watch a film again and it still feels kind of new. i love the colour palette of pulp fiction. especially the colour red is very strong. and i have no complaints about the cinematography whatsoever, it really looks amazing. and the design of many locations is great. i especially love jack rabbit slims, the 50's themed restaurant mia and vincent vega go to. it looks absolutely ridiculous of course, very extravagant, but that's why it's so amazing. it's so detailed. pulp fiction sure has it's cult classic reputation. i think almost everyone with internet has seen pictures and gifs of pulp fiction, even if they haven't seen the film itself. that's why watching the film is weirdly surreal. you know so many scenes, but when they are put together, they are perfect, even if so many scenes are legendary even on their own: samuel l. jackson's monologue, the dance scene. several pieces of dialogue. they are all amazing and so many people know them, but when you see them all in a film, it's... surreal. the characters of pulp fiction never seize to amaze me. like i said about reservoir dogs, the characters are closer to people than devices to carry out the story. none of them is a hero, none of them is a villain. they have virtues, they have vices. of course they are devices for the story, that's what characters do, but even when they do their job for the plot, they still have lives outside of the story. even if the film doesn't shove their regular life to your face, you can still feel it. pulp fiction is good. it is most definitely good, it's amazing. of course i like to think sometimes that it is completely overrated, but whenever i watch it again - or even see an out-of-context piece of the film, i remember that it is one of the best films ever made.;15 January 2016;10;['first', 'young', 'many', 'absolute', 'beautiful', 'first', 'several', 'great', 'new', 'strong', 'amazing', 'many', 'great', 'themed', 'ridiculous', 'extravagant', 'amazing', 'detailed', 'cult', 'classic', 'surreal', 'many', 'perfect', 'many', 'legendary', 'own', 'several', 'amazing', 'many', 'surreal', 'close', 'regular', 'good', 'good', 'amazing', 'overrated', 'out', 'good'];0.4422821969696969

313;Old Joe;with a cult following around the world, a couple of years ago i thought i better get around to watching 'pulp fiction', and see what all the fuss was about. to my horror, i found this movie too sick and violent for my liking. then just the other day i gave it a second chance and boy i am glad that i did. 'pulp fiction' is an inside look at a memorable community of criminals. this is one of the more unique pieces of cinema the world has ever seen. prize-fighter butch coolidge has decided to stop payment on a deal he's made with the devil. honey bunny and pumpkin are a couple of young lovers and small time thieves who decide they need a change of venue. meanwhile, two career criminals, vincent vega and jules, go about their daily business of shooting up other crooks that are late on payments to their boss. while one is asked to baby-sit their boss' dangerously pretty young wife, the other suddenly realises that he must give up his life of crime. the screenplay written for 'pulp fiction' by quentin tarantino and roger avery is unusual and interesting at the same time. i like how quentin made the story be out of chronological order, in addition to the way he cleverly changes the pace of the movie (e.g. from violent-humorous or vice-versa). then there is also the very subtle use of humour in 'pf', which is another part of the script l like as well. tarantino, i have read, used the humour to offset the violence that was about to, or has happened. yet the script also holds some weird dialogue, for instance when mia and vincent are in the diner, as i felt the first time it was really boring. a second viewing i can appreciate that it is a little different, not like your normal movie lingo. i am not surprised that this screenplay won an academy award, as it was very original. this movie has an all star line up. it resurrected the career of john travolta who was on a downer before taking on the character of vincent vega in 'pf'. travolta is good as the bad guy, as i also like his performance in the action hit, 'broken arrow'. travolta shares an interesting, but bizarre chemistry with uma thurman, who plays mia. the dance sequence the pair does at the burger diner has to go down as one of the great pieces of cinema i have seen. i know i will not forget it for along time to come. thurman is also part of the movies most distressing scene, when her character accidentally od's on heroine. what follows is quite unbelievable. vincent's mobster sidekick is jules (samuel l. jackson), whose role is so serious that in some circumstances it has to be laughed at. jules always misquotes a bible passage, thinking that he has it right to the very word. the verse is 'ezekiel 25:17'. i love how the script allows both travolta and jackson to make fun of what essentially are dangerous, violent and serious situations. they also share funny dialogue at the beginning of the film, as vincent asks jules, 'do you know what they call a quarter pounder with cheese in paris? a royale with cheese.' the mob pair work for marcellus wallace (ving rhames) who for most of the movie we only see the back of his head. he is one of the more influential characters in the entire movie. then you have the character of butch (played by action superstar bruce willis). he has been asked to throw a fight he is in, but doesn't, with the consequences of that being great. we also learn about the history of a wrist watch that his grandfather had in the war. one of the two great cameo performances in 'pf' comes from captain koons (christopher walken), who tells one of the movies funnier moments. the wrist watch is an important item to the movies make-up. the other is a bad guy by the name jimmie (played by tarantino himself). tarantino is one guy who sure is involved when it comes to making a movie! i have to admit that i was not a fan of the contents of 'pulp fiction' when i first watched it. yet three years on, i can see why many people like what it covers. the violence (one of the main reason why i did not like it first time) is nowhere as bad i thought, as tarantino cleverly cuts away to a different camera angle or too a completely different shot all together to make it a little less shocking. yet it still has the same impact, as you know exactly what has happened. sure the bad guys use guns, but again they are used in such a way, that i could approve of them a second time around. there are many other deeper aspects to this movie that i have learnt to see and want too find more about. early on in 2003 i was away with friends on the beach. at one stage i started drinking a can or two of alcohol. after an hour i was getting really happy, and started to dance like they do at the diner in 'pulp fiction'. since that night i have wanted to watch the movie and see what i was mimicking. quentin tarantino has had what i believe is a positive influence on movies that we watch today. sure he might push the envelope on what people like, but he also makes movies that are a little bit different, unlike the normal 'predictable' movie formulas. tarantino also uses some extraordinary camera angles in pulp fiction, just great! first time around, i would have only given pulp fiction a very small rating, however after many viewings, pulp fiction has shown me that it is a brilliant film, exceptionally well made by tarantino. cmrs gives 'pulp fiction': 5 (brilliant film);23 February 2004;9;['sick', 'violent', 'other', 'second', 'glad', 'inside', 'memorable', 'unique', 'young', 'small', 'daily', 'other', 'late', 'young', 'unusual', 'interesting', 'same', 'chronological', 'violent', 'humorous', 'subtle', 'tarantino', 'about', 'weird', 'first', 'boring', 'second', 'little', 'different', 'normal', 'surprised', 'original', 'good', 'bad', 'broken', 'interesting', 'bizarre', 'great', 'distressing', 'unbelievable', 'serious', 'bible', 'right', 'very', 'ezekiel', 'dangerous', 'violent', 'serious', 'funny', 'marcellus', 'most', 'influential', 'entire', 'great', 'great', 'funny', 'important', 'other', 'bad', 'tarantino', 'tarantino', 'many', 'main', 'first', 'bad', 'tarantino', 'different', 'different', 'shocking', 'same', 'bad', 'second', 'many', 'other', 'deep', 'happy', 'positive', 'little', 'different', 'normal', 'predictable', 'extraordinary', 'great', 'first', 'small', 'many', 'brilliant', 'brilliant'];0.042515601281835

322;robsta23;"this film may play with its use of chronology, and it may be episodic, but people generally claim this movie to be great because it is the first to do so. it is certainly not the first film to do either of these things. it is inspired by many films before it, such as rashomon - which tells the same story from four different perspectives - as well as ""my life to live,"" a neorealist film which is told in twelve distinct episodes. however, pulp fiction was the first film to play with chronology in this manner in many years, and it is because it does so with great purpose which helps to make it my favorite movie (among various other reasons). some complain about this fiddling with chronology to cause confusion, yet the story only goes out of the linear time line in two spots in the film, and i always found it easy to follow. as for the big episodes in the film (the ones tarantino actually gave titles to) the first two are played in chronological order, and the third episode shown jumps back to a spot before the other two stories. i will not got too in depth with my next comment as it would give too much away if i did, but tarantino's choice to show butch coolidge's story (bruce willis) before jules' story (samuel l jackson) has a huge impact on the way the audience views vincent vega (john travolta) by the end of the film. it is this fact combined with the way jules' story ends that left me mind-blown when i watched this film for the first time. i understand that in the context of 1994 when this film was released that it was an extremely violent film. if you're still going to complain about the violence in this film today, i would laugh and tell you there is no way you could handle more contemporary films like mongol, 300, or gone girl. hell, i hope you can make it through django unchained, tarantino's most recent and by far his most violent film to date. what people forget to say about the violence in pulp fiction is that most of it actually happens off screen, leaving the violence up to the audience's imagination (maybe this is why people remember it to be more violent than it actually is). what i realized and loved about this film after watching it for a few times is that the three stories of this film all have a common connection - they deal with loyalty to a father figure, each one more intimate than the last. we have vincent vega struggling to be loyal to marsellus wallace (the crime boss), we have butch coolidge honoring his father, and we have jules winnfield rethinking his relationship with god. other than the chronology of the film, what is easily the most notable thing about pulp fiction is the dialogue. tarantino has arguably written better scenes after this film (in fact, i agree with his choice of the opening scene of inglourious basterds as his favorite thing he has written), but this is the movie by tarantino that everybody quotes, especially the famous scene when jules dominates the conversation about breakfast and what marsellus wallace looks like (trust me, even if you haven't seen the movie you've probably heard a friend quoting this scene). tarantino is a master of dialogue - he writes conversations that people might actually have with each other. the topics may seem random, but that's how real-world conversations work. you discuss events, make analogies, disagree and argue - you don't simply talk about what is going to happen or what has happened, which is unfortunately how a lot of dialogue in film goes. tarantino always creates distinct and well-developed characters through his use of dialogue. this movie is a roller coaster of an experience, and it gets my highest rating. 4.0/4.0";23 November 2015;10;['episodic', 'great', 'first', 'first', 'many', 'such', 'same', 'different', 'neorealist', 'distinct', 'first', 'many', 'great', 'favorite', 'various', 'other', 'linear', 'easy', 'big', 'tarantino', 'first', 'chronological', 'third', 'other', 'next', 'much', 'huge', 'first', 'violent', 'contemporary', 'recent', 'violent', 'most', 'violent', 'few', 'common', 'intimate', 'last', 'loyal', 'winnfield', 'other', 'notable', 'well', 'inglourious', 'favorite', 'famous', 'other', 'random', 'real', 'tarantino', 'distinct', 'high'];0.1149612403100775
323;freaky_dave;i'm not kidding about any of this. pulp fiction is indeed one of the best movies ever made. there are so many scenes in this movie that are memorable, i couldn't talk about them all without taking up way too much space. the dialogue in this film is magnificent. samuel jackson and john travolta as hit men have most of the best lines, but they are not the only ones with incredible lines. we have uma thurman, bruce willis, christopher walken who has a small part but has dialogue which is just as good as travolta's and jackson's, ving rhames, tim roth, amanda plummer. you get the idea. the plot revolves around a number of people, many mentioned above but not all, and how their paths cross in different ways. each story, i think there are about three but there might be more, is mixed up, but everything comes together in a finale at a diner which makes complete sense and wouldn't have worked better any other way. pulp fiction begins and ends in almost the same time period, but we as the viewers know much more about the characters at the end that we didn't know when the movie first started. it was a clever idea which breathed new life into the gangster picture. pulp fiction's time twist was one that many other films followed with moderate success. the most recent being 2005s sin city, another incredible film. great scenes, great dialogue, great characters, and a great story. this movie has it all and as directed by quentin tarantino is one of the best movies made in the 90s. it is definitely tarantino's greatest achievement and should've won best picture in 1994.;6 April 2006;10;['good', 'many', 'memorable', 'much', 'magnificent', 'most', 'good', 'only', 'incredible', 'small', 'good', 'many', 'different', 'more', 'complete', 'other', 'same', 'more', 'clever', 'new', 'many', 'other', 'moderate', 'recent', 'incredible', 'great', 'great', 'great', 'great', 'good', 'great', 'good'];0.4420332355816228

325;gogoschka-1;"i can only speak for myself, but i had never seen anything as stylish, cleverly constructed, well written and electrifying as this milestone when i first saw it in 1994. what really pulled me in right from the start is what we've now come to know as a tarantino trademark: the dialogue. when gangsters jules and vincent talk to each other (or all the other characters, for that matter) there is a natural flow, a sense of realism and yet something slightly over the top and very theatrical about their lines it's a mixture that immediately grabs your attention (even if it's just two dudes talking about what kind of hamburger they prefer, or contemplating the value of a foot-massage). then there's the music: the songs tarantino chose for his masterpiece fit their respective scenes so perfectly that most of those pieces of music are now immediately associated with 'pulp fiction'. and the narrative: the different story lines that come together, the elegantly used flashbacks, the use of ""chapters"" there is so much playful creativity at play here, it's just a pure joy to watch. if you're a bit of a film geek, you realize how much knowledge about film and love for the work of other greats and inspiration from them - went into this (leone, depalma, scorsese and, of course, dozens of hyper-stylized asian gangster flicks), but to those accusing tarantino of copying or even ""stealing"" from other film-makers i can only say: there has never been an artist who adored his kind of art that was not inspired or influenced by his favorite artists. and if you watch tarantino's masterpiece today, it's impossible not to recognize just what a breath of fresh air it was (still is, actually). somehow, movies - especially gangster films - never looked quite the same after 'pulp fiction'. probably the most influential film of the last 20 years, it's got simply everything: amazing performances (especially sam jackson); it features some of the most sizzling, iconic dialogue ever written; it has arguably one of the best non-original soundtracks ever - it's such a crazy, cool, inspirational ride that you feel dizzy after watching it for the first time. it's well: it's 'pulp fiction'. 10 stars out of 10. favorite films: http://www.imdb.com/list/mkjokvqlsbs/ lesser-known masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/ favorite tv-shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/";24 July 2014;10;['stylish', 'electrifying', 'tarantino', 'vincent', 'other', 'other', 'natural', 'top', 'theatrical', 'respective', 'most', 'different', 'playful', 'pure', 'much', 'other', 'asian', 'other', 'favorite', 'impossible', 'fresh', 'same', 'influential', 'last', 'amazing', 'sizzling', 'iconic', 'good', 'non', 'original', 'crazy', 'cool', 'inspirational', 'dizzy', 'first', 'favorite', 'favorite'];0.1829506802721088

329;blakiepeterson;"quentin tarantino is a modern cinematic master, but he isn't a hitchcock, a spielberg, or a nolan. those directors, wonderful as they are, took the normalcies left behind by their filmmaking ancestors and spiced them up, making the familiar suddenly indelible. tarantino, on the other hand, has never made something familiar to the viewer. his films, though often paying homage to the greatest of the grind house and the sturdiest of the studio system, twist anything even resembling an expectation maybe the plots of tarantino's films have been portrayed in some way or another before, but don't bet that the dialogue, the actors, the dynamics that fill each scene will match anything you've come to know. ""pulp fiction"" is his most widely adored film, the one where his notable violent tendencies are kept to a comic minimum, the one where his dialogue never rings offensive and his exchanges glow with the smooth wittiness of yesterday's fools. situations don't play out with the professional easiness of a square that went to film school: everything feels as though it were washed and dried by a cinematic nut more fond of staying home friday nights watching pam grier kick ass than going out on the town with slightly drunken friends. even watching a bad movie was better than experiencing the mundanities of life, because bad movies, bad as they were, took them away from the troublesome thing called reality. and so ""pulp fiction"" is a stew of cinematic wonders, some sexy, some funny, some tragic, some bloody like the sordid comic books of the same name, there's unrelenting sleazy appeal to be found among the campy ruins. but the film is more than camp: it's radical noir, thunderously romanticized, delirious in its aesthetical violence. tarantino doesn't just film his actors, his scenes: he falls in love with them, clinging on to their every move, making even the smallest of a detail, of a character, seem enormous in their connection to the overall buoyant picture. tiny intricacies, such as the way john travolta casually corrects uma thurman when she refers to all the waitresses at jack rabbit slim's as marilyn (one is monroe, yes, but the others are actually schlockily dressed like mamie van doren and jayne mansfield), says much about tarantino's filmmaking personality. as much as he loves the icons and movies the general public refers to as masterpieces, he can't help himself from putting the underdogs on a pedestal and letting them shine, even if it's for a blink because ""pulp fiction"" is directed by a cinephile who appreciates everything about cinema, not just the conventional oscar nymphos. there's something about the film that still seems as dangerous as it did in 1994 there has always been daring auteurs in the slippery slopes of hollywood, but exciting is the way that tarantino pushed, and continues to push, boundaries, making madness seem mainstream, luminous. stories intertwine in a fashion reminiscent of 1956's ""the killing"", time hopping yet staggering in its ability to complete each other's sentences. ""pulp fiction"" follows an assortment of characters, all connected: assassins vincent vega (john travolta) and jules winfield (samuel l. jackson), powerful gangster marsellus wallace (ving rhames), his wife, the chic, cocaine addicted mia (uma thurman), washed up boxer butch coolidge (bruce willis), and bank robbers honey bunny (amanda plummer) and pumpkin (tim roth). how they are associated i cannot say (it would ruin the genius of tarantino's screenplay). but each character, so well drawn and so flawlessly portrayed (the actors are excellent, their characterizations already iconic in some shape or form), is unforgettable. look at the way vincent covers up his lack of smarts with his ability to go from agreeable to brutal in a matter of seconds; how jules can enjoy the taste of a hamburger while ready to commit a hit because he's too damn used to killing; how mia can make the mere smoking of a cigarette bolster the same sexy power of ava gardner or louise brooks; how butch is willing to risk he and his girlfriend's (maria de medeiros) life for a watch passed (with disturbing fervor, i might add) on through generations; how honey bunny and pumpkin don't think about the risks of robbing a restaurant because life is short and sin is fun. even the most despicable of characters participate in conversation so complex and blackly hilarious we can hardly help but side with them. tarantino doesn't just write characters; he lives vicariously through them, as if he kept them locked inside his mind until it became time to write the screenplay. among the finest scripts ever written, startling is how confident every line is, how well the performers deliver each sentence. ""pulp fiction"" is a near perfect film, and though i prefer ""kill bill"", one can hardly deny the genius of tarantino. how many directors create worlds as simultaneously grimy, cool, dangerous, humorous, appealing, as he does? if you can name five others, i'll have to take your word for it and revoke mine.";3 July 2015;10;['modern', 'cinematic', 'wonderful', 'familiar', 'indelible', 'tarantino', 'other', 'familiar', 'great', 'sturdy', 'notable', 'violent', 'comic', 'offensive', 'smooth', 'professional', 'cinematic', 'fond', 'drunken', 'bad', 'well', 'bad', 'bad', 'troublesome', 'cinematic', 'sexy', 'funny', 'tragic', 'bloody', 'comic', 'same', 'unrelenting', 'sleazy', 'campy', 'more', 'radical', 'delirious', 'aesthetical', 'small', 'enormous', 'overall', 'buoyant', 'tiny', 'such', 'monroe', 'much', 'general', 'conventional', 'dangerous', 'slippery', 'exciting', 'mainstream', 'luminous', 'reminiscent', 'staggering', 'other', 'powerful', 'chic', 'excellent', 'iconic', 'unforgettable', 'agreeable', 'brutal', 'ready', 'damn', 'mere', 'same', 'sexy', 'willing', 'disturbing', 'short', 'fun', 'despicable', 'complex', 'hilarious', 'fine', 'startling', 'confident', 'near', 'perfect', 'many', 'grimy', 'cool', 'dangerous', 'humorous', 'appealing'];0.0849801587301587

334;ryan_kuhn;"there's just something about pulp fiction that makes it great. it took me a while to figure it out, but i think i found it. this may sound weird, but i think that it's the upbeat message found deep within the movie. what is so upbeat about a story involving 2 hit men (samuel l. jackson and john travolta) who kill at 4 people during the course of the movie, a crooked boxer who promises to take a dive (bruce willis), and a drug pusher (writer/director/average-at-best actor quentin tarantino)? it's not what they do, but how they come to their decisions, the major decisions that they make during the movie that a hopeful vibe comes about. take the characters vincent (travolta, in an oscar nominated role) and jules (jackson) as two under-armed hit men. after the two whack 3 rookie drug dealers, then accidentally shoot their inside man, each goes off their own way and ""save"" someone, both metaphorically and physically, and in doing so, are saved themselves, again both in the physical and metaphoric sense of being saved. the aspect of pulp fiction most remember is the script. things are said by tarantino's characters that had not been said in movies in years. what would normally be cut out by antsy editors are left in here to give the characters depth, add humor to the movie, and gives the audience something to remember. who forgets the first scene of the movie after the opening credits, where vincent and jules discuss hamburgers in europe. or the bible verse sermonized by jules before he goes through with business. and of course, the music selections made by tarantino are almost as important as the script or the actors. it is said that quentin will pick the music for his movies before he writes the script, it is that important to him, and he uses this extra ""character"" in the movie pitch-perfect. the opening credits employ the use of ""miserlou,"" which has become synonymous with tarantino and features songs from the 60s and 70s to add more depth to each character. we know the jules is a funk fan, as he chooses to play ""jungle boogie"" in his car, and that mia (uma thurman) is adding an undertone of sexuality by playing ""girl, you'll be a woman soon"" while entertaining vincent. this scene comes after ""son of a preacher man"" welcomes vincent into her home before the big date at the 60s restaurant where we get to see mr. saturday night fever dance again. the lure to pulp fiction comes from the sum of the parts. the acting is great, humor comes from unexpected places, notably in the final act with harvey keitel's man who cleans up problems, and the music all add up to a good movie. the underlying sense of hope is what gives pulp fiction it's stature as one of the great movies of the 1990s.";13 February 2005;10;['great', 'weird', 'upbeat', 'upbeat', 'crooked', 'average', 'good', 'major', 'hopeful', 'armed', 'inside', 'own', 'physical', 'metaphoric', 'most', 'antsy', 'first', 'bible', 'important', 'important', 'extra', 'perfect', 'synonymous', 'tarantino', 'more', 'entertaining', 'preacher', 'vincent', 'big', 'great', 'unexpected', 'final', 'good', 'great'];0.3392045454545454

338;michael_the_nermal;"this is it---the movie that turned quentin tarantino from a nobody independent film director to one of the titans of film, in a league with griffith, demille, fleming, capra, lean, minnelli, ford, spielberg, lucas, coppola and scorsese, among a whole lot of other directors that are super-famous, but i don't know about because i know little about film as an art. the question: is ""pulp fiction"" a timeless masterpiece that should be put up upon a pedestal? my answer: no. it's a good movie, to be sure, and the main characters are, to an extent, well-developed, but tarantino stuffs his film so full of peculiar hipsterism and allusions to obscure tv shows and movies that it nearly drowns out the plot. it also splits viewers to those ""in the know"" about whatever film or hipster references tarantino is making, and those who haven't a clue, and either feel the film is eccentric or are chagrined to not be smart enough to get it. this movie has forced elitism in cinema to the mainstream, where arcane references and bold gimmicks (such as a distorted time-line) have been lauded as visionary. previous mainstream great films were straightforward in their presentation of the story, but had such great plot and acting that they stood on their own without relying on gimmicks. tarantino takes a decent plot and stuffs it with extraneous stuff and the critics buy into it. this truly is a film that cannot stand on the merits of its actors or plot alone. one thing that will take a viewer off-guard---and which fans tout as an example of tarantino's ""genius""---are the long periods of weird and pointless dialogue punctuated with fast, flashy violence. long dialogue seems like a trademark of tarantino movies, and whether you like or hate his movies depends on how strong your attention span is. in this add world of ours, i'd think long, droning dialogue is a major no-no, but somehow tarantino loves to include it as essential to his films. in some movies, like the ""death proof"" half of ""grindhouse,"" is can be a bataan death march form of torture to have to endure. in ""pulp fiction,"" it can get boring, but is not too terrible. the scenes where travolta and jackson drone on about burgers in france, and where thurman and travolta discuss thurman's audition for a tv show, it is irrelevant and boring, though i'm sure tarantino fans will tell the unwashed among us that we ""just don't get it."" when ving rhames and harvey keitel speak, their words relevant, witty and interesting. jackson's peculiar monologue before killing an enemy, which is a mishmash of bible verses strung together in a rather incoherent, rambling manner, is fun to listen to, as jackson says it with rage and passion, but ultimately is meaningless prattle that does little to further the plot until the last chapter of the movie. in all, ""pulp fiction"" is full of too much talk that accomplishes nothing to further the plot or convey anything revealing or meaningful about the characters. the disposal of a linear plot line is sometimes relevant to a movie, particularly if it is used to emphasize something about a character or a particular scene. in ""pulp fiction"", the nonlinear plot is a device for emphasizing certain characters, whether travolta's, jackson's, or willis's. in essence, ""pulp fiction"" is merely four mini-movies connected only by the thread of common characters (all of whom seem to be working for the crime lord played by ving rhames). tarantino is to be commended, in this instance, for not following through with a straightforward plot and instead treating his film more as a character study. if you try to view this film as anything more than four separate character studies, you get a damned mess. the way this film was sold to the public, the nonlinear device's true purpose was not made clear, and first-time viewers will not understand tarantino's vision on a first-time viewing. in spite of the apparent uniqueness of the nonlinear device, i wonder just how original it is. the violence is gratuitous to an extent, but at least tarantino explores its morality. the characters of bruce willis and samuel jackson are the most important with regards to the exploration of the morality of a life of crime. they are truly three-dimensional characters who reevaluate their lives. the other characters seem one-dimensional and are less interesting by comparison. other than the analysis of morality from the two characters mentioned, tarantino uses violence as a means to shock the viewer. the ""gimp scene"" in the store basement and uma thurman's od scene are simply shocking, with little to recommend to them other than they are violence for the sake of violence. i am not particularly intelligent enough to ""get"" cinema as an art-form, but it seems like violence as an art-form is becoming accepted in serious films, much to the detriment of anything substantive. it is a disturbing trend that tarantino tries to justify as art. i wish ""serious"" movies would rely less on violence-for-violence's sake. it is not intellectually appealing, and is instead disturbing. other than being an interesting series of character studies, ""pulp fiction"" has little else going for it. this movies shows promise for tarantino as a crafter of interesting stories, but at the same time it is too preoccupied with trying to be hip. it has spawned a series of inferior imitators that have lowered the quality of cinema as a whole. for this reason, ""pulp fiction"" has done more harm than good for

345;sandnair87;"quentin tarantino's mesmeric pulp fiction is a slow dance on the killing ground, a prodigious horror-comedy spun out with such ferocious comic glee and buoyancy that belie its seeming cruelty. superficially set in the gang haunts, streets, bistros, apartments, pawnshops and eateries in the cheesiest corners of modern los angeles, this dizzily convoluted noir plunges us into a kind of retro-nightmare fantasy land (formed of tarantino's own pop-drenched experience) that keeps looping back on itself and traps us in a cul- de-sac of double-crosses, absurdity, arousal and danger, never completely sure of where anyone's going or why creating a sheer directionless excitement that only tarantino can conjure. the structure itself is wickedly ingenious: three interconnected stories, bracketed by several preludes and a few codas, are told deliberately out of sequence, with the same cast - a bloody band of outsiders - popping up everywhere. most of the characters are familiar - the boxer who refuses to throw a fight (bruce willis), an obsessive war veteran (christopher walken), a mob boss's jaded wife (uma thurman), two desperate young lovers starting a crime spree (tim roth, amanda plummer), a pair of single-minded hit men who operate within a twisted code of honor (john travolta, samuel l. jackson) - but tarantino's approach to their behavior consistently avoids the stereotypical. by and large these mugs exist in a moral vacuum which, for tarantino, is the ideal atmosphere for cracking jokes while cracking open heads. their tales all start slowly, but soon everyone's destiny plays out as the stories dovetail into outlandish twists. stuff happens in pulp fiction, exhilarating, jaw-dropping, visceral stuff but tarantino weaves the stock stories into an amazingly coherent whole. unlike other action-thrillers, this movie gets its charge not from action pyrotechnics but from its electric barrage of language, wisecracks and dialog, as the lingo takes on a murderous eloquence - a verbal swagger. the tension tarantino creates between the threat of guns and the greater threat of verbal fusillade is electrifying. it's hard to imagine any viewer leaving this extravagantly demented low- life lollapalooza without carrying away at least a few indelible moments. the entire cast, like tarantino, also seems to revel in sloshing around in this muck, each one of them having a time of their lives. pulp fiction also makes it clear, despite its gory content, that tarantino isn't just some punk nihilist on a sick joyride; his movies are all about consequences. there is a moral core in pulp fiction too- a subversive one. but ultimately this is also what makes the movie so unexpectedly buoyant. despite the drugs, the blood, the language and the grit, pulp fiction is fundamentally light-hearted. it's fluff!";20 April 2015;9;['mesmeric', 'slow', 'prodigious', 'such', 'ferocious', 'comic', 'seeming', 'cheesy', 'modern', 'own', 'drenched', 'double', 'sure', 'sheer', 'directionless', 'ingenious', 'several', 'few', 'same', 'bloody', 'most', 'familiar', 'obsessive', 'jaded', 'desperate', 'young', 'single', 'minded', 'twisted', 'stereotypical', 'large', 'moral', 'tarantino', 'ideal', 'open', 'outlandish', 'exhilarating', 'visceral', 'tarantino', 'coherent', 'other', 'electric', 'murderous', 'verbal', 'great', 'verbal', 'hard', 'lollapalooza', 'least', 'few', 'indelible', 'entire', 'clear', 'gory', 'sick', 'moral', 'subversive', 'buoyant', 'light', 'hearted'];0.0272869674185463

350;Jackblyth8;"a hilarious, thrilling rollercoaster captured in essence by the incredible quentin tarantino; 'pulp fiction' sees an impressive cast bonding to create the perfect mural of all things entertaining. the comedy mingles with the seriousness of the film, reinforcing tarantino's intention to make the film a comedy. its structure and overall direction is exquisite, contrasting two different livelihoods and gradually advancing to their relevance. hitmen jules winnfield and vincent vega arrive at an apartment to retrieve a briefcase for their boss, gangster marsellus wallace, from a business partner, brett. after vincent checks the contents of the briefcase, jules shoots one of brett's associates, then declaims a passage from the bible before he and vincent kill brett for trying to double-cross marsellus. they take the briefcase to marsellus, but have to wait while he bribes champion boxer butch coolidge to take a dive in his upcoming match. the next day, vincent purchases heroine from his drug dealer, lance. he shoots up, then drives to meet marsellus's wife mia, whom he had agreed to escort while marsellus was out of town. they eat at a 1950s-themed restaurant and participate in a twist contest, then return home with the trophy. while vincent is in the bathroom, mia finds his heroin, mistakes it for cocaine, snorts it, and overdoses. vincent rushes her to lance's house, where they revive her with an adrenalin shot to her heart. butch betrays marsellus and wins the bout, accidentally killing his opponent. at the motel where he and his girlfriend fabienne are lying low and preparing to flee, butch discovers she has forgotten to pack his father's gold watch, a beloved heirloom, and flies into a rage. returning to his apartment to retrieve the watch, he notices a mac-10 on the kitchen counter and hears the toilet flush. vincent exits the bathroom, and butch shoots him dead, leaving the gun inside. as butch waits at a traffic light in his car, marsellus spots him by chance crossing the road. butch crashes his car into marsellus, leaving both of the men injured and dazed from the accident. after coming to, marcellus takes a gun out and shoots at butch, and then chases him into a pawnshop. the owner, maynard, captures them at gunpoint and ties them up in the basement. zed, a security guard, joins maynard. together, they take marsellus to another room to rape him, leaving ""the gimp"", a silent figure in a bondage suit, to watch butch. butch breaks loose and knocks out the gimp with a punch. he is about to flee but decides to save marsellus, returning with a katana from the pawnshop and kills maynard. marsellus retrieves maynard's shotgun and shoots zed. marsellus informs butch that they are even, as long as he tells no one about the rape and departs los angeles forever. butch picks up fabienne on zed's motorbike, and they drive away. earlier, after vincent and jules have killed brett in his apartment, another man bursts out of the bathroom and shoots at them wildly, but misses with every bullet. afterwards, jules and vincent kill him. jules professes their survival was a miracle, which vincent disputes. as jules drives, vincent accidentally shoots brett's associate marvin in the head, covering themselves and the car in blood in broad daylight. they hide the car at the home of jules' friend jimmie, who demands they deal with the problem before his wife comes home. marsellus sends his cleaner, winston wolfe, who directs jules and vincent to clean the car, hide the body in the trunk, dispose of their bloody clothes, and take the car to a junkyard. at a diner, jules tells vincent that he plans to retire from his life of crime, convinced that their ""miraculous"" survival at the apartment was a sign of divine intervention. while vincent is in the bathroom, a couple dubbed ""pumpkin"" and ""honey bunny"" hold up the restaurant. jules overpowers pumpkin and holds him at gunpoint; honey bunny becomes hysterical and trains her gun on him. vincent returns with his gun aimed at her. jules recites the biblical passage, expresses ambivalence about his life of crime, and allows the robbers to take his cash and leave. jules and vincent leave the diner with the briefcase. providing the unique cyclical structure of ending where we started, 'pulp fiction' is a hilarious creative spectacle. its production and direction is impressive and credit to tarantino for revitalising travolta and willis' acting career's - the director's cameo isn't too bad either. possessing a fast-paced hurry, the film ensures its crime and action is accommodated at all times with jokes and humour, to take away the sense of seriousness. as viewers we are often greeted with a 'happy ending' but the diner scene is more meaningful, samuel l. jackson's character seemingly resents his life of brutality and violence, and is focused on reciting a biblical message. he allows the two lovers to leave free of charge or punishment, in fact paying them for their services, the unusual act sees jules be the 'bigger person', the perfect ending to a film fuelled with extroverts.";9 February 2021;10;['hilarious', 'thrilling', 'incredible', 'impressive', 'perfect', 'entertaining', 'overall', 'exquisite', 'different', 'double', 'upcoming', 'next', 'themed', 'low', 'beloved', 'dead', 'silent', 'loose', 'about', 'associate', 'broad', 'bloody', 'miraculous', 'divine', 'hysterical', 'biblical', 'unique', 'cyclical', 'hilarious', 'creative', 'impressive', 'bad', 'happy', 'din', 'meaningful', 'biblical', 'free', 'unusual', 'big', 'perfect'];0.2803525641025641

363;Svenstadt;it would be hard to call this a bad movie because it isn't. i find it to be much overrated, just on account of all the trendy, popular sentiment the film contains, which are plentiful in tarantino movies, from his silly lines he wrote for crimson tide, to other things. the movie is chock full of cliches and recurrent motifs: from marcellus wallace always getting raped constantly, to butch's good luck, to vincent vega (john travolta) always being in the bathroom when something important happens, to jules winfield's (samuel l. jackson) moving sermons which seemingly summons supernatural deliverance for him. even still, the pacing is uneven. the movie ends where it began, in the diner. this is effective, but i felt in watching it that they do certain things merely for the shock value. people know that naughty things sell well. it is done so well, however, that you quickly realize how good the movie was. the downside is that you are unsure whom to sympathize with. these are all very bad people, and none of them really grow into characters to either villify or root for. for example, when vincent vega dies, you want to laugh, since he dies on the toilet, being knocked back by the recoil of the gun. it's pretty funny when the toaster pops, then he gets blasted! but you don't know what to think or feel anywhere in this movie. this movie contains just a series of victims on an on-again, off-again roller coaster. i don't see the need to ever see this again, because it simply tells a story and doesn't elicit any sympathy at all. if anything, the person you should feel sorry for, marcellus, isn't given enough screen time and isn't the main character. the main plot is the briefcase, which, some have said, contains marcellus's very soul. this seems pretty silly as a plot point since this is a guy ordering hits constantly and getting raped repeatedly. the title pretty much says it all in the beginning definition of the word: it is pulp fiction.;1 December 2019;7;['hard', 'bad', 'trendy', 'popular', 'plentiful', 'tarantino', 'silly', 'crimson', 'other', 'chock', 'full', 'recurrent', 'marcellus', 'good', 'important', 'supernatural', 'uneven', 'effective', 'certain', 'naughty', 'good', 'unsure', 'bad', 'funny', 'sorry', 'enough', 'main', 'main', 'very', 'silly'];0.0498917748917749

366;teh_mode;"watching pulp fiction for the first time is like discovering a new type of music that'll soon be sweeping every wannabe-cool dj's airwaves. watching it for a second time makes you realise just how formulaic and mundane all those seminars and handbooks about ""how to write a hollywood script"" really are. i don't want to criticise the robert mckee class of scriptwriting, we all know that we need the occasional ""mission: impossible"" to tickle our funny bone rather than our minds, but you don't have to be a genius, or indeed a scriptwriter, to work out that pulp fiction really is a true work of art. a film that, despite all it's obvious inspirations, was such an original film, not least one of the most important of the 1990s, spawning all kinds of replicas, inspirations and wannabe filmmakers. the celebration of junk food, bad hair and kitsch cool could never be told with as much fizz or energy as in tarantino's second coming. in the film's opening we meet tim roth and amanda plummer, deliberating in a diner about how no one ever sticks-up restaurants. ""bars, liquor stores, you'll get your head blown off stickin' up one of them!"" roth says, in his south london twang. he has a point too. they decide to rob the place they're in. if only they knew of the consequences. in fact, if only all the characters knew what they were doing. pulp fiction is an endless show of people f'ing things up. john travolta and samuel l. jackson play a pair of 70s-hyperbole laden hit men. a similar set up to the previous scene has our protagonists talking about nothing in particular - burgers, pot, what they put on fries in paris - then launching into a violent tirade among their now pursued yuppie friends, who obviously owe money to the two hit men's boss. it is a shocking switch of tone, one that works seamlessly, and sums up how well tarantino and avary can write. it also shows how violence is simply a way of life for these men. and with all this in mind, authenticity is still right at the back of your mind; pulp fiction is a movie about old movies, not real life. everything from the blazing soundtrack to jackson's hideously groovy afro to the incredibly simple story lines - a boxer throws a fight, but must get his father's watch back before the gangsters find it, a body must be dumped before the wife gets home, a woman od's and must be resuscitated before the her husband (the boss) finds out - is a one huge jollification of everything trashy but cool. and what of the now infamous cast that tarantino so delicately hired to work his script? john travolta has had so many revivals in his fluctuating career, but this role showed us such a new spin on the travolta ball. he is great as the stoner hit-man, who gets himself in deep waters with the boss' woman, played by an equally impressive uma thurman, who nails the moll wife exquisitely - complete with 20s style hair and an irresistible underlying seduction. we all know what bruce willis is capable of when he puts his acting chops to the test, and able assistance is given by the likes harvey keitel, christopher walken (in one the movies' funniest scenes) and tim roth. but it is samuel l. jackson who walks away as the new star in hollywood. with his explosive and dynamic turn as the fast talking, god-fearing partner-in-crime of vincent vega, jules, he delivers most of the movie's many memorable lines, and epitomises the effortlessness of tarantino cool: he is bold, funny, explicit and explosive. his lack of oscar at that years' ceremony should have been filed under the human rights act. a comic book of comedy with enough one-liners to keep the qt devotees annoyingly quoting until it may just seem a bit too good to be true, pulp fiction, even now - with all the time we've had to wrap it up and endure it's obvious imitators - still seems fresh. a film like no other, despite it's obvious homages to godard, film-noir and blaxploitation. it's pretty easy to dismiss his work as violent trash, but yet look at the recipients of all the bad deeds in the film: the ones who ""see the light"" as it were are the ones who succeed, the ones who continue to fall foul to the bad ways of life are the ones who pay for it in the end (one such unlucky character ends up in a rather unenviable position between a redneck rapist and his gun toting partner). in the end, it is a very simple collection of stories about redemption, about people who get themselves in horrible, yet hilarious, situations and have to arduously dig themselves out. its legacy is indisputable. its value is priceless. you haven't seen anything until you see pulp fiction.";10 May 2006;10;['first', 'new', 'cool', 'second', 'formulaic', 'occasional', 'impossible', 'funny', 'true', 'obvious', 'original', 'important', 'wannabe', 'bad', 'much', 'second', 'endless', 'similar', 'previous', 'particular', 'violent', 'shocking', 'tarantino', 'avary', 'right', 'old', 'real', 'groovy', 'simple', 'huge', 'trashy', 'infamous', 'many', 'new', 'great', 'deep', 'impressive', 'moll', 'complete', 'irresistible', 'underlying', 'capable', 'able', 'new', 'explosive', 'dynamic', 'fast', 'most', 'many', 'memorable', 'tarantino', 'bold', 'funny', 'explicit', 'explosive', 'comic', 'enough', 'good', 'true', 'obvious', 'fresh', 'other', 'obvious', 'easy', 'violent', 'bad', 'bad', 'such', 'unlucky', 'unenviable', 'simple', 'horrible', 'hilarious', 'indisputable', 'priceless'];0.0876238168611049

378;Blade_Le_Flambeur;"after opening his film-making career with the violent, gritty 'reservoir dogs' quentin tarantino followed it up with 'pulp fiction'. told with a similar, non-linear storyline the latter follows the criminal lives of many characters, some of which intersect by coincidence. tarantino's style of film-making is often incoherent, messy, and just plain obnoxious. while one can praise his entertainment factor, it's not good enough by itself to make a remarkable film. such is this case with 'pulp fiction' which often relies too much on clever editing, smart acting, and foul language. the film starts off with two lovers talking in a diner: pumpkin (tim roth) and yolanda (amanda plummer). as they discuss previous criminal jobs, they suddenly decide to hold up the diner they're in. after they get up with guns, declaring their intentions the film goes to freeze frame and the opening credits role. to describe the entire plot of 'pulp fiction' would take too long, and is unnecessarily. it follows the lives of two hit men named jules and vincent (academy award nominees john travolta and samuel l. jackson), a mob boss (ving rhames), his oddball wife (uma thurman), and a boxer at the end of his prime (bruce willis). intertwined among these criminal characters are a myriad of different personalities. there's the twisted zed, the classy winston wolf, and of course tarantino himself as jimmy. these characters often come together through different segments and numerous situations. they include a desperate trip to recover a sacred golden watch, a case of someone very important overdosing on heroine, and a botched getaway from a job. the cast is impressive, featuring smaller roles from the likes of steve buscemi, eric stoltz, and christopher walken. while tarantino has an impressive cast list to boot, other elements of the film often go wrong. the first thing that comes to mind in tarantino's films is dialog. he works a labyrinth of different personalities, characters, and events while connecting them with one common theme. the main interaction in 'pulp fiction' is violence. it is sporadic, but it comes in bursts of graphic nature. there is, like in 'reservoir dogs' comedy mixed in with drama and even action. however, stylistically the combination is lacking. tarantino ultimately has to use the f-word to establish a certain emotion or mood in his screenplay, rather than relying on directional technique. the cast emotes his dialog to their best of their abilities and the tough build of jackson is impressive. he gets into his character and fully embodies the hit-man who grows a conscious. the rest of the cast are solid, but jackson ultimately carries the show with his hilarious delivery and tone. technically speaking, 'pulp fiction' doesn't accomplish anything new. there is interesting editing by sally menke, although the photography by andrzej sekula looks dated. a good deal of tarantino's filmography deals more with more with the ""sound"" than the ""look"". there is a fun soundtrack thrown into the mix, but everything looks fairly standard as intended. tarantino's direction feels off base, mainly because the material he gives himself doesn't really go anywhere. 'sin city' is an example of a film that is purely based on style and looks, while tarantino as a filmmaker tries to get a combination of intelligence and entertainment. as these two heads collide, things get messy. does 'pulp fiction' really do anything new for cinema? there's quite a bit of swearing, yes, and the film is looked up to as something out-of-this-world but these are not striking elements. in 'kill bill: vol. 1' tarantino once again heavily copies from other kung fu films, but in that regard he is able to create something distinctly entertaining and visually exuberant. the characters in 'pulp fiction' are degenerates, people who kill for a living and people who use drugs regularly. tarantino has made personal remarks that he condemns this sort of behavior, yet the film stylizes both these elements as if there is a bigger mystique to them then there really is. in the end, i give 'pulp fiction' more than it's fair share of points. it entertains and it has some solid acting-tarantino's (lack of) ability to really pull everything together for a solid point ends up being his wrongdoing once again. 6/10";13 February 2003;6;['violent', 'gritty', 'reservoir', 'similar', 'non', 'linear', 'criminal', 'many', 'incoherent', 'messy', 'obnoxious', 'good', 'remarkable', 'such', 'clever', 'smart', 'foul', 'previous', 'criminal', 'entire', 'oddball', 'criminal', 'different', 'twisted', 'classy', 'different', 'numerous', 'desperate', 'sacred', 'golden', 'important', 'impressive', 'small', 'impressive', 'other', 'wrong', 'first', 'different', 'common', 'main', 'sporadic', 'graphic', 'reservoir', 'tarantino', 'certain', 'directional', 'good', 'tough', 'impressive', 'conscious', 'solid', 'hilarious', 'new', 'interesting', 'good', 'more', 'fun', 'standard', 'tarantino', 'messy', 'new', 'tarantino', 'other', 'able', 'entertaining', 'exuberant', 'personal', 'big', 'more', 'fair', 'solid', 'solid'];0.1191368894758725

""pulp fiction"" easily has ten things going for it (spoilers contained herein): (1) the dialogue is quotable and i still hear quotes from it. (2) the scene with the adrenaline shot is one that should never be duplicated. (3) samuel l. jackson rocked this movie. this was the best performance of his career. (4) harvey keitel was best supporting performer. he was the comic relief and he did very well at it. (5) quentin tarantino is a master writer and master director. (6) the interweaving and rather disturbing tales are told surprisingly well. (7) the film editing was unreal. i think memento took some ideas from this movie. (8) the imagery dealing with god and spirituality made me wonder for a good long time. (9) several rather unknown people show up and make for some memorable performances (burr steers and phil lamarr were in the first third). (10) the movie had a certain cheese factor that made it all the better. ten reasons give a score of 10. cheesy and well-written are clearly two contradictory elements and that is especially true in the medium of film. quentin tarantino proved the world wrong with the release of this movie. it really rules! here ends my rant!";7 March 2003;10;['first', 'initial', 'classic', 'quotable', 'good', 'comic', 'disturbing', 'unreal', 'good', 'long', 'several', 'unknown', 'memorable', 'first', 'certain', 'well', 'contradictory', 'true', 'wrong'];0.1487301587301587
382;FrankBooth_DeLarge;pulp fiction is a very entertaining viewing experience. i've never seen a film as original as pulp fiction. the structure of the movie is so creative, that it's hard to stop watching once you've started. this film is one that is very well liked among people everywhere, but some people don't understand it. the film does happen out of chronological order, as you may already know. being out of chronological order makes it a little bit hard to follow, but having certain things happen at the beginning makes the film more involving the whole way through. (this part contains spoilers) pulp fiction is set up in three stories. stories 1 and 2 do happen in chronological order, but the opening scenes are actually a few clips of the third story, which chronologically happens before the first 2 stories. if that was too confusing, this part might analyze the movie a little bit better for you. in the opening scene we see a man and a woman in a diner talking, and then they start a hold up. then it cuts away to the opening credits. after that we see 2 mafia hit-men, vincent vega (john travolta) and jules winnfield(samuel l jackson) going to an apartment where they are supposed to take care of a few guys who stole a brief case from the mob boss, marsellus wallace. after that scene is when the stories take place. the first story is about how vincent is asked to look after marsellus's wife. the second story is about how a boxer(bruce willis) cut a deal with marsellus and is being pursued by marsellus's hit men. the third story, which is briefly shown at the beginning, picks up after vincent and jules killed most of the men in the apartment, and they accidentally shot one guy in their car, so they try to cover it up before one of their associate's wives finds out about it. basically, from what i got out of this movie, this is an anti crime type of story. throughout the story, certain members of the mob experienced things that would never have happened if they weren't involved with crime. pulp fiction is a movie that everyone experiences differently. if you experienced it the way i did, it will be a film you'll never forget. definitely worth viewing, a very unique type of viewing experience.;9 January 2005;10;['entertaining', 'original', 'creative', 'hard', 'chronological', 'chronological', 'little', 'hard', 'certain', 'whole', 'chronological', 'few', 'third', 'first', 'confusing', 'little', 'well', 'few', 'brief', 'first', 'vincent', 'second', 'third', 'most', 'anti', 'certain', 'worth', 'unique'];0.0808095238095238

389;Hawkensian;"'pulp fiction' is a film with few flaws particularly worth mentioning. since its release in 1994, the film has become nothing short of legendary; some may feel its praise from hipsters and venerable critics alike is undue, but i don't think it is. the film's non-linear narrative is so strong, so rich; it keeps you thoroughly engaged and develops the characters in such a way that you begin to run through your head the chronology of the characters' stories, making sense of tarantino and avary's complex script. this complexity makes 'pulp fiction' very re-watchable, i have seen it many times, and recently i was lucky enough to catch a screening at the duke of york's picturehouse in brighton, which was an experience that reminded me of how special this film is. 'pulp fiction' explores the following principal characters: vincent vega and jules winnfield, a pair of loquacious hit men who appear to exist in a style vacuum; butch coolidge, an ageing but courageous prize fighter; marsellus wallace, a seemingly omnipotent mobster and mia wallace, the flirtatious wife of mr. wallace whom vincent vega is assigned to take out to dinner. the characters' stories famously clash with each other, regularly to chaotic and hilarious effect. tarantino is yet to return to this kind of form. after 'jackie brown' in 1998, he spent time making the entertaining but comparably meagre 'kill bill' films, which were well orchestrated viscera, but ultimately below him. he then made 'death proof', which was an offensively bad, juvenile piece of work with a script of unprecedented annoyance. however, tarantino made a comeback with 'inglourious basterds', which had a rather appealing premise and many memorable scenes. 2013 sees the launch of 'django unchained', which, with its ensemble cast and inevitable flair, is one of the most exciting films of the year. 'pulp fiction' has all the components of a classic, it has the scope and the quality, it is within the bracket of films such as 'the godfather', 'goodfellas' and 'citizen kane', films that will be revisited by audiences forever, films that are firmly considered as 'required viewing'.";11 September 2012;9;['few', 'worth', 'short', 'legendary', 'venerable', 'undue', 'non', 'linear', 'strong', 'rich', 'tarantino', 'complex', 'watchable', 'many', 'lucky', 'special', 'principal', 'loquacious', 'courageous', 'omnipotent', 'flirtatious', 'other', 'chaotic', 'hilarious', 'tarantino', 'entertaining', 'orchestrated', 'bad', 'juvenile', 'unprecedented', 'inglourious', 'appealing', 'many', 'memorable', 'ensemble', 'inevitable', 'exciting', 'such', 'required'];0.2329004329004329

391;rebecca-ry;'pulp fiction' is seen as a modern classic. it scores 9/10 here because it really is a great film, it makes you laugh on more than one occasion and can become extremely violent within seconds. john travolta and samuel l. jackson are the best characters in the plot, their dialogue with each other is hilarious. jackson's monologues can be really frightening and he proves just how great an actor he is. their part in the film is also probably the most violent. bruce willis' part is very brief but, again it can be quite funny and extremely graphic. it's difficult to tell whether he is good at acting in this film because he's pretty much playing bruce willis, he can play a different character in other films but his 'tough-guy' approach is also effective, it particularly suits this role well. travolta and uma thurman's section is also very short but is incredibly well done, not just by the actors but by tarantino's direction too. amanda plummer and tim roth's short screen appearances are also very well written, their almost comic performances work great in this film. overall, the plot can be confusing, you see characters die and then a few chapters later they're alive. tarantino sets it out in a random order but at the end it will all make sense, this can put off some people and can make the film less enjoyable but the content of each 'chapter' keep you entertained and are genuinely interesting. the dialogue is, as is usually the case with tarantino's work, very life-like. how he manages to get conversations in film so realistic and natural is amazing. the soundtrack is also really good, in some scenes it really adds either humour or dramatic effect. overall, i would strongly recommend this film, it is a classic. if you've never seen a tarantino film this would be a good place to start.;9 May 2012;9;['modern', 'great', 'more', 'violent', 'good', 'other', 'hilarious', 'frightening', 'great', 'violent', 'brief', 'funny', 'graphic', 'difficult', 'good', 'different', 'other', 'tough', 'effective', 'short', 'short', 'comic', 'great', 'confusing', 'few', 'alive', 'tarantino', 'random', 'enjoyable', 'interesting', 'like', 'realistic', 'natural', 'amazing', 'good', 'dramatic', 'tarantino', 'good'];0.136984126984127

401;Mnemosyne15;the film uses five separate segments to show us the story in a non-narrative manner from multiple angles. at first glance, the five segments seem to have no connection. this is not the case. each story is closely linked to each story. and each story has the protagonist of each story. in other people's stories, you can only be a trivial passer-by by chance. in your world, you are your own protagonist, but you cannot do whatever you want, because you cannot leave the big world. in the big world, everyone is a small role, and no one is the real protagonist. at the beginning of the film, the couple intends to rob the restaurant as if everything is under their control. at the end of the film, he returned to the restaurant, but at this time the protagonist has become jules, and the little couple has become a stepping stone for the self-redemption of the gang member jules. for another example, when the killer vinson was with martha's wife mia, they danced and twisted to get the trophy, as if the world were revolving around them. but in a blink of an eye, the gold medal killer vinson was shot by the most familiar gun in boxer's butch chapter. the film uses the restaurant story as the beginning and the end, not only because the restaurant fragment is at the center of all the fragments, but also because jules and vinson have different views on not being shot at close range, which ultimately leads to their fate. different. in the restaurant, jules thought that this miracle was god's guide to him, and he decided to wash his hands in a golden basin. vinson only thought it was a weird coincidence. when vinson went to the toilet, a little couple in the restaurant robbed the restaurant with a gun, but they met a killer who often killed someone with a gun. the little couple was quickly controlled by jules. but jules did not kill them. he had decided to rehabilitate, so he let the little couple away and even gave them his money. after the timeline after the luggage was delivered, we did not see the group jules again. when delivering the luggage, the arrogant vinson annoyed the boxer butch. butch missed the fake punch and was chased by the gangster. to kill, vincent was sent to monitor butch's home, but he was shot dead when butch returned home to collect his gold watch. although they are all killers, one likes the bible, one loves vulgar novels, one believes in the miracles of god, one thinks weird coincidence, one is humble, one is arrogant, and two attitudes determine two destinies. in the end one wandered around to help others, and one died of arrogance in the grab of someone else and went to extinction. the accidental factor, the attitude to life, and the living environment determine the inevitable fate of a person. maybe you think that small things that are not important often involve or even determine your fate.;12 March 2020;8;['separate', 'non', 'narrative', 'multiple', 'first', 'other', 'trivial', 'own', 'big', 'big', 'small', 'real', 'little', 'familiar', 'different', 'close', 'different', 'golden', 'weird', 'little', 'little', 'little', 'arrogant', 'fake', 'dead', 'bible', 'vulgar', 'weird', 'humble', 'arrogant', 'accidental', 'inevitable', 'small', 'important'];-0.0893229166666666

404;joshuafagan-64214;"if i may, let me note what a year 1994 was for film. this film. shawshank. gump. the lion king. if someone came up to me and started ranting about how this was the best cinematic year ever, i'd actually listen to them for awhile before asking them why they are getting in my face. of those films, this and shawshank stand out, because they were not pre-established blockbusters. gump and lion king were expected to be pretty big, and just turned out bigger than anyone could possibly imagine. but these films were smaller, more personal projects. they are also quite different from each other in almost every other way; a notable one being that while shawshank barely made back its budget at the box office, this film took off. over the last couple weeks, with steve jobs and the like, we have examples of platforming failing. but it can succeed: this film is a prime example of that. this is important not just if you're incurably a nut about these sort of things, like am i. it means that this is the first exposure a lot of people had with a tarantino film. i bet a lot of people became fans for life at some random matinee screenings some cloudy tuesdays. this is one of those films that i would have loved to be there at one of its early screenings. a lot of minds were opened those days. i hope i'm not overselling this film, but it is one of those films that is so great that it is nearly impossible to oversell, which is a positive for me, as i love my gushing descriptions, as you might be able to tell if you read my review of mad max: fury road. one thing that must be noted about this film is that it goes out of order, and not a semi-organized out of order like memento. this does not make the film hard to follow- it is easier to follow than memento, at any rate- but it does make you think on your feet. sometimes, i think that this whole movie is a then-young mr. tarantino taking a hunk of dynamite to the usual three-act structure. and it is glorious. no film better encapsulates the rush of exciting new filmmakers that we had in the 90s than this one. the title describes this film so well. it's not based on the style of blockbuster films. this isn't jaws or indiana jones. this is darker, dirtier, less-universally subject matter. this is the equivalent of those books you keep for a trip to the doctor's office or the dmv just so you can be pulled out of the doldrums of life. it's not trying to be one of those great american novels written by fitzgerald or steinbeck that is typically only read by 'normal people' when they are in an english class or when they feel particularly scholarly. of course, most of those novels were not particularly good, even at being what they are. this film is. it's clever, action-packed, well-written, and so much more. it represents a stark change from the happy-go-lucky (sometimes), subtle (often), and averse from breaking new ground (usually) attitudes of eighties movies and holds up a banner for nineties film. in the nineties, the same techniques that were developed for dark and gritty and serious movies like the godfather or apocalypse now were being played apart the fabric of the mainstream. yes, kids movies got even cheesier and less legit. but they no longer defined the market like they did in the prior decade. artistic exploration became the norm. and few did that more than mr. tarantino, particularly in this film. yes, if pulp fiction is what people expected, pulp fiction is what they got. but they did not get it in the way that they expected. to once more go back to mm:fr, i'm willing to be there were people who went into that film expecting to see just another action film in the style of the dime-a-dozen die hard and james bond knock-offs that pop up so often every year. their experience with that movie is probably on the level as anyone who came into this film expecting to see a mere piece of pulp fiction. this film is not a part of that 'genre', if you can call it that, but both an homage to it and its leading light. it transcends its grounds, its place in time, and perhaps even the medium of film itself. it is pure artistry. i cannot exaggerate how much of a breath of fresh air this was. pretty much every problem with film in the eighties was given an antidote. it's also a good cure for everything from with major filmmaking today, though i argue that a more artsy version of the hunger games series would be a better one. but that's just me. as you might expect from a film that took off like this, it launched several careers and revived others, including that of john travolta, who for once uses his overacting to his advantage. the soundtrack, of course, is phenomenal and iconic. enough so that when i wrote the words pulp fiction down on the page, the first thing that popped into my mind was the title theme (misirlou as covered by dick dale and the daletones, in case you were wondering). above all, when i watched this film, i felt a love for film and artistry, as well as a desire to build upon the works of the past while making a unique mark. it enraptures you in itself. honestly, i'm kinda surprised that it took off like it did back then. but i'm not surprised that it's remembered today. it holds a unique place in society and is one of the definitive 90s films. enjoy.";6 November 2015;10;['good',

407;cutter-12;"the movie that defines the sensibilities of generation x. that is to say its values are worthless, the story is lurid and over extended, the writer/director is overwhelmingly self-indulgent and tacky (any revelations to do with christianity are twisted by tarantino to fit his obscene sense of morality), the violence is absolutely incredulous, and the originality to do with non linear plot lines and everything else is greatly exaggerated (try watching some early kubrick to get an idea where he ripped it off. -- hell try watching 50 other trashy independent exploitation flicks from the 50's and 60's to see how much ""originality"" tarantino has.) i'm not going to make any friends here, as this film has obviously snowed everyone who's commented on it, but who cares. despite some extremely intelligent and powerhouse acting from samuel l. jackson, pulp fiction is a n experience not unlike having your face smashed into a urinal by a criminally insane biker in the bathroom at a race track between race four and five. it is an offensive and disturbing trip through the mind of a filmmaker who is as far from being a genius as the earth is from neptune. quentin tarantino is not orson welles. and pulp fiction is a film which only speaks to a generation pre-occupied with body piercing and anti-depressants. make no mistake, i am more of an atheist than a christian, but even i am outraged that people find deep meaning in a killer seeing the light and turning over a new leaf by letting the piece of garbage petty crook snake out the door with everyone's wallet he has terrorized at gunpoint along with his wigged out nutcase of a girlfriend you'd just wish tony minero would ice. if he truly was making a spiritual point and sincerely trying to do the right thing he'd have given tim roth his wallet, told him to leave the bag and apologize to everyone on his way out. off to a flawed start as a christian. and the fact that tarantino lets us see that roth and plummer's characters aren't terrible people but just actors before they pull their heist is also a load of crap. then there's the completely sickening la underworld psycho scene (a personal tarantino fantasy?) to do with sodomy and a couple of hillbillies which was done much truer and to better effect in boorman's deliverance. does anyone truly come away finding this scene to be entertaining? and if so , if you're ever in my town please keep driving. quentin tarantino is truly one sick puppy. sure, he does write some nifty dialogue if you can hear it amid the cacophony of mf and n words, but as far as talent for film-making goes he hasn't got an idea. he couldn't act his way out of a box made of wet tissue paper (spielberg gave a better performance in the blues brothers) and visually he has nothing to offer at all. if anyone knows his influences, and he speaks of them often, you will know how all of the people he holds dear and in high regard (especially howard hawks) would phone the swat team on him rather than invite him to sit at their table. and to sum up my point, what can you expect from a guy who prattles on and on and on about how great a film rio bravo is. before any more gen x and y'ers announce to the world that this is the greatest film ever made, please see some other movies beforehand!!!!!!!!!!!!! start with citizen kane.";28 October 2001;1;['worthless', 'lurid', 'indulgent', 'tacky', 'tarantino', 'obscene', 'incredulous', 'non', 'linear', 'exaggerated', 'early', 'other', 'trashy', 'independent', 'much', 'intelligent', 'urinal', 'insane', 'offensive', 'disturbing', 'pre', 'anti', 'more', 'outraged', 'deep', 'new', 'wigged', 'tony', 'spiritual', 'right', 'flawed', 'tarantino', 'terrible', 'personal', 'tarantino', 'much', 'well', 'sick', 'nifty', 'wet', 'well', 'dear', 'high', 'great', 'more', 'great', 'other'];-0.0792883116883116

409;walsh-22;i prefer pulp fiction to reservoir dogs. i find it to be the funniest out of the two. there are so many funny situations that has me in stitches and it mainly involves vincent and jules. the scenes i laugh the most at is when vincent shoots marvin accidentally in the head, jules and vincent cleaning the car after and when vincent brings an o-ding mia to lance's house, that just has me in stitches every time. i loved the interaction between jules and vincent. i couldn't wait for the film to switch back to them because they had really good chemistry, they were so hilarious together and i just enjoyed their reactions to the situations they found themselves in throughout the movie. i like that again quentin tarantino shoots the film out of sequence because it means that john travolta who is shot in the middle of the movie, is alive at the end. there are other story lines entined in the film- ringo and yolanda robbing the coffee shop, mia and vincent's date, butch (a boxer) who is paid to take a dive but ends up killing his opponent and trying to keep one step ahead of vincent and jule's boss marsellus wallace but as i have said i am more interested in the scenes that feature vincent and jules. i can see why this film was the comeback vehicle for john travolta as he is just brilliant in it and it never seems like he doesn't belong in the role, what i also like about his role is he is not afraid to send himself up which we see especially in the dance scene with uma thurman. i can't imagine anyone else in samuel l. jackson's part, he just makes it his own. the other actors who i feel make the film entertaining is uma thurman, ving rhames, rosanna arquette and eric stoltz. yes, it has violence, some people class it as racist, i really don't know, maybe i'm wrong but i get the impression he is not doing it to be racist but is showing a world that not anyone sees or thinks still exists. it might be ugly but at least it is honest in saying our world is not as perfect as we think and the subjects covered in the film are happening somewhere. i have respect for quentin tarantino for not copping out and not trying to soften the hard core subjects the film features such as drug use and murder. a very good job, quentin.;2 March 2008;10;['many', 'funny', 'vincent', 'ding', 'good', 'hilarious', 'tarantino', 'alive', 'other', 'interested', 'brilliant', 'afraid', 'own', 'other', 'entertaining', 'wrong', 'racist', 'ugly', 'least', 'honest', 'perfect', 'hard', 'such', 'good'];0.1979166666666666
410;chas437;this film was wildly popular in the mid-90s, and i'll admit to enjoying it back then. but, 25 years later, it hasn't aged well. tarantino's slick innovative cinematic style is now seen as gimmicky and trite. the staggered time line thing has been overdone to death. when you get past all the imagery and hip dialogue, there's really nothing there. its not really storytelling, the screenplay is probably the worst thing about pulp fiction. ironic that tarantino's screenplay was the only oscar winner. i give it 5 stars because there were substantial innovations in the film, just not enough to overcome the total lack of substance.;26 May 2019;5;['popular', 'slick', 'innovative', 'cinematic', 'gimmicky', 'trite', 'overdone', 'bad', 'ironic', 'only', 'substantial', 'enough', 'total'];0.015
411;commandercool88;without a doubt, 'pulp fiction' is one of the best pieces of postmodern film-making we have at our disposal. it is an audaciously entertaining hunk of pop culture, a feisty showing from quentin tarantino and one of his most raving successes. it's gloriously profane, unapologetically gratuitous, but not without purpose or meaning. with its underlying theme of redemption that runs through the veins of each story tarantino tackles, 'pulp fiction' becomes an exhilarating and daring masterpiece. with a brilliant twist on the traditional three act set-up, tarantino rolls expectations on their side and masterfully spins a web of many threads and intersects. jam packed with adrenaline and unexpected twists and turns around every corner, 'pulp fiction' never panders to its audience and never passes up a wicked change-up thrown directly at the audience. we quickly pick up on the fact that this is not just violence for the sake of violence or vulgarity for the sake of vulgarity but a man wrestling with the very meaning of life. and what an extraordinary film it has made for, executed perfectly down to the very last detail. each episode that tarantino captures on film is simultaneously self-contained and apart of a whole. the sum of its parts is great, and whether it's samuel l. jackson's fury reigning down on the evil tyranny, or uma thurman sipping seductively on a five dollar shake, or bruce willis dismantling a hotel room in search for a wristwatch, 'pulp fiction' is never, ever dull. it carries a hefty running time (more than two-and-a-half hours), but we're constantly kept on our toes and immersed with the character tarantino has zeroed in on. his writing here is fantastic, each line of dialogue delivered with calm confidence and each story developed with thrilling style. there's an abundance of fantastic performances to be admired within 'pulp fiction'. john travolta's vincent, uma thurman's mia, bruce willis' butch, ving rhames' marsellus, tim roth's ringo. but perhaps none more compelling and crackling than samuel l. jackson's jules. his is the highlight of tarantino's picture, a commanding role and fascinating character in search for redemption and a new outlook on life. when all is said and done, his story will still resonate most powerfully. it all goes back to quentin tarantino's immense ability to tell a story that not only keeps audiences entertained but has a purpose and destination. a great, great film that will leave an unforgettable impression you'll be itching to relive again. more reviews at rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public;27 July 2008;10;['good', 'postmodern', 'entertaining', 'feisty', 'raving', 'profane', 'gratuitous', 'underlying', 'tarantino', 'exhilarating', 'daring', 'brilliant', 'traditional', 'tarantino', 'many', 'unexpected', 'wicked', 'very', 'extraordinary', 'last', 'tarantino', 'great', 'evil', 'dull', 'hefty', 'more', 'fantastic', 'calm', 'fantastic', 'compelling', 'fascinating', 'new', 'immense', 'great', 'great', 'unforgettable', 'more'];0.339121212121212

417;Det_McNulty;"following the success of 1992's reservoir dogs, quentin tarantino released his finest film to-date, the self-proclaimed masterpiece pulp fiction; a film which is arguably the most influential of the last few decades, and one which stands alone as a ""to-be"" classic. pulp fiction remains widely regarded as one of the essentials in modern cinema, which has established itself as a film for the lovers of cinema, as those are the people it gets its greatest amount of admiration from. pulp fiction marked the new-wave, avant-garde cinema, it became recognised for its vigorously exciting flavour and unfathomable cool. revolving around a deconstructed narrative, composed of three stories, which are all insanely surreal, pulp fiction brings you inside a world quentin tarantino has successfully crafted through individuality. the film starts with a lavishly entertaining conversation of tension and wit between two robbers, one being tim roth and the other being amanda plummer, who kick-start the film with furious energy. this scene is then followed by the infamous conversation of amsterdam and burgers between the justifiable ""cool"" of jules (samuel l. jackson) and vincent (john travolta). from here on in you have entered a world fuelled by greed and missing-morality. sure, pulp fiction is undoubtedly one of the ""coolest"" and ""hippest"" films around, nevertheless it holds much, much more than that. the film stands as a piece which depicts the psychology of normal people who have been thrown into extreme circumstances, meaning their personalities have changed along with their situation. it is a film which is much than amusingly clever on the surface, as in fact pulp fiction juggles allegory, such as the ""freedom"" of amsterdam being a counterpart for the film's non-conformist, disobedient nature. the film has countless recurring themes, such as redemption, vengeance, spirituality, morality, individual morals, and a person's mannerisms. even behind the film's humorous anecdotes there is still a lingering sense of haunting poignancy the film throws upon its viewer. the inviting environments are simply an innovative showcase for a study of one's ethics and the dealing of horrendously problematical situations. the characters are all vigorously layered, with multi-dimensional emotions and spontaneous behaviour. when i say that every actor performs with undeniable perfection, i mean it. from christopher walken's cameo as captain koons, to bruce willis' alpha-male, yet kind-hearted ""boxer-thug"" performance. everyone in the film sets themselves a back-drop for their character, letting every character differentiate between one-an-other. yet, as harvey keitel states in the film, ""of course you're character, but it doesn't mean you have character"". dense script-writing, and what might seem like entirely irrelevant dialogue lets pulp fiction become its own piece. and rather than being driven by plot, the film is driven by its variety of surreal characters, who all talk in a way which seems so real. yes, the conversations may not to be the same topic you talk about with another person, but the way in which a conversation branches off to an entirely different topic is something we all do in everyday life. few films are able to portray dialogue through such a method, which is one of the countless reasons as to why quentin tarantino's script is the key instinctive foundation behind the film, since it lays the rules of what is to occur in a latter scene. the script crafts the comedy, as there are no comedic set-pieces in the film, nor is there a comedic narrative. however, the actors' delivery of nerve-biting, ego-driven lines, which brim with humour and emphasised body language, gives the film its distinguished tone of dark comedy. one of the reasons pulp fiction has become so iconic is due to its diversity in film-making, which is comprised of influences from french new-wave cinema, to asian crime flicks, yet the film is still entirely original. quentin tarantino ultimately creates his own sense of ""bravo-film-making"". the use of tracking-shots, dolly-zooms, variation in lens focus, quick-cut editing, slow-motion sequences, lyrical camera positioning, steadicam tactics and close-up camera shots, the variety pulp fiction has is not just held within inside its narrative, but within its technical side too. then you have the dynamic use of music, which has clearly been hand-picked by quentin tarantino himself and suits the film with a simplistic level of ease. the set-pieces are also crafted with scrutinising detail, such as the notorious lair, involving two hillbillies, a gimp and two of the film's protagonists. pulp fiction is, quite simply, a hard-boiled, noir-toned masterpiece of modern cinema, comprised of film-making which deserves to be dissected frame-by-frame. the sheer unadulterated consistency of greatness pulp fiction follows means it is a film which should be watched again and again. yes, all the characters might be ""sinners"", yet there is no denying that you will be rooting for a certain character(s) by the end of the film, as surely, with characters as diverse as these there must be someone you share the same belief with, right? devine-intervention is what pulp fiction is, a miracle and one which justifies vast acknowledgement. take for example jimmy's (quentin tarantino) brief conversation on the ""gourmet"" of coffee, it sums up the magnificence of pulp fiction perfectly, not forgetting the addition of ""lots of cream, lots of sugar"".";18 June 2007;7;['reservoir', 'fine', 'influential', 'last', 'few', 'modern', 'great', 'new', 'avant', 'garde', 'exciting', 'unfathomable', 'surreal', 'entertaining', 'other', 'furious',

420;thewillt08;"a movie in which really has no main characters, a crazy plot, and insane dialogue. that is basically what sums up pulp fiction. quentin tarantino wasn't really known before pulp fiction, but after this movie he became one of the best directors in recent memory. i can't even tell you what the movie is about. travolta, samuel l. jackson, uma thurman, and bruce willis all have their stories and they all somehow intertwine, that's really it. the plot makes no sense and the entire movie is confusing from the opening to ending credits. after the credits roll your mind starts piecing together and then you will realize that this movie is unique and brilliant. from the first scene of the movie i was hooked. the audience is introduced to pulp fiction in the middle of a conversation at a diner. honey bunny and pumpkin are talking and my attention was drawn to my tv. i intended on multitasking on the internet while watching but instantly i was drawn into their conversation. i recognized tim roth from lie to me and was curious what he was doing in this movie. the entire scene was just brilliant starting with a simple conversation and ending with a robbery of the diner. then it was the next scene. i put the laptop down because i knew this movie deserved my full attention. pulp fiction is simply classic tarantino. the original story, similar actors, creative dialogue, and an amazing score push the story along and make it what it is. other than travolta, there really is no ""main character"". i consider the script and the words the characters say as a character. if you break the movie down, very little actually happens. travolta and samuel l. jackson have a solid 10-15 minute conversation about cheeseburgers and a foot massage. i don't know how they did it but they made a conversation about a foot massage very entertaining. a script like pulp fiction's does not come around lightly. this was one of the most interesting and captivating screenplays i have ever seen on film. there is not one boring scene in this movie because of the interesting conversations. this movie has a very long list of big actors, my favorite being christopher walken. he is only in the movie for one scene, but it is my favorite scene. young butch is watching tv and incomes walken playing his father's pow friend. his father fought and died in the war and walken had something to give him. walken goes on a speech about a gold watch his father and himself hid from the vietnamese. the delivery and presentation in this scene is hysterical. the camera never moves, all we see is walken holding the watch and telling his story. it is a scene like this where you feel the words and their impact. i will say it all throughout this review; the words are what make this movie. as far as plot, there really is none. there are stories of individuals whose lives intertwine. what makes this movie special is that the scenes are out of order. i loved that it had this effect. the movie starts in the diner and then we never see them again, until the end. it's brilliant. after the movie i took a piece of paper and drew out the pulp fiction timeline. if a movie makes you think then it does its job, but this went above and beyond. i wanted to re-watch the movie in the correct sequence, but honestly, if i did, the movie is awful. if this movie was in the order of events it would be pointless and meaningless. it would be a ridiculous movie with weird dialogue. instead, the audience is left wondering what is going on and we get sucked into the universe that is, quentin tarantino. do i like that the movie is out of order? well, yes and no. my really only problem is that all of the actors are seen once and most of them are never seen again. in the first opening scenes samuel l. jackson was so entertaining but then he left and we don t see him again for a very long time. the movie skips ahead to travolta and uma thurman's night on the town. i missed seeing samuel l. jackson on screen. then we get sucked into bruce willis' story and i missed travolta and uma thurman, but i was so interested with bruce willis, i didn't even care. i guess what i'm trying to say is, i loved these characters and wanted to see all of them at once, which i realize isn't possible. i wanted them to have more interaction with each other, but then again, that would have probably made the movie a lot worse. another problem with the scene jumping is the irrelevance of events. once scene one character gets blown away and killed by another. at that time it was a huge deal because one of the characters died, but in the next sequence he was alive again walking around being awesome. it took away from his death and almost made it pointless. if you pay attention towards the end we see why he dies but it almost seemed unnecessary and random that he died. tarantino made this movie not intending to make a sequel, but he never reveals what is in the briefcase that jules carries around. why not?

430;matlefebvre20;"three stories into one. this is ""pulp fiction"", one of the most incredible movies i've ever seen. just after seeing the first story, which stars john travolta and uma thurman, i was satisfied with the movie. the second (and the best) story, with bruce willis, made me understand that the movie deserved a 5/5. add another story, with travolta and samuel l. jackson, and you know that ""pulp fiction"" is simply perfect and a revolution into the film industry. what impressed me the most is the structure of the movie. even before the opening credits appear, you assist to a conversation between a young man and his girlfriend who decide to rob the restaurant in which they eat, because it would be an easy job. they both shout ""hands up!"", just when director quentin tarantino cuts the scene starts the credits and then shifts elsewhere. vincent (travolta) and jules (jackson) are about to meet their boss marcellus (ving rhames), but they meet other guys and the scene (that i baptized scene a) ends tragically, but not for everybody. the first story begins. vincent and mia(thurman), marcellus' wife meet each other for a drug trade. they go to a 50's drive-in and they participate into a dance competition, which they win. it shouldn't be surprising, when the dance man is john travolta. it's clearly visible that he hasn't buried the grease and saturday night fever days. but the story ends less happily as mia overdoses herself and vincent brings her to the dealer who sold him the drug. in order to re-animate mia, vincent has to perform into the most shocking scene i've ever seen. cut to the second story. young butch is given his deceased father's gold watch by capt. koons(christopher walken). actual butch(willis), a boxer, wakes up from this dream and goes to the ring. we never see a single scene from the combat, but the radio announcer tells that butch fought his adversary so hard that he killed him. unaware that he actually killed his opponent, butch flees to the motel where his wife fabienne waits for him. fabienne forgot butch's watch and the boxer goes back to his home to get it. but he discovers a gun on his oven and at the same moment, vincent goes out from the bathroom. instinctly, butch takes the gun and shoots vincent to death. butch flees in his car and marsellus appears in front of him. butch runs over marsellus, but the boss wants butch's head and he pursuits him to an electronic store. both men are taken hostages by the salesman and the sexual-obsessed policeman on the scene. they're able to free themselves. butch kills the salesman with a japanese sabre, while marcellus shoots the policeman into the genitals. my god, this is something entirely new for the violence genre! this is some kind of depiction and exaggeration of today's everyday violence and it's absolutely awesome. the aggressiveness and the violent instinct, as well as the sexual needs make the characters intriguing and fascinating, if not frightening. in their minds, violence is neither funny, nor dramatic. violence has just lost its signification and it becomes the only employable language into their world. this world has lost of its logic and moral working, turning itself into a savage jungle filled of barbaric people. the third story begins with the scene a and its followings. vincent and jules bring a friend into their car. during the ride, vincent inadvertently shoots him and the vehicle is filled of blood and a corpse lays on the back seat. vincent and jules visit a friend, jimmy(tarantino), and try to find a solution. soon, winston wolf(harvey keitel) arrives and tells them what to do. the following scenes are filled with drama, as well as extreme-black humor. vincent and jules decide to take breakfast in a restaurant, but the place they chose is about to be taken over by robbers. so, the first scene of all superimposes itself. what follows is images of drama, as well as this ultra-violence and that taste for anarchy and robbery. ""pulp fiction"" is simply a classic. its revolutionary structure and stories make it twisting and intriguing and the characters that we see here are only superficial, especially the main ones. jules takes violence as a simple aspect of life and his religious chats are somehow special. butch is a soul-tortured boxer who acts like violence was as normal as breathing. the drug use and the sexual situations into the movie may be controversial, but they're just other elements from a mad world, in which violence, absurdity and foolishness are the order of the day.";19 April 2006;10;['incredible', 'first', 'satisfied', 'second', 'good', 'perfect', 'most', 'young', 'easy', 'about', 'other', 'first', 'other', 'surprising', 'visible', 'shocking', 'second', 'young', 'deceased', 'actual', 'single', 'unaware', 'oven', 'same', 'electronic', 'sexual', 'able', 'japanese', 'marcellus', 'new', 'everyday', 'awesome', 'violent', 'sexual', 'intriguing', 'fascinating', 'frightening', 'funny', 'dramatic', 'only', 'employable', 'moral', 'barbaric', 'third', 'back', 'extreme', 'black', 'about', 'first', 'ultra', 'revolutionary', 'intriguing', 'superficial', 'main', 'simple', 'religious', 'special', 'normal', 'sexual', 'controversial', 'other', 'mad'];0.1459415584415584

440;chrstphrtully;1994 was an interesting film year, in that it produced two of the most highly lauded films in recent memory -- pulp fiction and forrest gump -- which, in my humble opinion, are both grossly overrated. i'm not sure i could say pulp fiction is the worse of the two, but it's certainly the more disappointing. the reason for this is that quentin tarantino's script demonstrates his flair for hip, knowing dialogue, and his ability to use such dialogue to take the edge off violence (a good or bad thing, depending upon your views). the problem is that, rather than use this gift to create characters in whom you are actually interested in following, tarantino instead opts for the equivalent of writing and directorial masturbation -- i.e., showing what he can do merely for the purpose of showing that he can do it, without any real concern for character or plot. such an approach may be call for praise from critics and devotees, but for me they are a grievously missed opportunity. indeed, what was wildly praised as ingenious film-making (i.e., through the non-linear and looping time order of the scenes) instead smacks of an effort to cover up the lack of coherence in plot and character. as for the highly lauded performances, only three really stand out for me, and two -- harvey keitel and christopher walken -- in glorified cameos. the only other truly developed character is that of samuel l. jackson, whose character discovers something from his experiences, and attempts to act on what he has learned. the other performances in the film range from the passable (ving rhames), to the flat (bruce willis), to the really annoying (john travolta, uma thurman, amanda plummer). if you want to see the best tarantino film, watch a film where he creates believable characters and puts them through their paces, albeit with the help of elmore leonard source material -- jackie brown.;6 September 2009;3;['interesting', 'recent', 'forr', 'humble', 'sure', 'bad', 'disappointing', 'such', 'good', 'bad', 'interested', 'tarantino', 'directorial', 'real', 'ingenious', 'non', 'linear', 'glorified', 'only', 'other', 'other', 'passable', 'flat', 'annoying', 'good', 'tarantino', 'believable', 'elmore'];0.0347222222222222

449;Danimal-7;"this oddly intertwined series of tales is chiefly about two professional assassins, vincent vega (john travolta) and jules winnfield (samuel l. jackson), and their misadventures in the world of murder, crime, and taking the boss's wife out to eat. (trust me, this is not as funny as it sounds). haphazardly intermixed with this is the story of the boss, marsellus wallace (ving rhames) and of butch (bruce willis), a boxer who refuses to throw a fight for wallace and thus earns his enmity. some things are not wrong with pulp fiction. i do not believe, as some do, that it is intended to glorify violence and drug abuse. it does play both these things for comic effect, in what i found a very tasteless, vulgar, and unfunny style, but i don't think tarantino was trying to tell the audience that violence and drug abuse are actually fun and beneficial; inconvenient and inglorious consequences of both are shown quite graphically. and the acting by jackson, rhames, and, yes, willis is pretty darn good. nevertheless, pulp fiction bored me out of my mind. i was not interested in the characters, because none of them is sympathetic; none feels about the world or reacts to it in any way remotely approaching my own. and much of the movie is spent in long dialogue that does nothing to advance the plot. to be fair, tarantino does have an ear for realistic, earthy-sounding phrases. the lines never sound artificial, forced or strained; they do sound just like the spontaneous banalities that form the backbone of real people's conversations. but i don't listen to strangers' banal conversations, because they're boring if i don't know the people. and that's exactly how boring the conversations in pulp fiction are. pulp fiction's genius is generally said to lie in its accomplishments as a black comedy. well, whatever floats your boat. i got very few laughs out of this picture. interestingly, i always find my friends' re-enactments of their favorite scenes from pulp fiction to be much funnier than seeing the scenes themselves. i was amused twice in the final tale by tarantino's spoofing of movie cliches, as where jules urged honeybunny to ""stay calm, point the gun at me,"" and where a hapless gunman misses jules and vincent with an entire magazine at point blank range, much to all parties' amazement. but aside from that, the comedy eluded me. i don't know how anyone could hail lower than lowbrow humor like christopher walken's scene as being some kind of comic genius. furthermore, realistically brutal violence and comedy don't mix well for my taste. tarantino does have some imagination handling the camera. for instance, vincent at one point is told that marsellus wallace had a man thrown off a building for massaging mrs. wallace's feet; later, when vincent meets mrs. wallace on orders to take her to a restaurant, the camera never leaves mrs. wallace's feet. but tarantino's imagination often is no more than showing off. the film's structure appeals to the sort of over-literate viewer for whom the word ""nonlinear"" is synonymous with ""brilliant"" and ""artistic."" not to be a spoilsport, but there's a good reason most movie scripts are arranged in a linear fashion: that happens to be the way time flows. i'm not saying you can't tell a good nonlinear story, but there'd better be a reason for it. and i cannot tell what tarantino thinks he accomplished by mixing at least five (counting the opening scene) different time sequences together in a seemingly random order. i was not confused, but many others were, and i don't see what tarantino gained in exchange for losing them. one reviewer has suggested this device enabled tarantino to put jules' ""redemption"" at the end, thus finishing the movie on a positive note. if this is so, then the conclusion is just as manipulative and intellectually dishonest as any standard tacked-on hollywood feel-good ending. not that the ending is really bad; in fact i gave the movie an extra half star for its ending, as i finally became interested in one of the characters. i would have liked to find out whether jules succeeded in leaving the criminal life. of course, i take self-confessed ""redemptions"" with a grain of salt, but since jules seems to be uncertain himself about whether he'll kick the criminal habit, i can live with that. but redeemed or not, jackson couldn't completely redeem this frequently tedious, sometimes nauseating, and rarely funny two and a half hours. rating: ** out of ****.";8 October 1999;5;['professional', 'funny', 'wrong', 'comic', 'tasteless', 'vulgar', 'unfunny', 'fun', 'beneficial', 'inconvenient', 'inglorious', 'good', 'interested', 'sympathetic', 'own', 'much', 'long', 'fair', 'tarantino', 'realistic', 'earthy', 'artificial', 'strained', 'spontaneous', 'real', 'banal', 'boring', 'black', 'few', 'favorite', 'funny', 'final', 'calm', 'hapless', 'entire', 'blank', 'much', 'low', 'comic', 'brutal', 'tarantino', 'more', 'literate', 'nonlinear', 'synonymous', 'brilliant', 'artistic', 'good', 'most', 'linear', 'good', 'nonlinear', 'different', 'random', 'confused', 'many', 'positive', 'manipulative', 'dishonest', 'standard', 'good', 'bad', 'extra', 'half', 'interested', 'criminal', 'uncertain', 'criminal', 'tedious', 'funny'];0.0296026300743282
450;McFrogg;"for some strange reason, pulp fiction is regarded as a masterpiece, and its director a genius. according to some ancient legends, the movie is supposedly so awesome that most of its fans lose the ability to tell us exactly why it is so darn good. one of my friends used to talk about how great pulp fiction was after he saw it with his stoner dad. i had of course heard positive stuff about it before, and decided to be polite and watch it when he showed up at my apartment with the dvd. we turned it off after maybe seven hours or so. some people will say: ""but you didn't watch the last 20 minutes!!! it's the ending that is good!"". i'm sorry, but i don't have to go outside and eat dog crap to know it's bad for me. i really can't understand what's so great about it. when people talk about this piece of crap, they usually bring up the ""distoibing"" gimp scene, the fat travolta dance or the part where the hit men accidentally blow the black guy's head off. clap...clap...? my friend didn't even say why he liked it. he just had a blank look on his face and repeated: ""bring out the gimp, bring out the gimp"" over and over again. okay, so the last part didn't really happen, but i bet he only liked it because his father told him it was good. but why did his father like it? drugs? i think many people brainwash themselves into liking tarantino movies.

452;HollisWoods;"this is such a fun movie to not just watch, but to break down given how layered the film is. i'm not promising this to be a full on analysis of pulp fiction, but i will share any thoughts i have had after watching this movie a few times. the movie starts of with a dictionary definition of 'pulp fiction,' saying a pulp fiction is ""characteristically printed on rough, unfinished paper."" knowing the characters, the title now seems quite fitting. the pace and irony is set up brilliantly in the opening dining scene. you have a lovely young couple having a casual conversation about crime, and the scene ends with them starting a crime with upbeat music leading into the credits. that's pretty much the tone of the entire movie. you become attached to these nice people who are actually very horrible criminals and everything is so energetic and fun but with a serious undertone beneath. as this movie is told in clear cut story segments, the 2nd segment is probably the most iconic as we're introduced to vincent & jules, played by john travolta and samuel l. jackson. again with the irony, we follow their casual and light hearted conversation as they are on their way to massacre a bunch of people for their boss. this segment gave us the greatest slj moment of all time. jackson's performance is so captivating here as he plays the hardcore hitman. but when he looks into the camera reciting that bible verse, that was just magic. the next segment was all about uma thurman and her role as mia. her and vincent had great chemistry on screen. there's a lot that can be broken down about their talk at the restaurant and the characters themselves, but i won't get into it. i really just want to talk about the performances because that's what stuck out to me the most in this part. uma was really captivating as mia and travolta's performance when mia overdosed really added to the intensity. once again. there's a bit of irony for vincent as he feared what marcellus would do if he found out what happened. he thought once mia was okay, it would all be fine and dandy, but he ends of dying literally the next day. now butch's big segment was the weirdest thing i've ever seen in a movie. i mean i get it, but what the heck, you know? my big take away here is the story of the watch. we're given a traumatic story via a five minute close up of christopher walken, and then we see butch's own journey as he retrieves the watch from his apartment. the tales of the watch surrounds the idea of two men going through a harrowing experience to get the watch from point a to point b. so there was a great parallel between generations. also love bruce willis here, always fun watching him in any movie. the final sequence is such a creative choice for so many reasons. first of all, after the rest of the film being very linear, for some reason we go back a couple days and return to vincent & jules. after my first watch, i spent days thinking of why they would do this, especially since we just saw vincent get shot to death. knowing vincent is dead, you appreciate his comedic relationship with jules a bit more, especially as they deal with the ""bonnie incident."" i ultimately think the nonlinear order here has everything to do with jules's verse, however. the segment kicks off with the same ""look into the camera"" moment from the beginning and goes from there. they also end up in the diner that the couple form the beginning are in and are present when the couple robs it. this is where jules himself breaks down the verse he's recited, giving his own interpretation. after my 2nd watch, this was the moment i believed to be the whole point of pulp fiction. - not just a reason for nonlinearity, but the whole purpose of the film. i won't articulate my analysis completely, but i basically think that all the characters we've seen are trying to be the shepherds in their own story, that they, in their own way, are on the ""path of the righteous man,"" trying to help those around them ""through the valley of darkness."" your interpretation can be different than mine, but i do believe that this verse means everything to the story, which is why it was part of the last sequence, as well as a scene from the beginning. overall thoughts? this is a great movie. it's enjoyable for a casual viewer and can totally be ripped a part for analysis. the filmography was every great. there a 3 big one shot steady cam scenes that i love to watch - in the apartment, at the restaurant, and following butch. the music was so fun and energetic and helped bring life to the film. the way the entire film was written is so unique and after 30 years is unlike anything we've seen in film. i just want to get into tarantino's head for the creative vision. like what was the purpose of the close ups with the piercing girl? why have that 10 minute close up with butch when he's introduced? what's the purpose of not revealing what was in the case? so many little details, so much to enjoy. pulp fiction can viewed over and over again and a single person will notice something new every time. it's timeless, fun, well written, well acted, well filmed, and a true icon in film history.";26 July 2021;9;['full', 'few', 'dictionary', 'rough', 'unfinished', 'fitting', 'lovely', 'young', 'casual', 'upbeat', 'entire', 'attached', 'nice', 'horrible', 'energetic', 'fun', 'serious', 'clear', 'iconic', 'casual', 'light', 'hearted', 'great', 'hardcore', 'bible', 'magic', 'next', 'great', 'most', 'okay', 'fine', 'dandy', 'next', 'big', 'weird', 'big', 'traumatic', 'own', 'harrowing', 'great', 'fun', 'final', 'creative', 'many', 'linear', 'first', 'dead', 'comedic', 'more', 'nonlinear', 'same', 'present', 'own', 'whole', 'whole', 'own', 'own', 'righteous', 'different', 'last', 'overall', 'great', 'enjoyable', 'casual', 'great', 'big', 'steady', 'fun', 'energetic', 'entire', 'unique', 'creative', 'close', 'many', 'little', 'single', 'new', 'fun', 'true'];0.2211317978896103

458;bobc-5;"""you know what they call a quarter pounder with cheese in paris?"" it's inane, but it's entertaining and it sure seems witty when they're saying it, especially when you learn that this conversation is occurring on the way to knock off a group of possibly armed drug dealers. this is the casual manner in which you would like to talk with your friends and co-workers just before the big event goes down. this is dialogue that makes you feel hip just listening to it. forget the salvation and redemption bit, this movie is all about making you feel hip. you feel hip when you get to listen in on the clever repartee, hip when you can be titillated by the gratuitous violence but still act blase about it, hip when the sudden time jump doesn't bother you in the least. this movie makes you feel more hip then any other which has been made in quite a long time. look beneath the hip surface, however, and you're left with little more than violence as entertainment. violence in movies works best when used as a necessary device to support the plot, characters, and message. tarantino reverses this relationship, creating plot and characters purely to support an entertaining sequence of violent situations. each act of violence has its own specific purpose - make us laugh, make us jump, make us cheer, give us a vicarious thrill - and tarantino is extremely skilled at making this work. this is the greatest strength of ""pulp fiction"", but ultimately its greatest weakness as well. the out-of-sequence scene demonstrates the extent to which the creation of entertaining violence was the driving force of the production. no doubt this was originally intended to be seen in its proper sequence but had to be removed because not only does it add nothing to the plot and character development, it actually bogs things down and gets in the way. not wanting to lose his biggest laughs, however, tarantino simply sticks it on the end and has the added bonus of now having a non-traditional narrative simple enough to not confuse his audience but sufficient to make them feel hip for being able to ""appreciate"" it. is being hip enough? not to be a classic, at least not in this case. almost any hip movie is going to be firmly rooted in its own time period, but ""pulp fiction"" has lost it much more quickly than others. although very entertaining and memorable in the initial viewing, its appeal fades quickly. when the hipness is gone, there's nothing left but violence, which doesn't make for a very pleasant viewing experience. hip classics such as ""ocean's eleven"" and ""goldfinger"" stay classics because they still give us fun and adventure even after the hipness has turned to camp.

(not the ridiculously negative). though, this movie does have it's good points (great points); and some that aren't so good - i.e. drug use, violence, blatant disregard for human life and the lack of hardly any morals (on the part of most characters). i've got to say, though, i loved this movie (""love"" is a strong word, considering some of the content listed above). nevertheless, everything about the way this movie was created was masterpiece material. bold and daring variation from mainstream plot. a look at the ""normal"" aspect of the lives of hanous characters - i.e. what they did or dislike, what and how they like to smoke. their feelings on pop culture icons and the list goes on. personally, i find that viewpoint fascinating. what worked: particularly, the absence of pretense in the actors' projection of their characters; i found myself actually believing that john travolta was a heroin-abusing, cold-blooded assassin. each actor made their character real; and that says a lot about terantino, as well. he knew what he wanted from these artists and drew it from them; even when they didn't necessarily endorse the character's behaviors. plus, i think writer/director terantino portrayed the opposite of mainstream opinion. some would say that his story glorified or encouraged these criminal actions. on the contrary, i believe he showed that bad things are more likely to happen to people who don't have a good moral fiber. and, sad though true, these characters are, in any case, a reality of sorts in the world, today. what didn't work: not so much that anything didn't work, but that the content was too dark. and only for the reason that this was my dad's kind of movie, and one kids could learn from. though, from the content neither will watch (well not my kids). my dad likes crime dramas, but he comes from an era where movies criminals don't swear or not much, anyway. on the same token, weren't ever portrayed using mind-altering substances. other than this, i think he would love this movie. maybe he'll just have to catch the edited for television version - ha ha ha. for me, though, i liked it just fine. 9/10 - hell, i've gotta save a perfect score for that might have the same impact, but my kids could watch, too. maybe not possible. other than that, i loved this film. thank you";17 October 2002;10;['negative', 'good', 'great', 'good', 'blatant', 'human', 'most', 'strong', 'bold', 'daring', 'normal', 'hanous', 'fascinating', 'cold', 'blooded', 'real', 'mainstream', 'criminal', 'bad', 'likely', 'good', 'moral', 'sad', 'true', 'dark', 'much', 'same', 'token', 'other', 'fine', 'perfect', 'same', 'possible', 'other'];0.1279761904761905

475;dj_xand325;"quentin tarantino's 'pulp fiction' continues to inspire, shock and intrigue an entire audience of film watchers since its release in 1994. the story consists of three sagas of drugs, deceit and sleaze inter-linking in a vastly unconventional and unchronological style leading to a simply astonishing end sequence. tarantino builds a strong plethora of almost archetypal characters that resembles pulp material. the scenarios are almost generic situations that we always see, yet tarantino and avary add another zest to these stories that lead on a tangent resulting in a complex inter-mingling of transition and unbelievable acts of fate. interpreting this movie is almost impossible; it's become the subject of many film studies courses. responses to the mysterious contents of the briefcase is a hotly fought debate. some say it's the soul of marsellus, others the jewels from reservoir dogs or others simply say it's a golden light bulb! tarantino has made the film stick with you, caused debate amongst its fan and accomplished a medium of mysteriousness towards the film that somewhat mirrors the incomprehensible nature of 2001: a space odyssey. an overall interpretation of this film is equally impossible. it is often called a 'masterpiece with no message', this is true but a fan can at least delve deeper into the subject matter of this film, what's happening? and what really binds this set of sleazy characters. tarantino's script tends to look at the importance of transition and the repercussions of not acknowledging this transition. butch and marsellus' experience with zed leads to an immense change in their relationship, their blind hate leads to a mutual sense of acceptance that butch takes into account and leaves town as soon as he can. then you have jules' 'moment of clarity'. his divine experience makes him change his ways and acknowledge a sign of transition away from gangster activities. interestingly, vincent's disregardance of this 'divine intervention' leads to a cruel fate of death. then finally, you have yolandi and ringo's frightening thought that they would lose each other therefore seem as if to alter their villainous ways. their transition is captured by jules' final speech speaking of his desire to be the shepard and guide them through a tyranny of evil (which he ultimately does!). in a way, 'pulp fiction' tracks a range of characters going through a huge change governed by the perplexing actions of fate or even of a form of divinity. one thing that is extraordinary about tarantino's script is its flawless ability to enthral and entertain. the speech is memorable and expertly crafted, the banter is thought-provoking and lifts these characters from their almost archetypal interpretations. jules: let's get into character the script is almost a critical expose of what goes on behind the scenes of these typical gangster situations that we've seen so many times. that is why the script is so dynamic. never have i comprehended a screenplay where almost every scene has quotable lines and i probably never will again! the film was garnished with 7 oscar nominations and 1 win (for the screenplay). perhaps pulp fiction should have snatched best picture and some acting oscars yet the important thing is, the film didn't need the awards and tarantino didn't want it! he just made a movie he wanted to make and like so many other films shunned by the academy, it has become as memorable if not more memorable as the film that won best picture (forrest gump) pulpfiction is a cinematic marvel, a tour-de-force of magnificent proportions. beautifully directed by tarantino and the awesome performances of uma thurman, samuel l jackson and john travolta elevate the film to a cult pedestal that is almost unrivalled. quentin tarantino's masterpiece may be one of the greatest films of all time. 10/10";18 February 2007;10;['entire', 'inter', 'unconventional', 'unchronological', 'astonishing', 'tarantino', 'strong', 'archetypal', 'generic', 'tarantino', 'avary', 'complex', 'inter', 'unbelievable', 'impossible', 'many', 'mysterious', 'reservoir', 'golden', 'incomprehensible', 'overall', 'impossible', 'true', 'least', 'deep', 'subject', 'sleazy', 'immense', 'blind', 'mutual', 'divine', 'divine', 'cruel', 'frightening', 'other', 'villainous', 'final', 'huge', 'perplexing', 'extraordinary', 'flawless', 'memorable', 'archetypal', 'critical', 'typical', 'many', 'dynamic', 'quotable', 'oscar', 'good', 'important', 'many', 'other', 'memorable', 'memorable', 'good', 'forr', 'cinematic', 'magnificent', 'tarantino', 'awesome', 'unrivalled', 'great'];0.15

490;donuthaters12;pulp fiction is the film that put tarantino on the map, and this film is regarded as many as his magnum opus. at first, i didn't agree to this acclaim and it did had me confused a bit due to it's lack of driving plot and seriousness that i expect from crime films. after subsequent viewings, i understood that i came into this with the wrong mindset and that i did not appreciate the boldness that tarantino demonstrated with this film. pulp fiction is quentin tarantino's best film and arguably, the best film of that decade. the film is written by quentin tarantino and his screenplay here is like a collection of his best stories sewed together. the highlight of this film is his use of pop culture, hilarious, and naturalistic dialogue. in reservoir dogs, tarantino's dialogue in that film did contain that style that is found here but it does from time to time fall unto the conventional dialogue that is found many crime films but in pulp fiction, the lack of plot allows him to focus on it's characters and therefore write dialogue that is not boxed in by the story. though the film is not tied down by it's story, it does include it to have a conclusion of sorts in the end of each segment. the characters in the film are one of the main reasons that this film is enjoyable because they are all so unique and different from one another and they never feel like they are common archetypes, and one of the main reasons are the delivery of the actors and the smart quirky dialogue from tarantino. quentin tarantino's sophomore film is a major improvement over his previous film, in terms of style, dialogue, and photography. tarantino was able to maintain the tone of dark humor, and the grit of a crime/gangster film. without the humor, i think may be suffered by characters just having a regular conversation just before a very brief burst of action. one of the main points that made this film appealing is the jumbling of the storyline, and having each storyline having some sort of throwback to the other. pulp fiction is an execution of style but not sacrificing an inch of substance. andrzej sekula comes back to handle the photography of this film, and it is an improvement over the previous film that felt rushed and amateurish. sekula and tarantino have taken the things that worked on reservoir dogs and improved upon it here. pulp fiction contains multiple shots that felt precisely placed and takes away the hand held style that was found on the previous film, except for heated moments in the film. the film contains long takes of the actors just spitting out his dialogue and delaying the action of the film, which at times is not as fun as the moments that precedes it, and it also allows the camera to explore the environment these characters are confined in. pulp fiction lacks the musical score that most films succumb to and is primarily a soundtrack driven film, similar to the first film. the film contains excellent songs from multiple decades, and these tracks at most times defines the scene. these tracks are now much more abundant here in comparison to his previous film therefore the film doesn't feel quiet and rarely contains a moment that felt slow or didn't feel cinematic. pulp fiction contains a stellar cast with standouts that include uma thurman, john travolta, samuel jackson, tim roth and bruce willis. when these actors come on screen, they bring their a game. the chemistry between john travolta and samuel jackson or uma thurman is fun to watch and did allow me to get sucked in with their words and their relationship. these actors gave these parts with seriousness to a story that is ridiculous, that it allows the film to attain that dark humor that made this film so appealing. the actors i did not mention were not as much of a standout as the other actors but they do their part well enough that none of them felt boring or underwhelming. pulp fiction is a masterpiece that contains hilarious dialogue, outrageous story lines, precise photography, stellar soundtrack, and great acting. the film is a milestone in cinema history and has been looked upon to in future films as inspiration. pulp fiction is quentin tarantino's best film and arguably, the best film of that decade.;7 January 2014;10;['many', 'magnum', 'due', 'subsequent', 'wrong', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'hilarious', 'naturalistic', 'reservoir', 'conventional', 'many', 'main', 'enjoyable', 'unique', 'different', 'common', 'main', 'smart', 'quirky', 'major', 'previous', 'able', 'dark', 'regular', 'brief', 'main', 'other', 'previous', 'reservoir', 'multiple', 'previous', 'heated', 'long', 'fun', 'musical', 'most', 'similar', 'first', 'excellent', 'multiple', 'most', 'abundant', 'previous', 'quiet', 'slow', 'cinematic', 'stellar', 'fun', 'ridiculous', 'dark', 'appealing', 'much', 'other', 'boring', 'underwhelming', 'hilarious', 'outrageous', 'precise', 'stellar', 'great', 'future', 'good', 'good'];0.1480326876513316
491;andrewnmiller;"for a long time, pulp fiction was always a movie that never appealed to me as given it's gore and blatant language, i stayed away from it but after a friend had recommend it to me, i decided to finally watch it and let me tell you, it certainly deserves all the praise it's gotten. from it's graphic violence and slick directing to it's talented cast and kick-ass soundtrack, pulp fiction is one of the crown jewels of cinema history. as the movie's story isn't told in chronological order, the three main stories continually interconnect with each other starting with two hit-men named vincent and julies appearing at an apartment complex to commandeer a briefcase for their boss marcellus wallace and murder a man named brett and one of his assistants. they then deliver the case to marcellus only to be kept waiting while wallace brides a boxer named butch to be intentionally knocked out during his upcoming match. what follows is a series of events from vincent taking marcellus's wife on a date to marcellus and butch being held hostage by a pawnshop owner. one of the first scenes of the movie are vincent and julies taking about what a big mac in france is called, the scene is humorous and has a certain charm to it but it also makes these two hit-men look a bit too ordinary. if the viewer didn't realize, they would think that these two are just talking on their way to work, but what's interesting is that their discussion has no importance to the outcome of the movie and yet without scenes like this, pulp fiction would never have been the movie that it is today. one gets the sense that tarantino threw whatever he wanted into the film and yet in some way, the finished movie isn't just consistent but amazingly rough around the edges. as the movie doesn't follow a single narrative, some people will have problems keeping up with the story and who's backstabbing who, but the movie works a lot better if you pay close attention to what is happening and see it as a dark comedy disguised as a crime drama. each of the stories in the movie start with a circumstance that could have been developed for any run-of the-mill crime movie, but something always manages to go awry, some tiny sudden calamity which effects the entire case and causes it to crumble, driving the frenzied characters to bizarre methods. tarantino's creativeness comes from a capability to focus on insignificant details and accompany them wherever they might go, even if they divert the story away from predictable story changes. it's no surprise that fans of the movie have spent arguing about what's in the suitcase, which leads to them delving deeper into the film more than tarantino anticipated. the movie is so wonderfully arranged with a lot of amazing details, many of them you won't even see on your first viewing so the film seems to be bawling for deep analysis, but there isn't anything to really analyze, as the name of the film implies, it's an accomplishment in craft and method and a distinguished and arranged one at that. perhaps no other movie script will ever find a superior role for detours as the entire movie seems to involve them at every turn. no character speaks a line of dialog in a sincere way as julies does in one of the final scenes of the movie where he could just tell the couple robbing a restaurant that they should just stay clam and no one will be injured which would be a typical line of dialog from your standard action or crime movie, but rather than do that, jules goes out on a limb about what fonzie is then asks the robber to get his wallet. tarantino relishes every phrase uttered by his characters, discovering a promising joke in every conversation and fortifying it with crafty mainstream culture mentions, but the dialog isn't just funny; it's packed with insightful reflections on human conduct or people's religious views. mia wallace's comment to vincent about reveling in the silence or julies reciting ezekiel 25.17 are the best examples of this and out of all the scripts to come out of hollywood, pulp fiction is truly one of the best. the film is also shot wonderfully with no shortage of bright colors, amazing camcorder shots and fantastic camera angles, the soundtrack is also amazing with a great mix of classic songs ranging from dusty springfield's ""son of a preacher man"" and al green's ""let's stay together"" to neil diamond's ""girl, you'll be a woman soon"" which help to make it a truly unique movie but also makes it more fun to watch. for a film of this magnitude to work, the cast had to be perfect for the roles and they certainly deliver on that. uma thurman is wonderful as mia wallace nailing the sharp dialog with ease, bruce willis provides a dynamic performance as the boxer butch as does maria de mederios as butch's girlfriend. ving rhams plays mob boss marcellus wallace in true style. eric scholtz is great as the drug dealer lance, christopher waken pops up in a flash from the past scene and gives a fine performance even if his time on screen isn't very much and even director quentin tarantino shows up in a short cameo. john travolta's performance as vincent vega is truly a sight to see as he puts a new coat of paint on the role of the hit-man and makes it his own with just the right amount of elegance and charm, while samuel l. jackson is perfect as jules with his undercurrent of evilness, showing an attitude of vicious anger and is still to maintain his cool even when facing death. there isn't much else i can say about pulp faction except to go watch it if you haven't already.";2 October 2017;10;['long', 'blatant', 'graphic', 'slick', 'talented', 'chronological', 'main', 'other', 'marcellus', 'upcoming', 'first', 'vincent', 'big', 'humorous', 'certain', 'ordinary', 'interesting', 'tarantino', 'finished', 'consistent', 'rough', 'single', 'well', 'close', 'dark', 'awry', 'tiny', 'sudden', 'entire', 'frenzied', 'bizarre', 'insignificant', 'predictable', 'more', 'amazing', 'many', 'first', 'deep', 'distinguished', 'other', 'superior', 'entire', 'sincere', 'final', 'typical', 'standard', 'tarantino', 'promising', 'crafty', 'funny', 'insightful', 'human', 'religious', 'good', 'good', 'bright', 'amazing', 'fantastic', 'amazing', 'great', 'classic', 'dusty', 'preacher', 'unique', 'more', 'perfect', 'wonderful', 'sharp', 'dynamic', 'marcellus', 'true', 'great', 'past', 'fine', 'much', 'short', 'new', 'own', 'right', 'perfect', 'vicious', 'cool', 'much'];0.2208696775860955
492;SebMoz;this is tarantino's masterpiece, there's no other way to say it. it has arguably one of the smartest scripts i've ever seen. the story, which is non-linear, is so well constructed it takes several viewings to grasp it all. the movie doesn't seem to be about any spesific thing, but there is a subtle hint of redemption as a central theme. the characters and preformances in this movie are practically perfect. this is still one of the best performances i've seen from sam jackson, and it's an outrage he didn't win an oscar. each scene has its own unique flavour and charm, every segment has its own arc while also tying into the main plot. the comedy is great, the serious moments are great, every word of dialogue is exciting despite seemingly not having any reason to exist. this movie is just such a great time, and i recommend it to everyone who loves movies. i cannot think of a single genuine flaw with it, and it will remain one of my favorite movies for a long time.;12 November 2020;10;['other', 'smart', 'non', 'linear', 'several', 'spesific', 'subtle', 'central', 'perfect', 'good', 'own', 'unique', 'own', 'main', 'great', 'serious', 'great', 'exciting', 'great', 'single', 'genuine', 'favorite', 'long'];0.3171428571428571

495;Roger_Sterling;i saw pulp fiction one week ago today, and i should have written this review earlier. i heard this movie was good, but damn! i had no idea what i was in for. quentin tarantino does one hell of a job directing this movie (and his cameo was decent too), and practically everyone in the movie gives a good performance. my favorite character is easily jules winnfield, played by the one and only samuel l. jackson. he is indeed one bmf in this movie, and absolutely owned the final scene in the diner. another thing i noticed is how many things i have seen on tv and in other movies that payed homage to this movie. not that i'm surprised, this is probably tarantino's best (i haven't seen all his movies), and is easily one of the best movies i've ever seen.;14 February 2007;10;['good', 'decent', 'good', 'favorite', 'final', 'many', 'other', 'surprised', 'good', 'good'];0.3941666666666666

497;bobbyelliott;pulp fiction is a movie of our times - fast moving, exciting but gratuitous and ultimately meaningless. this movie has pace! it moves along from the opening scene at great speed and it's never anything less than thrilling. there are stories within stories throughout the movie. several funny moments. and many violent scenes. and that's my problem with this film. it seems to glorify (or at least casualise) violence. a kid's face is blown off by mistake - and our heroes only worry that his splattered brains spoils their hair. but it's all very entertaining - just a bit immoral and it doesn't really have anything to say except that tarrentino has a fascination for meaningless violence. entertainment value is 9/10. but i gave it 8.;24 November 1999;6;['exciting', 'gratuitous', 'meaningless', 'great', 'less', 'several', 'funny', 'many', 'violent', 'least', 'splattered', 'entertaining', 'immoral', 'meaningless'];-0.0347222222222222
498;simplysoda_19f;pulp fiction is like a roller-coaster it has it's ups and downs, but when it's done, you'll want to ride (watch) it again! quentin tarantino is a great director and like all his movies he does have a cameo role in the movie, but he's a great director, to me what makes him so great is that he has a different style of mind like any other film director that i've seen. also, this movie has lot of big named stars, and this is the first movie that i've ever seen these three guys together: samuel l. jackson, john travolta and last but not definitely least....bruce willis. it's a movie about a lot of different people who all work for the same person, marcellus wallace. oh, i forget to mention that uma thurman, harvey keitel, ving rhames, christopher walken and roseanna arquette are in the movie as well. it's an interesting movie that you have to watch at least 2 times to understand the story, but if you've seen previous tarantino movies, you just should know what to expect. the reason i say that, is because there are a lot of flashbacks and flash-forwards in the movie. so, it does get a little confusing there, but all-in-all, i gave this movie a 9, because it's got a great cast under great direction, an original story but brilliant, and a great dance sequence where john and uma do the twist. watch the movie, it's great!;2 February 2006;9;['great', 'cameo', 'great', 'great', 'different', 'other', 'big', 'first', 'last', 'least', 'different', 'same', 'marcellus', 'interesting', 'previous', 'tarantino', 'little', 'confusing', 'great', 'great', 'original', 'great', 'great'];0.2822916666666667

513;joeravioli;"pulp fiction is just the sort of film that will change the way that you think, although that remains to be seen whether or not that's a good thing. ask yourself: would you rather live out your life thinking eloquent, civil thoughts or gleefully profane, borderline blasphemous mental rants (most of which having to do with fast food) that would send mike tyson running into a corner with both hands over his ears, screaming ""i can't hear yooooou!!"". okay, it's not that bad. the f-bomb count, according to the imdb parents guide, is 272 (with 40 in the maternal form), but unless you're a fat, doe-eyed little boy with one hand on the tv remote and the other on the bible, you won't be offended. anyway, i'll stop before this turns into a full blown parent's guide. i mean, if you want a parent's guide, go to the parent's guide. pulp fiction reminded me of jane austen's pride and prejudice (or any of her works, for that matter) in that it prioritizes character exposition rather than narrative. in truth, the narrative -- much like an austen novel -- is there, yes, but it's not really what we're in for. rather, we dip into tarantino's perverted thoughts to see his characters unfold, live, breathe, and die in front of us as they float through a world subject to tarantino's gleeful aggressions. tarantino, a master of dialogue (although i'm sure austen would object), creates and develops such beautifully rich psychological profiles that he allows you to sympathize with even the most depraved of human beings. for me, being highly concerned with values and morals and all other sentimental detritus that modern society condemns, this proved slightly difficult to stomach. for example, in the first scene, we witness two murders. there's a bit of buildup, sure, but you're never quite given the reason why you have to sit through an execution. to his credit, tarantino makes his depravity an afterthought. the film pulsates with a beautiful energy absent from modern screen writing. and the acting is sublime. never will i forget hoffman's slick, cool, and hilariously restrained twist with uma thurman, or even good ol' sam jackson's ""english motherf- (and you know the rest)"", or even ving rhames' wise comments on pride. the character's passionately delivered lines brim with quotable dialogue, the real, crazy stuff that sends delightful shivers down your spine. as i previously mentioned, the plot really doesn't matter in this film. tarantino's use of the nonlinear narrative (which has since become famous) ends up making the order of the story very difficult to follow. in fact, after finishing it, i couldn't for the life of me remember the order of what happened. i knew that some things happened: people talked, did drugs, killed people, got raped, etc, but the order in which all these things happened escaped me. but once you realize who died, who got raped, who talked, and who did drugs, you'll realize that the story is a great deal more complicated than you give it credit for being. not only did the characters interact, they grew, progressed, and even died. this i loved. it's pulp fiction in its purest form, a mess of bullets, blood, and dialogue that is at once unexceptional and utterly unforgettable.";6 March 2016;8;['good', 'eloquent', 'civil', 'profane', 'blasphemous', 'mental', 'most', 'fast', 'bad', 'maternal', 'fat', 'eyed', 'little', 'other', 'full', 'blown', 'austen', 'gleeful', 'sure', 'austen', 'such', 'rich', 'psychological', 'depraved', 'human', 'concerned', 'other', 'sentimental', 'modern', 'difficult', 'first', 'sure', 'beautiful', 'absent', 'modern', 'sublime', 'cool', 'good', 'english', 'wise', 'quotable', 'real', 'crazy', 'delightful', 'nonlinear', 'famous', 'difficult', 'great', 'complicated', 'pure', 'unexceptional', 'unforgettable'];0.1758116883116883

522;zanghi_james;quentin tarantino made a nice splash with his cinematic debut of directing reservoir dogs. and less than five years later, he followed up with another wonderful non-linear masterpiece that not only lived up to the previous films performance, but outshined it as well, appropriately called pulp fiction. much like reservoir dogs, pulp fiction is not for everyone. there is an incredible amount of cussing and swearing as well as violence and disturbing imagery. there are some callbacks to the style of reservoir dogs as well with the violence, like not showing the violent boxing match that is the main point of bruce willis' character's story in the film is definitely a callback to tarantino not showing the botched diamond robbery in reservoir dogs. some of the scenes of violence are so out there, though, that they are almost like r-rated scenes from a three stooges short, most notably the scene where uma thurman needs to be revived from overdosing on heroin. however, don't expect such comedical style all the time, since there is that one scene with bruce and ving that is like deliverance was directed by eli roth. as usual, the casting choices of the film are spot-on. ving rhames, who i really only have seen else in the mission impossible films, plays a great, tough, and much more likable gangster than lawrence tierney in reservoir dogs. john travolta's character, despite doing a great dance scene, plays a pretty despicable bonehead who gets his comeuppance in a nice satisfying way of gallows humor. the true star is samuel l. jackson, playing a good-natured and loyal gangster who, following a slightly botched job, gets a better view of his violent life and decides to get his act together. the cameos are, as usual, really cool, also. bruce willis plays an okay tough guy in this one also, though his tantrum when he loses his watch is a little out of control. i mean, i agree that the watch is critically important to his character, but he didn't have to blow up at his girlfriend like that... and of course, the soundtrack rocks.;28 May 2019;10;['nice', 'cinematic', 'reservoir', 'less', 'wonderful', 'non', 'linear', 'previous', 'reservoir', 'incredible', 'disturbing', 'reservoir', 'violent', 'main', 'reservoir', 'short', 'such', 'comedical', 'usual', 'impossible', 'great', 'tough', 'likable', 'great', 'despicable', 'nice', 'satisfying', 'true', 'good', 'natured', 'loyal', 'well', 'violent', 'usual', 'cool', 'okay', 'tough', 'little', 'important'];0.1356800766283524

526;jbirtel;"it must tickle tarantino to no end to read or listen to all the self-proclaimed 'experts' who dissect and analyze every scene, shot and line; and apply their religious or mythic interpretations; then proceed to pat themselves on the back for their ingenuity. yes...this movie is chock-full of subtexts and inside references (and plenty of homages to movies past), but the bottom line is: it's not so much original as it is combining so many elements of comedy sketches and classic story chestnuts wrapped in some great soundtracks. and the results explode like a blast of fresh air. so just sit back and enjoy the ride! not that there is anything new to his approach. 'citizen kane' (non-linear story) and 'american graffiti' (scenes written to fit an existing soundtrack) and even 'abbott & costello meet frankenstein' (the comedy/horror movie) are just a few examples of popular re-inventions. but tarantino's approach are more like reminders of combining many more elements of great movies (or great movie scenes) and making those reminders seem like re-inventions. is there anything wrong with that? not a chance! not when the end film has so much wit, intelligence and energy. it's time for guilty pleasure! every actor (to the small bit parts) is perfectly cast, to single one performance over another would be an unjust slight. this is not a competition of who comes off best, this is a massive group of a labor of love everyone involved must have relished (including the technicians) so that the story comes first and everyone has their chance to shine when it serves the story to do so. the direction, camera angles and editing causes the movie to unfold much like a book, which may qualify it as being a visual 'page-turner'; you can't wait to see what happens next. and just when you think the movie is going to turn right; bam! off it goes again on another left turn. this was one of the first movies i'd had seen in a long time that i wasn't able to predict on what was going to happen next (with so many movie cliches where the hero gets violent revenge 'at the end', the hero's side-kick is killed off two-thirds of the way thru, the damsel in distress stupidly allows herself to being captured, dialogue that is 'dumbed-down' to appeal to the (so called) mass). to get the most from this entertainment, it's best to know nothing about it other than the info on the dvd jacket. to reveal anything is to rob yourself of a great movie viewing (and listening) experience. so...you won't find any lazy re-hashing of the plot in this review. the ""collector's edition""('s) dts sound is fantastic and is a huge improvement over the 5.1 dolby digital's earlier dvd release. if you love the movie, then you'll enjoy the wealth of bonus material.

527;abum190;"how quentin tarantino managed to pull this off is a mystery. where he got these characters from is even more of a mystery. this movie is a celebration of all things trashy, and yet i got the feeling that when tarantino started making this movie he realized he could make it so much more than that. he has a gold mine of character and dialogue here, and he has used it up and more. the best thing about this movie is its dialogue. everything everyone says is so natural; you believe someone would say these things in real life. every conversation is essential to the plot, but when they take place they feel spontaneous. even sequences that would feel contrived under a lesser screenplay or lesser director feel perfect in this movie, such as the scene between willis and the cabdriver, or the scene with uma thurman and john travolta dancing at the restaurant. not only are conversations natural, but the way events shape out feels like real life also. when we are expecting mia and vince to get on the good foot and do the bad thing, what we get instead is a crisis in which mia almost dies. when we expect butch to get killed, instead he does the killing. the movie felt like it was leading me in one direction but then led me in another, but i didn't feel gypped because it felt right. and the actors are something else in this movie. john travolta did not give the performance i expected from him- i expected hammy travolta and what i got was understated travolta that fit into everything around him; definitely not what i expected. sam jackson has the most fun in this movie, but manages to keep it real at the same time. i can't even get into everyone else, simply because there are so many good performances. i gave the movie a 10 (something i've done for only three other movies) because it's so complete. i had trouble figuring out what the point of the movie is, and i'm still not sure, but it really doesn't matter. the stories are so intriguing and the characters are so engaging, i don't really care about the point of it all. i just want to see it again.";3 September 2006;10;['more', 'trashy', 'tarantino', 'more', 'gold', 'more', 'good', 'natural', 'real', 'essential', 'spontaneous', 'less', 'less', 'perfect', 'such', 'natural', 'real', 'good', 'bad', 'right', 'hammy', 'most', 'real', 'same', 'many', 'good', 'other', 'complete', 'sure', 'intriguing', 'engaging'];0.2969742063492064

529;nehpetstephen;"wow! truly a modern classic! each of the several storylines are intriguing and highly entertaining. my favorite is the one focusing on bruce willis as a boxer who disobeys when ordered to throw a fight for a million dollars. my least favorite is the one centering on vincent (travolta) and his ""date"" with mia (thurman), the boss's wife. in my opinion, it detracted from the crime-related tones in the other storylines, yet it was still wonderful. the acting from the all-star cast is perfect, all around. i only had one problem: travolta. several other reviewers state how wonderful he was in this outstanding role. personally, i didn't think it was that remarkable. i've never really like travolta and that may have been a factor. the real actor in this movie is samuel l. jackson, as a philosophical hitman--but then again, he's good in everything. so the plotlines may not be too believable, but that's the point. this film explores things that rarely happen as a natural chain of events. the bruce willis story--which explores how coincidences can strongly affect our lives--is one example of this. the people they run in with at the gun shop is hilarious and memorable. quentin tarantino has certainly outdone himself in this brilliant, classic film. everything about it--from the very detailed, complex characters to the entertaining storylines to the stunning direction and acting--is perfect. a must see for any fan of movies. 10/10";19 August 2000;10;['modern', 'several', 'intriguing', 'entertaining', 'least', 'other', 'wonderful', 'perfect', 'several', 'other', 'wonderful', 'outstanding', 'remarkable', 'real', 'philosophical', 'good', 'believable', 'natural', 'hilarious', 'memorable', 'brilliant', 'classic', 'detailed', 'complex', 'entertaining', 'stunning', 'perfect'];0.391025641025641

532;joseayarza;ok, i loved this film. loved it. but it's not perfect. the main problem with the movie is that the best scene is at the beginning: the histerical what? conversation. this scene comes very early in the movie, so you would expect that the rest should equal or top that perfect scene. and while the movie is always interesting and has some other moments of great humor, it never reaches the greatness of that scene. compared to that incredible scene, the rest of the film is a disappointment. that wouldn't be a problem if the scene had been left to the end, but since it's at the beginning.... putting that aside, this movie is so original. the characters speak a lot. in many movies, the characters only speak the necessary to advance the plot, and the action is given more importance. however, in pulp fiction, characters are given the chance to talk, as we talk in everyday life. as a result, the characters seem incredibly real and we care a lot about them. the non-linear structure is another plus. it's a very intelligent way to grab the audience and not letting go. at times the movie gets a little boring but you never lose interest because you always want to know whether the movie will move forward or backwards. movies that play with time always work. well, most of the time, at least. what about the acting? my personal favorite was samuel l. jackson. but everybody did a good job including quentin tarantino as the guy who helps the guys hide the body but is afraid that his wife might arrive and discover the whole deal. uma thurman was also great at portraying that strange woman who apparently likes to play with people's feelings, knowing that they're afraid of her, because of her husband. john travolta was my least favorite. he was too inexpressive for me, although, perhaps he did that intentionally because the character required it. overall: 9/10.;27 July 2002;10;['perfect', 'main', 'good', 'histerical', 'perfect', 'interesting', 'other', 'great', 'incredible', 'original', 'many', 'necessary', 'more', 'everyday', 'real', 'non', 'linear', 'intelligent', 'little', 'boring', 'most', 'least', 'personal', 'good', 'tarantino', 'afraid', 'whole', 'great', 'strange', 'afraid', 'least', 'favorite', 'inexpressive'];0.2421130952380953

536;shattenjager777;"quentin tarrantino is in general better known for the amount of violence in his films than any merits they have, and after seeing ""pulp fiction,"" i can see why. the film had an extreme amount of violence, yes, but it had few merits. the stories were none too original or exciting and the final attempt to connect them was completely unsuccessful and really brought to the fore what a disconnected, nonsensical mess the entire film is. the characters are flat and dull, the dialogue is made up of about six total words, five of which cannot be used on network television, the stories aren't exciting, and those stories have an attempted connection that doesn't really connect them. tarrantino seems to have been playing around with time and non-linear narrative, but the film barely, if at all, made any sense. there seems to be no reason for anything that happens and the unusual narrative, rather than drawing the viewer in, is beyond tarrantino's (the writer) abilities. further, tarrantino draws no interesting characters--even with two skilled and charismatic leads in samuel l. jackson and john travolta. the most interesting character is definitely that of butch the boxer, and even he is little-defined. the performances of all involved were fine, since the characters required so little, highlighted by bruce willis (oddly enough) and samuel l. jackson and lowlighted by the ever-horrible patricia arquette, who can do more to ruin an easy character than any actor i have ever seen this side of kevin costner and patricia clarkson. the parade of stars seemed to be tarrantino's attempt to distract from the film, but it wasn't successful, since most of the actors were people who have horrible taste in general (mr. travolta, that's your call) and this was like a concatenation of all their wrongdoings. meanwhile, tarrantino the director does not distinguish himself in one way or another. it's a fairly standard-looking film that doesn't jump out of the mainstream at all, which was actually rather effective since the violence then seemed much more commonplace, but i don't know that it was tarrantino's intention. i think if he intended that sort of theme, he would have used a more close up-laden style, so i doubt that he intended to be dull. the film's few redeeming moments were packed near the end, with a hilarious scene of bruce willis choosing a weapon with which to kill some tormentors and a look on his face at the end of said scene that is absolutely priceless leading the pack, but a few other good comic moments come near the end and perhaps make up somewhat for the mess that came before them. overall, i consider ""pulp fiction"" a terrible mess of a script with no characterization, bad dialogue, a wildly disconnected story, and no reasons for anything that was directed decently if not well and enacted as well as possible considering its horrendous flaws. the film is most certainly not the masterpiece it is made out to be; it is more the accident it least wants to be. i would suggest it if you don't mind violence and want a good nap, but that's it.";4 April 2005;2;['general', 'extreme', 'few', 'original', 'exciting', 'final', 'unsuccessful', 'disconnected', 'nonsensical', 'entire', 'flat', 'dull', 'total', 'exciting', 'non', 'linear', 'unusual', 'interesting', 'skilled', 'charismatic', 'interesting', 'fine', 'little', 'horrible', 'more', 'easy', 'successful', 'most', 'horrible', 'general', 'standard', 'effective', 'more', 'close', 'up', 'dull', 'few', 'hilarious', 'priceless', 'few', 'other', 'good', 'comic', 'terrible', 'bad', 'disconnected', 'possible', 'horrendous', 'more', 'good'];0.1287601626016259

542;eddie052010;pulp fiction. what is there left to say about it? from it's countless reviews, accolades and the fact that it redefined cinema should already tell many how brilliant this movie is and how it's legacy has changed the face of cinema forever. with all of that praise, many have talked about it and analyzed it to death, so it would imply that there is simply nothing left to talk about. however, as i love this film so much and really like writing reviews, i will also discuss what a masterpiece this film is. firstly, the way the story is told is fantastic, as it does it in a non- linear fashion, each focused on a certain bunch of characters and their actions, and how some of those actions affect the other stories. sure the separate plots maybe simple on their own, but the way they mesh together in this film is quite beautiful. sure, not all of the stories are great here, as there are one or two slow, boring ones that you have to sit through, but you will be rewarded with other great and exciting stories to make up for it. the fact that each story has about 20-40 minutes of screen time allows each story to breath and leave an impact, something which many of it's copycats (snatch for example) fail to realize. as it is told in a non-linear fashion, meaning that certain stories happen after others, it allows for many surprises along the way. it is like 4-6 short films for the price of one and most of them are fantastic and offer you a different experience with each story. the first story is about a couple of gangsters, vincent vega and jules winfield who are going to carry out a hit for their boss, marsellus wallace. what follows is a hilarious mix of violence, comedy and kahuna burgers. the same thing can be said of their other stories one of which involves them accidentally killing a hostage and having to clean the car before time runs out as they have parked in a friend's garage whose wife is coming home. this is story is definitely the most comedic in the film as there are the most jokes and humiliations in it, particularly with vincent and jules being very humorlessly clumsy. their most action packed story is the final one where a diner is held up and vincent and jules are caught right up in the middle of it, being held hostage by a gangster called pumpkin and his loose cannon wife. while there is a lot of humour here, it is definitely the most tense due to the situation and how psychotic both pumpkin and his wife are. it isn't the most violent however. this is where bruce willis, playing a boxer called butch comes in. after killing another boxer in a fight that he was meant to lose, butch quickly escapes with his girlfriend and intend on leaving the country. there is one problem however, he left his gold watch behind, an item that has been in his family for generations. so he has to go back in order to reclaim the watch. this is definitely both the most violent and the most surprising story, seeing as how it takes a turn into the exploitation and samurai genres. however, the transition of genres is a smooth one considering how it keeps with the tone of the film and is played more over the top, which considering how this film is partly a black comedy fits. the only dud here is when vincent has to look after marsellus wallace's wife, mia. it is such a slow story, and there is barely any sort of excitement in the story despite plot points like an overdose. there is hardly any chemistry between vincent and mia and mia herself is quite a boring character. she's just a bland party girl. uma thurman does her best, but even she can't rescue the story from blandness. however, that is my only compliant with the film. another good thing about it is the dialogue. sure, like reservoir dogs, it discusses hardly interesting things, but it works and can often times be really funny. there is also a lot more character development in this than reservoir dogs, with most of the characters at least having a different personality to them, and as in these stories there are many duos, there is much chemistry between the characters. vincent for example, is a calm quiet man who really doesn't want to screw up meanwhile jules is a much more psychotic, religious and dangerous character who is thinking of retiring soon. butch is a paranoid person who only manages to get through life with his wit and often by the skin of his teeth. marsellus is a very though person who while a person who shouldn't be double- crossed does care about his wife and what happens to himself, and not even he can protect himself all the time. there are also some stylistic choices i really like as well. the soundtrack is great (if not as good as reservoir dogs), the film has a great loose tone which allows for a lot of fun and there is even some ambiguity as well, which i won't spoil for you here. overall, this is by far one of the best films of the 90's and of all time. it is a mixture of many things and many genres which all mesh together to give us a spectacular experience. despite some problems here and there, this a complete masterpiece that improves on reservoir dogs while being great on it's own. if

549;ctrout;pulp fiction is a movie with many interweaving stories about corruption, redemption, and honor. it is set in los angeles and gives us a different look at the world of crime. in quentin tarantino's world, the bad guys are fast talkers with a stylized vocabulary. there's really only one hero in the film, but that doesn't stop you from liking most of the characters, especially the always excellent samuel l. jackson. there's nothing this guy can act poorly in. he's great in everything. as for everyone else, well john travolta sky rocketed back into the public eye thanks to tarantino. he was never better as the devoted hit-man to jackson's one who has second thoughts about the profession. uma thurman can also thank quentin for making her a household name, twice. she plays mia wallace, a very intriguing and different character that we don't get to see in many movies. bruce willis is the tough guy who's on the run from mr. wallace (ving rhames) after he doesn't do what he's told. as i said before, there's really only one hero in the picture and willis pretty much fits that bill. all of the other members of the supporting cast do very well with the few scenes they have. each one is equally memorable and even our director, quentin tarantino, gets bitten by the acting bug. it's samuel l. jackson who steals the show and that's what i remember most about this excellent movie. of course, there is gratuitous violence and graphic language, but nothing that we don't say in everyday life. as long as you have a pleasure for dark humor, you'll enjoy this movie. it really is more of a comedy than any other genre. all in all pulp fiction is a masterpiece of originality. some say tarantino rips off from those low budget movies of the '70s, but he's really just putting all of what he learned from his childhood and creating something that comes off as nothing we've seen before. and that's all i need to enjoy a movie: something that i haven't seen before and that comes off as entirely original and creative. it's one of the best movies of the '90s.;14 May 2006;10;['many', 'different', 'bad', 'fast', 'most', 'excellent', 'great', 'public', 'well', 'devoted', 'second', 'intriguing', 'different', 'many', 'tough', 'other', 'few', 'memorable', 'excellent', 'gratuitous', 'graphic', 'everyday', 'dark', 'more', 'other', 'tarantino', 'low', 'original', 'creative', 'good'];0.1846707818930041

552;kylopod;"one of the early scenes in ""pulp fiction"" features two hit-men discussing what a big mac is called in other countries. their dialogue is witty and entertaining, and it's also disarming, because it makes these two thugs seem all too normal. if you didn't know better, you might assume these were regular guys having chit-chat on their way to work. other than the comic payoff at the end of the scene, in which they use parts of this conversation to taunt their victims, their talk has no relevance to anything in the film, or to anything else, for that matter. yet without such scenes, ""pulp fiction"" wouldn't be ""pulp fiction."" i get the sense that tarantino put into the film whatever struck his fancy, and somehow the final product is not only coherent but wonderfully textured. it's no wonder that fans spend so much time debating what was in the suitcase, reading far more into the story than tarantino probably intended. the film is so intricately structured, with so many astonishing details, many of which you won't pick up on the first viewing, that it seems to cry out for some deeper explanation. but there is no deeper explanation. ""pulp fiction,"" is, as the title indicates, purely an exercise in technique and style, albeit a brilliant and layered one. containing numerous references to other films, it is like a great work of abstract art, or ""art about art."" it has all the characteristics we associate with great movies: fine writing, first-rate acting, unforgettable characters, and one of the most well-constructed narratives i've ever seen in a film. but to what end? the self-contained story does not seem to have bearing on anything but itself. the movie becomes a bit easier to understand once you realize that it's essentially a black comedy dressed up as a crime drama. each of the three main story threads begins with a situation that could easily form the subplot of any standard gangster movie. but something always goes wrong, some small unexpected accident that causes the whole situation to come tumbling down, leading the increasingly desperate characters to absurd measures. tarantino's originality stems from his ability to focus on small details and follow them where they lead, even if they move the story away from conventional plot developments. perhaps no screenplay has ever found a better use for digressions. indeed, the whole film seems to consist of digressions. no character ever says anything in a simple, straightforward manner. jules could have simply told yolanda, ""be cool and no one's going to get hurt,"" which is just the type of line you'd find in a generic, run-of-the-mill action flick. instead, he goes off on a tangent about what fonzie is like. tarantino savors every word of his characters, finding a potential wisecrack in every statement and infusing the dialogue with clever pop culture references. but the lines aren't just witty; they are full of intelligent observations about human behavior. think of mia's statement to vincent, ""that's when you know you've found somebody special: when you can just shut the f--- up for a minute and comfortably enjoy the silence."" what is the movie's purpose exactly? i'm not sure, but it does deal a lot with the theme of power. marsellus is the sort of character who looms over the entire film while being invisible most of the time. the whole point of the big date sequence, which happens to be my favorite section of the film, is the power that marsellus has over his men without even being present. this power is what gets vincent to act in ways you would not ordinarily expect from a dumb, stoned gangster faced with an attractive woman whose husband has gone away. the power theme also helps explain one of the more controversial aspects of the film, its liberal use of the n-word. in this film, the word isn't just used as an epithet to describe blacks: jules, for instance, at one point applies the term to vincent. it has more to do with power than with race. the powerful characters utter the word to express their dominance over weaker characters. most of these gangsters are not racist in practice. indeed, they are intermingled racially, and have achieved a level of equality that surpasses the habits of many law-abiding citizens in our society. they resort to racial epithets because it's a patter that establishes their separateness from the non-criminal world. there's a nice moral progression to the stories. we presume that vincent hesitates to sleep with mia out of fear rather than loyalty. later, butch's act of heroism could be motivated by honor, but we're never sure. the film ends, however, with jules making a clear moral choice. thus, the movie seems to be exploring whether violent outlaws can act other than for self-preservation. still, it's hard to find much of a larger meaning tying together these eccentric set of stories. none of the stories are really ""about"" anything. they certainly are not about hit-men pontificating about burgers. nor is the film really a satire or a farce, although it contains elements of both. at times, it feels like a tale that didn't need to be told, but for whatever reason this movie tells it and does a better job than most films of its kind, or of any other kind.";17 November 2005;10;['early', 'big', 'other', 'witty', 'entertaining', 'normal', 'regular', 'other', 'comic', 'such', 'final', 'coherent', 'textured', 'much', 'many', 'astonishing', 'many', 'first', 'deep', 'deep', 'brilliant', 'numerous', 'other', 'great', 'abstract', 'great', 'fine', 'first', 'unforgettable', 'easy', 'black', 'main', 'standard', 'wrong', 'small', 'unexpected', 'whole', 'desperate', 'absurd', 'small', 'conventional', 'well', 'whole', 'simple', 'straightforward', 'cool', 'generic', 'tarantino', 'potential', 'clever', 'witty', 'full', 'intelligent', 'human', 'special', 'sure', 'entire', 'invisible', 'most', 'whole', 'big', 'favorite', 'present', 'dumb', 'attractive', 'controversial', 'liberal', 'more', 'powerful', 'weak', 'most', 'racist', 'many', 'racial', 'non', 'criminal', 'nice', 'moral', 'sure', 'clear', 'moral', 'violent', 'other', 'hard', 'much', 'large', 'eccentric', 'well', 'most', 'other'];0.1692765567765567

598;DaveDiggler;"""pulp fiction"" is considered quentin tarantino' masterpiece; both as a writer and director. although it's not a perfect film and has a couple flaws, ""pulp fiction"" has one of the greatest scripts that changed the way films were made. the film opens with a conversation between ""pumpkin"" and ""honey bunny"" as they chat about their new plans to rob restaurants instead of banks and liquor stores. eventually this scene will end the film as it doubles back on itself. often times- and we're seeing the case more and more with tarantino- he'll drive a film on dialogue instead of plot and substitute plot for senseless dialogue. that happens here, but it works most of the time. lately it hasn't been working on the level of ""pulp fiction."" uma thurman plays marcellus wallace's (ving rhames) wife, mia, and her only importance to film is to be entertained by vincent vega (john travolta) on a date that's not quite a date. i feel as if these scenes are supposed to entertain us since it has nothing to do with the plot that is extremely thin compared to its run time (154 minutes). travolta, for me, is the real stand out. when he's on screen his scenes, whether jackson is next to him or not, are full of energy and pulp. he does a lot of listening, some dancing, a lot of arguing and/or debating, and offers up a lot of great comedic moments. his best scenes are with uma thurman when they go to jackrabbit slims. this little date, where they talk about nothing of much importance as far plot is concerned, is funny, engrossing and entertaining. i don't know why it never gets old, but it doesn't. the acting between the two is great and both were worthy of their oscar nominations for best actor and best supporting actress respectively. this section of the film is one of the strongest of the three along with ""the bonnie situation."" the writing and acting is superb in both sections. this date leads to an overdose as mia takes a line of vincent's heroine. the direction here is much in the mold of a graphic hitchcock film. to add to the suspense the owner of the house counts to three (something that happens quite a bit in the film). as he slowly counts to three we see all the nervously waiting faces in the entire room. we get a close-up shot on the needle that's cocked back and ready to strike. we get a close-up on the red dot where the needle needs to hit. it slowly builds the scene and the suspense. tarantino handles this scene and all the others with a ton of precision and a lot of confidence. tarantino makes huge strides as a director since his previous film, ""reservoir dogs,"" and a lot has to do with his confidence as a director. the older tarantino is too confident in his abilities. the majority of ""pulp fiction"" has a lot of energy and snap to it. if you watch closely to the opening scene in ""reservoir dogs"" you won't see that same kind of crisp, confident direction from tarantino. there are a lot of pauses throughout that conversation and it doesn't quite flow like a tarantino film that we've become used to. to his credit he was working with some b-list (some c or d-list) actors. he's not working with much more here, but the majority of his major role players are all acted out terrifically with the exception of one: bruce willis- through not fault of tarantino; bruce is just a bad actor. the section of the film that really drags, and is noticeably behind compared to the other two sections, is ""the gold watch"" section. this section is incapable of greatness since bruce willis single handedly ruins it with his ""die hard"" facial expressions, especially when they're not needed. the writing here is also the worst and, at times, puts the actors in very difficult situations. this section becomes annoying as we hear bruce willis call his girlfriend- that we won't care at all about- lemon pie, sugar pie, and retard. when he calls her a retard it's pretty funny, but other than that this lacks the punch that travolta and thurman provided minutes earlier. this section is bloated with dialogue, bad acting, and uninteresting characters. ""the gold watch"" has its moments and definitely picks up when we meet the gimp and the crazy world that we fall into. it just takes too long getting there. christopher walken provides a very interesting and hilarious story of the watch that has been passed down anally from generation to generation of the coolidge family. ""the bonnie situation"" may very well be the strongest section of the film. this is where we meet ""the wolf"" (harvey keitel) as he cleans up a mess made by vincent vega in a hilarious scene where he accidentally ""shot marvin the face."" ""the bonnie situation"" offers up quite a bit of laughs, some great acting, and a very strong ending. the film ends where it started with jules (jackson) talking about changing his life around as he ""walks the earth."" thankfully gods interventionist-like hand, that saved him hours earlier, doesn't make him walk too far as he has sent him a weak person for the transitional jules to save. the film ends on jules changing or turning against everything he has ever done or known. instead of being a bad - and killing ""pumpkin"" (tim roth), he gives him some money, out of his own wallet, for a chance to start fresh and redeem himself. this might actually be ""pumpkin"" and ""honey bunny's"" last heist, and they have jules to thank for the chance at redemption and changing their ways.";16 August 2008;9;['perfect', 'great', 'pumpkin', 'new', 'most', 'only', 'thin', 'run', 'real', 'next', 'full', 'great', 'comedic', 'good', 'little', 'much', 'far', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'old', 'great', 'worthy', 'oscar', 'good', 'good', 'strong', 'superb', 'much', 'graphic', 'entire', 'close', 'ready', 'red', 'tarantino', 'huge', 'previous', 'reservoir', 'old', 'confident', 'opening', 'reservoir', 'same', 'crisp', 'confident', 'tarantino', 'used', 'more', 'major', 'tarantino', 'bad', 'other', 'incapable', 'single', 'hard', 'facial', 'bad', 'difficult', 'annoying', 'funny', 'other', 'bloated', 'bad', 'uninteresting', 'crazy', 'long', 'interesting', 'hilarious', 'strong', 'hilarious', 'great', 'strong', 'like', 'weak', 'transitional', 'bad', 'own', 'fresh', 'pumpkin', 'last'];0.1644816390506046
599;sublime501;"after watching pulp fiction, i wasn't quite sure what to make of it. it felt a little odd calling it a ""great"" film, because it is essentially just a lot of violence, swearing, sex, and drugs. or so you'd think. in reality, this movie has true character depth. every character is so complex and interesting that you have to care for even the sleaziest, and each character never fails to fascinate and compel you. it's the story of two mob hit men, two diner bandits, and a boxer whose lives intertwine in various ways. the subplots are pretty complex, and the way that the movie goes out of chronological order makes it a lot more interesting. at least eight people are killed, or if not, badly injured. and nearly every sentence contains at least one swear word. there are a few graphic and memorable sexual innuendos, and countless drug references. but let's be honest. although the script is classic (who doesn't know the ""quarter pounder with cheese"" scene?) and the direction is, as always, great from mr. quentin tarantino, pulp fiction would be nothing if not for the truly perfect cast. this movie would definitely not be considered as classic as it is if it weren't for the cast that supports it. every single cast member is brilliant and executes their role perfectly. john travolta and samuel l. jackson make a perfect team and have a wonderful chemistry. bruce willis surprised me in being a very good actor (although maybe i haven't seen enough of his movies to judge him). uma thurman is wonderful, and so is the rest of the supporting cast. everyone is just perfect. although the cast doesn't have a whole lot to fall back on, other than the classic script and great direction, they truly make this movie what it is--a mob classic with depth. if you don't say out loud, ""cool!"" when somebody gets shot in the head, this movie may not be for you. and if you can't accept pulp fiction for what it is (which is violence, swearing, sex, and drugs), then you won't like it. if you can see what it's meant to be and just sit back and enjoy it, you most likely will be very impressed. i was. my approval. 9.5/10.";23 May 2004;9;['sure', 'little', 'odd', 'great', 'true', 'complex', 'interesting', 'sleazy', 'din', 'various', 'complex', 'chronological', 'interesting', 'injured', 'least', 'swear', 'few', 'graphic', 'memorable', 'sexual', 'countless', 'honest', 'classic', 'great', 'perfect', 'classic', 'single', 'brilliant', 'perfect', 'wonderful', 'good', 'enough', 'wonderful', 'perfect', 'whole', 'other', 'classic', 'great', 'loud', 'cool', 'impressed'];0.3499839124839125

616;movielover1989;----------this has spoilers----------------- pulp fiction is an awesome movie. it is long but you can't even tell it seems to be only about an hour and forty five minutes. when in reality its closer to two and a half hours. this movie was great i well every way possible. jackson and travolta are great together. willis pulls off another believable role. and thurman plays drugged up really well. first this is a segmented movie. the first segment vincent vega aka. travolta has to take out marcellises wife (thurman). this leads to the dance off followed by thurman od'ing and then vincent has to give her an adrenalin shot in the heart. in the second segment entitled the gold watch butch (willis) needs to get his gold watch back from his apartment and along the way he runs into a hit man marcellus himself and some gay rapists. this is a great section with a good share of violence. in the third and final section it picks off where the movie began where jules (jackson) and vincent (travolta) have to get a suitcase of what you can only assume is gold to there boss. along the way they accidentally blow off some guys head then wolf (keitel) helps them get out of that one then they get caught up in a restaurant robbery which jules decides to take into his own hands. this movie is just great it is a perfect 10 from beginning to end. this is most definitely not to be missed. this is 100% excellent. watch it.;11 February 2006;10;['awesome', 'long', 'close', 'great', 'possible', 'great', 'believable', 'second', 'hit', 'gay', 'great', 'good', 'third', 'final', 'gold', 'own', 'great', 'perfect', 'excellent'];0.5229166666666667

621;garage5inc;"10/10 easily, this is a must see for anyone fifteen and up. step aside forrest gump... i originally heard this was one of the coolest movies made in the 90's and that the music was perfectly intertwined with the story. both were absolutely correct, but i will give you a review that will make you drive to blockbusters right now and rent it or buy it. ""what do two hitmen, a briefcase, a prizefighter, and a gold watch have in common?"" pulp fiction starts off with the music ""jungle boogie"" in the credits which we see later is actually a radio being tuned in by john travolta (who was on a self-destructing movie career mode for almost 15 years until this) and samuel l. jackson (in his best performance to date) two hitmen who work in la need to collect something from small-time crooks who screwed their vengeful boss (ving rhames) over. from start to finish pulp fiction's dialogue is the most known, most recognizable, and most quoted in cinematic history. travolta and jackson enter the apartment with guns ready, amusingly talking about how fast food in america is different than fast food in europe and other such things. pulp fiction immediately grabs your attention when jackson and travolta storm into the apartment room and demand answers, a briefcase, and a taste of a big kahuna burger. when travolta opens up the briefcase we see a gold light emit from it, every single person who has seen this movie has a different opinion on what could be inside, but it's never revealed. in some very memorable dialogue jackson intimidates the crooks by demanding answers on why they did what they did first by shooting one of them while another is trying to talk his way out of his death and saying to the leader of the group ""oh i'm sorry did i break your concentration?"" jackson shouts out his death-sentence prayer which might give you a chill the first time you see it and then opens fire on him while we see the gold light flash on jackson and travolta simeltaniously. pulp fiction consists of a few oscar-winning stories by quentin tarantino. vincent vega and mia wallace the gold watch the bonnie situation each story is intertwined and reveals to us the true side of american crime and situations in the early 80's. the begining starts out, followed by the scene after the last scene, then a flashback, followed by the real end of the story where all loose ends are tied up, and then the first scene of the movie ties to the last scene. sounds difficult? absolutely not! roger avary and qt have made this complex story so simple almost anyone can understand it, and that is by no means a bad thing at all. comedy, dialogue, drugs, dancing, the gold watch, boxing incident, an accidental meet between two small time bank robbers in love and two philosophical hitmen, and the gimp is how to explain pulp fiction. after seeing pulp fiction, it will almost definately go on your top 10 list of movies of all time. american film institute - 100 greatest american movies ever made #96 academy awards (movies of 1994) best picture (nomination) best director (nomination: quentin tarantino best actor (nomination): john travolta best supporting actor (nomination): samuel l. jackson best supporting actress (nomination): uma thurman best original screenplay: roger avary & quentin tarantino best editing (nomination) cannes film festival: best picture";31 October 2002;10;['forr', 'cool', 'correct', 'common', 'good', 'small', 'vengeful', 'recognizable', 'cinematic', 'ready', 'fast', 'different', 'fast', 'other', 'such', 'big', 'gold', 'light', 'single', 'different', 'memorable', 'sorry', 'first', 'few', 'true', 'american', 'early', 'last', 'real', 'loose', 'first', 'last', 'difficult', 'complex', 'simple', 'bad', 'accidental', 'small', 'philosophical', 'top', 'great', 'american', 'good', 'good', 'tarantino', 'good', 'good', 'original', 'tarantino', 'good', 'good'];0.1468182979810887

628;JonSnowsMother;this movie shows you don't need stupid twists to make a great film all it was was a cool gangster movie which didn't need a big budget. the film is based on three story's first is about two gangsters vincent(travolta) and jules(jackson) and they got to get something back from these guys who messed with their boss marsellus wallace. in that scene is amazing and samuel l jackson gives an amazing performance and is so cool. (e.g. jules faces bret(the guy who stole marsellus wallace money) jules: what does marsellus wallace look like? bret: what? (jules points his gun at bret) jules: say what again. say what again,motherf***** say what one more goddamn time. bret: he's b-b-black jules: go on bret: he's bald jules: does he look like a bitch? bret: what (jules shoots him in the arm) jules: does he look like a bitch bret: no jules: then why you f***ing him like a bitch,bret? bret: i didn't jules: yes you did. you tried to f**k him and marsellus wallace don't like to be f****d by anybody,except mrs wallace. are you mrs wallace bret: no jules: of course your f***ing not! the second story is about vincent taking out marcellus wallace wife mia(thurman) to dinner and mia almost dies because she took some deadly cocaine vincent had. the third is about butch(willis) a boxer who was payed by marcellus wallace to fall in a fight but butch wins the fight and runs off. but butch's girlfriend forgets his watch which was given by captain koons(walken) a man butch's dad was in a prison camp with in vietnam. butch risks his life to get the watch and results in him and marcellus wallace get captured by two gay rapists. the third and final story is the follow up of the first story about jules and vincent. pulp fiction is different to other gangster movies but one of the best around. and the best modern gangster movie.;24 February 2008;10;['stupid', 'great', 'cool', 'big', 'first', 'amazing', 'amazing', 'cool', 'more', 'goddamn', 'black', 'bald', 'second', 'marcellus', 'deadly', 'third', 'marcellus', 'marcellus', 'gay', 'third', 'final', 'first', 'different', 'other', 'good', 'good', 'modern'];0.2202380952380953

642;samfischer88;pulp fiction is hard to put into perspective. in every way possible, this is just fantastic. tarantino showed us brilliance in style, story, and cast. i've seen pulp fiction multiple times now, and it is safe to say that this might be the best movie ever put together. this is a different kind of crime and action movie. this is a weirdly authentic. there are some gruesome, yet comedic scenes. this is really what turned tarantino into tarantino. there are surprises that are dramatic, yet hysterical in how it is presented. its truly original and has yet to be matched by any movie i've seen. pulp fiction won an oscar for best original script, which it rightfully should have. this script is broken into chapters, presenting different sides of the story. each chapter is unique, presenting new characters that really piece everything together. along with the story in general, there are gems of memorable quotes. these powerful lines make the movie even more memorable, as they cause the scenes to stand out among other classic movies. the cast is once in a lifetime as well. its like the actors and actresses were made for these roles. travolta. samuel l. bruce willis. uma. thats just to name a few. this a star studded cast! they played there parts well, with travolta and jackson really being the most memorable to me. their scenes are spectacular. travolta was the star, but jackson had the star quotes. travolta deserved more recognition for his performance. jackson's quotes are the ones i remember. his lines will be remembered by viewers forever among the classics. this is a once in a lifetime movie, that really should be seen by everyone at some point in their lives. it is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. 10/10.;14 February 2016;10;['hard', 'possible', 'fantastic', 'multiple', 'safe', 'good', 'different', 'authentic', 'gruesome', 'comedic', 'tarantino', 'dramatic', 'hysterical', 'original', 'good', 'original', 'different', 'unique', 'new', 'general', 'memorable', 'powerful', 'memorable', 'other', 'classic', 'few', 'memorable', 'spectacular', 'more'];0.1528900112233445
643;ferni-tierni;"pulp fiction is a lesson that even if people act on their best intentions, if they are surrounded by evil or around bad influences, there are so many events outside of their control that they are bound to be punished eventually. this is why jules (samuel l. jackson) decides to liberate himself from the ""evil life"" after experiencing his divine intervention. he wanted to be good and inspire benevolence in people rather than symbolizing the tyranny of evil men. in almost all the scenes of the movie we get reminded how destructive and grim situations can become if characters do not decide to live a life of virtue and responsibility. the verse recited by jules progressively gains more power as we navigate the protagonist's desire for vengeance or restitution. it is the metaphor that if you initiate the process of changing your thoughts (biblical verse) maybe actions (forgiving pumpkin) might follow and also habits and life in general. as is customary in tarantino's films, the majority of the characters have temerity, choleric temperament, unforgiving, and reckless decision making. vincent (john travolta) accidentally shoots his friend on the face while jules drives the car. mia (uma thurman) overdoses with cocaine and has to be revived by vincent with an adrenaline shot to heart. butch (bruce willis) decides to run over marcellus wallace (ving rhames) on the street and ends up destroying his girlfriend's car. marcellus and butch fight on a weapon's store, and they get restrained, tied up, and sodomized by strangers. tarantino was dead set on sending a message that if you are participating in illegal, immoral, or destructive behavior, you will get punished by destiny, fate, or god. the dialogue is some of the best i have seen in movies: vincent's casual stories of amsterdam, jules and vincent conversation on the comparison of feet massage and oral sex, the biblical verse jules recites to his victims, pumpkin's description of how restaurants is the best place to rob. by these scenes the characters received personality, charisma, ideology, convictions. we get a glimpse into their life and aspirations; we understand their motivations. all of these instances give flavor and atmosphere to the movie that gives us a sense of novelty and originality. the astute part is that most of the characters seem reasonable and humane despite their murderous behavior. this adds more to the message of the movie that humanity can still be recovered after falling into the valley of darkness. the tension was not as good as some of his other movies, but the scenes compensate it with other cinematographic content. jules scenes in the restaurant robbery and in the recovery of the briefcase were intense, smart, ruthless, charismatic, audacious, and original.";20 April 2020;10;['good', 'bad', 'many', 'evil', 'divine', 'good', 'evil', 'destructive', 'grim', 'more', 'biblical', 'general', 'customary', 'choleric', 'unforgiving', 'reckless', 'marcellus', 'dead', 'illegal', 'immoral', 'destructive', 'good', 'casual', 'vincent', 'oral', 'biblical', 'good', 'astute', 'most', 'reasonable', 'humane', 'murderous', 'more', 'good', 'other', 'other', 'cinematographic', 'intense', 'smart', 'ruthless', 'charismatic', 'audacious', 'original'];0.0085459183673469

645;Habibi-Universe;what a great movie by quentin tarantino set in the late 1980s/early 1990s. a typical classic. in my opinion, this is not quentin's finest and best work as i prefer some of his other movies such as django unchained, but this is definitely his most iconic picture. for some reason, quentin tarantino always manages to pull off such great dialogue in his movies which have a very nice flair to them. dialogue, which is clearly one of his strengths, build up rising tension and as a viewer you never know what is going to happen next in the scene. there are some unexpected twists in the movie that really shocked me. i found myself gasping a few times throughout the movie. 'pulp fiction' is just another great example of what a fantastic writer and director quentin tarantino really is. my favourite performance in this movie was by far samuel l jackson's one. he really shined throughout every single scene with his great acting presence. it is always such a joy for me to watch this brilliant man act. another actor who i liked way more than expected was the great bruce willis whose performance really surprised me since i had never seen him act so well before. this movie is fantastic, sure does it feel different to other movies you have seen, but that's what makes a movie great and stand out from others. i whole-heartedly recommend this amazing piece of fiction to everyone who is a film fan and doesn't mind a little bit of gore. this my friends, is a true classic! 8.5/10;6 January 2019;8;['great', 'late', 'early', 'typical', 'fine', 'good', 'other', 'such', 'iconic', 'such', 'great', 'nice', 'unexpected', 'few', 'great', 'fantastic', 'favourite', 'single', 'great', 'brilliant', 'more', 'great', 'fantastic', 'different', 'other', 'great', 'amazing', 'little', 'true'];0.3282525510204082

659;alishahmohd;for the people who are not aware of the concept and the style that quentin tarantino uses for most of his movies, tarantino's films involve a lot of blood, violence, strong language and profanity and most of his films are not told in a continuous manner they keep on switching between time periods like past and present. tarantino takes his style and concept and pushes it to the absolute max in pulp fiction and this resulted in arguably the greatest film he ever made. pulp fiction tells 3 different interrelated stories, with one main character, the first story's main protagonist is vincent (john travolta), the main protagonist of the second story is butch (bruce willis) and jules (samuel l. jackson) is the main protagonist in the third with vincent playing a very strong supporting role. the film also includes a prologue and epilogue and these stories are also shown non chronologically. this film uses such a unique format, that chronologically the events of the epilogue take place just moments after the prologue and the three stories told in the middle take place before or after the events of the prologue/epilogue. pulp fiction is one of those films that would have perhaps not been as entertaining if it had been shown in a chronological order, it's non linear format of storytelling is definitely one of it's highest points keeps the viewer thinking and interpreting. this is a major benefit because the viewer can just choose to watch one story at the time and still be entertained and will still feel like that he watched a short flick and there will be a sense of completion. all story's can also be re-watched chronologically to watch the film from a different perspective. the film can also be re-watched in the current order it is in to comprehend the film in it's entirety. the film's replay value is tremendously high, i watched it around 10 times and always found it entertaining. pulp fiction does not hold the viewer on the edge of his seat to find out what will happen next, but to think about what transpired earlier and what led to the current situation. for example: vincent and jules went to do their job ,all dressed sup in suits and couple of hours later they go to bar to meet their boss in shorts and t shirts, at first i thought it was a glaring oversight but this is heavily explained later on and i was extremely surprised with the events that led to this sudden change of attire. the film's three stories are not that in depth or engaging neither is the overall plot of the film, but the plot is still funny, interesting and keeps us engaged throughout, the three stories also inspired by short films that tarantino is a fan of, brands that tarentino loves and b grade movies that tarentino likes they all appear, this is a quentin tarantino movie through and through and his fingerprints are all over it, he himself makes a cameo in this film, and despite not being a trained actor does a decent job. the dialogue is the film's greatest point, some really awesome, fantastic and memorable dialogues are spoken throughout this entire film that they are being quoted to this very day. this film does not want to directly take you into the action, when vincent and jules first went to do their job, they didn't get directly into they talked about a series of unrelated events which were all interesting to listen, they are criminals about to commit a crime, but to them it is just another day at work, they are co workers and friends and they are gossiping. another example is bruce betrayed marsellus wallace and killed someone, he is on the run but decides to smoke in the hired cab and discuss with the taxi driver in detail about what he just did. another example would be us bruce willis going around his house's yard, rather than the film directly starting the scene with him entering through his house's front door, in the yard scene the camera focuses closely behind butch to keep us on the edge of out seats and expect someone to attack him, although nothing happens. pulp fiction has many pop culture references and also involves some serious and controversial subjects likes miracles, drugs, mob bosses, taking dives, betting, homosexuality, rape all these subjects are depicted in the film. the soundtrack and full length songs that are used are really good and just are fun to listen, the main theme and ending themes are also excellent tracks. the acting is fantastic, samuel l jackson steals the show with his natural roles as jules, john travolta regains his former glory and fame with his excellent performance as vincent, uma thurman as mia wallace was also great and bruce willis is also portrays the butch character very well. there are many awesome cameos throughout the film where the actors deliver their lines and perform their roles almost perfectly my favorite however must be christoper walken's short cameo and the sentimental story he tells about the golden watch. all other minor characters like tim roth and amanda plummer also do a commendable job n their short roles. in conclusion, i want to say that pulp fiction is an astonishingly unique film which does not have a deep story and there is hardly any morale to the story but a tremendously entertaining film, with a fun plot, brilliant and absolutely mind blowing dialogue with tons of pop culture references and social commentary. it is simple a masterpiece without a message and arguably quentin tarantino's best movie. overall: 9.5/10;22 November 2013;10;['aware', 'most', 'strong', 'most', 'continuous',

673;joelnova93;what tarantino can teach you about writing is that characters shouldn't just be pieces on a board to move the plot along, but they should be living, breathing citizens of the world the writer crafted for the viewers. that's why his films are so long, and pace so slowly: you sit with the characters. hang out with them. get to know them long enough so that they show you their quirks. on top of all this, tarantino engages the viewer even further by writing multiple intersecting plot lines that are portrayed out of order, which is very satisfying as all the puzzle pieces come together. knowing a little bit about a character's future can let the viewer breathe, and calling back to a familiar situation from a new angle is suspenseful to wonder when or how that new element will play out. overall a very refreshing, very wild movie. truly a work of art. 10/10;4 August 2019;10;['long', 'tarantino', 'multiple', 'satisfying', 'little', 'familiar', 'new', 'suspenseful', 'new', 'refreshing', 'wild'];0.1510227272727272

685;Grimbleton;"probably tarantino's best film, pulp fiction is a self-sidetracking and highly combustible film that out-does itself at every turn. centered around several people who's individual arcs all meet at the fork in the road, the film does a masterful job of developing characters and telling a story about people striving to keep and flaunt their power. the performances by the star-studded cast are absolutely stunning and are only augmented by tarantino's whimsical dialogue, with almost a twenty-minute sequence with just vincent and jules talking about nonsense. every scene only enhances the depth of these characters, providing great insight into the personalities that make up people like butch or marsellus by providing a window into the way they think and interact with others. although the jumbled time-frame can cause confusion at first, it all eventually falls into place and wraps itself up in the end, making for one interesting film. probably my favorite aspect of the film is how it treats every character like a normal human being, foregoing the heroics and the pretense of a ""primary protagonist"" - this leaves the viewer with a film where they observe the initial position of a character and watch that character go through a set of struggles completely unique (and in some cases absolutely mental) that put their personalities and beliefs to the test. all in all, this is tarantino's best film and shows how ditching the traditional film setup creates a film with an unprecendented form, all only to aid in its success.";16 January 2021;9;['good', 'combustible', 'several', 'individual', 'masterful', 'stunning', 'whimsical', 'great', 'interesting', 'favorite', 'normal', 'human', 'primary', 'initial', 'unique', 'mental', 'good', 'traditional', 'unprecendented'];0.2955882352941176
686;DemonKiki;"the postmodern discourse of the film, because it is in the post-industrial society era, is driven by the commercialization of the consumer society, thus embodying commercial, game, and popular colors. jameson pointed out that the old (essentially advanced modernist) boundary between the advanced culture and the so-called popular culture or business culture has been abolished, and new texts have emerged that are full of forms, categories and contents of cultural industries. bourdieu believes that the film has got rid of the shackles of classic art and has become a popular culture or a postmodern culture and has become a cultural capital. the purity of aesthetics and the self-discipline of art have been impacted. the tower of pure aesthetic ivory has collapsed under the impact of popular art and its aesthetics. the ensuing is the appearance of popular aesthetics, and it has increasingly gained its own aesthetic legitimacy. attracting audiences with popular themes, flattening the depth, everything is flat, this is what distinguishes the serious attitude of postmodernism from modernism. the result is to give the audience leisure, fashion, relaxation, surprise, and no tears. violence, crime, sex and other generally considered vulgar themes are the themes of postmodern movies. especially in terms of violent style, tarantino became a single family. violence has always been the unshakable theme of quentin's works, and formed his black violence aesthetics. violence is bloody, cold, game, and does not carry any moral and political responsibilities. ""pulp fiction"" thoroughly stylized and gamified violence. it makes the audience realize that at this moment, you are watching movies for entertainment, so tarentino will turn violence into joke, sex into joke, politics into joke, and history into joke. it does not ask about the meaning, does not reflect, does not touch politics, not to mention resistance. the ""bible"" quotes before jules' killing were not intended to legitimize his murder. similarly, the scene of mia's overdose did not have any intention of exhorting drug addicts. ""black"" has also been treated as a piece of joke. both vincent and jules drove around the city in a car full of brains and blood. in order not to let the police find it, but also in order not to add trouble to their friends, they had to do it within 40 minutes. cleaning the car is a very technical task, so that they have to hire a special problem-solving expert from the headquarters to guide them in their work. when the two big-hearted men finally washed themselves and the car afterwards, while wearing two exaggerated and somewhat funny t-shirts standing in front of the camera, a scene full of blood and terror was transformed into a humorous sketch, and the popularity and gameplay are most vividly displayed here. so some people say: ""pulp fiction"" completed the transformation of violent movies from modernity to post-modernity, showing that post-modern violent movies have completely lost the power of social criticism, the depth and the profound connection between old movies and the real world. no longer carries the meaning of cultural symbols such as national mythology, heroism, social resistance, political complaints, etc. some other similar cultural commitments are also taken out, leaving only the image itself. ""and the frequent scenes of violence in the film are echoing its ""circular structure"" clearly states that the occurrence of violence is cyclical and never stops. ""pulp fiction"" tells us: in life, violence, including wars and boxing, is omnipresent. there is no justice in life and death, right or wrong in front of it. although quentin tarantino has never talked about postmodernism, he knows its essence. he seems to tell us that life in the 20th century is developing rapidly, changing fast and worthless. no one is immune. no matter whether life or death is unreasonable and fair is a ""vulgar novel"", and this is where the subversive power of postmodern cinema aesthetics lies.";16 April 2020;10;['postmodern', 'post', 'industrial', 'commercial', 'popular', 'old', 'advanced', 'advanced', 'popular', 'new', 'full', 'cultural', 'classic', 'popular', 'postmodern', 'cultural', 'pure', 'aesthetic', 'popular', 'popular', 'own', 'aesthetic', 'popular', 'flat', 'serious', 'other', 'vulgar', 'postmodern', 'violent', 'single', 'unshakable', 'black', 'bloody', 'cold', 'moral', 'political', 'gamified', 'bible', 'black', 'full', 'technical', 'special', 'big', 'hearted', 'exaggerated', 'funny', 'full', 'humorous', 'violent', 'post', 'post', 'modern', 'violent', 'social', 'profound', 'old', 'real', 'cultural', 'such', 'national', 'social', 'political', 'other', 'similar', 'cultural', 'frequent', 'circular', 'cyclical', 'omnipresent', 'right', 'wrong', 'worthless', 'immune', 'unreasonable', 'fair', 'vulgar', 'subversive', 'postmodern'];0.0311978200371057

688;pgear83;"widely considered to be the best film of the past quarter-century and certainly the most influential, the second film directed by quentin tarantino is a masterpiece of modern storytelling. the film contains multiple and intersecting story lines and popularized this structural technique, paving the way for such excellent films as magnolia, crash and babel. likewise, the non-linear chronology of the film was also a likely inspiration for many future films, including christopher nolan's memento. but none of these later films come close to tarantino's original. the greatest strength of this movie, and indeed all of tarantino's work, is the writing, particularly in terms of dialog. characters speak as they do in real life, not just to advance a plot, but about random mundanities as well. tarantino could have been as great a novelist as he is a filmmaker and it shows in this dialog. musings on mcdonald's in europe or the level of intimacy involved in a foot massage become funnier and more fascinating than one would ever think. characters also stutter, trip over their words, repeat themselves and use poor grammar (not just as in colloquialisms) just as people do in unscripted real life. yet the film is so well acted and absorbing that we do not even notice these linguistic imperfections without applying very close scrutiny. as an example of the realism of the dialog, take the famous scene (indeed, one of many famous scenes in the film) in which mia wallace (uma thurman) has overdosed on heroin and vincent vega (john travolta) has taken her to his drug dealer's house for help. the plan is to give her a shot of adrenaline directly to her heart (not a sound strategy according to any literature i've read; you would think they'd have some naloxone on hand for this purpose, but i digress). vincent needs to make a mark over mia's heart so that he can stab a needle into it: vincent: what i need is a big fat magic marker (pause) you got it? jody: (after a pause) what? vincent: a magic marker... (annoyed, desperate) a felt pen, a (expletive)ing black magic marker! i find this very funny because it is like one of those situations in everyday life where people misunderstand each other because they have different words for things, or they mishear. of course, in an emergency situation like this one, tempers would obviously flare. all of tarantino's films have excellent dialog, but what really sets pulp fiction above the rest are the themes of redemption/salvation and the character arc of jules winnfield (samual l. jackson). the partner of vincent vega, jules is a bible quoting, murderous hit-man. jules and vincent sadistically kill a room full of young men to reacquire the mysterious briefcase, belonging to their boss. in finishing this job, however, they escape death themselves only by an extraordinarily unlikely occurrence. jules believes a miracle has occurred, but vincent dismisses it as chance. they debate the implications of what has happened first at the site and later at the restaurant that is the site of the first and last scenes of the film. as they debate, the camera cuts back and forth between them, showing them in opposite profiles and highlighting their opposite world-views. in a ""moment of clarity"" jules decides to give up crime and ""walk the earth."" vincent is skeptical, but jules shows he is serious by going out of his way to save the lives of the two more amateurish robbers that attempt to steal the briefcase. likewise, in one of the other story lines we see butch coolidge (bruce willis) risk his own life to save another human being (who only hours before was trying to kill him) from torture. it is these examples of morality from the immoral and of karma working its fatal purpose that make this an often inspiring film. finally, i have to wonder whether tarantino even knew how great a film he was making. pulp fiction is a tribute to the lurid, disposable so-called 'low' art of the mid 20th century - poorly dubbed asian crime films, sci-fi magazines and detective stories, etc. who would have thought that one of the century's last great works of art would have arisen from such material? perhaps a microcosm of this is the manner in which jules is a connoisseur of fast-food hamburgers, finding beauty and delectability in the most mundane and disposable of culinary indulgences. this film is indeed, a very tasty burger.";12 July 2008;10;['good', 'past', 'influential', 'second', 'modern', 'multiple', 'intersecting', 'structural', 'such', 'excellent', 'non', 'linear', 'likely', 'many', 'future', 'later', 'original', 'great', 'real', 'random', 'tarantino', 'great', 'funny', 'fascinating', 'poor', 'unscripted', 'real', 'linguistic', 'close', 'famous', 'many', 'famous', 'sound', 'big', 'fat', 'magic', 'magic', 'annoyed', 'desperate', 'black', 'funny', 'everyday', 'other', 'different', 'excellent', 'samual', 'bible', 'murderous', 'full', 'young', 'mysterious', 'unlikely', 'first', 'last', 'opposite', 'opposite', 'skeptical', 'serious', 'more', 'amateurish', 'other', 'own', 'human', 'immoral', 'fatal', 'inspiring', 'tarantino', 'great', 'disposable', 'low', 'mid', 'asian', 'last', 'great', 'such', 'fast', 'mundane', 'disposable', 'culinary', 'tasty'];0.1468055555555555

700;stephen_thanabalan_fans;"quentin tarantino's noir-ish and unconventional (contextualising it at its time) postmodern masterpiece did launch the independent film industry and put miramax on the map (spanning a slew of ensuing films in 'trainspotting' and 'lock stock' and circular time-line film structure duplicates in 'the usual suspects' and 'memento') and i agree on all counts that this film is movie-making genius in most ways- from its sheer originality, stylized offbeat nature, slick camera-work, catchy soundtrack (who can forget the miserlou track) and considering it fathered a genre and was way ahead of its time in 1994 all the way to the fact that it contains a celebration of nuances shared in terms of countless film references ranging francois truffaut (jules et jim- samuel l.jackson's character), robert wise (boxing as the sport of choice for film noir), robert aldrich or alfred hitchcock's psycho (the hilariously dark 'action' scene between bruce willis' character and ving rhames' character). i agree that it shaped culture from the 1990s and beyond because it shed light on film-making's ability to function as an underground americana social commentary, dealing with taboo themes and gritty content but twisting it with a dose of black humor in its eclectic dialogue of rough poetry that plays on ironic wit and borders on poker faced matter-of-fact cynically irreverent pretentiousness. now, my qualm essentially is that with such a quality film, we can raise critique of it to the level of thematic analyses and subsequently, the broader sense mass pop culture influence that the film through no fault of its own, but given its impact and critical acclaim, invariably glosses over. whilst 'redemption' and intervention may be the themes central to the film as evidenced by th story where each character has to make an error, face judgement and then redeems themselves, inasmuch as that helps pulp fiction get dubbed as one of the greatest films of all time, and the quintessential nouveaux independent film industry's kick-starter, what i disagree with is that the film's cult status takes it to the point where the film is seen as redemptive in itself as an entity. true the film may deal with all issues from the oddball and in a very rambunctious way make dark humor acceptable, but it does not change the fact that there is an issue not so much with social responsibility (screw that) but more so with a question i have about: purpose. i personally cannot (not that anyone cares about my opinion anyway) in my view give this film top billing because on top of the fact that it deliberately misquotes biblical scripture to prove samuel jackson's character was basically a pseudo philosophical inanity designed to flatter to deceive, i actually start to wonder whether that element was a synonymous microcosm of what the film was doing in general- flattering to deceive? and more so because i concomitantly wonder, just what is the point of pulp fiction anyway? it carries no greater lacing, no greater meaning, and other than being new and refreshing as compared to the commercial fare grinded out at its time and in the wake of its immediate predecessors, by those tokens could only possibly be a revolutionary film, and not a great film, certainly not as lofty as its accolades thus far have deemed it. then again, perhaps that too is a rhetorical question given that the quote at the start goes, to deal with ""lurid subject matter"" characteristically put on rough, unfinished paper. maybe we can substitute paper for film? the problem with this is that i find it serves itself more as an anti-mainstream film (speculating that until 1994 all or most films including the cult classics that it references) proud to linger over its ostensibly 'classic' small stories. it pompously celebrates itself with every element of itself (that i've listed at the start of this review) carrying a touch of over-rated pretentiousness to the film such that it assumes just assembling references to great film styles (now we know tarantino paid lots of homage to all the great films he watched whilst still a video store clerk) makes it capable of being a top film. in my opinion, this is no fault of the film per se but more so the expectations raised by such an over-rated film. for me, it lacks the heart or element of tragedy that comes with the nature of the content it displays- some say that its very strength- because it has no clear heroes/villains/right/wrongs, but for me that is its weakness - an emotionless diatribe that masks itself very well. black masks itself, and that is it- pulp fiction- pulp content that fictionally sells more and i accept its critical acclaimed role in modern indie cinema, but it must not be overrated and esteemed more than that. i give it: 8/10";15 November 2005;8;['unconventional', 'postmodern', 'independent', 'circular', 'usual', 'most', 'sheer', 'offbeat', 'slick', 'catchy', 'miserlou', 'countless', 'alfred', 'dark', 'underground', 'social', 'taboo', 'gritty', 'black', 'eclectic', 'rough', 'ironic', 'irreverent', 'thematic', 'broad', 'mass', 'own', 'critical', 'central', 'great', 'quintessential', 'independent', 'redemptive', 'true', 'rambunctious', 'dark', 'acceptable', 'much', 'social', 'top', 'biblical', 'philosophical', 'synonymous', 'great', 'great', 'other', 'new', 'refreshing', 'commercial', 'immediate', 'revolutionary', 'great', 'lofty', 'rhetorical', 'subject', 'rough', 'unfinished', 'anti', 'mainstream', 'most', 'cult', 'proud', 'classic', 'small', 'such', 'great', 'great', 'capable', 'top', 'clear', 'right', 'black', 'more', 'critical', 'acclaimed', 'modern', 'indie', 'more'];0.1782923775570834

'pulp fiction' is the thrill-ride of cinema . it is like watching a real life comic book on the big screen. it's wild, chaotic, fun, entertaining, and thrilling from beginning to end as it is told from different segments. the plot of about redemption. jules and vincent are two hit men who are sent to retrieve a briefcase for their boss, marsellus wallace. ringo and honey bunny are two bandits who plan to rob a diner. wallace's wife, mia, goes out with vincent and unfortunately has an overuse of drugs. butch coolidge is a boxer who is out of luck and ditches a fight with marsellus' money filled in his pockets, and plans to escape with the money. all of the stories are divided into different segments told at different times. quentin tarantino had his directorial debut with 1992' 'reservoir dogs', and wrote tony scott's 'true romance'. here, he writes and directs 'pulp fiction' with everything he's got, and it never fails. ever. everything about this film is absolutely nothing that you would expect from a mob film, which is exactly one of the reasons that it succeeds. the dialog is classic to say the least, in which it should be required for movie-goer to read that script, and definitely see the movie. there is one very talked about and mysterious scene, when vincent opens the briefcase. no one knows what is in it, at least no fans of the movie. many people take guesses but at times are never close. quentin does this to make us think in our own minds of what it is. some say that it is the jewels from 'reservoir dogs' but some go as far as to say that it is marsellus' soul (briefcase case code: 666; the band-aid on his neck is supposed to cover the ""thorn"" sign). it's highly doubtful in my opinion, but it is one again thought-provoking and interesting. the dialog is great. the film never runs on empty for the script or even the characters. the characters all have lines at some point, and each of them are successful, whereas in 'reservoir dogs' the pace did drag a bit during the background character development. here's an example of the dialog in the film: vincent: you know what they call a quarter pounder with cheese in paris? jules: they don't call it a quarter pounder with cheese? vincent: no man, they got the metric system. they wouldn't know what a quarter pounder is. jules: what do they call it? vincent: they call it a ""royale"" with cheese. jules: a royale with cheese. what do they call a big mac? vincent: well, a big mac's a big mac, but they call it ""le"" big mac. jules: ""le big-mac"". (laughs) what do they call a whopper? vincent: i don't know, i didn't go into burger king. the dialog is very comically funny in some of the scenes, and at the same time is suspenseful in some ways. tarantino's direction is fabulous, as was his in his debut. both this is something different. in his first film, it seemed much more independent and there was much controversy of the style from 'reservoir dogs'. here, his style is much more clear and the writing makes it succeed more than any other indie film i've ever seen. the cast is great, once again. samuel l. jackson gives one of his best, if not the best, performances of his career. travolta, thurman, willis, rhames, roth, and keitel give very memorable performances and quotes. also, christopher walken gives a great comic cameo. each segment tells most about one of the main characters. you get to know each of them one-by-one. in the end, you don't really know which character to root for, because you like all of them. one of the most controversial things about this film that came across the critics was it's violence and excessive language. now that i have seen tarantino's latest film, 'kill bill', i now think that 'pulp fiction' isn't nearly as violent as many people would think nowadays. the language is heavily used, but tarantino blends it in with the script very easily that it isn't really much of a problem. 'pulp fiction' has gotten many excellent reviews and great ratings from fans and critics alike. it is definitely a fan that no movie-goer can't miss out on, and tarantino proves to be one of my favorite directors ever, along on the list with hitchcock, kubrick, scorsese, and spielberg. this is easily the best of quentin's career, and a landmark for films to come. 5 stars out of 5.";11 February 2006;10;['real', 'comic', 'big', 'wild', 'chaotic', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'different', 'different', 'different', 'directorial', 'reservoir', 'true', 'classic', 'least', 'mysterious', 'least', 'many', 'close', 'own', 'reservoir', 'thorn', 'doubtful', 'provoking', 'interesting', 'great', 'empty', 'successful', 'reservoir', 'metric', 'big', 'big', 'big', 'big', 'big', 'funny', 'same', 'suspenseful', 'fabulous', 'different', 'first', 'independent', 'much', 'reservoir', 'clear', 'more', 'other', 'indie', 'great', 'good', 'good', 'memorable', 'great', 'comic', 'most', 'main', 'controversial', 'excessive', 'late', 'violent', 'many', 'tarantino', 'much', 'many', 'excellent', 'great', 'tarantino', 'favorite', 'scorsese', 'good'];0.2296969696969696

736;moviestar26;when this movie released in 1994 it totally redefined the gangster movie genre forever. they can't be a single soul had not seen this movie. by far it became a classic and received cult status and was given many academy awards at the oscars. quentin tarantino became a popular director and the youth were inspired from his movies. however with this movie in particular he caught everyone's attention. many movies later became inspired from this. doug liman's go and seven days in the valeey were speculated with pulp fiction style. hence why many directors were influenced by this movie and attempted to copy its style. guy rithie was very inspired by this movie. this was very evident in 'snatch'. this movie was a lot like a homage to the gangster genre. influances of french and asian cinema are clearly seem in the visuals. it also contained many moments that leads the viewer to watch on in anticipation as to what will happen next. it is an intriguing adventure none the less. this is the genre that i had wished tarantino had stayed with. 'reservoir dogs' and 'jackie brown' were also were also some of his finest works. however his association with robert rodriguez led him on to the path of making vampire and zombie movies, which was not really to my taste. im sure most of his fans may have adored them. **************************contains spoilers*********************** many of tarantino's movies have been shot in la. so there has been no better way to portray the underworld realistically. we are given an insight in to a group of characters, some which are directly and indirectly related to the crime world. the movie is more like a collection of 6 stories collaborated in to one movie. one segment moves to the next. they have a linear pattern but they are shown in a non chronological order. two hit men 'jackson and travolta' recover a suitcase and kill a boy accidentally in their car. they require quick assistance to to deal with the situation. later on they go to a diner where the place will be robbed by a couple. we are then introduced to a black gangster's white wife that one of the hit men has to spend an evening with. he saves her life from a drug overdose. afterwards a boxer turns his back on the gangster he had taken payment from but enters in to a situation whereby he is forgiven. these stories all sum up a 2 day period in la. *************end of spoilers******************************* upon viewing the movie one will notice that there is not really a plot to bite on. instead we are witnesses to a number of situations that arise in coincidently and how the characters will pull themselves out of it. we are shown how members of the underworld operate and that they are very organised people. the movie is filled with witty dialogues and scenes of a violent nature. however i have seen korean movies that have depicted more. the movie is high on style and substance but is very character driven. i know la is a very frightening city to live in and even innocent people can be hurt in gang wars. the movie clearly shows this. a lot of concentration and patience is require in some of scenes, diner scenes especially. due to the fact they are very conversational. many scenes are long stretched whereby a little editing would of helped the film. there is no background music in the movie at all. tarantino instead incorporated music tracks in to many of the scenes to add to the atmosphere. it did not take away any quality what so ever surprisingly. a good example of this was when butch was going to his apartment. bruce willis, harvey keitel, and samuel l jackson without a doubt give one of their best performances. however i could not understand what led rosanna arquette to do this role. i felt she was wasted. all is said this can surely be an exciting and enjoyable ride for anyone who understands and is a fan of gangster movies. it is nearly on line with 'the godfather'.;6 October 2009;8;['single', 'classic', 'many', 'popular', 'particular', 'many', 'valeey', 'many', 'evident', 'french', 'asian', 'many', 'intriguing', 'less', 'tarantino', 'reservoir', 'fine', 'sure', 'most', 'many', 'well', 'related', 'next', 'linear', 'non', 'chronological', 'quick', 'black', 'white', 'organised', 'witty', 'violent', 'korean', 'more', 'high', 'frightening', 'innocent', 'require', 'din', 'conversational', 'many', 'little', 'tarantino', 'many', 'good', 'good', 'exciting', 'enjoyable'];0.2416964285714286
737;OrdinaryDay;tarantino is an enigma, and most people seem to either love him or hate him: there is no middle ground. is he a brilliant, prodigious writer and director who meticulously takes the essence of the hard-boiled crime and detective stories that inspired him growing up and takes their heart and soul and re appropriates it into a story for the modern audience? is he a shameless hack who simply steals from old movies and takes credit for them, trying to claim that these old stories are his 'original ideas'? the thing is, depending on who you ask you will get a different answer. some say yes, some say no, but the thing is that everyone has an opinion! because when you see a work of art such as this, forgetting about any possible derivatives within the story, it is impossible to look away. always riveting, bloody, scary and most of all very funny, with pulp fiction tarantino managed to take time-worn stories that had been done hundreds of times before and since and give it a distinctive tarantino flavor. what kinds of hit men discuss cheeseburgers while going to and from their latest hit? the ones in pulp fiction do! and therein lies the brilliance of this movie, as tarantino made everything that was old seem fresh again, through his distinctive auteur style, narrative that goes back and forth in time, the juxtaposition between street smart cheeky dialog and the horrific actions of the characters and the weird morals within the narrative, which presents bad guys as funny and sexy. perhaps the myths surrounding pulp fiction do an injustice to the movie itself, because so much has been written on the movie, it has been critiqued so many thousands of times, that watching the movie with the weight of all those expectations can seem a little underwhelming. after all, it probably won't change your life, or inspire in you a life long love for hardboiled noir stories or anything like that. pulp fiction exceeds in something so much more simple, and yet something that so many other filmmakers forget to do: it succeeds in being a brilliant piece of entertainment that will keep you on the edge of your seat for the whole duration. and when you get down to it, i think being a piece of brilliant entertainment is much better than being a piece of film history. but what makes pulp fiction so special is that it is both.;19 July 2013;10;['most', 'middle', 'brilliant', 'prodigious', 'modern', 'shameless', 'old', 'old', 'original', 'different', 'such', 'possible', 'impossible', 'bloody', 'scary', 'most', 'funny', 'distinctive', 'tarantino', 'hit', 'late', 'old', 'fresh', 'distinctive', 'smart', 'horrific', 'weird', 'bad', 'funny', 'sexy', 'much', 'many', 'little', 'long', 'simple', 'many', 'other', 'brilliant', 'whole', 'brilliant', 'well', 'special'];0.082860644257703
738;g_ryder;is there a theme and message in this crime-action-thriller? yes there is, and not only is it explicit but also has a subliminal, implicit theme. the theme of noticing, recognizing, and interpreting clues, signs, omens, apparent coincidences, and miraculous happenings and their significances in the choices you then make. there are two distinct, divergent views (and type of persons) on the occurrence of inter-connected events in the world. the first or traditional view is that apart from the mundane, any strange or unusual or inter-connected events are due to super-natural connected causes or divine intervention, and the other is the modern scientific-atheist view that these are merely coincidences, chance, or accidental events and only mistakenly appear to be strangely connected only because they are extremely improbable. according to this latter view, given enough time, even a monkey with a typewriter can eventually produce a shakespearean tragedy, just as a few basic elements like carbon, oxygen, nitrogen etc., given enough time and all the right conditions (near impossibility), will eventually come together to form a highly complex living organism like a bacteria out of sheer chance...by now you get the picture. in this movie, jules who is one of the key characters is of the first type, and his partner vincent is not exactly of the second type but rather the type who doesn't give a damn either way the kind that never reflects upon any happening. when the 'miracle' happens, jules immediately recognizes it, whereas vincent couldn't care less, and so jules knows that this sign, the omen, the extremely unlikely happening is of direct significance for him and him alone and immediately decides to make a choice to make a u-turn in his life of crime. that decision empowers him, and when he comes to face another event where he has the choice either to kill or not to kill he makes the right one. jules stands redeemed and empowered, but vincent has learned nothing and meets his fate as a man would who has lived his life 'unconsciously'. samuel jackson as jules stands out as the most intense actor and delivers his lines as a champion boxer going for the knockout punch. the others are really peripheral characters the ones who fill in the scene to make it more colorful. if this movie makes you more conscious of the unusual happenings in your life and then correctly derive their significance effectively for yourself, rather than dismiss the whole 'miracle of life' as mere chance coincidences, you will have got the message of this film, otherwise its good entertainment only.;23 August 2012;9;['explicit', 'subliminal', 'implicit', 'apparent', 'miraculous', 'distinct', 'divergent', 'inter', 'connected', 'first', 'traditional', 'mundane', 'strange', 'unusual', 'inter', 'connected', 'due', 'super', 'natural', 'connected', 'divine', 'other', 'modern', 'scientific', 'accidental', 'improbable', 'latter', 'enough', 'shakespearean', 'few', 'basic', 'enough', 'right', 'complex', 'sheer', 'key', 'first', 'second', 'unlikely', 'direct', 'right', 'intense', 'peripheral', 'colorful', 'conscious', 'unusual', 'whole', 'mere', 'good'];0.0632756132756132

760;tabbyharwood;this brilliant film directed by quentin tarantino gives us a unbalanced cast of intertwined criminals that all eventually cross paths. the mixture of some of my favorite actors include john travolta, samuel l jackson, bruce willis and uma thurman. you have honey bunny (amanda plummer) and ringo (tim roth) robbing a diner. vincent vega (john travolta) and jules winnfield (samuel l jackson) in a car discussing burgers, to walking in hallways talking about rubbing feet and having sex. then vincent and jules enter a room and kill men in regards for marsellus wallace (ving rhames). this is when jules starts resiting bible versus before he kills. butch coolidge (bruce willis) is seen sitting while you hear off screen speaking which you learn is marsellus wallace. vega is hired to take mia wallace (uma thurman) out while her husband is out of town. the go back to the house where mia snorts cocaine and passes out. she is later found just about dead by vega who takes her to a friend to help. chaos erupts as they try to help her from dying from an overdose. butch and maria spend a night together in a hotel making love and then he realizes his watch is missing and he has a fit. he leaves to go get his watch. he arrives at his apartment to the the watch and vega is waiting for him. butch kills vega. butch leaves his apartment and sees wallace at an intersection and he hits him but gets into a car accident. wallace chases butch and shoots at him and tries to kill him. the fit in a pawn shop. the owner saves wallace as butch is about to kill him. he knocks butch out and makes a call. wallace and butch are kidnapped. they are brought downstairs to some underground sex fetish spot. butch escapes but before he leaves he goes back down for wallace. butch walks in and wallace is getting raped. due to butch saving wallace they makes amends by butch being told he needs to leave town. the scene goes back to the hotel where vincent and jules commits their first kill and it shows them being shot at. they kill the man that comes out of the other room. they take marvin for a ride and kills him. the get rid of the body of marvin and end up at a restaurant. the turn of events of end back in the same place where the movie started. all the events leading back to the ending is the beginning of the film. scene switches back to the beginning of the restaurant robbery. ringo wants jules to open the case. he opens the case. jules turns it around and takes ringo hostage and then calms down the situation and lets him go. jules doesn't kill ringo but rather gives him money to leave the other wallets. he recites a bible verse but doesn't kill him, he breaks the cycle of murder. the ending shows them leaving the restaurant in their shorts, showing you that it is after they were hosed down of blood. bringing you to the conclusion that the beginning of the movie was the end of the movie.;5 December 2014;9;['brilliant', 'unbalanced', 'favorite', 'marsellus', 'dead', 'about', 'underground', 'first', 'other', 'same', 'other', 'bible'];0.1714285714285714
761;Patti-Gaston;quentin tarantino takes you on one wild ride in this movie with the out there dialogue, the violence, the music, the drugs, the dancing and the 50's themed diner! the overall message of this spectacle in my opinion is that eventually you have to come down,whether it is from the high of blowing people away, from snorting heroin and over dosing and getting a shot of adrenaline in your heart to going back into a dangerous situation to do the right thing even when you want to run away. this movie is fast paced, laugh at loud funny at times and sometimes blush worthy but most importantly it is unforgettable. this is a modern classic that should not be missed.;8 May 2015;8;['wild', 'out', 'themed', 'overall', 'dangerous', 'right', 'loud', 'funny', 'worthy', 'unforgettable', 'modern'];0.1632275132275132
762;codymontanye;quentin tarantino's pulp fiction is an obvious classic and tarantino's breakout hit. i felt like it was an odd movie with some scenes that were out of the ordinary and rather questionable. i believe that the way the movie was filmed you could tell that it was a quentin tarantino film. the shots used were not just straightforward angles, which made it very visually interesting throughout. i also loved the look of many of the sets that were used throughout the film with my favorite being to 50's diner that john travolta and uma thurman were in. overall, i found this movie to be very great and i would definitely recommend it to film lovers.;13 May 2015;8;['obvious', 'odd', 'ordinary', 'questionable', 'tarantino', 'straightforward', 'interesting', 'many', 'favorite', 'great'];0.1953703703703703

765;j-goslin;pulp fiction is one of those movies that has gone down in history for the way it looks on screen and the messages sent throughout the course of the film. the film wouldn't be so eerily brilliant if it weren't for the lighting effects. sometimes the faces of the character's are 1/2 lit or lit in a different way which really helps bring the concept of being in the shadows to the screen and it manages to make that more of a profound impact on the viewers because the person doesn't look normal or like they should. another technique that was used very well in this film was the actual film making itself. the subjects were filmed in such a way that they complement the lighting effects but still make them visible for the audience to understand what is going on in the story.;12 May 2016;8;['brilliant', 'different', 'more', 'profound', 'normal', 'actual', 'visible'];0.2722222222222222
766;maryolalov;pulp fiction is one of those movies that not everyone can enjoy. many people say that it's boring and senseless. it is true that the plot isn't something special but it isn't the plot that makes this movie so unique but the awesome script and great cinematography. probably one of the greatest things in this movie are the dialogues. the dialogues just like in all other tarantino movies aren't directly connected with the plot. take the first dialogue between samuel jackson and john travolta. they are talking about how a certain burger is called in france. this and many others dialogues don't have a direct relation with the plot line but their function is to somehow build the characters' personalities. the other thing that makes this movie so unique is the unexpected turn of events. like in all other tarantino movies you don't know who they are going to kill next or what is going to happen. the scene where vincent shoots marvin in the face is a great example for such unexpected turn of events. this makes the viewer more intrigued and thus makes the whole experience form the movie way better. there isn't much more that can be said about pulp fiction. it's not a movie that everyone will enjoy but still deserves to be seen.;25 January 2019;9;['many', 'boring', 'true', 'special', 'unique', 'awesome', 'great', 'great', 'other', 'tarantino', 'first', 'certain', 'many', 'direct', 'other', 'unique', 'unexpected', 'other', 'tarantino', 'vincent', 'great', 'such', 'unexpected', 'whole', 'more'];0.2702922077922077

""pulp fiction"" is great because it can be classified in so many categories. it is a comedy, drama, action, adventure... two characters that are worth mentioning are uma thurmon and samuel l. jackson. uma thurmon who plays mia wallace is excellent as a cocaine addicted druggie. she's in the picture for not even half the time, but ""vincent vega & marcellus wallace's wife"" is my favourite story of ""pulp fiction."" samuel l. jackson who plays jules is a focal point of the story. with his ezekial 25:17 deal and his ending performance, jackson deserved the academy award for best supporting actor. the soundtrack is great because it reminds you about the fun the winner of palme d'or of the cannes film festival really was.

779;Robert_90;"pulp fiction has essentially defined the indie movie. i first saw it on tv some time last year and have since put it on both my favourite movies list and least favourite movies list. odd, that. even though everybody seems to like the movie, to me there isn't that much to like about it. the dialogue is supposedly just ordinary chit-chat that people may have on a daily basis, but it's like that in that for the most part the dialogue is actually a sort of boring idle chat while you wait for the interesting bits. the parts of dialogue i think of in particular involve the whole chat between vincent and jules between the end of the opening credits and reaching the dudes' apartment (you know, about foot massages and the boss's wife etc). the same goes for much of the conversation during the vincent-mia ""date"", the conversation between butch and his girlfriend, etc. royale with cheese is interesting the first time but after about the 5th time i lost interest. also there's the characters - jules is supposedly one of the coolest characters in modern cinema but what's to like? he's just a black guy in a black suit who quotes the bible and uses ""the m/f-word"" a lot. even his redemption doesn't quite interest me so much. likewise, the vast majority of the characters are unlikeable on some level - vincent is a drug user who makes several bad mistakes over the course of the film (you know what i mean), mia is a lower-class coke addict with a sugar daddy and a failed tv pilot to her name and there's nothing likable at all about butch. the only character i really liked was the wolf, because he just had that smooth confidence and sharp mind that seems to come alive when harvey keitel plays a character. as for the story out of all three stories (the ""date"", the ""gold watch"" and the ""bonnie situation""), my favourite had to be ""the bonnie situation"" because it just worked. from the unexpected ""trigger"" of events, this is quite interesting because it focuses on jules for the most part as he undergoes his ""moment of clarity"", plus watching the two cleaning up is a laugh and a half. the other stories have their interesting moments (""bring out the gimp"") but are nowhere near as interesting because the idea is that the characters speak more often than any action happens. oh well, such is life. the action itself is actually cliches, but done in such a way that they seem original. the examples include the assassination sequence, the car crash, etc. the one piece of action that seemed incredibly original was the entire hillbilly sex dungeon scene probably one of the best scenes in the movie, if somewhat disturbing. in short, this is a good movie though. it's good for those of you who like ""talkies"" punctuated with action i.e. most people, but i seriously can't understand why this ends up on both my favourite movies list and least favourite movies list. maybe it's because this movie is, among other things, bi-polar. i give it 7/10";19 January 2005;9;['indie', 'last', 'favourite', 'least', 'favourite', 'odd', 'much', 'ordinary', 'daily', 'most', 'interesting', 'particular', 'whole', 'same', 'much', 'interesting', 'first', 'cool', 'modern', 'black', 'black', 'vast', 'unlikeable', 'several', 'bad', 'low', 'likable', 'only', 'smooth', 'sharp', 'alive', 'unexpected', 'interesting', 'most', 'other', 'interesting', 'interesting', 'such', 'original', 'original', 'entire', 'good', 'disturbing', 'short', 'good', 'good', 'most', 'favourite', 'least', 'favourite', 'other', 'bi', 'polar'];0.1357407407407407

798;timmyminh;"now i know when you read the title of my review you may think it's such an oxymoron but it's exactly what it says: pulp fiction is a awesome and brilliant and smart film but it's overrated. people like to toss the word ""overrated"" as if it's a synonym for ""bad"" but it just means something is being valued more than it should be. in other words, i don't think pulp fiction is 8.9 great but like an 8.1-8.3 kind of great. pulp fiction with its witty dialogues, non-linear structure of storytelling, entertaining moments and characters, subtle details in screenwriting are not enough to convince me that it is 8.9 good. and i've watched and studied this film as much angles and layers as a film student could and still fail to see why it is 8.9 and is on par with the godfather, the shawshank redemption, 12 angry men, schindler's list, and the dark knight - all of which are titanic achievements in cinema. but don't let those dilute you to think i think this film sucks, like i said it deserves probably 8.1 to 8.3 at the most. so i will lay out why i think pulp fiction is still great. the witty dialogues: quentin tarantino easily stands among legendary screenwriters such as aaron sorkin, eric roth, tom mccarthy, etc. in terms of dialogue writings. they are smart, entertaining, engaging. how tarantino wrote the diner scene where vincent vega and mia wallace was spending an entire minute of screen time ordering the food and still keep the audience intrigued: this is because he uses exotic terms for the food and uses the character's reaction to those exotic names. that's how to make it interesting. furthermore, it adds such smart details into the plot for example the fact that butch and marsellus spent minutes agreeing that butch should throw his fight only to be sabotaged in under 30 seconds after butch interacts with vincent vega. vince calling butch a ""palooka"" and ""punchy"" (both are affronts to a boxer, more than that, a person with a warrior complex like butch), then butch sees that vince and marsellus are good friends hugging each other. this crucial 30 seconds change the plot forever, causing butch to not throw the fight and the lives of him, marsellus, and vincent vega to be subsequently changed forever. this was such smart writing. of course, the entertainment in this film is such thrilling: the od of mia wallace and the anticipation on whether the situation can be salvaged; the rape scene and how our characters overcome that in a satisfying way; samuel jackson's character jules' wittily intimidating lowkey comedic dialogues.and the diner robbery then the showdown between pumpkin and jules is such breathtaking. then of course, the iconic pulp fiction dance, what can i say? pulp fiction's message hidden in hindsight is ultimately that of redemption or choosing the right path for life. for mia wallace, she chose the druggie life only to be end up on the verge of death, after the morbid experience we can see her soften somehow. maybe then she will turn to righteousness and redemption. next, butch's family background were all warriors which is why he chooses to be a boxer but then the warrior element doesn't come in until he made decision on whether to save marsellus wallace his enemy or not from the degenerate hillbillies. which is why he chose a samurai sword out of all things. finally, jules' arc is that he realizes he only survive an ordeal through ""divine intervention"" and deliberate that this is a sign and if he doesn't stop being a proxy in this business now then more a dire fate may ensue upon him. hence why he shows mercy to pumpkin a diner robber and he rethinks the interpretation of his bible verse. overall, we can see the source for a person's switch to righteousness doesn't just come from religion (which is what most people think because they only focus on jules' arc), but it comes from many things: a brush with mortality (mia wallace), family values (butch), salvation from a foe (marsellus wallace), and faith (jules). the only character who was not enlighten to this revelation was vincent vega because his lifestyle is too deeply embedded in this criminal and toxic underworld. furthermore, he's too absent-minded and too shallow to comprehend a deeper deliberation in life as jules. hence why he does not buy into jules' interpretation of divine intervention. the dialogue writting of tarantino is just like his plot writing: it starts with one point then spirals into a whole different place in a way that is entertaining. this is because real life dialogues and real life events are exactly the same. this is why tarantino's writing is so great. and overall, pulp fiction is great is awesome is smart and easily win a place in my top 30. but of course, as i said, i still don't get and probably never will understand why it is 8.9 and is top 6 of the best film ever made despite of how much i said i love it above and the many explanations and readings of this film that i have read.";13 December 2020;8;['awesome', 'brilliant', 'smart', 'bad', 'more', 'other', 'great', 'great', 'witty', 'non', 'linear', 'entertaining', 'subtle', 'enough', 'good', 'much', 'angry', 'dark', 'titanic', 'most', 'great', 'legendary', 'such', 'smart', 'entertaining', 'din', 'entire', 'exotic', 'exotic', 'interesting', 'such', 'smart', 'punchy', 'more', 'good', 'other', 'crucial', 'such', 'smart', 'such', 'satisfying', 'comedic', 'din', 'such', 'iconic', 'right', 'druggie', 'divine', 'dire', 'din', 'bible', 'most', 'many', 'only', 'criminal', 'toxic', 'absent', 'minded', 'shallow', 'deep', 'divine', 'whole', 'different', 'entertaining', 'real', 'real', 'same', 'great', 'great', 'awesome', 'smart', 'top', 'good', 'much', 'many'];0.3070995670995671

832;gonzallanca;"pulp fiction or in spanish as ""violent times"" the film has stories, which are crossed between them. in the first we have 2 types (samuel l. jackson and john travolta) working to marcellus wallace, and must retrieve a golden suitcase. the second is a boxer (bruce willis) who after winning a fight, that marcellus wallace said that lose, escapes with the money. and the third tells a story of the wife of marcellus walace (uma thurman) and of his addiction to drugs. let's start with the actors. the truth is that we all were excellent. john travolta, uma thurman, bruce willis, ving rhames. but, for me, the one that stood out from the other was samuel l. jackson, who with his first scene of ""i dare you"" left me crazy. now we are talking about really baby. the script and how they are connected the stories, is the most amazing thing i've seen in the cinema. because you can easily you do a movie with the story of bruce willis, or with john travolta and samuel l. jackson. but all this is what we owe to a mr quentin tarantino, and his partner roger avary. as i am of the new school of trantino (bastards without glory, django, the hateful 8) and i'm used to die all (or almost all) and in this film does not pass. and it is for this reason that this film left me with a kind of hollow, wanting more, of failure, of the movie. also i think that the actors not involved in both the film, with all the money you gave them. the film focuses more on vincent and jules, who were those who participated more in the movie. good 8/10";10 June 2017;9;['spanish', 'violent', 'first', 'marcellus', 'golden', 'second', 'marcellus', 'marcellus', 'excellent', 'other', 'first', 'crazy', 'amazing', 'new', 'trantino', 'hateful', 'hollow', 'more', 'good'];0.1508116883116883
833;Angel-Shadow;pulp fiction, pulp fiction, pulp fiction it never gets tiring, what a film, nothing short of class. since i first joined imdb i've noticed that 1994 wasn't a bad year for films with forest gump along with my favourite film of all time the shawshank redemption. as well as these two gems came tarantino's pulp fiction. pulp fiction is one of those films which truly lives up to its reputation. the film is so intricately detailed it blows your mind and gives you the 100% factor that all films crave, which is entertainment. the characters of vincent and jules are so well portrayed and presented by jackson and travolta the characters really begin to grow on you. normally there is a lead protagonist in many films, however pulp fiction follows the stories of just 3 with the same characters in different scenes and times. pulp fiction's actual story is at first very confusing yet i feel this adds to the overwhelming sense that this is ' pulp fiction', it needs no explaining. when i first saw this film i got nothing less in quality than i expected , but a completely different film experience. the dialogue in this film along with the accents is unsurpassed with such classic lines as (potential spoilers) ' i don't dig on swine sa'll' and ' you hear that billy boy??'' and of course the classic 'royal with cheese'. pulp fiction is occampanied with truly fantastic fast flowing music to go hand in hand with the films unique often in my case unexplainable genre.so from this the one thing that can be deduced from pulp fiction is that it is truly unique with innovative ideas and audience pleasing scenes. bruce willis takes on a surprising role in the form of butch the boxer trying to scam his way past big time heavy marcellis wallace. i don't wish to give to much away in this review as i think its harsh on many people, however i can say uma thurman looks by far at her most visually stunning in her first film - big break. she portrays the character of mia beautifully with believable, often at times sexy methods at steering away from her true personality. it would be fair to say quentin tarantino has created a true gem for the film world with a truly fantastic script, fantastic dialogue and ultimately great acting. pulp fiction really is a royal with cheese 10/10;16 February 2006;10;['tiring', 'short', 'bad', 'favourite', 'detailed', 'portrayed', 'lead', 'many', 'same', 'different', 'actual', 'first', 'confusing', 'overwhelming', 'less', 'different', 'unsurpassed', 'such', 'classic', 'potential', 'classic', 'royal', 'fantastic', 'fast', 'unexplainable', 'unique', 'innovative', 'pleasing', 'surprising', 'big', 'heavy', 'harsh', 'many', 'stunning', 'first', 'big', 'believable', 'sexy', 'true', 'fair', 'true', 'fantastic', 'fantastic', 'great'];0.2178240740740741

838;halnexus;"this is filmmaking at its apex. though i would hardly argue that this film is the greatest, which is what many imdb users relate after they've just seen a movie they really like and then forget about once the next ""titanic"" or ""matrix"" hype machine bursts their way, i must say that ""pulp fiction"" added more to the cinematic lexicon more than any other film of the 90s. and who can argue with that? indeed it is one of my favorites just for its adamant refusal to do things by-the-book, and many previous comments essay this film as a highly moral and spiritual piece--they couldn't be more right. when the film came out, a lot of the reviewers commented on its cinematic brand of hipness...being hip is cool, but i wouldn't necessarily equate that with great movies--just look at ""men in black"", which was sorta fun but hardly the endurable piece of cinema that ""pulp fiction"" has become. so what sets it apart from the rest of the crowd? it's exactly this spirituality...watching the film, i remember being shocked and enlightened at the same time, being unbearably tensed up and utterly charmed and in agreement with this weird california former video clerk's world view. the film is a tour-de-force of the cinematic style; one of my favorite shots in the film seems to be a homage to both the fast-paced unbreaking style of scorsese's ""goodfellas"" and roman polanski's ""rosemary's baby"". it is the scene where travolta crashes his malibu into eric stoltz's front yard and brings the od'ed thurman inside his house. as rosanna arquette hurls invectives at the two, the camera (wonderful work by andrez sekula moves back and forth between arquette and travolta and stoltz lurching over thurman (that's the scorsese part). then, as stoltz goes looking for the plunger, the camera follows him into a room, where it inexplicably stops at the doorway so as to impede a full sight of stoltz, reminders of the scene where polanski photographed ruth gordon in ""rosemary's baby"" by placing an obstruction between her and the camera so the audience would instinctively lurch their head to the side, making a hopeless attempt to see around the obstruction. such a phrase can be used to describe ""pulp fiction"": most movies simply unfurl their stories at the audience. this movie subliminally makes you a part of the action. i recently had a semi-argument with a friend over the worth of this film over ""natural born killers"". now don't get me wrong, oliver stone is a powerful filmmaker, but his film banged you over the head incessantly with points like ""i'm going to use my artistic license to satirize the over-the-top violence of popular culture by making a movie replete with...over-the-top violence!"" in the style of david spade, ""it's called hypocrisy, oliver--check into it!"" anyways, i digress. anybody who bad-mouths this movie indeed has no appreciation for cinema; sure, the film may have a goof or an errant philosophy somewhere , but tarantino fulfilled any filmmaker's dream in revitalizing cinema. you can say that the film's tone didn't impress you, that its style wasn't to your taste...but you can't deny the artistry that went into it. morality? for all of those who believe this film is an amoral travesty, i suggest you rent the family favorite ""the santa clause"" and count how many times disney shamelessly milks its own products, or if god is mentioned even once in what is supposed to be a christmas film. or in any family film. what impressed me the most when i first saw ""pulp fiction"" was its inclusion of god at all, many generation-x filmmakers (paging kevin smith?) are so agnostic in their beliefs that it was so refreshing to see one that painted divinity in such a positive light. you can have those other indie favorites ""chasing amy"" and ""good will hunting""(both starring those irritating crybabies matt damon and ben affleck), and if you like those cynical films which are basically reworkings of ""oh-feel-sorry-for-me"" melodramas of the late-40s reworked with equally irritating alternative rock (best summed up by the smashing pumpkins in a ""simpsons"" episode: ""all's we got is our millions of dollars, our legions of fans, and our youth.""), then you can have them. compare that to jules' awakening (""i was just sitting here eating my muffin and drinking my coffee when i had what alcoholics refer to as 'a moment of clarity'."") and you'll see how tarantino turned the mythic gen-x stereotype on its head as well.

839;urbanlegend23;"quentin tarantino had an immediate fan base following his career after the release of the excellent ""reservoir dogs"" in 1992, which only grew significantly upon the release of the much-revered ""pulp fiction"" two years later. commonly referred to by many as one of the best films of the '90s, the film was simply a revolution, its impact undeniable. many - perhaps the majority excepting those who prefer ""jackie brown"" - consider ""fiction"" tarantino's finest work. countless film fans worship at its alter. am i one of them? not really. i think the film is fantastic for reasons i'll soon explain, but i don't passionately subscribe to it as tarantino's best either. in fact, ""django unchained"" is easily better, and this film has serious claims to that title from ""inglourious basterds"" or ""kill bill: vol. 2"" (yes, i think it's better than number one, okay...easily better, in fact). but why is this film so particularly popular? it's remarkably clever, pop-culture-hip, reference-heavy dialogue is one such reason. there's no wonder it won tarantino and roger avary an oscar for best original screenplay. the technique on display only matches the words - tarantino's patient, passionate direction and andrzej sekua's stylish yet unobtrusive are a match made in heaven. the film is consistently tense, electrifying and unpredictable, and that is aided by its (at the time at least) unique non-linear narrative. it never complies with hollywood movie cliches, and even in 2016 this approach is refreshing. fans and viewers which of ""fiction""'s distinctive four chapters is its best. some, like me, will place the first chapter (somewhat smug and self-satisfied, like uma thurman's performance on re-watches) and the last (overly convenient - how come nobody walks into a previously packed diner and interrupts the goings-on?) the worst of the best. they'll prefer the brutally tense mid-section involving the sexy anti-hero butch coolidge (perhaps a career-best bruce willis) and the darkly hilarious, clever harvey keitel-assisted murder clean-up. they are certainly the film's highlights for me. but the film encourages subjectivity (the suitcase, hello?) and perhaps these different interpretations are part of the fun of this wickedly clever, irrefutably influential modern classic.";25 June 2016;9;['immediate', 'excellent', 'reservoir', 'many', 'good', 'undeniable', 'many', 'fine', 'countless', 'fantastic', 'good', 'well', 'serious', 'inglourious', 'well', 'okay', 'popular', 'clever', 'pop', 'heavy', 'such', 'tarantino', 'good', 'original', 'passionate', 'stylish', 'unobtrusive', 'tense', 'electrifying', 'unpredictable', 'least', 'unique', 'non', 'linear', 'refreshing', 'distinctive', 'good', 'first', 'smug', 'satisfied', 'last', 'convenient', 'bad', 'good', 'tense', 'sexy', 'anti', 'hero', 'good', 'hilarious', 'clever', 'different', 'wickedly', 'clever', 'influential', 'modern'];0.2675675675675675

850;m-visker;with no doubt pulp fiction is a modern day classic, and there is good reason why there is so much hype around the movie. the story can be a little confusing at times to follow due to the fact that there is two stories happening at once, but when you get the flow of the movie down it is a very enjoyable to watch. the acting is phenomenal and the writing is amazing, it is no surprise that the movie won an oscar for it's original screenplay. the dialogue is smart and witty through-out the movie, it also uses silences to make scenes more powerful and intense. the conversations feel real as if these people, even though ridiculous, could exist. the editing in this movie is also very strong, one scene in which i find it to be great is the overdose and adrenaline shot scene. vincent is speeding down the highway with mia who is having an overdose, he is frantically calling the drug dealer, the camera then switches to the drug dealer, the shot is slow and doesn't cut to anything, giving the effect that he is in no rush to pick up his phone, and is very unaware for what is about to happen. once vincent gets to the house we hear the car screech down the road, the camera follows the drug dealer out and the camera isn't quick or steady but instead shaky as if we are running behind following him outside. this adds to the chaos of the scene. once they have mia laying down the camera switches between the characters faces, really letting us the panic the two guys are having and the two girls don't seem nearly as worked up. right before the shot is given we are given zoomed shots of vincent's face and the drug dealers face again, there is almost no sound, all of this just intensifies the scene and builds up suspense. this scene is serious and yet entertaining because of the banter between the two men. pulp fiction is a great movie in many ways and isn't for the faint of hearts, tarantino is very innovative and uses editing, cinematography and sound to really capture the mise-en-scene of this film.;9 May 2014;9;['modern', 'good', 'much', 'little', 'confusing', 'enjoyable', 'phenomenal', 'amazing', 'original', 'smart', 'witty', 'powerful', 'intense', 'real', 'ridiculous', 'strong', 'great', 'slow', 'unaware', 'about', 'quick', 'steady', 'shaky', 'serious', 'entertaining', 'great', 'many', 'tarantino', 'innovative'];0.2467380952380952

""pulp fiction"" also has a few truly original moments. christopher walken's wonderfully dry delivery of the ""your father kept this watch in his ass for years"" story is hilarious. there is only one serious flaw in this film: quentin tarantino is a very poor actor. thank god he confined himself to a small role. if he really feels the need to be onscreen, he should just go ahead and pull a hitchcockian cameo in his films. sure it's derivative, but at least his screen presence will be minimized.";19 February 1999;10;['excellent', 'original', 'many', 'other', 'la', 'femme', 'obvious', 'much', 'own', 'reservoir', 'original', 'many', 'great', 'more', 'many', 'other', 'successful', 'great', 'fresh', 'interesting', 'few', 'original', 'dry', 'hilarious', 'serious', 'poor', 'small', 'onscreen', 'hitchcockian', 'sure', 'derivative', 'least'];0.283

862;scotty12;this film worries me. is it great as so many say? it's riveting viewing that's for sure. movies need to satisfy 5 criteria to be truly great (in my humble opinion): totally committed believable acting, technical excellence, memorable scenes that recur in your mind, something fresh to say or way to say it, and a message at its heart that can change people's lives (hopefully for the better). this film has the first four in abundance, but fails completely on the fifth. the film is a dazzling kaleidoscope of images, sounds and emotions.it is one of the most vital films of the 90s without a doubt. though there is quite a lot of violence, it's less painful to watch than in other movies (e.g. goodfellas). rather there's a constant sense of menace, because you know mr quentin always has some ultra-violence and jolts to the viewer, and also the non-linear structure means it's more difficult to figure out who's going to get hit. you get this sense of foreboding right from the off, when the couple are discussing robbing the diner, and the gun goes down on the table with a much louder noise than it should to match the volume of the dialogue. best part of the film for me was the dancing sequence - couldn't help thinking so that's how the excellent dancer of saturday night fever ended up! i have to say that they didn't get proper medical advice for this movie - giving an injection into the heart as for the overdose can't be done through the sternum (breastbone), but it has to go underneath, angled upwards. i'm pretty sure that giving a slug of adrenaline to someone who's overdosed on cocaine would kill the person instantly rather than wake them up. and who decided to call the drug adrenaline (its british name) when it's called epinephrine in the us? i'm left with the impression that this was just another scene that the film makers wanted to include to shock people, rather than trying to make it true to life. most worrying aspect is the very graphic depiction of heroin injection. it's made to seem glamorous and seductive. anybody trying to get off heroin who watches this movie will have a hard time resisting the impulse to follow the example shown on screen. i think this particular scene should not have been included in the movie. again there's a medical inaccuracy - the blood shown being drawn back into the syringe before injecting is too bright red, that's arterial blood rather than blood from a vein. maybe they thought bright red makes it look more vivid (and shocking)? overall i think this film is worth watching if you know what to expect and like that kind of thing. however it has an empty heart which makes it fall way short of greatness. my opinion is that tarantino is very talented in film making, but this takes a back seat compared to his desire to shock people at any cost.;7 February 2001;2;['great', 'many', 'sure', 'great', 'humble', 'technical', 'memorable', 'fresh', 'well', 'first', 'fifth', 'dazzling', 'vital', 'painful', 'other', 'constant', 'ultra', 'non', 'linear', 'difficult', 'loud', 'good', 'excellent', 'proper', 'medical', 'sure', 'british', 'true', 'worrying', 'graphic', 'glamorous', 'seductive', 'hard', 'particular', 'medical', 'bright', 'red', 'arterial', 'bright', 'vivid', 'shocking', 'worth', 'empty', 'talented', 'back'];0.1923611111111111

902;pachys;"where can i start? this movie is simply amazing and will forever be one of the greatest movies of all time. let's start with the genius of the great quentin tarantino, who in his second movie (pulp fiction), solidified himself as one of the greatest directors, winning an oscar for best screenplay for pulp fiction, and the movie winning the most prestigious award in film, the palme d'or at the 1994 cannes film festival in france. one of the reasons for why this movie is so good is because of quentin's use of nonlinear storylines in this film. it's so unique how quentin put events in different order and it was so fun to watch, he did it in a way that you wouldn't be confused as well, you would be surprised and then you would find out the true order of the film when you continue to watch it. the cast and the acting, oh my goodness it's amazing. this is another reason for why the movie is so good. quentin tarantino revitalized john trovolta's career by placing him in the role of vincent vega, one of the mobsters in the film, and he does not let us down. he plays the role so perfect that it became the best acting performace of his life. we all know samuel l. jackson now, super famous and great actor, but before pulp fiction no one knew him. quentin tarantino not only revitalized john travolta's career with pulp fiction but he gave samuel l.jackson a chance and introduced us to an amazing actor and it was legendary. jules winnfield, the other mobster in the movie, who samuel l. jackson plays, is nothing short of a spectacular character who is funny and a bad-ass at the same time and sam plays him perfectly. the cast only gets better with quentin bringing tim roth back, who was a major character in quentin's first film resovoir dogs and giving bruce willis, who was achieving a ton of success from the hit ""die hard"", a major role. bruce willis plays the boxer butch who is facing decline in the ring because of age. like samuel and john, bruce plays butch so good that i can't picture another actor playing him. bruce is strong and bald as well and was more than capable of having that type of boxer swagger and meaness to him while acting and that is what made him the best choice to play the boxer butch. like samuel l. jackson, quentin made another person famous, this time an actress, the great uma thurman, who plays the bride in quentin's movie series called ""kill bill"". in pulp fiction uma plays the sexy mia wallace, who is the wife of marsellus wallace, the mob leader. uma plays her really well and put her name with some of the best in the movie industry. in the end, this film's story, screenplay, directing and cast are so amazing that it made it into a classic. it's hands down one of the best crime movies of all time, as well, with it's violence, humor as well and tarantino's key to directing... the art of the unexpected. watch this movie, it doesn't know how to dissapoint.";20 January 2018;10;['amazing', 'great', 'great', 'second', 'great', 'good', 'prestigious', 'good', 'nonlinear', 'unique', 'different', 'fun', 'surprised', 'true', 'amazing', 'good', 'perfect', 'good', 'famous', 'great', 'amazing', 'legendary', 'other', 'short', 'spectacular', 'funny', 'bad', 'same', 'well', 'major', 'first', 'major', 'good', 'strong', 'bald', 'more', 'capable', 'good', 'famous', 'great', 'sexy', 'good', 'amazing', 'good', 'unexpected'];0.4453252032520325

926;gsprods;i didn't think tarantino could possibly top reservoir dogs, but here he is only two years later, outdoing himself with pulp fiction, a bigger budget than reservoir but still small by hollywood standards. the film is a masterpiece, winning tarantino the oscar for original screenplay and getting well deserved nominations for best picture, director, actor (travolta), supp. actor (jackson) and supp. actress (thurman). my one complaint is that many people who rent the video are missing out on some of the joys of the film because most of the videos are cropped so that you can't see the whole screen the way you did in the theatre. for example, when drug dealer eric stoltz is in bed watching tv before travolta calls him letting him know he and uma are on their way over, you see a box of funny looking breakfast cereal (some outdated brand) that stoltz is eating. in the video you can't see it, and you miss out on one of the funny sight gags tarantino has in store for you. it's little details like these that help make pulp fiction a treasure to view long after the initial impact of the stories wears off. the film's style has been ripped off but only the coen bros. fargo has come close to bringing us the same off beat pleasures. as the years go on, movie fans will be more and more surprised to learn pulp fiction did not win for best picture.;5 January 2000;10;['reservoir', 'big', 'reservoir', 'small', 'tarantino', 'original', 'deserved', 'good', 'many', 'most', 'whole', 'funny', 'outdated', 'funny', 'little', 'initial', 'same', 'off', 'surprised', 'good'];0.1825
927;Auselan;"some people think that pulp fiction is unique because of its formlessness. however, not only does the film have form, stereotypical characters and a traditional moral framework, but it is a self-proclaimed derivative tribute to other classic films. pulp fiction is unique, paradoxically, because of its laborious adherence to cinematic tradition. except for the ending, the form is mostly linear: the coffee-shop incident is succeeded by travolta's story (with uma thurman) which is followed by bruce willis' story. the opening scene in the coffee-shop jumps back in time slightly (like a nudged record needle ) and what follows is the samuel l. jackson (with travolta) interrogation scene; a dislocation which is reversed, or put right, at the end where the interrogation scene is followed by the coffee-shop scene (temporally correct). the final section of the film covers the time-period just before the start of the film and ends just after the start of the film. it charts the bloody conclusion to the interrogation scene; samuel l. jackson and john travolta's baptismal hose-down (the head of the hose, looking like a gun, punishes them with a cold jet and cleanses them of their sin, like a re-birth; instead of being shot with bullets, they are chastised with water and re-clothed in ordinary civilian, rather than gangster, clothes) and ends with jackson's conversion. in the coffee-shop samuel l. jackson the character with the most authority, partly due to his powerful old testament prose has a religious revelation and gives up his gangster life. it is the extremity with which this cliche (gangster has revelation and gives up bad life) is executed that makes it unique; it is the excessive conservatism of jackson's divine enlightenment with the miraculous escape from the bullets, the harsh baptism, and the gradual understanding of the bible quote he has repeated all his life that is so shocking and surreal. it is his complete lack of distinctiveness (his wallet doesn't have his name written on it, but 'bad mother f***er' it may as well read 'bad guy') that makes him so memorable and iconic. a work of fiction that focuses on character-in-action is moralistic by default; morality being the manifestation of psychology when it interacts with the world. the film tells three short-stories which focus on a certain character and end with that character reaching the moral high point of his life (like the thousands and thousands of other stories, both timeless and corny). the first one involves travolta and thurman, the gangster boss's wife and ends with him saving her life, delivering her home safely before walking away (rather than sleeping with her). the second is an escape story involving bruce willis which ends with him saving the gangster boss who was originally trying to kill him for an earlier misdemeanour. the third and final story is the story of samuel l. jackson, ending with his conversion. it's a shockingly good film, with an absolutely inspired absurdity to it. <ul><li>'pigs are filthy animals i don't eat filthy animals.' - 'yeah, but bacon tastes good; pork chops taste good.' - 'pigs sleep and root and shit that's a filthy animal. i ain't eating anything that ain't got sense enough to disregard its own faeces.' - 'how about a dog a dog eats its own faeces.' - 'i don't eat dogs either.' - 'but do you consider a dog to be a filthy animal?' - 'i wouldn't go so far as to call a dog filthy, but they're definitely dirty. but a dog's got personality personality goes a long way.' - 'so by that rationale, if a pig had a better personality, he would cease to be a filthy animal.' - 'we'd have to be talking about one charming mother f***in' pig.'</li></ul> it is it's surrealism with time becoming disjointed that makes it so close to every day life (which is confounded by memories - the past living in the present). it is a film that is so surreal that it seems real and so hackneyed that it is totally unique; it is a paradoxical clarification of our confusing world.";16 September 2001;9;['unique', 'stereotypical', 'traditional', 'moral', 'derivative', 'other', 'classic', 'unique', 'laborious', 'cinematic', 'linear', 'correct', 'final', 'bloody', 'baptismal', 'cold', 'ordinary', 'most', 'due', 'powerful', 'old', 'religious', 'bad', 'unique', 'excessive', 'divine', 'miraculous', 'harsh', 'gradual', 'shocking', 'surreal', 'complete', 'bad', 'bad', 'memorable', 'iconic', 'moralistic', 'short', 'certain', 'moral', 'high', 'other', 'first', 'second', 'early', 'third', 'final', 'good', 'inspired', 'filthy', 'filthy', 'good', 'good', 'filthy', 'own', 'own', 'filthy', 'filthy', 'dirty', 'long', 'well', 'filthy', 'charming', 'surreal', 'real', 'hackneyed', 'unique', 'paradoxical', 'confusing'];-0.0488222789115646

935;TheUnholyPeanut;"quentin tarantino is one of the greatest directors of the last 25 years. with an impeccable filmography with masterpieces like reservoir dogs, django unchained, inglorious basterds, and kill bill, he has had a very illustrious career. but it was not until pulp fiction, his magnum opus, that we get to see his true skill. first, we will start out with the script. pulp fiction is widely considered to have one of the greatest and most unique scripts of all time. one of the reasons for this is because of the non-linear narrative, which rarely a director tries (however, memento and reservoir dogs, his first film, both succeeded in this technique as well.) mostly, only literature does this, such as catch-22, so it was very unique for a film to do this so impeccably. the reason this film has a non linear narrative is so the audience can slowly pick up the pieces and find all the deeper nuances of the characters and multiple plots, yes, the script also has very compelling interweaving plots as well, although it mostly focuses on two hitmen, vincent and jules. another reason the script is so great is because of the dialogue, which feels extremely natural and realistic, and not forced, making you feel like these events actually happened. the script also has various interpretations, which i will not get into, and complex symbolism like the golden briefcase, which can be interpreted in so many different ways. the impeccable script is also further improved upon by the spectacular performances in this film. samuel l. jackson gives his best performance as jules, in which he shows his true skill. he seems extremely realistic in this movie, and some of his line deliveries for the dialogue are superb, especially the bible quote, which is a superb scene. his screen presence and charisma in this film is also great as he really makes the entire film so great, and makes jules such an amazing character. john travolta, whose career was dying out before this film, also gives a great performance as vincent. he also seems extremely realistic and has really great line deliveries, such as his blase delivery of the ""i shot marvin"" scene to him talking to himself in the mirror. he is great in every scene he is in. everybody else such as uma thurman, christopher walken, harvey kristen, bruce willis, tim roth, and ving rhames also gave a phenomenal. every actor in this film arguably gave off their greatest performance ever. this film also shows quentin's skill as a director, even when he was young. quentin masterfully directs a lot of scenes like the dance scene for example which is one of my favorite scenes in the entire film. there are also some incredibly beautiful and interesting shots, such as the shot of the opening of the golden briefcase, or the dance scene (which is such a greatly directed scene improved upon by the script.) tarantino also uses his aesthetic of violence, seen in his first film, in his directing in the movie a lot. he does this because it's not just for violence, because violence is the voice and force upon the narrative, he uses it to bring out very different emotions. this film mostly fortified quentin's skill as a director, and it really does show in this movie. the soundtrack is also great and really fits the tone and feel of the film. overall, pulp fiction does indeed deserve all the praise it gets, because of its almost flawless script, with a non linear narrative and various interpretations, superb performances and great characters, and great direction and cinematography. the film really does deserve all of its praise. 9/10.";2 February 2022;9;['great', 'last', 'impeccable', 'reservoir', 'inglorious', 'illustrious', 'magnum', 'true', 'great', 'unique', 'non', 'linear', 'reservoir', 'first', 'such', 'unique', 'non', 'linear', 'deep', 'multiple', 'compelling', 'great', 'natural', 'realistic', 'various', 'complex', 'golden', 'many', 'different', 'impeccable', 'spectacular', 'good', 'true', 'realistic', 'superb', 'bible', 'superb', 'great', 'entire', 'great', 'amazing', 'great', 'realistic', 'great', 'such', 'blase', 'great', 'such', 'phenomenal', 'great', 'young', 'favorite', 'entire', 'beautiful', 'interesting', 'such', 'golden', 'first', 'different', 'great', 'non', 'linear', 'various', 'great', 'great'];0.4057692307692309

941;Timeee;"my theory is that every piece of art, thus every movie, has to be evaluated, judged from the inside, by its own rules. this might be understood in many different ways; basically i mean that one should not start watching anything with an already prepared frame which he will then try to force on the movie. it's not possible to simply start from zero- we're human after all, and are influenced by our life up until the moment of watching a new movie- what we can do is throw aside stereotypical expectations and struggle to look at the movie from a multitude of points of view, in an open-minded way. ""pulp fiction"" is for me the perfect example of a movie where cliches just don't work. the ""i hated it"" part of comments here is filled with complains about the poor plot, the lack of character development or the pointless dialogs. but even if their observations are all true, they're missing the point: none of those expectations are valid o pulp fiction, therefore the movie should not be judged based upon them. wouldn't it be silly to complain about james bond for not being realistic? or to underrate harry potter for being childish? a movie can be regarded from many alternative angles- not all of them are sensible. watching -and of course re-re watching, frame by frame- this movie was simply a pleasure, a major source of cinematic satisfaction. i didn't care about the storyline or the morale, if it was any; instead i couldn't stop enjoying samuel l. jackson reciting his classic bible-quote, or mr. wolf doing his job, or marcellus wallace talking to butch, the music, the moves, the full-of-flavor acting and lines, making every moment so enjoyable that it made me watch it over and over again. this movie is not about what it's about, it's about how it's made. dialogs seem stupid on paper- brilliant on tape (of course that doesn't mean that dialogs are stupid, but in this film they do not have the purpose to take the action forward- they are not a means to communicate, but have an inward value of themselves ). i have not enough words of praise for the acting; god bless sam, john and bruce for what they did. never again will another movie like this be made- masterpiece, reason to live, whatever you want it to be.";1 December 2007;10;['own', 'many', 'different', 'possible', 'human', 'new', 'stereotypical', 'open', 'minded', 'perfect', 'poor', 'pointless', 'true', 'valid', 'silly', 'realistic', 'harry', 'childish', 'many', 'alternative', 'sensible', 're', 'major', 'cinematic', 'classic', 'marcellus', 'full', 'enjoyable', 'stupid', 'stupid', 'inward', 'enough'];0.036758207070707
942;mligorio;when i realized that more than 1500 reviews had been written, i thought that my own input would make little impact. tarantino might prefer to say that it would be like 'pissing in the ocean'. but, after reading a dozen or so reviews, it became clear that many critics, even those who liked the film, don't actually understand the message of the movie. it's true that the story was well scripted, the dialog was witty and amusing, and the acting was good, but the essential theme of the film needs to be brought to light. essentially, people are not all the same. we differ in terms of race, nationality, social status, education, and religious beliefs. these fundamental differences at times cause conflicts of interest, even wars. nevertheless, having common ideals and sharing personal struggles serves to unite us. tarantino tries to teach us this moral through the lives and personal experiences of his characters. in fact, each character in the story is a study of just that, character. comparing vincent and jules, for example, we get the impression that jules is the more educated of the two, nevertheless, vincent seems knowledgeable and, moreover, he is perceptive logical thinker who can hold his own in a conversation. you may have been impressed by the simple fact that a white man and black man could be such good friends that they readily forgive one another for costly mistakes and other offenses. in fact, the two men treated each other in a manner that was almost entirely colorblind. the 'n' word didn't necessarily apply only to black people. it could apply to friend or foe and, depending on context, it could be either and insult or a compliment. but, perhaps even more impressive was the nonchalant attitude both these two men took toward their day to day job as hit men. not only could they talk about breakfast, they could actually eat it after committing a bloody murder. it is quite remarkable how many characters in story were too interested in themselves to pause for a even moment to reflect on the many lives they destroyed. however, at least at some point, just about every important character in the story reveals to us that they indeed have a conscious. to our amusement, vincent talks to himself in the bathroom as he tries to encourage himself to be on his best behavior with the boss's wife. jules' actions are even more dramatic, when he risks his own life to save the man who tried to rob him. we are all searching for fulfillment in our lives. and, at times, it seems that we are desperately trying to maintain order in a world that is obviously corrupt and depraved. this common experience allows us to understand the many problems that others face, and it enables us to help one another to endure life's many hardships. this empathy is so powerful that on momentous occasions even bitter enemies can make peace. it may well be that this sense of compassion which transcends all law is what truly defines us as civilized human beings, allowing us to find meaning or purpose in our lives beyond the mundane existence of 'kill or be killed' in the so called neon jungle.;3 February 2011;9;['more', 'own', 'little', 'tarantino', 'clear', 'many', 'true', 'witty', 'amusing', 'good', 'essential', 'same', 'social', 'religious', 'fundamental', 'common', 'personal', 'tarantino', 'moral', 'personal', 'knowledgeable', 'perceptive', 'logical', 'own', 'simple', 'white', 'black', 'such', 'good', 'costly', 'other', 'other', 'colorblind', 'black', 'impressive', 'nonchalant', 'bloody', 'remarkable', 'many', 'interested', 'even', 'many', 'least', 'important', 'conscious', 'good', 'dramatic', 'own', 'corrupt', 'depraved', 'common', 'many', 'many', 'powerful', 'momentous', 'bitter', 'civilized', 'human', 'mundane'];0.1721354166666666

958;Mighty_sheman;"simply put pulp fiction is the silliest film i have every seen, it puts battlefield earth and the long kiss goodnight (spookily starring the two leads from this film) firmly in the shadows, they look like rare vintage wines next to this cheap plonk. the fact it is so highly revered by so many, and even considered profound, makes me fear for the very existence of modern society. there are some fundamental reasons i dislike this film with a passion, the first being the pacing and substance, the film really mirrors it's director to perfection, yapping and a mumblin and a stumblin from start to finish, enthusiastically about....nothing! if qentin was not such an untalented, cretinous buffoon i would call him the new david lynch. the only substance in pf is of the white powdery verity, the film is just a collection of sick images splashed on screen willy nilly strung loosely together by some sharp but pointless dialogue. the film was too crude, made purely for shock value. when violence, male rape, drug abuse, accidental shootings and other such fun filled things are packaged as cool and even as comedy in the hands of an immature director you get a highly irresponsible film, and to sell it as some sort of 'smart art' piece is doubly irresponsible. then there is the complete lack of character development and depth. there are no characters, only 2 dimensional machines created solely to perform acts of severe violence and drop in a few wise cracks, they perform actions in one scene that seem to have no effect or relation to what happens in their next scene. not one of them is even slightly likable or in possession of any redeemable characteristics apart from perhaps butch (willis), did i mention he is a violent thug, murderer and a thief? then there is mia who seems to have little purpose in the film other than an excuse to include the very uncomfortable scene where an over weight travolta boogies on the dance floor. yes she is in the 'famous' needle scene as well, but what else? the section featuring vince and mia was just dropped and barely mentioned again like mia herself, so what was the point? a question i asked of the film throughout. i quickly realised that nobody in the film was there to be developed, any one of them could have been dropped (apart from butch) or their actions performed by a completely new character without making a spot of difference to the film, their actions were not to be the subject of scrutiny. that would be asking too much of the tarantino who is clearly only interested in attempting to make stuff look cool. he is the most unoriginal man on the planet only capable of tacky 'homage' (ie, he is a thief) action films. don't believe me? watch kill bill where he even pays homage to his own film, this one! i do give credit to him in one respect. he realised that if he re-jigged the order of plot events he could not only look artistically swish but he could disguise the fact that the story is not worth the toilet paper it was written on, impressing upon many the fallacy that the hack job narrative structure enhanced the story. the direction is experimental but quite frankly tacky and laughable at times. one scene featuring a near comatose butch in particular comes to mind, the camera is stuck dead still on him while marsellus (rhames) uses the m-f word 100 times in about 5 minutes, totally amateurish. the only memorable performance is from jackson, who could make the ingredients list of a packet of cookies sound fun, he is offset by a flat performance from travolta. that brings me to the 'witty' dialogue which, apart from the violence, is the crux of the piece. it is unfortunate then, that this dialogue basically consists of idiots talking a load of nonsense about such deep things as cheeseburgers, milkshake, foot massages, cleaning up skull and brain chunks and some coffee that is described as gourmet s**t. some dialogue was witty but mostly it was just utterly pointless, the characters deliver it with such perceived style and coolness despite the fact they were talking about, frankly, a lot of bs. add this to the fact there is (barring brief moments in butch's story) no plot, no emotion and especially no substance and you have one worthless film. ""ah you don't get it"" they all scream, don't make me laugh, the circular narrative and the ham-fisted attempt at redemption at the end does not equal substance. the ending was hilariously cheap, obviously a desperate attempt to justify a pointless 2 hour string of images in one strike. is it meant to be profound? well after sitting through the whole film which consisted of characters that were never developed adequately, where no actions or events were properly tackled, challenged or explored with any great thought or depth during which i was never required to care even once, i was presented with one of the most cheesy, pointless monologues in film history. oh and a parody of qt's fans - the briefcase is opened and they stare at the shiny thing and go ""ooooh, it beautiful"". it is all a hollow gesture when you consider the character that delivers the speech and his actions directly following it, combined with the entire sequence of stupid events that precede it. many movies these days suffer similar problems at their conclusion because of obvious limitations in plot structure and development, some have endings that invalidate the rest of the film, others have endings that are invalidated by the rest of the film, with pulp fiction qt has somehow achieved both simultaneously. you'll figure out what i mean. as a rule i don't usually let a film's director put me off the film itself but, after kill bill and pulp fiction, tarantino films are now the exception.";7 June 2005;1;['silly', 'battlefield', 'long', 'rare', 'vintage', 'cheap', 'many', 'profound', 'very', 'modern', 'fundamental', 'first', 'untalented', 'cretinous', 'new', 'only', 'white', 'sick', 'sharp', 'pointless', 'crude', 'male', 'accidental', 'other', 'such', 'cool', 'immature', 'irresponsible', 'smart', 'irresponsible', 'complete', 'dimensional', 'severe', 'few', 'wise', 'next', 'likable', 'redeemable', 'violent', 'little', 'other', 'uncomfortable', 'famous', 'new', 'much', 'interested', 'cool', 'unoriginal', 'capable', 'tacky', 'own', 'swish', 'worth', 'many', 'experimental', 'tacky', 'laughable', 'near', 'particular', 'dead', 'amateurish', 'only', 'memorable', 'fun', 'flat', 'witty', 'unfortunate', 'such', 'deep', 'milkshake', 'witty', 'pointless', 'such', 'brief', 'worthless', 'circular', 'cheap', 'desperate', 'pointless', 'profound', 'whole', 'great', 'most', 'cheesy', 'pointless', 'shiny', 'beautiful', 'hollow', 'entire', 'stupid', 'many', 'similar', 'obvious', 'tarantino'];0.0339528850145288

973;swmoncur;"this movie ages better the longer i think about it (it's been three days now since i watched). wildly entertaining from start to finish. the unpredictability that we have come to associate with tarantino is present throughout and give it that unique flavor of satisfaction. it reminded me of a loose hybrid between fargo and the big lebowski. dark comedy with a more-than-healthy dose of violence. as with most, if not all, tarantino films, the plot is out of left field and is filled with unexpected twists and turns. this is compounded by the fact that you're following three unique storylines (not in chronological order!) whose common thread is largely unclear until the end of the movie. it does come together in the end, which showed the genius of the plot and helps to fully appreciate the bizarre, yet crafty, storyline. samuel l jackson especially stood out in his role, accompanied by strong performances by travolta, and willis. the character interplay was amusing throughout and really kept you glued to the screen. there are several iconic scenes that i can tell will always stick out in my mind: the hamburger / apartment interrogation scene, the date night dinner and dancing scenes with travolta and uma thurman, the ""royale with cheese"" dialogue, and the epic diner showdown at the end with pumpkin and honey bunny. some awesome lines throughout. the piecing together of the film was among the best aspects imo. the shattered start, followed by a winding journey that makes the viewer wonder if there is any cohesion at all, ending with a bang. the rollercoaster experience is what makes it so enjoyable, and creating such a well-designed rollercoaster is no easy feat-so kudos to tarantino and company for such an entertaining ride.";17 January 2022;8;['well', 'entertaining', 'present', 'unique', 'loose', 'big', 'dark', 'more', 'healthy', 'most', 'tarantino', 'left', 'unexpected', 'unique', 'chronological', 'common', 'unclear', 'bizarre', 'crafty', 'strong', 'amusing', 'several', 'iconic', 'epic', 'din', 'awesome', 'good', 'shattered', 'rollercoaster', 'enjoyable', 'easy', 'entertaining'];0.3034516765285996

976;franklynbob;"this is an amazing film. reservoir dogs was more violent and gritty. jackie brown was more stylish. this is a perfect mix of both. the film's music plays an important role in establishing a large part of it's style that's not made from the clothing, dialogue or violence. notice how there is never a cd playing. the music is played on car radios, records, etc. i actually didn't know whether or not the film took place in the 90's or the 70's the first time i watched it. i had to go back and look for date elements (cars, cigarettes, etc.). the dialogue is very witty, and it gets a lot of its points from is observations. ""awkward pauses"", ""coming back from the bathroom with your food waiting for you"". i think that tarantino's most valuable talent is his ability to observe human behaviours. the narrative construction is another note. i liked the way the film was cut up. but it's important that the construction benefits the film, rather than trying to hide its weak spots, like some other films do. i think that tarantino was walking a fine line between cutting edge filmaking and exploitation, and crossing the line of having too much of everything. i think people need to realize that this film is at first a comedy. we can't take it seriously. some of the events are probably very true to the crime life, but they're handled in a way that make the film live in another world. obviously the film is not reality. i also think that people get upset about the violence, which if you think about it, takes place mostly off-screen. so it could be taken as praise by tarantino, making people think they're seeing more violence than is actually there. i could go on for hours writing. i've come up with a religious theory about the film too. how marcellus waves his hand at butch after he rescues marcellus from the rapists in an almost absolving manner. the biblical passage. how we are left with the feeling that vince and jules are the winners when they casually walk out of the diner at the end of the film, until we remember that vince was killed about 45 minutes earlier in the film and that this scene is actually taking place before that. vince laughs at jules in the coffee shop when he says he's done, he's out of the crime life, and then after laughing at him, gets killed when he (vince) decides to continue with the life. i think that both the critics are the fans of this film should look a little closer, to realize that it's not as one-dimensional as they may think. the only negative effect this film has had on me is the amount of post-tarantino rip-offs there have been. there's a difference between being influenced by a film and just trying to copy it. too many new film makers are making flash-bang films, without tarantino's talent to be able to pull it off.";2 February 2002;10;['amazing', 'reservoir', 'violent', 'gritty', 'stylish', 'perfect', 'important', 'large', 'first', 'witty', 'valuable', 'human', 'narrative', 'important', 'weak', 'other', 'fine', 'much', 'true', 'upset', 'more', 'religious', 'marcellus', 'biblical', 'little', 'close', 'dimensional', 'only', 'negative', 'post', 'tarantino', 'many', 'new', 'able'];0.1947746094485225

984;Merkin4pres64;"""pulp fiction"" redefined cinema in the 20th century and continues to do so to this day. several films since ""pulp fiction"" have followed it's pattern- the inter-wining stories of several people, some films such as ""crash,"" and ""lock, stock, and two smoking barrels."" this film explores a variety of topics ranging from drugs, hit men, perverse dialog and language, and finally, one of the most intriguing topics of the entire film- the briefcase whose contents are never revealed. this film wouldn't have work if it hadn't been for the cast. the cast is absolutely perfect. all the actors fit the right part, they all do what they need to do and they all do it flawlessly. the only person i had a problem with was the character of fabienne, but despite that setback in the film, the rest of the film makes up ten-fold for what she ruins. but when thinking of the cast, three names come to mind- john travolta, samuel l. jackson, and uma thurman. all of these three were oscar-nominated for their performances and unfortunately, didn't win. john travolta plays hit man vincent vega, partner to jules. he is a low rent for hire asked by his boss to ""take care"" of his wife which jules mistakingly refers to as a job. vega isn't an adventurous man, but yet his boss' wife shows him a good time when he is supposed to. but their evening together almost ends in tragedy. uma thurman give what is probably the strongest performance of her career, if not surpassed by the bride in the ""kill bill"" movies. she is mia wallace, the failed television actress wife of vince and jules' boss, marcellus. she is the adventurous personality that makes vincent do stuff he normally wouldn't do. but this personality leads to almost fatal downfall. and what is there to say about samuel l. jackson? much. he is vincent's hit man partner. jackson gives the otherwise nice jules his sense of evil and the evil way in which he recites ezekiel 25: 17- and for this, jules is my favorite character in the entire movie. what jules does is remarkable. he is able to express a temperament of sheer, vile, anger, but yet, under pressure, manages to keep his cool, even when a gun is pointed to his head. even though many say travolta, jackson, and thurman were stiffed of their oscars, in truth they were, but the greater outrage is that martin landau won over samuel l. jackson. this film is a masterpiece. you have no idea what you are missing if you don't watch this. honestly, watch this movie and you'll see what i'm talking about.";18 November 2005;10;['several', 'inter', 'wining', 'several', 'such', 'perverse', 'intriguing', 'entire', 'perfect', 'right', 'only', 'nominated', 'low', 'adventurous', 'good', 'strong', 'adventurous', 'fatal', 'much', 'nice', 'evil', 'favorite', 'entire', 'remarkable', 'able', 'sheer', 'vile', 'cool', 'many', 'great'];0.2921325051759834

989;bryan_nixon79;i agree with many other citizens that pulp fiction is the best movie of the 1990s. it definitely ranks in my top 5 favorite movies of all time. what is so great about this movie is how tarantino managed to steel from so many other films that he actually created something completely original. he also did this with kill bill. he deserved his oscar for the screenplay. in my opinion, pulp fiction should have been awarded the oscar for the best film of the year, but that honor went to forrest gump. it's a shame that samuel l. jackson was not awarded for his role as jules. it is also a shame that uma thurman was nominated for her role in pulp fiction, but not for her performance in either kill bill. that's strange. pulp fiction is one of the funniest movies ever conceived. it is also one of the most intense. of the three stories, the gold watch, which is about bruce willi's character, butch, is my least favorite. but, it is far from being bad. to me, it plays homage to deliverance, which is a great movie, too. i'm sure that's what tarantino was going for. the third story, the bonnie situation, is a fast-paced slap in the face. amazing! the first story, which is about vincent vega's, played by john travolta, night with his boss's wife, played by uma thurman, on the town. it ends with one of the most heart-pounding scenes that i have ever viewed. i can't forget the prologue and epilogue, which takes place in a coffee shop. how brilliant is that scene? a restaurant being robbed. keep up the good work tarantino. i can't wait for his world war ii film.;5 July 2005;10;['many', 'other', 'good', 'top', 'favorite', 'great', 'many', 'other', 'original', 'good', 'forr', 'strange', 'intense', 'least', 'favorite', 'bad', 'great', 'sure', 'tarantino', 'third', 'amazing', 'first', 'most', 'brilliant', 'good'];0.3576086956521739

1011;jerrybrsc2;"before i knew what a cultural phenomenon pulp was, i knew that this film was incredible. seeing pulp fiction for the first time, i was awestruck. after seeing it, i can 100% say that it is deserving of every bit of praise it gets. lets break this down: the acting is all top notch. whether it's samuel l. jackson, john travolta, eric stoltz, uma thurman and even quentin tarantino himself, they're all perfect for their roles in every way. whether the character the actor is portraying is loud and obnoxious or an exaggerated mousy caricature, all are on their a-game. the story is realistic, but at the same time it's ridiculous and over the top. while this combination of seemingly incompatible story elements could be potentially disastrous in an average film, pulp is well aware of it's absurdity and makes fun of itself to the nth degree. the fact that the film is so over the top, yet very dark at it's core is completely offset by the hilarity that comes with the situations that the characters find themselves in,(i.e. being caught and rapped by two redneck homosexuals in the hollywood hills). the writing, in my own humble opinion, is some of the best ever produced. period. whether the dialog is an exchange between two characters talking about rats, milk, or a royale with cheese, every word spoken is genuine and real and horribly hilarious in it's nature. you, as an audience member know that you shouldn't be laughing at what's happening on screen, but the film's sly whit is infectious and it keeps you smiling and guessing until the end of the film. some people call pulp fiction ""a movie about a movie"". i can't argue their point; pulp is a throwback to those crime cereals that were so prolific in newspapers and comic books of the 70's, as well as a throwback to the classic mobster movies many of us grew up with. some people see this as a weakness to quentin tarantino's direction, saying that he's limited to only making homages to other things in popular culture. i don't think that's true, personally, but in my opinion it's one of his strengths. he takes a genera that is well known and popular and gives it a very fresh twist. he did that with pulp and he continues to do it today, with films like kill bill and inglourious basterds. boiling pulp fiction itself down however, the true lovers of cinema, the people who will know exactly what tarantino is referencing or paying homage to are the ones who will get the most out of this film. that is however not to say that casual viewers won't like the film. it has a little something for everybody and is, without a doubt one of the best films of the recent generation. i hope you like this review and take it into consideration if you decide to see the film.";7 March 2012;10;['cultural', 'incredible', 'first', 'top', 'perfect', 'loud', 'obnoxious', 'exaggerated', 'mousy', 'realistic', 'same', 'ridiculous', 'incompatible', 'disastrous', 'average', 'aware', 'dark', 'own', 'humble', 'good', 'genuine', 'real', 'hilarious', 'sly', 'infectious', 'prolific', 'comic', 'classic', 'many', 'other', 'popular', 'true', 'known', 'popular', 'fresh', 'inglourious', 'true', 'tarantino', 'most', 'casual', 'little', 'good', 'recent'];0.2178030303030302

1037;Gotensive;"so i decided to re-watch this, as it's a film i've been told gets better on repeat viewings. i respectfully disagree. first off, for a film that's widely considered a brilliant piece of entertainment, i don't find it very much entertaining. it's too ""talky"", if that makes any sense. the scenes with travolta and jackson are good, particularly when jackson is doing his yelling schtick, but some of the conversations just don't interest me. i don't care about what burgers are called in france, or whether or not they put mayo on it. it's just filler, and dull filler at that. which brings me to the travolta scene with uma thurman, which is even more dull. we basically watch them on a date, chatting it up again with more useless filler ($5 milkshakes, foot massages, etc), and then we see them dance. call me crazy, but i don't particularly find that entertaining. now when thurman over-doses, and what follows after, that's entertaining. but what happened on the date simply bored me. i'm also no fan of the bruce willis segment, as his character is not interesting to me. for one, willis pretty much plays himself, and two we have to watch him and his girlfriend talk about nonsense, like women with potbellies. i honestly don't understand why this is considered brilliant dialogue. the scene where steve buscemi talks about tipping in the superior ""reservoir dogs"" is far better written, and more interesting, than any of the dialogue in pulp fiction, imo. also, i don't buy bruce willis going back to save the gangster who was going to kill him. the movie does pick up when travolta accident shoots the kid. i'll admit that part is funny, and very well written, even if tarantino nearly ruins the whole scene with his voice and ""acting"". the ending in the restaurant is cool, as jackson steals the show yet again. overall though, i'm just not a fan of this movie. i have nothing against tarantino, as i find ""reservoir dogs"" and the ""kill bill"" films to be solid and enjoyable films, but this film is, for the most part, dull. my 5/10 rating for it still stands.";7 April 2010;5;['well', 'brilliant', 'entertaining', 'talky', 'good', 'dull', 'dull', 'useless', 'crazy', 'entertaining', 'entertaining', 'interesting', 'brilliant', 'superior', 'reservoir', 'interesting', 'funny', 'whole', 'cool', 'reservoir', 'solid', 'enjoyable', 'most', 'dull'];0.2762499999999999

1041;CristiRojas12;the lives of two hit men, a boxer, a drug dealer's wife and two bandits intertwined through different stories ... that tells quentin tarantino in his film pulp fiction (1994), which deals with violence and redemption. it's a strong story, told through different chapters, which illustrate each of the stories, and as the film progresses from chapter to chapter the viewer is all intertwined. and tell the story that way works, because many things we do not understand or that leave doubts are resolved in the end. the dialogue makes the audience journey through history, and the dialogue is very dense, but it helps the narrative of the story because it gives the necessary information and maintains the expectation of what comes next. throughout the story we see the characters follow their own interests and seek its benefits, although some are blackmailed to act in certain ways. they want revenge and achieve their goals through violence, but realize that it does not always bring happiness, so try to redeem himself, but not always in the right way. it's a film that puts the characters into bizarre and dangerous situations, and when they escape enter some worse, this in the context of crime and intrigue. so nothing is predictable, no one knows what will happen next and kept the tension from beginning to end. the story moves quickly through dialogue, which tells us what is necessary to move the story forward, it shows that it is a movie that is not based on real life and that the director saw many films in which he was inspired to do this because it shows people and situations that are not ordinary, and tells it with a cold manner and a style that is not very common. all together, accompanied by good performances, it becomes an experience that can be enjoyed again and again.;1 December 2012;10;['different', 'strong', 'different', 'many', 'dense', 'necessary', 'own', 'certain', 'right', 'bizarre', 'dangerous', 'bad', 'predictable', 'necessary', 'real', 'many', 'ordinary', 'cold', 'common', 'good'];0.0685185185185185

1043;dxia;"i won't hide the fact that my comments here are directed toward the people that don't like this movie, but my foremost goal is to clarify a few issues about this movie that some people just plainly don't have right. issue 1: the movie is gratuitously violent! well, yes and no. i admit that for it's time 'pulp fiction' seemed excessively bloody and does at times glamorize violence, but if you review the film frame by frame, you'll realize that most of the violence is implied. the famous needle scene and marvin's unexpected end actually show less than you may think. tarantino stealthily cuts away at the exact moment when the audience expects to see something gruesome, and everything that we think we saw only occurred in our imaginations. now apart from those two scenes, there is a sword fight and a few executions, but none of them are as gruesome as what one would expect to see in action movies. the reason why people believe the movie is so violent is because of the extraordinary tension that tarantino builds up in every scene. bret's interrogation creates incredible tension because everyone knows that it will explode in violence, but they don't know when. vincent's ""accident"" is excruciating to some people because they see the gun bouncing in vincent's hand just before it discharges. people find it painful to watch because what they fear would happen is exactly what happens. i know some people dislike this movie because everyone laughs at the violence. they don't seem to understand that the audience is supposed to laugh. the laughter is there to relieve the tension because otherwise the movie really would be gratuitously violent. this movie is a caricature of criminals and neurotics, and the point is to watch them react to their world. fans of this movie are not blood-thirsty and do not find it cool to kill people. what so many like about 'pulp fiction' is how tarantino builds up his events and then pays them off so elegantly that some mistake it for a director trying to be cool. he isn't trying. he's succeeding very brilliantly. issue 2: the non-linear story is confusing and pointless! this issue that some people have with 'pulp fiction' really bewilders me, and it's plainly obvious that the people who says it are conventional movie watchers who don't like to put effort into what they're watching. these mainstream movie-goers want plot points and character arcs that can be diagrammed. while there's nothing wrong with linear story-telling, non-linear movies can be a relief sometimes, especially when it's done well. 'pulp fiction' is a perfect example of non-linear story-telling because the movie cannot be told in a linear fashion! think about what would happen. the movie would begin with jules and vincent, but then jules' redemption would happen midway through the movie, vincent would go on his date with mia, and finally butch would have his turn. the movie wouldn't make any sense! people would wonder why butch was introduced so late, and jules' redemption would feel less meaningful because it would no longer be the focus at the end. but as it is, the movie begins and ends perfectly. tarantino introduces all the characters at the correct moments, and he places the chapters in such a way that it brings more focus on the characters rather than the plot. if the movie had ended with butch riding away, it would have felt drab and awkward, but ending with jules feels ennobling. issue 3: the dialogue is meaningless! i know it shouldn't, but this issue really ticks me off sometimes because there's not a shred of truth behind it. it's like complaining that mozart's music has too many notes. people complain not because there's too many, but because they're just too lazy to listen to all of it and interpret what it means. as roger ebert says, tarantino's dialogue is ""load bearing."" take the ""quarter pounder with cheese"" discussion between jules and vincent. some may believe it's frivolous dialogue, but the information we learn from it makes a reprise in a later interrogation and initiates the mounting tension in that scene. the discussion of foot massages introduces the imposing threat of dating mia wallace, and fabi's speech about potbellies is used to hide the fear in her situation. she's trying to comfort herself with pillow talk so that she won't have to talk about hiding from the mafia. honestly, 'pulp fiction' is the most quotable movie ever made. at times, the dialogue sounds like poetry. the conversations do not jump or bounce, they flow and ebb with the sounds always hitting their emotional cues. it's a rare film that can be just as entertaining when listened to rather than watched. if you are one of those few that cannot at least appreciate how well tarantino creates his characters and narrative structure, then don't bother complaining because i already feel sorry that you cannot enjoy the movie as so many do. at the very least, you should not criticize the movie with false and shallow comments. because really, in the end, you're only embarrassing yourself.";1 May 2004;10;['foremost', 'few', 'right', 'violent', 'bloody', 'most', 'famous', 'unexpected', 'less', 'tarantino', 'exact', 'gruesome', 'few', 'gruesome', 'violent', 'extraordinary', 'incredible', 'excruciating', 'painful', 'violent', 'thirsty', 'cool', 'many', 'tarantino', 'cool', 'non', 'linear', 'confusing', 'pointless', 'obvious', 'conventional', 'wrong', 'linear', 'non', 'linear', 'perfect', 'non', 'linear', 'linear', 'meaningful', 'tarantino', 'correct', 'more', 'drab', 'awkward', 'meaningless', 'many', 'many', 'lazy', 'frivolous', 'later', 'quotable', 'emotional', 'rare', 'entertaining', 'few', 'least', 'well', 'sorry', 'many', 'least', 'false', 'shallow'];-0.0607683982683982
1044;dc_follies;pulp fiction is definitely a movie that can be watched over and over so that you can pick up more of the giant metaphor that tarrantino puts on the screen. i can't give this a perfect score, however, because the more i watch this movie, the longer and longer the thurman-travolta story seems to take. the portions of the movie with samuel l., john travolta and bruce willis are by far the most interesting portions of the story - there is better dialogue and what lies behind the curtain is more substantial. the hour or so with uma thurman is simply not very interesting. it bogs the story down, bringing the movie almost to a halt. i like the way tarrantino directs the film and the screen play is excellent, though there is so much swearing that it is almost difficult to overcome. i don't know anyone that swears nearly as much as these characters do (typical of anything qt has written) - newsflash quentin, outswearing a marine doesn't add to a story. much better than average, but not exceptional. *** of ****;8 December 2004;7;['more', 'giant', 'perfect', 'long', 'interesting', 'well', 'substantial', 'interesting', 'excellent', 'much', 'difficult', 'typical', 'well', 'average', 'exceptional'];0.3

1047;fatleprechan;writer and director quentin tartentino reportedly worked in a video store for a time. no doubt it was during this period when he decided he'd had his fill of formulated and prosaic conversations between actors. and contrived plots which plodded towards unsatisfying finales wrought with gunfire and unnecessary explosions. you will find no such nonsense in tarentino's masterpiece 'pulp fiction' with a complex and extremely entertaining plot, which is filmed out of sequence, a device which sometimes confuses audiences. not here as the whole thing plays out and comes together like a puzzle which everyone is having a lot of fun putting together. it is the story of a boxing fix. two handgun wielding robbers and two hit men all interwoven together and connecting at some point. but the most amazing thing about pulp fiction is the dialogue. the actors talk about normal everyday things, not just points to move along the plot or set up a conclusion. a good example of this occurs early in the film while the two hit men, played by john travolta in his academy award nominated come back roll as vince vega, and samuel l. jackson, also nominated for hollywood's biggest prize, as jules, the second of the contract killers, are driving in a car on their way to an ordered murder. they begin talking about vega's recent trip to europe. there is a reference to various fast food restaurants. and vega comments that because of the metric system in france the quarter pounder at mcdonald's is called a royal with cheese. the ease at which the actors speak the dialogue freely helps to create a realistic atmosphere where it seems like two people are just talking. someone might say that two men on their way to a brutal execution might not be on the subject of fast food. but who's to say where normal or abnormal conversation might lead. tarentino caught on to this before anyone else. and this is the most ingenious thing about the film. that and the fact that the scenes are funny, original and thrilling all at the same time. the film also has fine performances from tim roth, eric stoltz, ving rhames, and bruce willis among others. but none better than jackson, who's roll as the repentant hit man developing a conscience was the breakout part this tremendous american actor needed to finally achieve the recognition he deserves. he is comical and reverent in his newfound religion all at the same time. also look for harvey kietel, in a swell cameo as 'the wolf' a man called in to clean up messes which you can't tidy up yourself after this film came out, many imitators cropped up and tried to copy tarentino's writing style. along with his obsession with 70s black exploitation films and karate movies. but this film is positively one of a kind. it could easily be the best film of its decade. groundbreaking. 10 out of a possible 10 t.h.;21 June 2005;10;['formulated', 'prosaic', 'unnecessary', 'such', 'complex', 'entertaining', 'whole', 'amazing', 'normal', 'everyday', 'good', 'hit', 'big', 'ordered', 'recent', 'various', 'fast', 'metric', 'realistic', 'brutal', 'fast', 'normal', 'abnormal', 'ingenious', 'funny', 'original', 'same', 'fine', 'well', 'repentant', 'hit', 'breakout', 'tremendous', 'american', 'comical', 'reverent', 'newfound', 'same', 'many', 'black', 'good', 'possible'];0.15

1064;PorridgeBird;"i'll say this straight off: pulp fiction, unlike tarantino's previous film reservoir dogs, is appropriately titled. pulp is a publication which, according to dictionary.com, contains ""lurid subject matter."" this film is, put simply, trash.and i can easily see why this film may be a low point in american cinema. i can see how there can be a large amount of people who see the horrendous things this movie may or may not promote and call it the end of civilization. and i can easily see myself fitting into that crowd very well. so why do i like pulp fiction? i keep looking for reasons to hate it, but i can't find them. gratuitous violence? can't people see that this sort of pointless bloodshed isn't entertaining? and yet i've seen worse: kind hearts and coronets (1949) is about a man who is able to kill seven men and one woman (all played by alec guinness) to become the duke of chalfont. and how about titus andronicus? that shakespeare was one sick mother-- profanity? isn't this level of f-word usage unreasonable? and yet only yesterday i encountered two men who had never seen the movie before and were dropping f-bombs like a wwii blitzkrieg. it's not unreasonable; it's a reflection of society. it's not pretty, but then i didn't expect the muppet movie on this one. the other forms of deviance in this film? one word: deliverance. aesthetic self-indulgence? hey, i sort of liked citizen kane as well. it uses a camera trick every second, and not one of them helps the plot itself. but i felt it worked. some films are good because they have a great story. some films are good because they look nice on the mantelpiece. (the best films, of course, are both.) i don't know why i should hate pulp fiction. but if that's the case, then why should i like it? good acting? i've seen less wooden characterizations in children's nativity plays. samuel l. jackson does a good job, and bruce willis has my favorite performance, but everyone else seems a bit held back by their foppery. stylish camera-work? some angles were nice, creating some good opportunities for my laptop wallpaper, but nothing spectacular. dancing? you call that dancing? music? well, yes, i suppose i do like it. but at two hours and more, the soundtrack isn't enough to like a film. well, here goes everything: maybe i enjoy this film because it can show that, beneath the violence and the cocaine snorting, there truly is a humanity of some sort. that's why the film opens with such a loving couple robbing a restaurant. that's why two killers can talk so much about foreign fast food. that's why bruce willis can go back to save the man who previously was trying to kill him. that's why the film ends with the return to the restaurant scene, with one final act of redemption. that's why the good people get off the hook and the bad ones are killed by toasters. maybe i like this film because it shows that even the lowest scum has a sense of humanity. maybe i like it because it proves that it's never too late to do right. maybe i like it because it has a (bleep)in' adrenaline-injected heart. maybe. while i can't give it the full marks some believe it deserves (in my mind, tarantino's other masterwork reservoir dogs was better), i do think this is something worth watching. just remember, as mentioned before, that this truly is pulp fiction. but it's pulp like you've never seen before.";16 August 2006;7;['straight', 'previous', 'low', 'american', 'large', 'horrendous', 'gratuitous', 'pointless', 'entertaining', 'bad', 'able', 'sick', 'unreasonable', 'unreasonable', 'pretty', 'other', 'aesthetic', 'second', 'good', 'great', 'good', 'nice', 'good', 'good', 'wooden', 'good', 'favorite', 'stylish', 'nice', 'good', 'spectacular', 'more', 'enough', 'foreign', 'fast', 'final', 'good', 'bad', 'low', 'late', 'full', 'other', 'well', 'worth'];0.2002136752136752

1097;j-70786;"i begin with a favorite film, pulp fiction. i love cundin's work, especially pulp fiction. i don't know why, but it took me two weeks to get it back (i couldn't find it anywhere) . look at the time and dormitory classmates and other dormitory several students look together, many people looked at about half an hour quietly left, some finished is more boring than not to see. after more than two hours of watching the movie, i lay in bed feeling like the movie itself, not knowing what i was thinking. it's just that chuck berry-you never can tell keeps playing over and over in my head. i fell in love with the film two weeks later, at noon, when i felt an indescribable urge to see it again. the film consists of a prologue (a restaurant robbery) and four chapters (named ""joos and bunsei"" , ""bunsei and maschat's wife"" , ""a gold watch"" and ""bunny's situation"") . it breaks the narrative structure of every movie i've ever seen, and that's without a doubt the greatest feature of the movie. like a circle from a random point began to intercept, and finally returned to the starting point. in the story itself, my deepest feeling is not cundin's violence and vice, but the film's realistic meaning, casual moment will let you feel the pressure of life. in real life, there are always too many heavy things, such as violence, sex, war on the whole human level, as well as on the individual level, such as making a living, settling down, relationships, and so on, we carry these heavy shells on our backs, it is a human tragedy to walk hard and be tired. survival itself, from a certain point of view is a disaster, is irretrievable ""heavy"" , unless death... i do not know why such a film will give me such a thought. perhaps it is too ordinary, ordinary people to see the ordinary level of the most real thing. ummah. thurman and john johan. the travolta dance is one of the most memorable parts of the film, it's just a normal part of the movie, and it's cundin's way of entertaining the audience, but i remember it by accident, it's probably as hard for me to forget as living under pressure and having a little fun once in a while. a self-proclaimed ""vulgar"" story full of violence and black life, what meaning it brings to you is up to you to feel. in fact, i watch a movie in a different mood to see the same movie or in the same mood to see a different movie, out of the things are different, the mood will be like the plot slowly released. but i just love to watch movies, if anything to see that is their own little feelings, not a film review. nor was there any critical review of, say, a clockwork orange, the meaning of which i still don't understand. i send all the emotions in the film, perhaps just to the past emotional life of a kind of escape. but i feel so relaxed. i saw jiang wen's the sun also rises a while ago and loved the role of crazy mom. in fact, i think it's a relief to be crazy sometimes, it is better to live a life of madness than to live a life of worry and clarity. at least it's not a burden. in fact, i am now very disgusted with the people who write in the journal about their feelings, write their own emotional life colorful, dim light, you think you can write such a beautiful mood is great, but in my opinion than violence and vice is more vulgar. because you never dare to use a realistic view of life and the treatment of emotions, you only dare to hide in the heart of the self and can not get the real sustenance, you are the real vulgar. at this point i'm starting to feel a little conflicted, maybe like pulp fiction, but most of all i just want to know what i want.";27 May 2020;10;['favorite', 'other', 'several', 'many', 'boring', 'more', 'indescribable', 'bunsei', 'narrative', 'great', 'random', 'deep', 'realistic', 'casual', 'real', 'many', 'heavy', 'such', 'whole', 'human', 'individual', 'such', 'heavy', 'human', 'tired', 'certain', 'irretrievable', 'heavy', 'ordinary', 'ordinary', 'ordinary', 'real', 'memorable', 'normal', 'hard', 'little', 'vulgar', 'full', 'black', 'different', 'same', 'same', 'different', 'different', 'own', 'little', 'critical', 'past', 'emotional', 'relaxed', 'crazy', 'crazy', 'well', 'least', 'disgusted', 'own', 'emotional', 'colorful', 'dim', 'beautiful', 'great', 'vulgar', 'realistic', 'real', 'real', 'little', 'most'];-0.0059993734335839

1108;elkabousmehdi;pulp fiction is certainly one of those films that will always be remembered for their emotional impact that they bring on while you watching them, quentin tarantino's master piece came to reveal and put on a high stage one of the world best film directors. what impressed me about tarantino's gem was its plot, actually the plot provoked many critics, it intrigues everyone that watched the movie, but i would say the most important part in the plot was the characters as samuel l.jackson mentioned at the beginning of the film '' come on, let's get in character'' all the characters involved in the movie were vivid and each one with his or her specific added values. the plot can be divided into three different stories, as long as the film is progressing they getting close to each other, as it is unveiled in the last coffee shop scene. well it will take me more than that to describe the contribution of each character, but to sum it all up characters were master key to put the film into a maverick joy. the music played an important role starting from the first scene with ''dick dale's pulp fiction soundtrack'' illustrating a perfect start, and coming to one of the most entertaining scene when vincent and mia came on the stage to perform a dance that astonishingly matches with ''chuck burry's song- c'est la vie'', there are various of good music throughout the film. pulp fiction was purely entertaining from the beginning to its last seconds, and it's a film that you have to watch multiple times, each time it will keep dazzling you. that's what an entertaining movie should look like!! highly recommended!!!;27 December 2009;8;['emotional', 'high', 'good', 'many', 'important', 'vivid', 'specific', 'different', 'other', 'last', 'more', 'important', 'first', 'perfect', 'entertaining', 'various', 'good', 'entertaining', 'last', 'multiple', 'entertaining'];0.2909523809523809
1109;dpm12;pulp fiction is a classic and a masterpiece. i feel like it is a privilege to have been born one month after this wonderful film's release. i think the style of non-linear storytelling is genius, it just wouldn't be the same film if the stuff was in order. the story is awesome. vincent vega (john travolta) and jules winnfield (samuel l. jackson) are hit men who work for mobster marsellus wallace (ving rhames), who arrive at an apartment to pick up a briefcase that was stolen from their boss. they execute them and take one of the men named marvin (phil lamarr) with them. as their driving down the road, they accidentally hit a bump, causing the gun to go off, and vincent accidentally blows marvin's head off. the two go to jules' friend jimmie's (quentin tarantino) house, who warns them to hurry up and clean, because his wife will return from work in 90 minutes. winston wolfe (harvey keitel) helps them clean out the car, and the take the car to a junkyard to be disposed of. jules and vincent then decide to have breakfast, when the diner they are in is being robbed by pumpkin (tim roth) and honey bunny (amanda plummer). jules foils the robbery, and he and vincent leave to return marsellus' briefcase to him. that night, vincent takes out marsellus' wife mia (uma thurman) for a good time, and they eat dinner at jack rabbit slim's, a restaurant. later that night, she overdoses and vincent takes her to the house of his drugdealer lance (eric stoltz) where they give her an adrenaline shot and save her. they agree to keep this secret from marsellus. butch coolidge (bruce willis) has been paid by marsellus to lose his next fight, but he wins anyway, and now marsellus is looking for him. he and his girlfriend hide in a hotel room, but butch decides to go back to his apartment, knowing very well the gangsters could be there, to get his watch. he kills vincent while there, and encounters marsellus. the two end up fighting in a pawn shop, where marsellus ends up getting raped, and butch saves him. marsellus agrees to let butch go free, and butch and his girlfriend leave los angeles. the script is amazing, some of the best writing i have ever heard in a film, the acting is great, the story is cool, and, most of all, the film is entertaining. one of the best films i have ever seen, and my 6th favorite film. 4/4;13 May 2014;9;['wonderful', 'non', 'linear', 'same', 'awesome', 'good', 'next', 'vincent', 'free', 'amazing', 'good', 'great', 'cool', 'most', 'entertaining', 'good', 'favorite'];0.5535714285714286
1110;bigplatts;the movie that shot director quentin tarantino into popularity, pulp fiction still stands as his greatest movie and one of the best movies ever created. the film follows multiple inter-connecting plot lines: samuel l jackson and john trovolta play two hit men searching for a stolen briefcase, uma thurman plays the boss mans wife out on a date with trovolta, bruce willis plays a boxer on the run from gangsters, ands tim roth and amanda plummer play a couple robbing a diner. the plot is structured brilliantly and is told out of order which makes things even more interesting. the film features most tarantino trademarks, including his normal chunky dialogue, with some of the most quotable lines in any film ever contained here. the films also not shy on action and there's loads of surprises throughout the movie(although i wont spoil anything). acting wise, pulp fiction features one of the greatest casts in film history. jackson gives what is undoubtedly the best performance of his career as the bible spouting hit man, while trovolta gives another great performance in the role that resurrected his career. thurman also acts brilliantly as the sexy but mysterious wife to the main mafia boss. the supporting cast is strong with harvey keitel playing the gangster expert and even tarantino himself has a small but hilarious role. but thats not the only reason pf is so great, its everything about it. the soundtrack is classic tarantino with tons of pop culture tunes used to add to the story. while the camera work is some of the best since the films release. and the film just keeps on giving, from its smart opening scene which carries the whole movie, to its hilarious middle acts, to its hugely satisfying conclusion. as it stands, pulp fiction is still one of the funniest, darkest, most enjoyable and most creative films ever. if you haven't seen the film yet then i can't recommend enough you go out and watch it as soon as you can. a true classic.;3 July 2011;10;['tarantino', 'great', 'good', 'multiple', 'inter', 'hit', 'interesting', 'most', 'tarantino', 'normal', 'chunky', 'quotable', 'shy', 'great', 'good', 'bible', 'great', 'sexy', 'mysterious', 'main', 'strong', 'tarantino', 'small', 'hilarious', 'only', 'great', 'classic', 'tarantino', 'good', 'smart', 'whole', 'hilarious', 'middle', 'dark', 'enjoyable', 'creative', 'true'];0.3421768707482994

1112;bigcahs93;pulp fiction is a 1994 crime-drama directed and written by quentin tarantino. staring jon travolta and samuel l. jackson as two b.a.m.f's and bruce willis as butch. let me just say before i dig into this that i have a massive bias to this movie. i've seen pulp more than any other movie, in fact the reason why i even took this class in the first place can be directly linked to my admiration for pulp. that being said, tarantino really showed that he's got game in this film. many people say that he's just a really big fan simply 'steals' shots from other directors, and one can certainly see the similarities between the shots, but tarantino manages to make it his own every time. even if the set up is exactly the same, the shots he uses are able to stay 'tarantino- esque'. its also hard to point out one particular thing in this movie that stands out, as the cinematography, editing, sound, story, acting, and even the wardrobe stands out. what makes this movie different from the rest is the non-conventional showing of the story. its non-linear, its almost aggressively non-linear. for years i've been trying to figure out what the order in which the stories are told mean, i'm sure there's something there, but i haven't really been able to figure it out. that being said though, it doesn't hold the movie back. at the end of the day, this movie is everything a good movie could be. go watch it, go obsess over it, go talk about it, go go go! 10/10;9 May 2013;10;['massive', 'more', 'other', 'first', 'many', 'big', 'other', 'tarantino', 'own', 'same', 'able', 'hard', 'particular', 'different', 'non', 'conventional', 'non', 'linear', 'non', 'linear', 'sure', 'able', 'good'];0.2077731092436975
1113;OutlanderOmega;"when i was a kid, i had worlds and settings i'd come up with in my head. they were thrown together from different things in movies, music, and pictures. it was how i thought a sci-fi world should be. how i thought a forest of tribal people should look. these were all made of many different ideas, but there was one that wasn't fully formed. it was what i thought of when i saw the neon sign for a burger place by the old hollywood video store. it had brightly colored jungle leaves and the light of the words. it wasn't a complete idea, but i knew it was electric, bright, lush, and most of all interesting. pulp fiction was the embodiment of this. it was an interesting story that was one of the single most entertaining movies i've ever seen. though it's considered a sin, i haven't seen much tarantino. in fact, the only other one i've seen is inglorious basterds. so, i'd like to compare it directly to that. pulp fiction hit the proverbial mark on every aspect of cinematography, visual style, production design, and interesting shots. the first scene in inglorious basterds with the jews under the floor was supposed to be tense, but dragged on to where it wasn't suspenseful. however, the scene where vincent and mia go to jack rabbit slim's was great. as well as how they had an interesting conversation, the camera wasn't left to hang out while the crew went for a smoke break. the shot composition was changed up enough to keep an already good interaction more fun to watch. this constant flow of change-ups doesn't confuse the audience either, but keeps it interesting through every scene (save maybe butch's flashback). thematically, this movie is great. there's a lot to do with the idea of honor, but what was interesting to me is how ethics played in. living in seattle, i don't hear lots of conversations in public that go beyond people saying they don't know if they believe in god, but just want to accept everybody for all the stuff they think and stuff, man. pulp fiction doesn't struggle with that kind debate. they talk about god right at the start to move into a deeper ethical issue. it's proof that a movie doesn't have to be confusing or psychologically challenging to make you contemplate huge concepts. the content of a movie is not necessarily being promoted by its makers. this movie about killers, thieves, rapists, and addicts had more to say about morals and redemption than the boring eastern philosophy that suffocates discussions on belief. those discussions rarely happen where i'm from and it's something all people are interested by. sometimes when watching a movie i say, ""damn, that's why people love this."" a moment that makes the film worthy of its credit. i felt that was every single scene in pulp fiction. it had enough energy and information, both thematic and visual, to fill an insane asylum. there are few things i love more in a story than when they approach serious, dark situations with a who-cares attitude. pulp fiction did this amazingly, but without making the characters amoral or apathetic. this film had the entertainment drive of district 9 and the graduate. after a long wait to see it, i was impressed.";9 March 2015;9;['different', 'tribal', 'many', 'different', 'old', 'complete', 'electric', 'bright', 'most', 'interesting', 'interesting', 'single', 'entertaining', 'much', 'only', 'other', 'inglorious', 'proverbial', 'visual', 'interesting', 'first', 'inglorious', 'tense', 'suspenseful', 'great', 'interesting', 'good', 'more', 'constant', 'interesting', 'great', 'interesting', 'deep', 'ethical', 'confusing', 'challenging', 'huge', 'more', 'boring', 'eastern', 'interested', 'worthy', 'single', 'enough', 'thematic', 'visual', 'insane', 'few', 'serious', 'dark', 'amoral', 'apathetic', 'long', 'impressed'];0.1777513227513228

1115;samlynn12;there is no other word to describe this film. everything from the casting to the choice of music is perfect in my opinion. there is humour, violence, shock, it has everything a film needs, and they are all portrayed in a sensational way. for people who haven't seen the film, it is a collection of stories, all jumbled out of chronological order, and all are somehow intertwined. the individual stories themselves are wonderful, and i would watch them on their own. the way that tarantino has put all the stories together, so that we still aren't sure how they all connect until right at the end, is amazing. the film somehow has a gritty reality to it, even though some of the events that happen are ridiculous, they are believable all the same. the amazing thing is that tarantino always manages to produce incredible films. this is imo the best film that he has made (and probably ever made!), and for any fan, or in fact anyone who has not seen this film yet, go out and buy it now!;20 September 2013;10;['other', 'perfect', 'sensational', 'chronological', 'individual', 'wonderful', 'own', 'sure', 'amazing', 'gritty', 'ridiculous', 'believable', 'same', 'amazing', 'tarantino', 'incredible', 'imo', 'good'];0.4130208333333333

""pulp fiction"" is a quirky gangster film on its surface but when one digs a little deeper it is a story about redemption. notice the difference between the fates of john and samuel's characters, and also notice how bruce redeems himself. this would all be well and good enough as it is, but quentin is not done yet. not only does he bring forth an arsenal of brilliant directing (his classic ""car trunk"" shot), but he also makes a circular film (the beginning and the end are the same). this movie is great, just simply fantastic. and another lovely bonus is that ""pulp fiction"" never gets old, which is something hard to come by nowadays. ""pulp fiction"" is probably the best movie of the 90's and is certainly one of the best films of all time, and i mean that. the only people who will not like ""pulp fiction"" are dumbasses (who will get confused by the story format), the squeamish (who don't like gruesome screen violence), and right-wingers (who think that sex,violence, and profanity are the earmarks of a bad movie). all and all i give ""pulp fiction"": 5 out of 5 stars. note: 1/5 stars = bad 2/5 stars = ok 3/5 stars = good 4/5 stars = great 5/5 stars = classic 2005 imaginist";21 March 2005;10;['much', 'good', 'legendary', 'remarkable', 'watchable', 'classic', 'thick', 'clever', 'fabulous', 'such', 'enthralling', 'infamous', 'such', 'dark', 'simple', 'quirky', 'little', 'deep', 'well', 'good', 'brilliant', 'classic', 'circular', 'same', 'great', 'fantastic', 'lovely', 'old', 'hard', 'good', 'good', 'only', 'gruesome', 'right', 'bad', 'bad', 'good', 'great', 'classic'];0.1845063025210083

1144;booyatom;"i don't think i've ever laughed so hard during a movie. the brilliant thing about pulp fiction, the reason it is so highly regarded, is because it isn't cheap comedy. it's black comedy. personally, it took me about 2 or 3 seconds after the punchline to actually laugh. i had to think about it. i could picture people seeing it for the first time in 1994, a time when most moviegoers weren't used to as raw, violent and graphic movies as we see today. not many films leading up to tarantino's made use of free violence for no moral reason at all but just to laugh. this type of comedy generally makes us ask of tarantino : ""can he do that? is he allowed?"" a perfect example of this is when jules and vincent are coming back from a whack ordered by crime boss marsellus wallace. they've brought back with them their snitch marvin. in the car, both hit men are having a lively (and utterly comical) discussion, as is typical of tarantino characters. then, vincent turns around, gun still in hand from the job, and asks marvin his opinion. all of a sudden, his gun goes off and blasts marvin's head off. ""oh man, i just shot marvin in the face,"" says vincent, to which jules replies ""man, i've seen some ****** up **** in my day but this is really ****** up!"" there is no moral reason for this to have happened; it's just a hilarious lead up to the introduction of another hilarious character. oh and by the way, i almost died of laughter, i'm not joking. all the characters are so original yet so real. just look at the dialogue. most of it is unimportant to the plot of the stories in the movie, yet that's what makes pulp fiction... pulp fiction. the thing is, it's so damn funny. the very first scene we see with vincent and jules, a few minutes after the beginning, their dialogue seems quite irrelevant : they talk about the little differences between america and europe. for example, what we know as a quarter pounder with cheese at mcdonalds is called a ""royale with cheese"" in paris. oh, and they dip their fries in mayonnaise. at first glance, this dialogue is just killing time until something big happens, but with a skillful writer-director like tarantino, no time is wasted. the said conversation keeps coming back and is useful to understand jules and vincent's relationship. this is not the only instance in which there are conversations like these; the whole movie is a goldmine of one-liners and witty conversations that seem irrelevant, but always come back tarantino green-lighted a movement in cinema that was to follow. of course, the nineties and the eighties before them had their share of violent films : scarface, platoon, apocalypse now, natural born killers and many others. but never had there been a movie that poked fun of people getting killed. tarantino allowed filmmakers to have fun. movies like platoon and natural born killers used violence in an attempt to criticize the behavior. but tarantino uses it as comedy. there's nothing wrong with that; we can handle it. bringing his ideas to film, tarantino touched a sweet spot in film audiences. nowadays, there are plenty shoot-em-up movies, and we thank our pal tarantino for it.";12 November 2006;10;['brilliant', 'cheap', 'black', 'first', 'most', 'raw', 'violent', 'graphic', 'many', 'free', 'moral', 'perfect', 'lively', 'comical', 'typical', 'tarantino', 'sudden', 'moral', 'hilarious', 'hilarious', 'original', 'real', 'most', 'unimportant', 'funny', 'first', 'few', 'irrelevant', 'little', 'first', 'big', 'skillful', 'useful', 'only', 'whole', 'witty', 'irrelevant', 'tarantino', 'violent', 'natural', 'many', 'tarantino', 'natural', 'tarantino', 'wrong', 'sweet', 'plenty', 'pal'];0.126240959894806

1155;argo0403;"i've watched all films that tarantino directed but for me this pulp fiction is the best of all of them. it's a little bit difficult to explain this movie. this looks like a omnibus and consists of prologue , three stories and epilogue.they seem to be disconnected but after watching, everything is connected. prologue is about a couple planning to burgle a restaurant and two man from mafia vincent and jules . they takes a order from their boss marsellus to collect his possessions. first story is about vincent and marsellus's wife vega. he is asked to take care of her by marsellus. second is about one boxer who refuses to order to lose on purpose. third is about vincent and jules again. they happen to kill a man and asks a professional to solve. epilogue is also them at a restaurant. if there's a word describes this movie, it must be ""crazy"" in a good sense. all of the stories are completely crazy, full of sex talks and violence, and there's no message from this. however, i do love this craziness. i have to admit that tarantino really has a great sense of humor and is good at creating wonderful characters. particularly, i like jules acted by samuel jackson. i'm fascinated by his way of speak and the scene he recites ezekiel 25:17. it's imprinted on my mind. also i think conversations of this movie are really amusing. they're meaningless and not important but for instance, one about hamburger is awesome. every time after watching, i come to want to eat a hamburger! the story i like most is second. the scene bruce willis and ving rhames get caught and they kick asses of stupid two young guys is amazing! this is a cheap b movie. but it's waste to miss this sophisticated story , direction like music and enjoyable acting. after watching, you may feel refreshing and have a desire to watch again.";23 September 2013;10;['good', 'little', 'difficult', 'first', 'second', 'third', 'crazy', 'good', 'crazy', 'full', 'great', 'good', 'wonderful', 'fascinated', 'amusing', 'meaningless', 'important', 'awesome', 'second', 'stupid', 'young', 'amazing', 'cheap', 'sophisticated', 'enjoyable', 'refreshing'];0.2365

1159;SandyAren;"the film is so intricately structured, with so many astonishing details, many of which you won't pick up on the first viewing, that it seems to cry out for some deeper explanation. it's no wonder that fans spend so much time debating what was in the suitcase, reading far more into the story than tarantino probably intended. the movie becomes a bit easier to understand once you realize that it's essentially a black comedy dressed up as a crime drama. each of the three main story threads begins with a situation that could easily form the subplot of any standard gangster movie. but something always goes wrong, some small unexpected accident that causes the whole situation to come tumbling down, leading the increasingly desperate characters to absurd measures. perhaps no screenplay has ever found a better use for digressions. indeed, the whole film seems to consist of digressions. no character ever says anything in a simple, straightforward manner. jules could have simply told yolanda, ""be cool and no one's going to get hurt,"" which is just the type of line you'd find in a generic, run-of-the-mill action flick. the core of the movie, the blathering of vincent and jules is fun and enjoyable. bruce willis as a hot-headed boxer does an excellent job communicating his fear and desperation. in the end, the movie's quirks and twists are merely to make a rather run-of-the-mill arthouse film seem more edgy. it is a little bit to long, but i can say it is tarantino style to show everything in a little bit slow motion manner. there is no question that this is a well made and fun movie. 8/10";16 May 2018;8;['many', 'astonishing', 'many', 'first', 'deep', 'much', 'easy', 'black', 'main', 'standard', 'wrong', 'small', 'unexpected', 'whole', 'desperate', 'absurd', 'well', 'whole', 'simple', 'straightforward', 'cool', 'generic', 'fun', 'enjoyable', 'excellent', 'edgy', 'little', 'tarantino', 'little', 'slow'];0.0882716049382716

1223;JetBanana;"i am mainly dedicating this comment to the millions of closed-minded ""film fanatics"" who think the only way a movie can be ""good"" is if it has a distinct plot and plot outline characterized through pages of unnecessary dialouge. i found pulp fiction to be the perfect film to use as an example of all of the points i wish to make. a movie is much like any other piece of art, whether it is a sculpture, painting, etc. you need to open your mind and let it speak to you through your own interpretation. i've been told by some people that pulp fiction has no story line and is completely meaningless. it isn't going to be spoon fed to you. god forbid you have to think a little when you watch a film and you have to form some of your own conclusions. for those who watched this movie and didn't find it to have meaning, let me spoon feed it to you. pulp fiction explores four major themes and does so through the use of multiple, sometimes inter-weaving, stories. the main themes are friendship, loyalty, love (specifically forbidden love), and revelation. friendship is characterized through the words and actions (not all dialouge like you'd like it to be) of jules (samuel l. jackson) and vincent (john travolta). they play two partners in a crime syndicate and through certain events throughout their story, their friendship grows to new levels. their constant bickering and arguing through the film shows their getting to know one another better and look at life through a different perspective. loyalty is portrayed through butch's (bruce willace) story. he has the most open ended story of them all because it really make you wonder what happens next, but you are forced to use your imagination. his character is given a business proposition which he takes into his own hands and slightly foreshadows his ability to possibly form his own crime syndicate (but by the independancy of his character this seems unlikely). forbidden love is the meaning behind vincent and mia's (uma thurman) tale. i've heard from many that this was the most pointless story of them all and i wish to have you rethink that. she is the wife of a crime boss, and he works for this boss. the thought of their love for one another was so unthinkable in their situation that it had to be expressed through actions (hence the word acting). a prime example was the cinematically infamous ""twist"" scene. it showed the parallel rhythm of their ""souls"" for the lack of a better word and portrayed their completion of one another. and finally, revelation. the closing point of the film. it starts with the life-altering event (for jules at least) of not being hit by a single bullet shot at him. even at that one moment he almost immediately rethinks his whole outlook on life and decides to retire. but this is only the beginning. the most powerful scene in the film is in the diner at the end. jewels spreads his message of life and appreciation to two small time crooks who decide to rob the diner and its customers. through a very deep and proactive monologue delivered by samuel l. jackson, the robber only known as pumpkin (tim roth) is left speechless and in awe as he walked away with his wife and went home, hopefully to start an new life. i hope this helped you further appreciate this cinematic masterpiece and also help you realize the importance of watching movies, or any art form, with an open mind and with imagination. do not always dismiss something you don't understand as meaningless, in everyday life as well, for that is the ignorance this world decays from everyday.";8 July 2007;10;['closed', 'minded', 'only', 'good', 'distinct', 'unnecessary', 'perfect', 'much', 'other', 'own', 'meaningless', 'little', 'own', 'major', 'multiple', 'inter', 'main', 'dialouge', 'certain', 'new', 'constant', 'different', 'open', 'ended', 'own', 'own', 'unlikely', 'many', 'pointless', 'unthinkable', 'prime', 'infamous', 'twist', 'parallel', 'well', 'least', 'single', 'whole', 'powerful', 'small', 'deep', 'proactive', 'new', 'cinematic', 'open', 'meaningless', 'everyday'];0.057427660059239

1229;PrivateBryant;the fact that this is one of the most acclaimed movies by both critics and audiences alike, worldwide, is no coincidence. the content of this film is shocking- one man's vision of the many different aspects of petty criminals lives in los angeles. quentin tarantino doesnt pull his punches and in both this and reservoir dogs, he portrays a very realistic view of gritty world, not worrying about excessive amounts of bad language, some graphic violent scenes, and even drug use. the magic of tarantino is that he manages to couple this with a great, fast moving script, and a well thought out plot, that he executes perfectly. so not only do you feel that what you are watching is probably pretty close to reality, but it is irrestibly entertaining aswell. pulp fiction is really one story, following vincent vega(john travolta)and jules winnfield (samuel l jackson), as they have a hectic couple of days at the office, working for crimelord marsellus wallace. but it is told in three shorter sections that,combined together, tell the tale. the good thing is that you have to follow quite closely to get the best out of the movie, and afterwards take a couple of seconds to sort the scenes you have seen into the correct order that they happened. it's not really hard or complicated, but makes the film more interesting than if it were a beginning-middle-end story. the way that tarantino executes this, both in the script and the actual film itself, is deserving of all the accolades he recieved. of course, the thing that carries the film, along with the script, is the fantastic acting by one of the best casts i have ever seen. backing up travolta and jackson are: ving rhames, tim roth, harvey kietel, bruce willis,uma thurman,eric stoltz,tarantino himself,amanda plummer, and fans of reservoir dogs, (like me), will be pleased to see steve buscemi make a small appearance as a waiter dressed up as buddy holly. everything about this film is enjoyable, unless you are easily offended, and it deserves a lot of credit.;30 December 2002;10;['many', 'different', 'petty', 'reservoir', 'realistic', 'gritty', 'excessive', 'bad', 'graphic', 'violent', 'tarantino', 'great', 'fast', 'close', 'entertaining', 'hectic', 'short', 'good', 'good', 'correct', 'hard', 'complicated', 'interesting', 'middle', 'actual', 'fantastic', 'good', 'reservoir', 'pleased', 'small', 'enjoyable'];0.140625

1234;cmcafeeky;"pulp fiction is one of the most influential movies of its decade. it spawned tons of imitators in both style, character development, and structure. its nonlinear timeline may or may not be a tarantino homage to citizen kane, and can be seen in such modern classics as memento and the usual suspects to name an elite few. there are no bad scenes in this movie. it starts strong, gets better, and then ends on a high note. while it concerns the lives of two mob hit men, a boxer, a crime boss's wife, a pair of petty thieves in a nonlinear tale of the intersecting story lines, its style and the characters make it about much more. amazing opening scene kicks off the fun when honey bunny (amanda plummer) and pumpkin (tim roth) casually discuss their robbery strategies, profess their sugar sweet love for each other, and then sudden shift into full throated threats toward the patrons in the quiet dinner. the opening conversation between vincent (john travolta) and jules (samual l. jackson) is a classic in hyper stylized cool hipster conversation. there musings on a life in amsterdam, a ""royal with cheese"" , and the appropriateness of as foot massage, and what may happen if someone gets too cozy with the big bosses woman is a definite high point in scatological dialogue from a crime movie. all of the acting here is top notch. travolta makes an impressive return. he exudes charisma and is pitch perfect in every scene. michael madsen was originally offered the role, but due to scheduling difficulties was not able to participate. while madsen was terrific in tranatino's first directorial outing reservoir dogs, it's now hard to imagine anyone else in the role other than travolta. the date at jack rabbit slims is about as much fun as can be had in a restaurant. travolta gets to reprise his dancing, which helped skyrocket him to fame in the 70's, while helping reestablish himself here after his career waned somewhat during the late 80s. uma thurman does well as the big crime bosses sexy wife mia. the black bangs seem to be a nod to other bad girls, or maybe bettie page. the od scene is harrowing. samual l. jackson also delights as a contemplative hit man jules. does a movie get any more intense then when jules spouts his ezekiel speech as he looks down his gun barrel at a man who tried to do marcellus wallace wrong? it would be hard to imagine these two veteran actors having a cooler more impressive role then they found here with tarantino's dialogue. does it get any better than when jules has his gun on honey bunny and he muses on the meaning of his ezekiel passage? bruce willis does great job as the boxer who is coerced to throw a fight. he is great here as the old palooka nearing the end and looking for one last big payday. great interplay with his love interest helps provide some character balance countered by him almost going ballistic when she forgets his most prized possession when they start on the lam. i absolutely love christopher walken's cameo speech to a young boy, and all that had transpired in order for him to present him with the family heirloom wrist watch. i loved bruce willis and ving rhame's collision, fight and the scenes eventually payoff.

1236;Amadeus_Smith;"quentin tarantino's first masterpiece. the highly and critically acclaimed 1994 movie became a quick cult classic with its unconventional structure, immensely witty dialogue and great examples of excellent casting. while there is no absolute lead actor or main character, john travolta became the real shining star of the film as he went from an almost forgotten celebrity to a surprise academy award nominee. opinions of travolta skyrocketed after his admirable performance in pulp fiction, made even more special with quentin tarantino by his side, with his script and his vision. other actors who made tarantino's casting ability reign significant were samuel l. jackson, uma thurman, bruce willis, ving rhames, harvey keitel, tim roth, amanda plummer and a small christopher walken role. the brilliant casting went on to create brilliant characters. these characters were brought to life by their portrayals, witty dialogue, memorable moments and top notch chemistry; everybody remembers this movie for fantastic philosophical and psychological pieces of long dialogue that never get boring, mostly involving travolta and jackson, or to an even greater degree, travolta and thurman. it's hard to keep describing the characters, story and memorable scenes because there is just so much and too much to talk about, it's just much easier to say that everybody involved in the process did a great job. there is something in pulp fiction for everyone, for every die-hard movie fan, to every aspiring director or writer, to every casual cinema- goer. there is action, violence significant to the film's shape and style, quintessential tarantino trademarks, some fine notable qualities on the visual and design side of things and an incredibly memorable soundtrack, the latter of all these qualities perhaps being the most enjoyable generally. i really can't think of a movie that portrays better utilisation of a non-original score than this, with every song used as a device to set the mood, to capture your attention or to fit in nicely with the cinematography in its own sense of aloofness. the soundtrack boasts a fine array of surf rock and funk/soul music. of course, what will always be remembered, what will almost make pulp fiction innovative is the series of basic stories, made not-so-basic with an intriguing, non-chronological structure. the movie ends with a scene that takes place before the first main story that is presented, that being john travolta's character vincent vega taking his boss's wife mia wallace (thurman) out. but don't worry; you won't need a synopsis written out for you as you watch the movie, because in pure tarantino style, it is complicated but at the same time consumable. and speaking of, the main accolade here is quite simply the remarkable job done by quentin tarantino in his second feature length directing effort. made slightly frustrating by not being able to direct some of his earlier screenplays, the man knew that he was made to be a success in the movie industry, and after the release of pulp fiction, everybody knew it. pulp fiction taught us so many things, not just what they call a quarter pounder with cheese in france, but also not to have such a conservative outlook on movies. with a legacy that will always live on, pulp fiction is simply put, my favourite movie. i envy anybody who still hasn't watched it, you are really in for a treat. it is one of the all-time greatest films, and if you disagree then i will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger. *****";15 March 2013;10;['first', 'quick', 'unconventional', 'witty', 'great', 'excellent', 'absolute', 'main', 'real', 'admirable', 'special', 'tarantino', 'other', 'significant', 'small', 'walken', 'brilliant', 'brilliant', 'witty', 'memorable', 'top', 'fantastic', 'philosophical', 'psychological', 'long', 'boring', 'great', 'hard', 'memorable', 'much', 'much', 'easy', 'great', 'die', 'hard', 'casual', 'significant', 'quintessential', 'tarantino', 'fine', 'notable', 'visual', 'memorable', 'latter', 'enjoyable', 'well', 'non', 'original', 'own', 'fine', 'innovative', 'basic', 'basic', 'intriguing', 'non', 'chronological', 'first', 'main', 'pure', 'tarantino', 'complicated', 'same', 'consumable', 'main', 'remarkable', 'second', 'frustrating', 'able', 'early', 'many', 'conservative', 'favourite', 'great', 'great', 'furious'];0.2713464696223316

1239;harveybdickens;quentin tarantino's movies are there own genre. 25 years ago however, he was a nobody. then he directed this movie, and this is what put him on the map, as one of the directors to look out for. pulp fiction is about a number of different characters, whose stories all intertwine together during the course of this movie. you've got the two hit men jules winnfield, and vincent vega. you've got butch coolidge, a boxer, whose losing his game, so to speak. pumpkin and honey bunny, two robbers, who appear at the start, and the end of the movie, although they technically only appear in one stage of the movie. that's one of the interesting things about this movie. it is not told in chronological order. one might think this would confuse the story, but it actually makes it more interesting. this adds to an already interesting story, but the driving force behind the movie is the dialogue. a lot of dialogue based movies can be boring, and this one is boring very occasionally. this certainly is one of the more interesting dialogue based, that keeps people interested for its 2.5 hour length. for this reason it is possibly one of the most quotable movies of all time. considering that, and how well it is made, it is obvious, due to the content, that this movie isn't for everybody. some people really won't like it. however anyone who likes great dialogue, will probably like it, cinema nerds (like myself) will probably like it, i certainly enjoyed most of it, and so i give it 8/10;4 December 2015;9;['own', 'different', 'interesting', 'chronological', 'interesting', 'interesting', 'boring', 'interesting', 'interested', 'quotable', 'obvious', 'great', 'most'];0.2625
1240;ebhae-34976;1994 is the best movie year ever, i even think that is a fact. my top 10 in no particular order. the shawshank redemption. forest gump. the lion king. leon the professional. speed. natural born killers. ed wood. dumb and dumber. true lies. and of course this one. so what make this movie the best (in my opinion). 1: dialogue the dialogue in this movie is not plot driven. the purpose with the dialogue is to set up the characters and entertain the audience, that it succeed with. the dialogue is also what makes this movie so funny. tarantino (the director) like to use phrases that means the same thing as more common use phrases but is so much funnier. 2: acting amazing dialogue without a good delivery is nothing and a great script without characters you like is not nearly as entertaining. luckily for this movie the acting is great and they deliver the dialogue perfect (especially samuel l jackson). for example vincents reaction when mia came back home from the heroine overdose, that is some serious acting. and don't forget this movie brought john travolta back to life. 3: soundtrack every scene(except maybe the vincent talking with butch scene) that could have been kind of boring tarantino filled with music that pretty much everyone can enjoy, the driving montage, sun of a preacher man, girl you'll be a woman soon and the dance scene. but the music also is important to set the tone and ad to the fantastic experience that is pulp fiction. 4: cinematography like the soundtrack the cinematography is just pulp fiction. the bright colors and the typical stile tarantino have when he shot movies. the camera told us that this is a fun experience, not a dark movie. 5: the script this might be the best script of all time execute to perfection. it's in the script all the joke is and it is the script that have the perfect linked story. but the script also have the three different time-lines that makes this movie one of the most re-watchable movie of all time. this is my favorite tarantino movie and my 3d/2nd favorite movie of all time.;13 January 2017;10;['good', 'particular', 'professional', 'natural', 'dumb', 'true', 'good', 'funny', 'same', 'more', 'common', 'funny', 'amazing', 'good', 'great', 'entertaining', 'great', 'perfect', 'serious', 'boring', 'preacher', 'important', 'fantastic', 'bright', 'typical', 'fun', 'dark', 'good', 'perfect', 'different', 're', 'watchable', 'favorite', 'tarantino', 'favorite'];0.3126344086021505

1279;benjaminspetrofsky;"seriously, what is with all of the one star ratings on this film? what a disgrace. what the people hated about this movie is exactly what makes it good. so many people complain there is no storyline. bullshit. if you were actually paying attention to the film you would find that this picture was divided into different segments and switched around. just because it's something different than what you're used to doesn't mean it's bad. it's called a ""non parallel plot."" famous authors and filmmakers do this all the time, you just may have not noticed. quentin tarantino just takes it to another level because he has a very unique style where he likes to give you major cliffhangers and start the next substory, making you crave for more (an you do get it, just later on.) if anything, its a series of several stories, and the film is edited the way it is to show how these different stories intertwine. it's not that complicated of a concept, but the low intelligence of many viewers may result in complete confusion of what's going on. flat characters? i really don't even need to get into this one. the characters all had their own distinct personalities and yes, character development. if jules' transition from crime in the beginning to wanting to get out of the business in the end isn't character development, then i don't know what is. there is an obvious misconception here of what character development actually is. and too much dialogue? that's tarantino's style. what's with this sudden rule that a film should always be visually told and not told verbally? bullshit. art is something like a free for all. it works here. the dialogue is natural and is witty. i heard one reviewer say tarantino is self indulgent here because his dialogue represents his thoughts too much. wtf? just because he has a wordy script style means he's too self indulgent? he's simply writing a script with witty dialogue, there is no ego trip here. this claim is simply and utterly ridiculous. and if you're complaining about him being in his own movies, go ahead and say that alfred hitchcock was self indulgent and a bad filmmaker. i am very sure many people here wouldn't dare claim that. overall, this is indeed one of the greatest films ever made. and that isn't because it's a fad film like many others say. ""pulp fiction"" is a film that has completely revolutionized the way film handles dialogue and the editing of a film's story. if people are unable to acknowledge that then they are only limiting their perception of what has made films evolve to what it is today. films like ""pulp fiction,"" ""a clockwork orange,"" ""2001 a space odyssey,"" ""psycho,"" ""one flew over the cuckoo's nest,"" etc., are all films with this kind of status. if you don't enjoy this film, then that is fine. however, to deny the importance or influence this film has graced upon the medium is simply foolish and unenlightened on the part of the viewer. this is simply one of the most entertaining films you will ever see in your life if you can keep up with the pace and the story. it may take a few viewings if you're the kind of person that can't understand this kind of plot, but i guarantee almost every time that if you watch this film over and over and study it like i have and numerous other classics, you will notice all of the big and little things that make this film what it is. it's truly a remarkable film. there may be little symbolism beside's jules' commentary on the bible and reciting of biblical passages, but this film is more so about the entertainment than symbolic storytelling. there are two different kinds of films in that way, the ones that try to allude to something symbolic or important like ""a clockwork orange"" and there are other films that rely on entertaining the viewer like this film and ""jaws."" i'm sure not many people will call ""jaws"" a bad film either. anyway, don't listen to the one star reviewers. they simply didn't understand the film, its story, or its style. this film is a real treat.";17 March 2014;10;['good', 'many', 'bullshit', 'different', 'different', 'bad', 'non', 'parallel', 'famous', 'unique', 'major', 'next', 'more', 'several', 'different', 'complicated', 'low', 'many', 'complete', 'flat', 'own', 'distinct', 'obvious', 'much', 'sudden', 'free', 'natural', 'witty', 'indulgent', 'wordy', 'indulgent', 'witty', 'ego', 'ridiculous', 'own', 'alfred', 'indulgent', 'bad', 'sure', 'many', 'great', 'many', 'unable', 'fine', 'foolish', 'unenlightened', 'entertaining', 'few', 'numerous', 'other', 'big', 'little', 'remarkable', 'little', 'biblical', 'symbolic', 'different', 'symbolic', 'important', 'other', 'sure', 'many', 'bad', 'real'];0.1504166666666666

1292;oscar-50;"i don't have enough space here to point out all of the misconceptions about pulp fiction so i'll just give everybody my take on the film and its message. pulp fiction is a truly brilliant film that few people will ever completely understand. pulp fiction covers everything from social satire to morality to just good old fashion movie fun. first of all i would like to explain the bible verse that jules reads (ezekeil 25:17) and how it applies to the story. jules is ""the righteous man"", vincent is ""the selfish"", and marsellus represents ""the tyranny of evil men."" jules is ""beset on all sides"" by this negativity and must find it in himself to overcome it. jules, in the end finds redemption, where vince and marsellus have the vengance of the lord layed upon them for their sins. this is just one layer of a great story. perhaps that's the brilliance of pulp fiction: the various layers that the film can be enjoyed on. pulp fiction is the citizen kane of the 90's....it has changed filmaking like few others. the acting in pulp fiction makes it seem like the actors were just born to play their roles in the movie. uma thurman and samuel l. jackson give a couple of the finest performances in screen history. the social satire and quentin's great direction only fuel the fire. it's just too bad that the subject matter of the film turn people away from pulp fiction, because those people are really restricting themselves. pulp fiction is my all-tie favorite film and i believe that in 10 or 15 years it will go down as the greatest film ever made. 10 out of 10";6 September 1999;10;['enough', 'brilliant', 'few', 'social', 'good', 'old', 'bible', 'righteous', 'evil', 'beset', 'great', 'various', 'few', 'fine', 'social', 'great', 'bad', 'subject', 'favorite', 'great'];0.1656862745098039

(i know movies like crouching tiger, hidden dragon, my big fat greek wedding, and the passion of the christ had everyone talking, but i don't consider those great movies at all) i am truly proud to call this my favorite movie of all time. i hope mr. tarantino keeps his flawless resume flawless, and continues to turn out consistently brilliant work.";2 April 2005;10;['hard', 'unfamiliar', 'shady', 'shady', 'other', 'prior', 'above', 'clean', 'fourteenth', 'great', 'legendary', 'brilliant', 'good', 'perfect', 'ingenious', 'short', 'second', 'good', 'directorial', 'incredible', 'well', 'directorial', 'usual', 'little', 'black', 'medical', 'outside', 'cluttered', 'amazing', 'countless', 'amazing', 'many', 'next', 'big', 'next', 'close', 'pure', 'fresh', 'most', 'many', 'miramax', 'excited', 'whole', 'great', 'big', 'fat', 'greek', 'great', 'proud', 'favorite', 'flawless', 'flawless', 'brilliant'];0.3394345238095238

""pulp fiction,"" is, as the title indicates, purely an exercise in technique and style, albeit a brilliant and layered one. containing numerous references to other films, it is like a great work of abstract art, or ""art about art."" it has all the characteristics we associate with great movies: fine writing, first-rate acting, unforgettable characters, and one of the most well-constructed narratives i've ever seen in a film. but to what end? the self-contained story does not seem to have bearing on anything but itself. the movie becomes a bit easier to understand once you realize that it's essentially a black comedy dressed up as a crime drama. each of the three main story threads begins with a situation that could easily form the subplot of any standard gangster movie. but something always goes wrong, some small unexpected accident that causes the whole situation to come tumbling down, leading the increasingly desperate characters to absurd measures. tarantino's originality stems from his ability to focus on small details and follow them where they lead, even if they move the story away from conventional plot developments. perhaps no screenplay has ever found a better use for digressions. indeed, the whole film seems to consist of digressions. no character ever says anything in a simple, straightforward manner. jules could have simply told yolanda, ""be cool and no one's going to get hurt,"" which is just the type of line you'd find in a generic, run-of-the-mill action flick. instead, he goes off on a tangent about what fonzie is like. tarantino savors every word of his characters, finding a potential wisecrack in every statement and infusing the dialogue with clever pop culture references. but the lines aren't just witty; they are full of intelligent observations about human behavior. think of mia's statement to vincent, ""that's when you know you've found somebody special: when you can just shut the f--- up for a minute and comfortably enjoy the silence.""";21 May 2020;10;['early', 'big', 'other', 'witty', 'entertaining', 'normal', 'regular', 'other', 'comic', 'such', 'final', 'coherent', 'textured', 'much', 'many', 'astonishing', 'many', 'first', 'deep', 'deep', 'brilliant', 'numerous', 'other', 'great', 'abstract', 'great', 'fine', 'first', 'unforgettable', 'easy', 'black', 'main', 'standard', 'wrong', 'small', 'unexpected', 'whole', 'desperate', 'absurd', 'small', 'conventional', 'well', 'whole', 'simple', 'straightforward', 'cool', 'generic', 'tarantino', 'potential', 'clever', 'witty', 'full', 'intelligent', 'human', 'special'];0.1786190476190476
1352;kylerkl;pulp fiction is not another alternative film or a cult classic, but an experience in detecting what truth can be gleaned from each situation in our lives and dispelling all that is not real. it is a quest to find what each of us wants, needs, and desires. character development is covered in multiple layers and each character evolves within the film, making it difficult to capture all of the subtle nuances in one viewing. the defining mark of this film is the use of extremely real characters surrounded by absurd life situations. this is in high contrast to the majority of filmmaking in hollywood, which seeks to place hollow shells in very spectacular or realistic environs. each person met seems like someone you know. their manner, speech, or thoughts never betray them as empty husks contrived to fill space in a film. the use of vignettes is masterful and adds to the importance of each scene and to the scope of each characters life and their interdependence with one another. the film does contain severe violence, copious explicatives, heavy drug themes and an explicit rape scene. a good film to watch with a group of people, leading to discussion afterward. what was in the briefcase?;16 July 2001;8;['alternative', 'real', 'multiple', 'difficult', 'subtle', 'defining', 'real', 'absurd', 'high', 'hollow', 'spectacular', 'realistic', 'empty', 'masterful', 'severe', 'copious', 'heavy', 'explicit', 'good'];0.053611111111111

""tarantino is the director, and by the way, he played there too."" it was very funny they considered knowing that so valuable, to me it was no more than just ""a"" movie then. ""who did he play?"" i asked. when they told me i was shocked: ""what?! that pathetic imbecile in the robe was actually the director?!!!"" how could i know that that imbecile's iq is 160 to my 118, but i didn't know it then and i didn't care. funny, that exact dialogue that made me revere tarantino years later, that dialogue is cut off the most of the copies of the movie, and the cannes saw the cut version too. at least, the script is available for free and anyone can enjoy the full version, which contains even the unfilmed scenes. the main dialogue of the movie is cut. it is where mia is giving vince a third degree. it is here where tarantino speaks himself and for himself (even though everyone in his movies is tarantino, even bacteria in the actors' sweat speak tarantino ""f"" english, still here it is his dream and his dream-girl), it's his fantasy, it's the questions he wanted to answer he actually dreamed of getting beaten up by a girl, he loves amazons, and his other works prove it (jackie brown, kill bill vol.1, death proof, etc.) only strong men like to see strong women by their side. tarantino and roger avary share the best original screenplay oscar, but actually the full script was written by cutie only, the stories were developed together. it was roger avary who developed the hideous rape scene, he said about that like all writers do the characters did that on their own to the author's surprise, because he is a nice person, who would never invent something like that. anyway, it's a movie that arouses a wide variety of interpretation, from seeing the deepest philosophical ""ditch"" in it to the calling it the lowest pop chuck, to me it is a classic tarantino, and that says it all. he loved to see his beautiful child with the people, he would go to the cinema and watch it every time like the first time with them, noticing when they tensed and when they laughed, being tensed and laughing with them, being the happiest guy in the whole wide world then. i really think that he was the happiest guy then, you wouldn't find another like him. well, there is one thing i hate when some very sophisticated and very spiritual specimen start to zoom around about some irony of the movie, the irony of cutie, who is against violence on the screen, and in his movie he is saying: ""people, look at what you are doing, and stop!"", and they say it in such a pompous voice that it makes me almost physically sick. one of them happened to blabber in that way in my company. she had some good ideas too she pointed out it is not the bodies that shock, it is the attitude towards them that does. that is a nice phrase that sums up the reason why his movies seem to be and they are extra-violent. okay, but then she goes again people, look blah-blah-blah. i couldn't stand any longer: i told her about the first script, where vince shot marvin in the throat, and then with tarantino little talk shot him in the head, cuite changed that scene into one shot in the head she was happy and said: ""because it is softer!"", ""no, - i gloated, - he actually said himself that he changed that because the straight shot in the head was funnier"". she almost freaked out. look, you may see anything you want in it, even nostradamus prophecy, but keep in mind, that tarantino is a brilliant guy who loves action, crime and kung-fu movies just for the fun of it, and we love him for that. you may see anything you want in marcellus's case (from marcellus's soul to da vinci manuscripts), but keep in mind that tarantino and avary concealed its contents only because their initial idea seemed too trivial to them diamonds. they say: ""it depends on viewer's mind"", well, of course, it does, but i want to know what it is on your mind, that's why i watch your movie. so, one may see da vinci manuscripts, yet it may be plainly diamonds, but the movie is really epic. (i can't say that it's a must see, i don't like the word ""a must see"", like something forcing you into something) it is more than a fantastically good movie, it is the new testament of cinema new way of speaking in the movies, new way of storytelling, new way of being in the movies, new way of seeing the very movie-making idea.";20 September 2007;10;['new', 'tarantino', 'close', 'attractive', 'next', 'tarantino', 'tarantino', 'tarantino', 'funny', 'valuable', 'more', 'shocked', 'pathetic', 'funny', 'exact', 'tarantino', 'most', 'cut', 'least', 'available', 'free', 'full', 'unfilmed', 'main', 'third', 'tarantino', 'tarantino', 'other', 'strong', 'strong', 'tarantino', 'good', 'original', 'full', 'hideous', 'own', 'nice', 'wide', 'deep', 'philosophical', 'low', 'classic', 'beautiful', 'first', 'happy', 'whole', 'wide', 'happy', 'sophisticated', 'spiritual', 'pompous', 'sick', 'good', 'nice', 'extra', 'violent', 'blah', 'first', 'tarantino', 'little', 'happy', 'soft', 'straight', 'funny', 'brilliant', 'vinci', 'tarantino', 'avary', 'initial', 'trivial', 'vinci', 'epic', 'more', 'good', 'new', 'new', 'new', 'new', 'new'];0.2209723466188983

1384;trevorstunt;"the modern-day movie public seems entranced with the in-your-face barbaric and crude film style of quentin tarantino. the writer-producer-actor definitely has talent, and an imagination. but films such as this that have long-running dialogs - some sensible but mostly far-fetched, need to have a solid plot to be interesting. the plot of ""pulp fiction"" is very weak - almost pointless. and when the long stretches of cinematic street philosophy are punctuated with brutal scenes of blood and guts, i don't find much of anything entertaining. i enjoy great mysteries, including some of the better film noir. but for the gore and guts movies to be good and have appeal, they must at least have an interesting plot and very good screenplay. ""reservoir dogs"" was such a tarantino movie. but this plot has scenarios that bounce around in a weak screenplay. while there's a thin thread that connects some parts, others don't mesh. so, it comes across as a few short stories put together, some of which have the same characters. an example of this is when christopher walken's captain koons tells a tall story to a young boy named butch coolidge. two scenarios or so later, butch is a full-grown boxer played by bruce willis. other scenarios happen out of order, or in reverse order. this seems to be a style with tarantino, and one that some movie critics and buffs think is a great talent. i think it's a technique meant to grab an audience where the writer can't figure out a way to do it with a straight story chronologically. this sort of sets on end the long-standing teaching and methods of storytelling, writing, and playwrighting. and, there are a number of people who still prefer the chronological order of stories. we don't mind the use of flashbacks which are clearly identified as such. but wide changes in time or order, back and forth, from one scenario to another is confusing and says the author couldn't come up with the right ending. so, he or she used some weird techniques to make an ending superfluous. and, some of these films really don't have endings. this film could have started or ended just about anyplace within the screenplay. tarantino or the director just needed to shuffle the pages. it ruins what might be a good story for me. as for the acting in this film - what's so outstanding about characters spewing vulgarities back and forth, or screaming and intimidating people with foul threats in running expletives? seems we all have a tantrum streak within us.

1396;athleticz20022000;"following several interlocked tales of criminals, ""pulp fiction"" is about as well-written, well-acted, and well-directed as any film out there. the first storyline centers around jules and vincent (samuel l. jackson, john travolta), who are sent to retrieve a briefcase for their boss, marsellus wallace (ving rhames). the second story line focuses on vincent taking wallace's wife mia (uma thurman) to dinner, and the final storyline is about wallace bribing a boxer named butch (bruce willis) to take the fall is a boxing match. of course the story is extremely complicated and is not in chronological order, but going through everything that happens would take a while. tarantino won a best screenplay oscar, but the movie should have won many more awards, including best picture, best director, best supporting actor (samuel l. jackson), and best supporting actress (uma thurman). in most years, i would say that john travolta should have won the best actor oscar, but i give the nod to tom hanks in ""forrest gump"". the acting nonetheless is still as good as you will find anywhere. travolta, jackson, thurman, willis, rhames, christopher walken, tim roth, amanda plummer, harvy keitel and eric stoltz are all terrific. the only sub par performance is that of tarantino himself. the style of direction that tarantino uses is one of those ""love it or hate it"" kinds. if you love few different camera shots and long focuses on a character, than you will like tarantino's style of direction. in conclusion, ""pulp fiction"" is the best movie made in the 90's, barely edging out ""the silence of the lambs"" for the crown. i was skeptical of the film at first with its long running time, but after sitting through it, there really is nothing in the film that is not necessary and that should be edited out. this is a film that once you see, you will want to watch over and over again. that is the true sign of a masterpiece.";26 July 2006;10;['several', 'interlocked', 'first', 'storyline', 'second', 'final', 'complicated', 'chronological', 'good', 'many', 'more', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'most', 'good', 'forr', 'good', 'terrific', 'only', 'tarantino', 'tarantino', 'few', 'different', 'good', 'skeptical', 'long', 'necessary', 'true'];0.258
1397;hourglass44;"this movie is the flagship for the smug, self-aware sarcasm that pervaded the 1990s. while it is entertaining in a starkly violent way (observe vincent vega and jules's greater concern for the cleanliness of their car after blowing the head off of their backseat passenger or tarantino's focus on the silly pettiness of vega's argument with keitel's character whilst trying to figure out what to do with a dead body), the film is dripping with gauche vanity and retro references to the point that that becomes the unspoken star of the film. of course, this is typical fare for tarantino, so it should come as no surprise (anyone seen kill bill?). bruce willis's vignette is by far the best. gritty realism (fight fixing, his crummy hotel room and neurotic girlfriend, his car-crash and fight with marsellus wallace) is combined with a clever and thoroughly unsuspected twist (stumbling into a homosexual, s&m rape, horror-scenario). this is where tarantino is at his best; he just becomes a bit misguided when he focuses too much on sarcasm and quirky retro vanity rather than interesting, new storytelling. 7/10 jem";27 August 2005;7;['aware', 'violent', 'great', 'backseat', 'silly', 'dead', 'dripping', 'unspoken', 'typical', 'tarantino', 'good', 'gritty', 'crummy', 'neurotic', 'clever', 'unsuspected', 'tarantino', 'good', 'misguided', 'quirky', 'interesting', 'new'];0.122027972027972
1398;nickykelly-65134;in my opinion, this is the best thing to come from quentin tarantino's mind, and one of the most unique film ever made, although ironically borrowing a lot from other films. the strongest part of the film's story telling isn't that it has a particularly emotional or epic plot, but rather the way in which the film's stories are told. tarantino decides to take the film's story and present it out of chronological order, and although things like this have been done before, no film as done it quite as perfectly as pulp fiction. this non linear structure allows for tarantino to make the film uber-rewatachable and incredibly unpredictable to first time viewers, making the film much more compelling to watch. if tarantino didn't use this structure, the film may have still had great dialogue and great scenes, but it wouldn't be half the film it is now. another great strength of this film is it's script, which has to go down as one of the best film scripts ever written. the dialogue is perhaps the most entertaining part of the enter movie, as the two leads (john travolta & samuel l. jackson) carry their scenes excellently with their back and forth dialogue. tarantino also manages to use this quick and witty dialogue in some of the film's most intense scenes such as when jules and vincent take their boss's briefcase back from brett, and the film's climax scene in the coffee shop. overall, this is masterpiece of non-linear storytelling, dialogue and originality, and this film deserves all the fame and awards that it did receive, and perhaps more.;12 September 2017;10;['good', 'unique', 'other', 'strong', 'emotional', 'epic', 'tarantino', 'chronological', 'non', 'linear', 'unpredictable', 'first', 'compelling', 'great', 'great', 'great', 'good', 'entertaining', 'back', 'quick', 'witty', 'intense', 'such', 'non', 'linear', 'more'];0.3333333333333333

1407;Smartass-Dumbass;"i think one of the problems many people have with this movie is that it defined and set into motion an extremely irritating trend in contemporary film. the god-awful clones of tarantino pouring out of indie and mainstream studios alike should not, however, detract from the brilliance and subtlety of this movie. it works simply because those moments of brilliance (i have to admit i know the whole ""jules redemption-speech"" by heart) that its imitators lack come in the midst of the camp and gore they all do so well. tarantino alone uses an adolescent obsession with shallowness and morbidity to high satirical effect--like all great films (or even novels), this movie sets itself into a two-dimensional genre (absurd, pop-culture, comic-book situations) and then undermines its own genre by exposing the heart and soul underneath. there are too many points in the movie in which this happens to mention, but a few come to mind: the blown kiss from vincent to mia at the end of the first (or maybe second) story; the death of vincent; the obvious emotional dedication of butch to his wife at the end of his own story; vincent's unwillingness to believe in his own supernatural salvation without realizing he's doomed; and, of course, the climactic speech. with the exception of jules's final words, many of these moments seem at first to be horrifying or funny--but this is only because they fit so well into the flow of the script. a second glance shows them to be moments so poignant that the only reason they work is because they are so unique to the characters and their situations. the changes in each (or the lack of change) come, in a sense, as they individually choose to either drive for them or fall behind. most die-hard fans of the movie, i'm sure, have heard the story of the briefcase and the band-aids on the back of wallace's neck (the entire movie being a quest to bring back his stolen soul), and although tarantino has denied it, he can't deny that the movie is full of such heroic themes: escape by trial, the reclamation of past, love as both physical salvation and personal security, a will to believe in something beyond one's own selfish world. i won't say that if you don't like this movie that you're mistaken or ignorant, but i think that tarantino puts his audience into settings much like his characters are in: cheap, full of profanity and nastiness, fleeting. the best of them break through; i think he asks that anyone watching do the same.";27 January 1999;9;['many', 'contemporary', 'awful', 'indie', 'whole', 'adolescent', 'high', 'satirical', 'great', 'dimensional', 'absurd', 'comic', 'own', 'many', 'few', 'first', 'second', 'obvious', 'emotional', 'own', 'own', 'supernatural', 'climactic', 'final', 'many', 'funny', 'second', 'poignant', 'only', 'unique', 'most', 'die', 'hard', 'sure', 'entire', 'full', 'such', 'heroic', 'physical', 'personal', 'own', 'selfish', 'mistaken', 'ignorant', 'cheap', 'full', 'fleeting', 'good', 'same'];0.1835772357723577

1426;aljabman;it's not a film it's a experience. the characters are very memorable the story of nonlinear dialogue and action no the whole movie is fast and fun there's no down time or anything boring the movie is long. there's more then 10 memorable scenes that is referenced in any type of media. i like to think of pulp fiction as resvoir dogs another film by the genius tarrintino as a better version of it. i thought resvoir dogs had the coffe scene at the start and mr white hurting the police officer. i thought the movie was stretched out more then it needed to and the ending gave me such a poor taste in my mouth. i still like it, like i would get a poster or t shirt of resvoir dogs to show my opinion. there did you see that i lost focus that's what pulp fiction does it makes you forget about the world but remember about the experience. the scene where butch reclaims himself in the eyes of walleces is a redemption story in itself about how we can all get together without fighting and being greedy. the part where 2 scenes ( tiny bit of a spoiler but watch pulp fiction now if you haven't) where somehow at point blank range a revolver didn't shoot jules and vincent and somehow vincent shoots one of the guys in the head on accident. thats a message life is like a box of chocolates the things you never expect will happen. another part of the idea is the violence and sex violence plays a big part in this movie these are horrible people that everyone loves when i see this film i feel like it's a lego set controlled by tarrintino everything goes together like cause and effect yet while still being random sex is not that big in the film expect for the epic scene where butch remdeems himself and when butch is making out with his girlfriend but that scene was still great because he had to find his watch holy crap. this movie has dialogue lots of it and that's fantastic he is known for dialogue the tarrintino himself said that dialogue is a major component in his films and it shows, other films have such poopy dialogue where all they do is talk about nothing like get on with it. pulp fiction is the story of 3 as 1 and should be hands down the number 1 film of the millennium .;12 October 2020;10;['memorable', 'nonlinear', 'whole', 'fast', 'down', 'long', 'more', 'memorable', 'well', 'coffe', 'poor', 'resvoir', 'greedy', 'tiny', 'blank', 'vincent', 'big', 'horrible', 'tarrintino', 'random', 'big', 'epic', 'great', 'fantastic', 'major', 'other', 'such'];0.0515972222222222

1430;dwf801;"what is pulp fiction about? on the surface, it is about several unique people and how their lives connect in some way. the cast of characters includes a boxer (bruce willis), two gangsters (john travolta), their boss (ving rhames), and his wife (uma thurman). the whole movie consists of several small stories that all connect to each other. one of them involves the two gangsters trying to get rid of a dead body and clean up the mess they've made. another situation has travolta taking his boss' wife out on a date, her overdosing on cocaine, and him trying to find a way to save her life. there are other story lines that i won't give away because part of the fun is seeing how everything comes together. but the story is not told in chronological order. it jumps back and forth between stories in a way that would normally be confusing, but the brilliant screenplay makes everything flow nice and smooth. if you like to look at movies for their meaning and artistic value, then you could say that pulp fiction is about how people have lost all meaning and value in their lives. instead of having individuality, people define themselves by what they see in pop culture. the movie has endless references to pop culture and it seems that everything in the movie is inspired by some aspect of pop culture. this is not a lack of originality, but a way to show that everything we do is inspired by something or somebody else. a perfect example is when bruce willis' character, butch, is talking to a hispanic cab driver who asks him the meaning of his name. he says, ""this is america, honey, our names don't mean sh*t."" to me, the meaning of pulp fiction is that each moment has its own priorities. something might be important to you at one moment in time, but in another not important at all. one minute you could be racking your brain over what you are going to say in your next facebook status update, and the next you could have a gun in your face. people think they know what is important to them until something else happens that completely changes their priorities. take, for example, the part where butch coolidge sees the man who wants him dead. at one point, they are trying to kill each other, and suddenly one is trying to save the other from getting raped by some psychos in a gun shop. when it is all said and done, they don't even care about why they were fighting in the first place because something bigger and more important is happening. one of the things that makes pulp fiction great is that if you don't want to think too much about the deep, philosophical meaning to it, then you can just enjoy the movie for what it is-a humorous, violent, and stylish portrayal of several characters and their encounters with one another. it has a little something for everyone, and the more times you watch it, the more you begin to understand and appreciate it. the genius of the movie comes out in its dialogue. everything the characters say has meaning or it foreshadows something that is going to happen. for example, when travolta and jackson are talking, travolta says that in france, a quarter pounder with cheese is called a ""royale with cheese."" soon after, when they are about to do a hit on a few college kids, jackson asks one of them about the hamburger he is eating. he then uses the ""royale with cheese"" line on him, which leads to one of the funniest conversations in the history of movies. the academy-award nominated performance by samuel l. jackson creates one of the coolest, funniest, and greatest characters ever. despite how crazy the whole movie is (and how ridiculous his hair is), we never get the feeling that he is acting. he makes us think that he is a real person and truly believes everything he says. it is very exhilarating to watch how he starts off as a mob hit man with little meaning in his life and transforms into a deeper, more self-aware person. pulp fiction is not only the best movie of the '90s, but it is one of the greatest films of all time. whether you like hilarious comedies, violent action thrillers, or a deeply absorbing drama-you can enjoy it. the first time you watch it, don't try and think too much about it; just watch how the plot unfolds and everything comes together. watch the funny conversations between travolta and jackson, the funky dance scene with travolta and thurman, and all of the other moments that make pulp fiction a truly memorable movie. http://franklinreviews.blogspot.com/";13 March 2010;10;['several', 'unique', 'whole', 'several', 'small', 'other', 'dead', 'other', 'chronological', 'confusing', 'brilliant', 'nice', 'smooth', 'artistic', 'endless', 'perfect', 'hispanic', 'own', 'important', 'important', 'next', 'next', 'important', 'dead', 'other', 'other', 'first', 'big', 'important', 'great', 'deep', 'philosophical', 'humorous', 'violent', 'stylish', 'several', 'little', 'more', 'about', 'few', 'cool', 'great', 'crazy', 'whole', 'ridiculous', 'real', 'exhilarating', 'little', 'deep', 'aware', 'good', 'great', 'hilarious', 'violent', 'first', 'funny', 'funky', 'other', 'memorable'];0.17

1436;superstar_carnage;pulp fiction is one for the ages. the 1994 film scripted and directed by quentin tarantino is simply a classic. its witty and unique plot is sadistically humorous, offbeat and just plain and simply cool. the characters are edgy and unconventional put together with offbeat and sometimes pointless dialogue, which is a trait of tarantino's which is thoroughly enjoyable. the film is driven on with an all-star cast with now hollywood a-listers and has a classy soundtrack. the film is featured around 3 stories, which are presented in a non-linear way. the movie has a pre-title sequence featuring a foul-mouthed couple who rob liquor stores sitting in a coffee shop talking about bigger and better places to rob. the first story seen after the opening credits features a brief introduction with two hit men, vincent and jules, picking up a suitcase from their bosses business partners. after retrieving the case the movie cuts to the pair outside their bosses place of business wearing short-shorts and t-shirts referred to later in the movie as looking like they're going to a volleyball game. the audience has little time to speculate as to how they got the clothes as we see the arrival of a new character butch, who has a run-in with vincent. throughout the introduction to the first part, we are told that vincent has been given the duty of taking his bosses wife out and keep her company while he is out of town. the first story features vincent and his boss's wife and the trouble that they get into. the second story is based around butch and marsellus wallace (vincent's boss). we are given some insight to the story in a dialogue seen during the first story between butch and marsellus talking about butch throwing his last fight as a boxer. butch doesn't throw the fight and marsellus is now after him. the story revolves around a gold watch that holds some significance to butch, his girlfriend who forgets to take the watch with her when she leaves the house to go to a motel, now forces butch to go back to get his watch from his house. while on his way back to the motel he runs into marsellus. the final story is a continuation of the part when vincent and jules collect the case and how they got from wearing their suits into the short shorts and t-shirts. the closing part of the movie is back in the coffee shop. this time we see vincent and jules talking, with glimpses of the couple from the start, who unbeknownst to vincent or jules or any of the other customers are about to the hold the place up. pulp fiction propelled tarantino into stardom and the movie itself received its share of grace and disgrace. although considered by some a cinematic masterpiece (myself included), some, despite its brilliant screenplay, see it as a grotesque and vulgar film, because of its over-the-top gore and gritty coarse language and occasional vulgar dialogue topics. pulp fiction is not a movie for everyone. if you enjoy witty dialogue scenes, unconventional characters and an offbeat non-linear plot, then this movie is definitely for you. however, if you find yourself easily offended by strong, vulgar coarse language and disturbing blood and gore scenes stay right away from this film. for me this movie is number one in my book.;27 December 2007;10;['witty', 'unique', 'humorous', 'offbeat', 'plain', 'cool', 'edgy', 'unconventional', 'offbeat', 'pointless', 'enjoyable', 'classy', 'non', 'linear', 'pre', 'title', 'foul', 'mouthed', 'big', 'well', 'first', 'brief', 'short', 'little', 'new', 'first', 'first', 'second', 'first', 'last', 'gold', 'final', 'short', 'other', 'about', 'cinematic', 'brilliant', 'grotesque', 'vulgar', 'gritty', 'coarse', 'occasional', 'vulgar', 'witty', 'unconventional', 'offbeat', 'non', 'linear', 'strong', 'vulgar', 'coarse', 'disturbing'];-0.0110791985791985

1444;Runinrider;"~ spoilers pulp fiction is an anomaly; it's a story of different things, different characters, et cetera. it's a movie based on the life of various people -- whether criminals, boxers, or male-rapists -- who meet their change of life, their fates, within the course of two days. the movie in itself is hard to describe, and i'm sure director/screenplay writer quentin tarantino (reservoir dogs, jackie brown) simply wanted it that way. the movie begins in a small cafe, which gets customers high in numbers and whose wallets contain big bucks. then it shows you two robbers, thieves, who go over why they shouldn't rob a place like this as simply no one believes that coffee shops do get hold up -- and if they do no one will really give too much of a ****. then they take out their guns and open their mouths where finally the theme of ""miserlou"" plays and pulp fiction begins. you then are introduced to two hitmen, vincent vega (john travolta--broken arrow, grease) and jules winfield (samuel l. jackson--shaft, xxx). they go over their plans, visit a commoner and then question him, he apparently got into something with a crimeboss's wife. they ask for the ""666"" coded briefase and then kill him after a faithful reading of the bible by none other then jules himself. after this you'll then see the movie enter a section, which simply brings up a new part to the ongoing story of this movie. and aside from the hitmen you would also get in touch with boxer butch (bruce willis), crimeboss marsellus (ving rhames), and the crimeboss's wife mia (uma thurman). the performances are simply top-notch in here. john travolta gives a powerful interpretation of a hitman who really doesn't care much and doesn't show as much respect for anybody, whether it be his friends or enemies. samuel l. jackson also fits his role as jules by being as badass as possible, though never trying to harm anybody as he is getting tired of this ""killing"" business. bruce willis' performance is also astounding, as he goes into brawls with rhames, kills a hillbilly rapist, and shows his schlong on screen alongside his heartwarming girlfriend. uma thurman's role is also great and harvey keitel (the wolf) and ving rhames bring power and ""bang"" to their performances which make them an even bigger asset to the movie. hell, tarantino himself co-stars. finally, pulp fiction is a must-see. it's not a classic, no godfather or scarface, but it was never intended to be that in the first place. it is simply an innovative piece of action that almost no one should miss out (i still think this movie was robbed of an oscar back in 95 -- tom hanks and his portrayal of forrest gump won the award). *** 1/2";10 November 2002;9;['different', 'different', 'various', 'hard', 'sure', 'small', 'high', 'big', 'much', 'miserlou', 'faithful', 'other', 'new', 'ongoing', 'top', 'powerful', 'much', 'badass', 'possible', 'tired', 'astounding', 'great', 'big', 'first', 'innovative', 'forr'];0.1466522366522366
1445;ass_head;"i have seen this movie many times and i still haven't figured it all out because it is a very complex movie. i could go on and on about hidden plot meanings that i interpreted, but that would take up too much space so i am just going to write about the bigger things. i think the greatest thing about this movie is that in the end it made me feel like i was watching more than one movie. this film is almost 3 hours long and i wasn't bored for one minute, and it didn't even feel like 3 hours to me. i also have to reward quentin for his writing because he doesn't hide anything from his audience, he places them in the character's shoes and has them follow their every step. this is the worst review of a movie i have ever written because there is not much i can say about this movie. it is freakin' awesome because it is such a long, enthralling, and enjoyable ride. other than empty comments on this movie there is not much more i can say other than it is very entertaining, although it is not for everyone. quentin tarantino's movies are very selective with the audience it draws in so if you don't like this movie then you might as well give up on this man because his movies will never be normal. i, for one, love quentin's films because he is great at writing realistic, funny, and cool dialogue. so, of course i recommend this movie to everyone because i think it is great and we should support good filmmakers such as quentin and boost the demand for more ""different"" movies. by the way, the whole non-linear thing works because it is related to the style of the movie: the past meets the present. as for the references to the past we have jules's 70s style afro, the film's older music soundtrack, the jack rabbit slim's restaurant, the outdated audio equipment at mia wallace's house, and various other things. as for the present references we have the wolf's modern style camero, jules and vincent's cell phones, the style of honey-bunny and pumpkin's clothes, the drug dealer's girlfriend and friend's style in the beginning, and various other things. the film looks like it takes place in the past but we can clearly see that it takes place during the present, so it looks like the characters are caught in a time warp. since the film is non-linear then the audience too finds themselves in a time warp. in that way i think that the storytelling has relevance for those who do not believe so. p.s. i have read many reviews on this movie about people commenting on the excessive violence and explicit language in the movie, which are not things to be singled out about this movie. a lot of you know-it-alls out there don't like these kinds of movies because you think that the movie wouldn't sell if the bad language and violence were taken out, which is not true. there are a lot of stupid and unimportant movies out there that a lot of people like because they are traditional and do not make the audience think. just because a director like quentin decides to tell a story in a different way does not automatically make it stupid. different is not stupid. this movie needs violence and the like because that is what gangsters do, and the style of the violence makes the movie interesting and unpredictable. action movies are the ones that strive for violence because that is the plot, and there are many of you who would die without your car jumping off a 10 story building and staying in one piece. i am just sick of people hating movies because they are different because that just means less good movies for me to watch.";16 February 2003;10;['many', 'complex', 'much', 'big', 'great', 'more', 'bored', 'bad', 'much', 'awesome', 'long', 'enthralling', 'enjoyable', 'other', 'empty', 'more', 'other', 'entertaining', 'selective', 'normal', 'great', 'realistic', 'funny', 'cool', 'great', 'good', 'such', 'more', 'different', 'whole', 'non', 'linear', 'old', 'outdated', 'audio', 'various', 'other', 'present', 'modern', 'various', 'other', 'non', 'linear', 'many', 'excessive', 'explicit', 'bad', 'true', 'stupid', 'unimportant', 'traditional', 'different', 'stupid', 'different', 'stupid', 'like', 'interesting', 'unpredictable', 'many', 'sick', 'different', 'good'];0.0761904761904761

1452;moonwio;i have to say that pulp fiction is the best film i've ever seen. quentin tarantino's greatest talent as a filmmaker is his ability to pull career-best performances out of actors, particularly his first two films(this and reservoir dogs). samuel l. jackson is as good as advertised. his bible quote has gone down in history next to robert duvall's napalm speech in apocalypse now and marlon brando's contender speech in on the waterfront as one of the most memorable monologues in film history. travolta, willis, and thurman were all also good, but the film's other great performance comes from harvey keitel. the wolf is so cool that even jules is left in awe. tarantino and roger avary's script is composed of elements of other famous films yet remains original in its conception. the dialogue is profane, but hilarious and sometimes even profound. even with this excellent script, the acting is what makes this film great. other great movies include scarface, the first two godfathers, the original star wars movies(but not the new ones), the usual suspects, taxi driver, and the aforementioned apocalypse now and reservoir dogs.;28 January 2004;10;['good', 'great', 'good', 'first', 'reservoir', 'good', 'advertised', 'napalm', 'memorable', 'good', 'other', 'great', 'cool', 'other', 'famous', 'original', 'profane', 'hilarious', 'profound', 'excellent', 'great', 'other', 'great', 'first', 'original', 'new', 'usual', 'aforementioned', 'reservoir'];0.4039457070707071

1455;jcomins;"it is, all in all, a rather weak, flaccid, and uninspired picture. spoilers herein. it's difficult to discuss pulp fiction's weaknesses without examples. let me preface by making clear which points i am not hingeing this apparently uncommon opinion on: 1. i'm not worried about tarantino's use of pop references; i rather like these--they make directors like t, kevin smith, and ridley scott stand out versus historical flak and cop dramas. 2. i'm not against the unusual time structure. that said, more on this later. 3. i'm not against any of the characters, actions (violence, sexual practices, etc), or decisions made in the film. 4. i'm not against t's use of racial slurs; quentin has very well-known theories on the subject, and that's his business. these are the most common complaints i have heard against pulp fiction. however, the reason(s) i think the movie is weak has more to do with content, plot, pacing, continuity, and development. my first point to consider is that the movie is, as t states in the opening credits, a series of unrelated stories. while each segment has elements that carry over to the next--characters, clothes, props, vehicles--any given segment could have different actors playing different characters and the movie would, in all honesty, not lose much. for example, john travolta has several utterly unrelated roles, spanning the whole movie, that could have been played by anyone, as each of these roles has no relationship to any other. just because it is travolta who tells jules about amsterdam, who shoots marvin, who takes thurman out to dinner, and who is sent to shoot willis, doesn't provide an adequate link between these events. second, several very long scenes are essentially throwaway, added for the sake of chewing up time in a vaguely interesting way. the aforementioned uma thurman sequence is just a way for t to show off his knowledge of drugs and create a little suspense; thurman's character doesn't even figure into the story/stories as a whole, and the mention of her by jules earlier and her brief appearance later are clearly t's means of justifying her presence in the film. also of note is the basement scene, which is so long and so far removed from the semblance of a plot that it is also clearly t showing off his knowledge of bdsm subculture while distracting the audience away from the flimsy profluence of the movie. third, while there is nothing wrong with the characters per se, and i will be the first to admit that they are all a fun, likable bunch, a narrative american movie relies at least a little on character development. aside from butch, not a single character in pulp fiction changes in a meaningful way. ""ah,"" you all shout, ""what about jules? it seems like he changes a great deal,"" you continue. sorry. no. character development means that a character grows, and learns, and becomes better, or worse, or different, or the same but for somewhat different reasons, ad nauseum. it does not mean that a contrived and silly plot point suddenly opens your eyes to the presence of god in your la sleazy-gangster lifestyle. disney tried that in 'the fox and the hound' and it didn't work then, either. lastly, i come to the infamous narrative structure. in a film class i took once, there was an entire chapter in the textbook devoted to travolta's miraculous resurrection. ""wow,"" was the impression the book gave. ""holy moly."" when i subsequently saw pulp fiction, i went to my film professor and said, ""so?"" i still fail to see how this was groundbreaking in 1994, as i now fail to see past the purely gimmick nature of it. i don't believe it enhances the film in any way. it's barely interesting or worth keeping track of, like memento is. ""oh, but it ends where it begins!"" you interject. yes, well so did (not wanting to give the endings away, i will use oblique references) that kurosawa comedy based on john ford's early westerns, as did that relentlessly popular early german expressionist film with a bad rock band named after it, as did that gilliam flick which you saw last week. they did it, too, and no one cared. i don't mean that quite so sarcastically, but there you are. one last point: there is one gimmick in pulp fiction, amongst a freight liner-full that don't work, that does work: the bizarre references to religion. the manner of locomotion of marcellus wallace's soul is clever and weird enough to drive the relevant scenes, as is jules' biblical speech (""for i am the lord!""). i like that, a bit. it adds depth, a millimeter or two, to a very shallow movie. and pulp fiction is indeed a shallow movie. one watches it, turns off the dvd player, and walks away, unchanged. there is no legitimate conflict, or plot, or character development, or anything. sure, it's fine as a pure low-level entertainment flick with a good script, but i could just watch snatch or pitch black, which serve the same purpose and have the same plusses as pf (including atemporal editing) but with some excitement and emotion to boot. or, alternatively, i could watch battleship potemkin or the bicycle thief. a bit more sophisticated, those. on the other hand, if i'm in the mood for a slick la sleazy-gangster film, a slick la sleazy-gangster film by quentin tarantino, i might add, i'd just pop in jackie brown or reservoir dogs, both of which are truly excellent in all respects.";31 March 2005;5;['weak', 'flaccid', 'uninspired', 'difficult', 'clear', 'uncommon', 'worried', 'historical', 'unusual', 'more', 'sexual', 'racial', 'common', 'weak', 'more', 'first', 'unrelated', 'next', 'different', 'different', 'much', 'several', 'unrelated', 'whole', 'other', 'adequate', 'several', 'long', 'throwaway', 'interesting', 'aforementioned', 'little', 'brief', 'long', 'flimsy', 'wrong', 'first', 'fun', 'likable', 'narrative', 'american', 'least', 'little', 'single', 'meaningful', 'great', 'well', 'bad', 'different', 'same', 'different', 'contrived', 'silly', 'la', 'sleazy', 'infamous', 'entire', 'miraculous', 'gimmick', 'interesting', 'worth', 'oblique', 'early', 'popular', 'early', 'german', 'bad', 'last', 'last', 'full', 'bizarre', 'marcellus', 'clever', 'weird', 'relevant', 'biblical', 'shallow', 'shallow', 'unchanged', 'legitimate', 'fine', 'pure', 'low', 'good', 'black', 'same', 'same', 'atemporal', 'sophisticated', 'other', 'slick', 'sleazy', 'slick', 'sleazy', 'reservoir', 'excellent'];0.0493313763861709

""pulp fiction"" is the coolest film i have ever seen. it is exciting, funny and relaxing. i have seen it many times but there is always something new what i have not noticed before. this is a story where all main characters are criminals. they do their jobs just like us, as well as they can. they do not talk with each other about guns, police and crimes. they discuss different topics, from fast food to foot massage. there are no scenes in the film that do not fit there. many viewers think that the scene where butch and marcellus wallace are violently raped by a cop and a salesman, is too extreme. but i think this scene is necessary to understand the entire film. it is shown that people can be very cruel, and it does not depend on whether one is a mafia boss or a policeman. now to my favourite spots. the scene where vincent and jules visit their victims is one of the best in the film history. vincent just goes and stands away from the others who give him frightened looks. jules starts a friendly conversation, talking about hamburgers. after finishing the poor guy's sprite, jules gets to business. he asks unusual questions and presents an extract from the bible which drives the young boys absolutely scared. and finally, when the last guy appears and empties his gun without a single hit, jules and vincent exchange glances and shoot him. this is totally excellent! then we see vincent taking mia out. they arrive at the jackrabbit slim's, vincent is displeased with something, and mia draws a box in the air. genius! later when they sit and have their drinks, vincent says he has to take a leek. mia answers: ""that's a little bit more information than i needed..."" it is amusing to observe how vincent is trying very hard to look cool. his every movement is supposed to express being cool. he looks absolutely ridiculous actually. this illustrate the fact that men try to seem cool to women but usually the ladies do not buy it. the twist scene is also very clever. dancing in front of the public must be a huge surprise to vincent but he dances so well that they win the contest. about the prologue of ""the golden watch"". major coons enters to talk to little butch. the major speaks seriously to show how important his lines are. looking dead serious, he describes how several men carried the watch in their butts and how he eventually put it in his butt. that was really funny. in the end, vincent and jules drop at jimmy's to hide a body vincent has accidentally shot. jimmy is totally furious and explains that there is no sign on his house which says ""dead n...rs stored here"". they call mr. wolf who starts with praising jimmy's coffee and then gives instructions. he finally dresses the boys with jimmy's clothes and says they look like dorks. jules replies to jimmy's laughter: ""your clothes, m...r."" mr. wolf refuses in a very elegant way to give jules and vincent a ride, and ends his show with the line ""call me winston."" i found no weaknesses in the film. dialogue is funny, characters are very colourful, soundtrack cannot be compared to any film, and the actors are brilliant. john travolta and samuel l. jackson make their best appearances ever. harvey keitel and christopher walken make short but memorable roles. bruce willis and uma thurman are also good to watch. ""pulp fiction"" has started a new era in film-making. there are many films inspired by tarantino's work. guy ritchie has achieved the best results in ""lock, stock..."" and ""snatch."" but inspired by tarantino, he has created his own style which is too different to compare with ""pulp fiction"". if you are not a fan of such movies, do not hesitate. if nothing else, then samuel l. jackson's haircut is well worth watching.";17 March 2006;10;['good', 'american', 'brilliant', 'forr', 'cool', 'exciting', 'funny', 'relaxing', 'many', 'new', 'main', 'other', 'different', 'fast', 'many', 'marcellus', 'extreme', 'necessary', 'entire', 'cruel', 'favourite', 'good', 'frightened', 'friendly', 'poor', 'unusual', 'young', 'scared', 'last', 'single', 'excellent', 'little', 'more', 'amusing', 'vincent', 'cool', 'cool', 'ridiculous', 'cool', 'clever', 'huge', 'golden', 'major', 'little', 'important', 'serious', 'several', 'funny', 'furious', 'dead', 'elegant', 'funny', 'colourful', 'brilliant', 'good', 'short', 'memorable', 'good', 'new', 'many', 'good', 'own', 'different', 'such', 'worth'];0.2309011672850958
1463;salvador-97;"what can i say about pulp fiction that hasn't already been said before? that it is arguably one of the best movies ever made and that after twenty years since its release remains a dazzling and original piece of brilliant filmmaking? well, of course i could say all that, but i still wouldn't be making this magnificent movie justice. there's the amazing screenplay, exploding with pop culture references, and whose merits raise far above its plot and are really more related to the brilliant character development and the awesome mix of comedy and tragic that are so beautifully brought to life by the awesome cast. and then of course there's everything else, the amazing direction, the superb editing and the even more superb soundtrack. tarantino has this ability to select an handful of songs that, far more than just cool and nice sounding (ala ""goodfelas"" or ""boogie nights"", for instance) manage to give meaning to the scenes in which they are played. and that's just one of the million things that makes this movie so special and above all with such an high rewatchability value. and among those things there's also of course the unlikelihood of everything we see happening on screen and the unfolding of events that makes glued to the screen even after dozens of views... summing up my thoughts, pulp fiction is a groundbreaking achievement in filmmaking that still manages to dazzle and surprise audiences after 20 years of its release. it's not just one of my favorite movies, it's also the movie that made me look at films from a different point of view, almost ""forcing"" me to love them as much as i love books. please, if you haven't watched it yet, do yourself a favor and go watch it. but get ready, cus' it's gonna be a bumpy ride!";3 March 2015;10;['good', 'dazzling', 'original', 'brilliant', 'magnificent', 'amazing', 'related', 'brilliant', 'awesome', 'awesome', 'amazing', 'more', 'tarantino', 'more', 'cool', 'nice', 'special', 'high', 'groundbreaking', 'favorite', 'different', 'ready', 'cus', 'bumpy'];0.5496071428571428

1465;Eckleburg;"pulp fiction is one of the first movies that struck me as truly special. there was nothing that bore much resemblance to it upon first viewing and still nothing to this day that brings forth the same character and swag that tarantino & his crew managed to pull off here. what is more impressive is that the story is quite generic; what makes the movie such an enjoyable watch are the performances and the dialogue. this is an ode to tarantino films in general as i went on to discover by watching more of his works later on. even still, it should be said that the cast and screenplay drive this one home like few others do. another feat that makes pulp fiction stand out would be tarantino's keen ear for music that fits so well with his screenplays. whenever i hear ""misiriou"" or ""girl, you'll be a woman soon"", i have the opening credits or uma thurman dancing in my mind's eye. the same can be said for ""son of a preacher man"" & others. it's truly an experience that stays with you. quite simply put: it's a classic. pulp fiction captures a feeling more than it does a compelling story through the creative lenses of tarantino and a cast that just gelled together so well. it's as good as a royale with cheese sounds.";24 March 2018;10;['first', 'special', 'much', 'same', 'impressive', 'generic', 'enjoyable', 'tarantino', 'general', 'more', 'few', 'keen', 'same', 'preacher', 'more', 'compelling', 'creative', 'good'];0.3183673469387754
1466;leobrodin;"i just watched this for the first time. it's just extremely pointless and plotless, except for 30 minutes. it does not build up to any big finale in any way, it just exists. it's like a diary, simple documentation of what happens with no existing reason. it has four different plotlines in it, wowen together by including some of the same characters. each could be a tv episode of some show. these plotlines would be equally ""good"" if they had completely different characters. one of them might be worth seeing. the other ones are diaries. tarantino plays around with chronology ... so what? it made it neither better, nor worse. just pointless. it has an extreme amount of swearing -most sentences, literally- and violence. not necessarily a bad thing but definitely not a good one by default either. just tedious in this case. if the violence was exciting like some shootout this movie could have been worth seeing as braindead action. however it is almost only executions with no drama. bruce willis character butch has a decent plotline and was a bit exciting as it wasn't obvious how everything was going to end. with some improvement it could be a decent short movie on its own. with a lot of improvement perhaps a decent longer movie. there is one more scene where a character has a moral decision to make that might be worth seeing. there is no point in seeing the remaining 100 minutes. this is not the worst movie i have ever seen. it is nothing like the room, for example. as it is currently the 8th highest rated movie on imdb it is however by far the most overrated one that i have ever seen. i would give it two or three stars for the butch storyline if i didn't feel like the average has to be lowered as much as possible due to the current absurd 8.9. one last thing: the hit man that john travolta plays is sometimes just more of a braindead a**hole (the only word i can come up with to describe) than what is possible. everything in this review is of course opinions but i almost dare say most of it is opinions that are common sense.";29 July 2019;1;['first', 'pointless', 'big', 'simple', 'different', 'same', 'good', 'different', 'worth', 'other', 'tarantino', 'well', 'bad', 'pointless', 'extreme', 'bad', 'good', 'tedious', 'exciting', 'worth', 'decent', 'exciting', 'obvious', 'decent', 'short', 'own', 'decent', 'long', 'more', 'moral', 'worth', 'bad', 'high', 'overrated', 'possible', 'current', 'absurd', 'last', 'hit', 'more', 'only', 'possible', 'most', 'common'];0.04275

1486;afaix;"normally, i wouldn't bother to contribute my thoughts on a movie made back in '94, but i'm doing so for two reasons: 1.) it is my favorite movie of all time (and like everyone that uses this database, i've seen quite a few) 2.) i just watched it again last night (on dvd for the first time), which motivated me to go to imdb and read the reviews. i was aghast to read some of the negative comments that this movie inspired in many contributors. the following is more for the naysayers than anyone else. for those that championed the opinion that it glamorized drug use and violence: well, this is an age-old argument that's been pretty much exhausted. summed up in the question: ""does art reflect reality or does reality reflect art?"", i believe that it's a two-way street, and pulp fiction, evil intentions or no, rides right down the middle. it's a glimpse of a world that i dare say is alien to most of us, so who are you to question it's authenticity in regards to its use of drugs, violence, language, and a lax attitude towards them all. for those that complained about the pointless dialog that did nothing to promote the plot: have you never heard of character development? a lot of the things that have been dismissed as pointless and wasteful can be attributed to educating the audience of the character's thoughts and attitudes. the ""pointless"" conversation between jules and vincent about cheeseburgers illustrates that not only is vincent a traveler (and drug user), but that the two have a good working relationship, share similar interests, and genuinely like each other. the ""pointless"" dialog between butch and fabienne regarding potbellies is an insight to their relationship. that exchange yes is silly and contributes nothing to the plot itself, but those are the kinds of pointless conversations that are often shared between a couple. it's almost a milepost as to the seriousness of their relationship that they can enjoy such a trivial exchange. and plot? well, as it's been stated many times: its redemption, stupid. not only for jules, but for butch as well. anyone who doesn't see that doesn't really deserve to have their opinions read let alone considered with any modicum of seriousness. regarding the non-linear editing: is there a real problem with that? did it really confuse people all that much? were you still trying to mentally arrange the scene sequence ten minutes after the credits ran, or like most of the people i saw it with, figured out the jumps rather quickly and enjoyed the diversion? did tarantino do it simply for the sake of doing it in an effort to be hip and cool? i think not. i do believe it was done in order to have the film end on a high note. the alternative, if he had stuck to a linear formula, would have been fabienne and butch riding off on zed's chopper, and that would have been a bit disappointing. acting: what's not to like? have you seen any of travolta's movies prior to this? utter trash. with this one performance, he erased dozens of regurgitated, forgetful roles of leading men in mass-produced romantic comedies and dramas. samuel l. jackson's performance was simply unparalleled. bruce willis, who is normally unimpressive, blew me away with his performance. the scene in the hotel room when he goes nuts after not being able to find his watch was just a joy to watch. seeing him seething mad at his mate's packing incompetence, and his fighting back that emotion and trying to reflect the blame back on himself...well, just the facial expressions were priceless. direction? are you serious? the needle-through-the-chest scene is perhaps the best directed sequence i've ever had the pleasure to watch. you were in that living room with them. you felt the frenzy, you could smell the sweat and the bong water, and you were just as on-edge as vincent when you realized the potentially bad things that could result from the incident. that intensity could not have been duplicated by anyone of mediocre or non-existent directing talent. the choreography was in a word, perfect. and as far as hype, is concerned, how could such a gem of cinematography not be hyped? in my own defense, i saw this movie the day it was released (and many times since), only days after first watching reservoir dogs. basically, i knew little of tarantino, but i knew that dogs was among the best movies i'd seen in a long time. although i had seen and enjoyed natural born killers and true romance prior to pf, i was at the time unaware that their origins were with tarantino. pulp fiction deserves all of the hype and all of the praise that it spawned. if you haven't seen it yet, what in god's name are you waiting for? if you saw it and didn't like it, what in god's name is wrong with you? what part of the formula for a good movie is missing in pulp fiction? kudos to those who have praised it, and thank you quentin for upping the ante of quality movie making. my apologies for the length.";31 January 2000;10;['favorite', 'few', 'last', 'first', 'aghast', 'negative', 'many', 'more', 'old', 'exhausted', 'evil', 'alien', 'most', 'lax', 'pointless', 'pointless', 'wasteful', 'pointless', 'vincent', 'good', 'similar', 'other', 'pointless', 'silly', 'pointless', 'trivial', 'many', 'stupid', 'non', 'linear', 'real', 'much', 'most', 'cool', 'high', 'linear', 'fabienne', 'disappointing', 'utter', 'forgetful', 'romantic', 'unparalleled', 'unimpressive', 'nuts', 'able', 'mad', 'facial', 'priceless', 'serious', 'bad', 'mediocre', 'non', 'existent', 'perfect', 'own', 'many', 'reservoir', 'little', 'tarantino', 'good', 'long', 'natural', 'true', 'unaware', 'wrong', 'good'];0.0201870748299319

1524;sephev;"until recently, i was one of the few people on earth who had not seen this film. however, a couple of days ago, i finally ordered the tarantino box-set and sat down to watch pulp fiction. the phrase ""blown away"" is thrown around a lot regarding a variety of things, but i can honestly say that i am not exaggerating in the slightest. there are so many fantastic things about this film, but i think one of the film's best assets is tarantino's magnificently woven screenplay. halfway through the film, i was wondering how tarantino could possibly link all of the stories together to make some sort of sense, and then he managed to spectacularly. the characters and moments he has created in this film will be remembered for years to come. he simply breathes life into all of his characters, giving them their own personalities and showing a three dimensional side to every single person in the film, even the more minor characters like zed and fabienne. vincent's slightly dorky, disorganised gangster was brilliant to watch, especially when he is looking after mia; keitel's ""wolf"" was seedy and yet classy at the same time; butch's sentimental motives were humorous given that he had just killed a man for his own selfish gain; christopher walken's short scene as captain kooks made me laugh out loud. even character like the gimp were interesting enough to leave you thinking about them for time afterwards. credit must, of course, be given to the performances of every single actor and actress in the film. there was not a single performance that was slightly out of place or off key to the world around them. every line was delivered with perfect timing, and it made tarantino's already great screenplay even better. my personal favourite was samuel l. jackson's portrayal of jules, although i don't think that's a very original choice on my part. the cinematography in this film is equally memorable, too. there was not a single shot, just like the performances of the actors & actresses, that was out of place or drew away from the experience of the film. the long, uninterrupted shot of jules and vincent walking along the corridor talking about mia's foot massage before the infamous burger sequence was one of my favourites. to top it all off, the soundtrack is pure genius i can't help but feel like a bad-ass whenever i hear misirlou by dick dale or surf rider by the lively ones after watching this film. handpicked by tarantino himself, i hear. an interesting point about this film is the fact that it has no clear moral story or message. this, i think, is one of the reasons that i, and many people, enjoyed it so much, because it is not trying to be something that it is not. it is pure enjoyment, and the text at the very beginning makes it clear that the phrase ""pulp fiction"" means, essentially, ""trash story"". the mystery surrounding the briefcase is most likely tarantino's way of letting the viewer decide what is in the case themselves, making for some very interesting speculation. despite being very funny and very enjoyable, pulp fiction still has its dark, less enjoyable moments, one of the most memorable involving marsellus, zed and a basement (need i say any more?). however, tarantino still manages to make these dark moments funny and enjoyable, and certainly manages to make them memorable. for a very controversial film about the criminal underworld in los angeles, this film is surprisingly timeless. i can genuinely imagine people still watching it for many, many years to come, and for them to enjoy it as much as the original audiences did, and as much as i did. pulp fiction is fully deserving of all the awards and popularity surrounding it, and manages to make the same impact on new audiences nowadays as it did to the original audiences nearly 20 years ago. quentin tarantino has truly made something special a classic, you might say. it will go down in my opinion, and many others i am sure, of one of the best films of all time. one of the only flaws about it is that i doubt whether tarantino will ever be able to top it...";26 June 2013;10;['few', 'slight', 'many', 'fantastic', 'good', 'woven', 'tarantino', 'own', 'dimensional', 'single', 'minor', 'dorky', 'disorganised', 'brilliant', 'seedy', 'classy', 'same', 'sentimental', 'humorous', 'own', 'selfish', 'short', 'interesting', 'single', 'single', 'perfect', 'great', 'personal', 'original', 'memorable', 'single', 'long', 'uninterrupted', 'infamous', 'pure', 'bad', 'misirlou', 'lively', 'interesting', 'clear', 'moral', 'many', 'pure', 'very', 'clear', 'likely', 'interesting', 'funny', 'enjoyable', 'dark', 'enjoyable', 'memorable', 'more', 'dark', 'funny', 'enjoyable', 'memorable', 'controversial', 'criminal', 'timeless', 'many', 'many', 'original', 'deserving', 'same', 'new', 'original', 'special', 'many', 'sure', 'good', 'only', 'tarantino', 'able'];0.2432491582491582

1527;diannndra;many say this movie is overrated, many hate this movie very much, and many walk out of cinema before it's even finished. but, like it or not, pulp fiction opens the door for other movies that contains one or more of its formulas to either be enjoyable, or have higher rating, or be looked cool, or even be popular. those formulas are: (i cannot mention all of them) 1) short stories plots. pulp fiction is just like a book that contains short stories where each has their own plot. all the stories are connected one to another by the similarity of characters and incidents. there are stories of a couple who wanted to rob a restaurant, a gangster's wife and a hit-man's trip, two hit men's silly experience, and a runaway boxer hunted by gangster. they all happens around the gangster's environment. the time line of those stories doesn't have to be time wise, which means the story that happens first doesn't have to be the first to be told. maybe pulp fiction is not the first movie, but later, many movie uses this kind of plot and become successful. there are amores perros, babel, antares, sin city, kill bill, intermission, the dead girl, berbagi suami, and many others with their own variation. later, one of the variations called 'post-modern plot'. maybe they don't have any intention to use the same formula or they doesn't even inspired by pulp fiction, for example, chungking express launched a little bit sooner than pulp fiction. but, it is pulp fiction who opens the door for them, it makes easier for others to be enjoyable. 2)many stories with different point of view. in each of its stories, pulp fiction has a point of view of the third person (audience) that follows the main character. this kind of formula was already popular in the novel, long time before pulp fiction, jeffrey archer and even sydney sheldon wrote this kind of point of view. after pulp fiction, many popular movies use the same formula successfully, like the hours, crash, 21 grams, syriana, traffic, and many others including those're mentioned before. again, pulp fiction just opens the door. 3)satire to violence. pulp fiction is a satire to violence. quentin tarantino has always been making satire to violence movies, even sooner when he wrote true romance a year before. he always makes violence look funny in a dark way, to some people who can enjoy it. after pulp fiction, there are movies like lock, stock, and 2 smoking barrels, snatch, cidade de seus, brick, shawn of the dead, desperado, etc. 4)independent spirit. it is true that stanley kubrick has made indie movie long long time before pulp fiction. but, independent movies have never looked that cool before pulp fiction, and later, all the kubrick's are looked even cooler than before. i love pulp fiction. even it might not be my number 1 movie, but i have a great great respect and appreciation for it.;10 January 2007;10;['many', 'many', 'many', 'other', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'high', 'cool', 'popular', 'short', 'short', 'own', 'silly', 'runaway', 'wise', 'first', 'first', 'many', 'successful', 'dead', 'many', 'own', 'post', 'modern', 'same', 'little', 'easy', 'enjoyable', 'different', 'third', 'main', 'popular', 'long', 'many', 'popular', 'same', 'many', 'true', 'funny', 'dark', 'seus', 'dead', 'true', 'indie', 'long', 'long', 'independent', 'cool', 'cool', 'great', 'great'];0.2707812499999999

1529;hillfingerh;un predictable amazing film. that is the only word to express this whole movie. it is almost impossible to predict every scene that is shown. for example when trabolta (not sure with his name's spelling) carries uma who was dying and goes to the guy who sold the drug, multitude of people would think that uma would die and trabolta falls in peril with the boss but guess what? they success saving uma. and did uma told the boss whole this? nope, she kept her mouth shut. did this scene affect the story? not at all, everything is solved and actually this scene is not the final scene of the movie. it was just the part of beginning. but the most fascinating part is that in this movie the big story are pretty predictable but the little small story's elements are totally unpredictable. how is this possible? 'cause it is tarantino's film! no respect for girls violence no respect for view's visual, he just make it the way he want to and that is the power that most of the directors can't have, that's the power of the bravery. you better watch this awesome film as fast as possible!!;15 May 2013;10;['predictable', 'amazing', 'only', 'whole', 'impossible', 'sure', 'final', 'fascinating', 'big', 'predictable', 'little', 'small', 'unpredictable', 'possible', 'visual', 'most', 'awesome', 'possible'];0.1016203703703703
1530;theplanetsmasher1;"*spoilers lie herin* pulp fiction is a strait up great movie. the dialogue is witty, the acting fits with the rolls very well, and the connection is genius. pulp fiction has about 4 stories that all intertwine into one tale. the following is a very vague summary of the events in pulp fiction. the first centers on two hit men of marcellus wallace going to a drug dealers apartment to take care of some business. it ends as vinvent vega and jules winfield (the two mob hit men played by travolta and jackson) shoot the s*it out of one of the men. it then goes right into another story after a short ""interlude"" type thing. this time, vega has to take mia wallace (marcellus wallace's wife played by uma thurman) out to dinner. after dinner and winning a twist contest, mia overdoses which evolves into another substory where they must get adrenaline to her before she dies. the following story is called the gold watch. this is where one of wallace's men who is a boxer is paid to throw in a fight. he, however wins and is on the run from marcellus when he runs into him. this then goes into another subplot where marcellus and butch have been taken in by a s&m store owner and marcellus is raped while butch escapes only to later come down and save marcellus. the next story is called the bonnie situation where we are back with vincent and jules and as they take one of the drug dealers in their car and he is accidentally shot in the face by vincent. this evolves into the story of how they have to clean up the car and dispose of the body before they get caught. after this they go to a diner where a holdup (the beginning we see in the start of the movie)takes place. this description was very vague and left a lot out but it is hard to fit everything into one paragraph. anyway, what makes this movie great is the non-linear storytelling combined with the round-about way that the characters are indirectly characterized. many argue that the ""hip"" conversations do nothing to further their personality, but they fail to see how it actually does. vincent and jules' conversation in the beginning about the ""royale with cheese"" seems pointless. but it shows how desensitized to the violent acts they commit. they don't really care at all. there are other examples however i am too lazy to write them all. the movie is reasonably mature in it's content. upwards of 300 f*cks are used and many sexually implied. there is a lot of sexual content where they talk about oral sex and other things. the violence is not that bad. not what you see anyway. someone gets shot in the face and all we see is the blood spatter in the rear window and the blood/brain all over jules and vincent. don't let that, however, turn you off. it is a very good movie that should not be missed. final grade: 9.5/10";25 June 2004;10;['great', 'witty', 'vague', 'first', 'marcellus', 'vinvent', 'short', 'next', 'vague', 'hard', 'great', 'non', 'linear', 'about', 'many', 'pointless', 'violent', 'other', 'lazy', 'mature', 'many', 'sexual', 'oral', 'other', 'bad', 'rear', 'good', 'final'];0.0527777777777777

1540;preston-luther;"perhaps no other director places the entertainment value over essentially everything else than the quirky quentin tarantino. as long as people laugh, smile, and share in a cinematically glorious viewing experience of idiosyncratic dialogue, wacky story lines, who honestly can find it within themselves to give a hollerin' hoot about anything else? after his directorial debut of ""reservoir dogs"", tarantino proved he possesses the talent to craft a screenplay and ultimately a film. though a daring debut, ""reservoir dogs"" left out a majority of its action and subsequently more for the viewer to desire. with ""pulp fiction"", tarantino delivers not only his best ever film, but a milestone in the delicate dexterity of original storytelling. in this film we see three interweaving stories involving hit men, a bank-robbing couple, a rogue boxer, and a near-fatal blind date. the two hit men, jules winnfield and vincent vega, played by samuel l. jackson and john travolta respectively, provide the two most outstanding performances. samuel l. jackson dominates the screen with his thunderous voice and unwavering demeanor in his portrayal of a ""cool- cat"" gangster. his partner in crime, john travolta, also provides an intriguing and convincing performance that most assuredly rescued his career from the d-list depths of the ""look who's talking"" series. like ""reservoir dogs"", dialogue stands as the driving force behind the plot and characters of ""pulp fiction"". and not one line in the script lacks tarantino's stamp of wit and cleverness. characters speak fluently in wise-crack and tough guy throughout the plot, much like the cold-hearted noir heroes of the 40s such as sam spade and philip marlowe (both played by the late humphrey bogart). in one particular scene of retribution, the big man marsellus wallace, played by ving rhames, having endured the sexually unthinkable, promises to ""go to work on the homes with a pair of pliers and a blow torch [] i'ma get medieval on you're a**."" goodness knows what ""medieval"" may imply, but safe to say the guy's got a bit of pain lying in his future. bruce willis, who plays the down and out boxer, fails to throw a fight and thus suffers the pursuit of marsellus and his gangsters. eventually marsellus and willis wind up in a truly bizarre scene of mouth gags and homosexual perversion. somehow willis manages to find a way to escape the dastardly situation and get marsellus off his back all at once. wacky and uncanny? indeed, but like the rest of the film, tarantino tells it with such fun and enthusiasm that one can feel the entertainment buzzing like a jet engine. most of the dialogue stands in stark contrast to the majority of hollywood writing which functions simply to further along the plot. characters continually engage each other with conversations in which we might find ourselves conversing, making it all the more convincing. tarantino's dialogue reveals character and dimension. it does not offer standard, thin lines that reveal only what the audience already knows. this works to provide the feeling that we eavesdrop on the characters as they chit chat about miscellaneous topics such as the nomenclature of hamburgers, the sexual implications of foot massages, piercings, etc. though the dialogue may at first glance appear obscure and irrelevant, it obliquely implies events to come later in the unfolding of the plot. for instance, the talk of fast-food cheeseburgers does not stop in vincent's car; rather we see the hamburgers return in the next scene as jules and vincent interrupt the uneasy brett and gang as they dine on big kahuna burgers. we don't simply hear the dialogue, but we see a clever reprisal of the dialogue. it functions to the lay the comical and violence-tempering groundwork for future scenes. the unusual discussion between jules and vincent about what exactly a foot massage signifies between a man and a woman most notably lays the groundwork for the tension throughout the long sequence between vincent and mia wallace, played by uma thurman. before their blind date, we learn that marsellus wallace threw a man off a balcony for merely giving his wife a foot massage. so if marsellus wallace nearly kills a man for touching his wife's feet, imagine what he would do if someone happened to accidentally, oh i don't know, kill his wife. thus the problem vincent faces on his date-gone awry with mia wallace. marsellus just might go ""medieval"" again. vincent knows this but most importantly the audience knows this. tarantino cleverly crafts his dialogue to heighten the tension and anxiety of the scene, keeping our attention like a light trap and a fly. by the end, which i shan't ruin for it serves better to hear and watch than read, the film comes back around in full circle, ending where it started. the events in ""pulp fiction"" arrive jumbled and for the most part out of order, which undoubtedly helped inspire the increased number of non-linear narratives that pervade throughout hollywood today. the different plot lines of ""pulp fiction"" connect in some way, but each possesses a life of its own and can thrive individually. because of this no better title could serve the film quite like ""pulp fiction"" does. the dictionary describes the phrase""pulp fiction"" as ""fiction dealing with lurid or sensational subjects."" tarantino delivers sensation and he does so with smart dialogue, exuberant direction, and an array of actors that perform with just the right mixture of tough-guy wit and comedy.";14 March 2013;10;['other', 'quirky', 'glorious', 'idiosyncratic', 'wacky', 'directorial', 'reservoir', 'daring', 'reservoir', 'more', 'tarantino', 'good', 'ever', 'delicate', 'original', 'interweaving', 'rogue', 'fatal', 'blind', 'outstanding', 'thunderous', 'intriguing', 'convincing', 'reservoir', 'wise', 'tough', 'cold', 'hearted', 'such', 'particular', 'big', 'unthinkable', 'blow', 'medieval', 'medieval', 'safe', 'down', 'bizarre', 'homosexual', 'dastardly', 'wacky', 'uncanny', 'such', 'most', 'stark', 'other', 'convincing', 'thin', 'miscellaneous', 'such', 'sexual', 'first', 'obscure', 'irrelevant', 'fast', 'next', 'uneasy', 'big', 'clever', 'comical', 'future', 'unusual', 'long', 'blind', 'awry', 'medieval', 'tarantino', 'light', 'full', 'jumbled', 'most', 'non', 'linear', 'different', 'own', 'well', 'sensational', 'tarantino', 'smart', 'exuberant', 'right', 'tough'];0.1341049382716049
1541;Theodor-turner;pulp fiction is, overall, a poorly written and poorly directed movie. what shines though is the acting, which carries the entire film. the plot is confused and riddled with continuity errors. events do not occur in chronological order, but in 'chapters,' and the story is too far-fetched and too violent for the experience to be enjoyable. with the exception of joules (samuel l jackson), every character is completely one-dimensional. coupled with the fact that there is zero character development, this film gets very repetitive. pulp fiction starts off abysmally, an levels to at best mediocre by the end. the good in the movie is samuel l jackson and bruce willis in their roles (though tarantino's cameo appearance is laughable as always). luckily, unlike all other tarantino movies, no one suddenly does something completely out of character. this allows the film to just about carry itself, but it certainly does not justify the 9 and 10-star reviews pulp fiction has received. as usual, tarantino's 'visionary' work is nothing more than a crass, overly violent flop.;3 July 2013;4;['entire', 'confused', 'chronological', 'fetched', 'violent', 'enjoyable', 'dimensional', 'repetitive', 'good', 'laughable', 'other', 'tarantino', 'usual', 'more', 'violent'];-0.11875

1572;devonreed;"i was reading some of these posts and decided to put in my two cents worth on the pulp debate. someone stated that they had just seen the movie (in 1999, five years after its release) and could not understand the hype. well, therein lies the greatest problem facing a film like pulp fiction: everything novel and unique it brought to the cinema five years ago has been utterly ransacked by the hollywood mainstream. anyone who saw a film like bonnie & clyde 30 years ago will say what an impact the film made on them, when today it seems only like a well constructed gangster film. pulp fiction already seems a little dated because we keep seeing these characters and situations appearing on film. sure some of what tarantino did had been done before. we'd seen rampant drug use in drugstore cowboy, and gangster black comedy in goodfellas, but tarantino successfully mixed the dark subject matter with hipness for the nineties, and thusly created the film, and the film revolution that true film lovers had been waiting years for. pulp fiction trampled the hollywood blockbuster industry (remember this was the year of forrest gump) and sent studios running to sundance to find the next big thing. people who look at pulp fiction years after its release are going to have the same reaction one would have after listening to, say, nirvana's nevermind: ""it's good, but i don't get the fuss."" of course you don't. you have to be there from the beginning to realize just how much of an impact these artists had on everything we see and hear today. people who call pulp fiction the greatest film of all time are probably in need of an introduction to a few more films. pulp fiction is not the greatest film ever made. it is however, the most important film of our generation.";3 June 1999;10;['worth', 'great', 'novel', 'little', 'tarantino', 'rampant', 'black', 'dark', 'subject', 'true', 'forr', 'next', 'big', 'same', 'good', 'much', 'great', 'few', 'more', 'great', 'important'];0.2361979166666666

a cactus to a beautiful sunflower !metaphors do come handy at times!!after watching this movie my taste,my ideas,my interests for watching movies completely changed!!!this movie actually taught me a lesson as to how to approach a movie-to never to always look at the style or pace in the screenplay,but to look at something beyond these petty things,something i thought had no value-dialogues ..this movie was known to be a genre bending movie of all times!yes ,it surely is!i would also accept the fact that,this is the first black comedy i have watched.the first movie i had seen, where the violence is seen from a different aspect.you will never find the violence morose, unbearable or sadistic to watch as in the director's previous movie reservoir dogs ,but you might find it surprisingly entertaining. this non linear crime drama directed by quentin tarantiono(enemy then, guru now),has bagged names like postmodern film and neo noir film as its narrative structure is completely opposite to a normal straight forward narration and the characters are anti heroic characters in the film.if you are looking at the plot of the movie-there is no definite plot.that is why it has been haled as a masterpiece which defines nothing at all.the story as such is 4 intertwined tales of violence and redemption of 2 hit-man(travolta,jackson), a boxer(bruce willis) and a gangster's wife(uma thurman).this movie surprisingly won the oscar only for screenplay(tarantino and roger avary)!! what annoyed me was the fact that jackson as the hit-man named ""jules"" did not win for his superlative performance.he deserved it more for his ezeikel 25:17 dialogue's explanation at the end in his redemptive mood.....all the other actors like john travolta,uma thurman,ving rhames and bruce willis have done a commendable job.the highlight of this movie is the non linear narration of the story and tarantino's usual style-unpredictability!another aspect about this movie is the pleasant and eclectic background music fusing the violence to the entertaining mood of the film. i would like to conclude by saying that please don't assess a movie like i did without really understanding it-its sheer cockiness.i would highly recommend this movie for lovers of black comedies and the rest the world because it does not make you think,but will keep you glued to this movie as long as you follow the dialogues. lastly please don't expect to learn everything about this movie as such from this review as i will only tell you what i felt.i only will give you the wood and would ask you to enjoy the pleasure of rubbing the wood hard and lighting fire yourself,by watching the movie yourself.!!

1635;willie_j_rudd;quentin tarantino's second film contains a confusing storyline, lack of in-depth plot, no obvious message, and a seemingly never ending amount of dialogue.....and it works. pulp fiction is a masterpiece of contemporary film that has been applauded by critics and fans alike. the films non-linear storyline contains the stories of a couple who robs diners, two hit men who do a job for their crime boss, and a boxer past his prime who is asked to take a dive. the cast does a fantastic acting job that varies from bruce willis' street smart butch to uma thurman's mia who has a taste for nose candy. the two actors who shine in the movie is the duo of john travolta and samuel l. jackson. travolta's character goes through a variety of emotions throughout the film such as his laid-back side while riding in the car with jackson, to the intensity in his face while saving uma thurman's character from an overdose. jackson's character has a ferocity to him that makes the character very memorable. the camera work by tarantino is wonderfully done with shots that include his trademark trunk shot and mexican standoff. also, there is a well put together soundtrack to the film. the masterful film making and acting in pulp fiction makes it my favorite film of all time.;15 February 2010;10;['second', 'confusing', 'obvious', 'contemporary', 'non', 'linear', 'fantastic', 'smart', 'such', 'memorable', 'masterful', 'favorite'];0.2480952380952381

1643;famfrit;"now, what can i say about ""pulp fiction""? you've all heard of it and may be wondering what all the hype is about. i won't delve into all the details in this review so the best i can do (without spoiling the movie) is to just explain some of the things that were great about it. a noticeable quality about ""pulp fiction"" that really struck me (and part of what made it so great)was the dialogue. the dialogue dwells on seemingly pointless subjects, such as what a quarter pounder with cheese is called in france, yet is so encapsulating. 80% of the film is dialogue and surprisingly, it is consistently kept interesting. whereas in most movies, the dialogue seems to jump around and pass away as the story moves along, the dialogue in ""pulp fiction"" sets itself up to be played out in future situations(you'll see what i mean) and in this way, tarantino is able to create many instances of irony and maintain a solid story. in an interview quentin tarantino discussed the nonlinear script and explained that if writers can use this format in their books and have such freedom in their storytelling, why couldn't he? how right he is. tarantino started nothing short of a revolution in the film world by doing so. with the 5 different mini-""stories"" in the film(jules and vincent, mia wallace and vincent vega, the bonnie situation, the diner, and the golden watch) tarantino unravels each of the characters' stories and shows the viewer what happens after and before what appear to be cliche situations. the result is something the likes of which you have never seen before. and not only that, tarantino was able to intertwine all of the different stories and bring them together into a unified theme, ending with an iconic scene that will leave you speechless. at this point, i must address the complaints of many people who think that ""pulp fiction"" is merely a flick that revels in drug use, language, and violence. on the contrary, ""pulp fiction"" is essentially a moral story with a strong theme of redemption yet it is told through ""immoral"" characters(hit men, robbers, mob bosses, etc.). think of all of the great literary pieces in history that were banned and condemned for their immorality but are praised for their genius today! of course, there's nothing wrong with a good disney movie for family fun and moral values, but tarantino's style provides a breath of fresh air to the cinematic community. not to mention all of the other motifs, plot devices, and iconic scenes, ""pulp fiction"" is abundant with thrills, chills, and laughs. there is nothing more i can do except to say, get off your butt, go to blockbuster and rent it.

1644;Papatheodorou;pulp fiction was released back in 1994, and now, nearly twenty years later (as of 2013), tarantino's first real masterpiece can still be compared to some of the crime movies of today. critically acclaimed across the world, we are presented with four interweaving stories about mob hit-men, a boxer, a gangster's wife, and a couple looking to rob a diner, and it deserves it's acclaim. quentin tarantino's first film, reservoir dogs, was a word of mouth success. little was known about this raw, raunchy crime thriller from an unknown writer/director, but it became a cult classic quickly. therefore, his follow-up film needed to be good, and he delivers. anyway, on to pulp fiction. the academy award-winning film contains four interweaving stories. they are gritty and foul-mouthed, but truly spectacular. only few times have writer/directors been able to pull off such astounding films. without dipping into spoilers, i can safely say that pulp fiction is like a dive of a cliff for first-time tarantino viewers. you think it's risky attempting it, but when you do, you're hooked. it's this film that truly made tarantino who he is today, and it's this film that can still stand the test of time, one of the rare few. pulp fiction is a masterpiece i can't wait to watch again. a truly spectacular film on all levels. a beautiful crime drama that accurately dips you into the crime world in ways we've never been dipped before, and i can't wait to get dipped again. 10/10;5 July 2013;10;['first', 'real', 'first', 'reservoir', 'little', 'raw', 'raunchy', 'unknown', 'good', 'interweaving', 'gritty', 'foul', 'mouthed', 'spectacular', 'few', 'able', 'such', 'astounding', 'first', 'tarantino', 'risky', 'hooked', 'tarantino', 'rare', 'few', 'spectacular', 'beautiful'];0.2003739316239316

1646;forthosewhowait94;pulp fiction is a terrific movie! it has all the characteristics of a perfect movie: engaging plot, memorable characters, excellent writing and directing, and awesome music! tarantino is without a doubt one of the best film-makers of all time. i love all of his movies and i never get tired of watching any of them! pulp fiction is just another example of how awesome tarantino is as a film-maker. pulp fiction is one of those movies that requires a second viewing or more to truly understand it and enjoy it more. not only does it get better with each viewing but it also becomes easier to understand as you notice how tarantino focuses on the small details of the film and how the small details relate to the main plot. for example: the connection between marsellus wallace's band-aid on his neck and the suitcase. there is a fan theory that says that marsellus sold his soul to the devil and his soul is inside the suitcase. the fan theory states that in order the extract a soul, it has to come from the back of the neck thus explaining the band-aid on wallace's neck. tarantino has not come out and proved that theory true or not. personally, i think tarantino ultimately led the guessing to the fans as they come up with possible outcomes. the acting and dialogue is over the top and straight forward and i couldn't have possibly thought of a better cast to play the characters. when the film was nominated for all of those academy awards in '94, there was very tough competition since other films like forrest gump and the shawshank redemption were also nominated. but i won't complain since those 2 movies are really good too. however, i believe pulp fiction deserved the oscar for best original script and i'm really glad it won! in conclusion, pulp fiction is a cinematic masterpiece that will forever be a highly significant film even after all these years.;20 August 2013;10;['terrific', 'perfect', 'memorable', 'excellent', 'awesome', 'tarantino', 'good', 'tired', 'awesome', 'second', 'more', 'more', 'well', 'easy', 'tarantino', 'small', 'small', 'main', 'true', 'possible', 'top', 'well', 'tough', 'other', 'forr', 'good', 'good', 'original', 'glad', 'cinematic', 'significant'];0.3417735042735043

1670;ItsOKihaveabusinesscard;"it's interesting to read statistics such as "" the word 'f_' was used 463,729 times in this film."" apparently quentin tarantino needs to know how many quarters to put in his cuss jar. movies are made to take the place of storytellers, and when we sit adoringly at hollywood's knee we expect something fabulous. not everyone can spin a good yarn, and now we know that even our most promising film makers, regardless of their inauspicious beginnings, cannot hold our attention without resorting to gore and gimmickry. films like ""pulp fiction"" (1994, written and directed by quentin tarantino; starring john travolta, samuel l. jackson, bruce willis, ving rhames, uma thurman and many other big names) leave me wondering if prominent producers have just flat lost touch with their audiences. parents and grandparents must also consider the larger view: if a little pitcher accidentally stumbles into the wrong warren at the neighborhood multiplex his big ears will hear fascinating new words that might cause him to stay for a second listen, but by the end of this loud, red film he'll be ready for the booby hatch. i worry. when hollywood dumps buckets of blood like this on to the silver screen i'm always afraid youngsters might see it. heck, i'm not sure anyone should see it. i am disappointed in myself for falling for the fast talk and slickness (ignored the wee-small voice again). i watched the whole thing, and now my only hope for personal redemption is to try to prevent people with taste from having anything to do with this self-indulgent free-for-all. if i were catholic i'd probably have to go to confession just for having sat through this mayhem. public forums are an excellent way for us film fans to inform these talented and powerful people that we crave clever stories told in creative ways, and that profanity and blood are best served sparingly. it is possible that quentin tarantino is a genius. my hope is that his future work will be full and inspired, and that he will begin to move toward the light.

1677;pulpmaster2517;pulp fiction is one of those movies that comes along every once and a while that just shocks everybody because people sometimes can't explain the reason the film is so good. it is a landmark film in terms of style, screenplay, and story structure. in the beginning scene in the film we see two seeming normal people who are talking so calmly about robbing banks, drug stores, coffee shops etc...this is one of the best cold openings ever conceived on film. it opens up on a beautiful long shot and you just assume 'oh here are our films stars' and you don't know any better for the first few minutes because the dialog is so detailed that this must have to tie in with the story it must. at first you are confused you're simply like 'what is going on' this is a pretty random conversation. but as it escalates you start to understand a bit more. when they start talking about how easy it would be to rob a coffee shop and the reasons it is so simple you stop and think to yourself 'wow they are so right' and as the scene progresses you get drawn in more and more and by the end of the scene you're just hooked and wants to see what will happen next. then after the opening credits we see john travolta and samuel l. jackson and you're just like 'what where did the other people go' but soon you get so wrapped in the dialog of these two hit men about such random amusing things that you forget about that and get wrapped in the conversation of these two guys with some of the best dialog ever written. after we see them discussing gossip about tony rocky horror and mrs mia wallace and it it is so amusing to listen to this conversation despite the explicitly of the dialog. you listen to them gossip and argue and you know you've had a similar conversation as this sometime in your life and you are easily wrapped up in the story even more. once they go in to the apartment you see exactly how these guys work and you're thinking 'are these really the same guys that they were two minute ago?' then you hear jules' ezekiel 25:17 in the context which is going on which is just brilliant followed by the gold light when they shoot and kill their victim. now lets jump ahead to the date with vince and mia and once again we see some great dialog which is just your everyday chit chat, everyday date. with the exception of some cocaine snorting in the bathroom. i think that this scene is the one john travolta is best in because you can just tell exactly how high he is and how good he feels. after mia ods we are once again just amused by the arguing vince and lance are having despite the fact that a woman is dying right in there bedroom. this is one of the most dramatic, adrenaline rushing scenes in the movie as well as one of the funniest. lets now jump ahead to butch's story where we get great dialog in the cab driver who is simply curious about butch and in the hotel room with some everyday boyfriend girlfriend love talk and goofing around. when butch goes to get his watch he kills vincent coming out of the bathroom and runs into marcellus on the way home and from there the adventure continues with the rapist storyline. and the incredible use of music when butch gets his katana and saves marcellus. now we find ourselves back in the room from the beginning of the film with vince and jules and we see them killing brett from a different point of view followed by tons of humor between the divine intervention and marvin's head. we get more great dialog for the remainder of this section and then we end up back in the diner from the beginning and all starts to make sense. then in the dramatic conclusion jules gives one of the greatest speeches ever on film and we finally understand the message of the film, redemption. everyone with the exception of vincent has been given a second chance. mia, marcellus, butch, jules, pumpkin and hunny bunny. now looking back on vincent we notice that he ignored the divine intervention and thought jules was crazy, therefore being stupid and ignoring his chance for redemption then each time he goes to the bathroom something bad happens: he comes out in the restaurant and there are robbers, he goes to the bathroom at mia's he comes out she ods and he comes out of the bathroom at butch's and vincents life comes to an end. pulp fiction is so simple and yet at the same time one of the most complex films ever made that is open to so much interpretation i don't think we will ever catch every little thing in the film. between the pop-culture references, the unbelievable dialog we can all relate to, the simple yet complex story lines, the complex story structure that finally starts to come together piece by piece near the end. and the films overall message of redemption. pulp fiction is one of the greatest achievements in motion picture history and will be a timeless classic for generations and generations.;1 September 2007;10;['good', 'normal',

1689;Faustas610;"i never would have thought i'd write such a testimonial about the quentin tarantino's, 1994 movie ""pulp fiction"", because i was convinced that everyone had already seen this masterpiece. the narrative of this film is made up of several different but closely related stories in which the heroes find themselves in very unenviable situations from which they have to grapple with inadequate ways. i think this is the most adequate description of this movie, without spoiling anything about the story itself. each of the six segments that quentin tarantino presents to us with great ingenuity, manages not only to entertain, but also to amaze, scare and even excite you as a viewer. therefore, they all create such tremendous emotion that you will carry for a long time after viewing this tape. another important highlight is the branded dialogues of quentin tarantino. this person can turn a conversation about a burger, milkshake, or a watch into real art, so watching one of the objects i mentioned is so exciting that times passes by. no wonder quentin was awarded an oscar for best original screenplay of the year. dialogues also reveal the hereos themselves, who over the years have become an integral part of popular culture. so everyone - vincent, jules, jimmie, mr wolf, marsellus, mia, zed and butch are unique. they have characters, they come out as personalities and you sympathize with them from start to finish. and whether it's a bad guy or a good guy, they're all charismatic characters who have something to say and know how to express themselves. the movie lasts almost two and a half hours, but you can't feel it because everything passes by in an instant, so you can't get bored of watching this movie. it is decorated not only with great characters and greasy dialogues, but also with violence that is unexpectedly introduced in one scene or another. at first glance, you can be very scared because the most unexpected storylines will make you very surprised. technically, the tape is flawless. first and foremost, it is the soundtrack that creates the atmosphere of this movie that you can't just not enjoy hearing all sorts of music. true, it has became a directiorial feature as well, as each of his films are always filled with very expressive melodies or songs. secondly, artistic design. costumes, hairstyles, makeup, locations where all scenes were filmed - no complaints. also there can't be any complaints to the camera man andrzej sekula, who was able to give us every scene from interesting enough angles. audio and video editing - perfect. as for actors, we have a lot of talent in the film that quentin tarantino has masterfully used. uma thurman, john travolta, samuel l. jackson, harvey keitel, ving rhames, bruce willis and tim roth are just some of the actors who embodied the cult characters. although for some, this show has become a boost to a career and a career overload. it was such a pleasure watching the acting in this movie. to sum it up, it's one of those movies that you have to watch, even if you don't like these type of tapes. it's just a must-watch. this is one of the most important movies of the 20th century, which made a huge impact not only on popular culture but also on the genre itself.";12 October 2019;10;['several', 'different', 'unenviable', 'inadequate', 'adequate', 'tarantino', 'great', 'such', 'tremendous', 'long', 'important', 'real', 'exciting', 'good', 'original', 'integral', 'popular', 'unique', 'bad', 'good', 'charismatic', 'bored', 'great', 'first', 'scared', 'unexpected', 'surprised', 'flawless', 'true', 'directiorial', 'expressive', 'artistic', 'able', 'interesting', 'enough', 'perfect', 'important', 'huge', 'popular'];0.3578125

1719;jtrporrelli;"pulp fiction is an absolute unicorn of a film. it first premiered twenty-six years ago and has aged fantastically; arguably one of quentin tarantino's best films. somehow, the story has managed to remain fresh and unique, the dialogue sharp and cunning, the characters intriguing and memorable, music creates a sense of realism in the scenes, the camera work is impeccable. truly the movie is almost flawless. it's gone on to become one of those movies that almost everyone has agreed is a must-watch, especially for those aspiring to make films. it transformed tarantino's career, making him a household name and has inspired dozens of other filmmakers and movies. the only real question is: ""what makes pulp fiction so great?"" is it the snappy dialogue? the memorable characters? the experiential camera work? the answer, in short, is no. while all of these elements help polish the film into a masterpiece, they are not the core of what makes it spectacular. rather, it's the way tarantino addresses the idea of random chance and pre-determined destiny that sets it apart. most people believe that humans are free thinkers, that we have free will, and that everything that happens to us happens because of us and the choices we make. however, in pulp fiction, jules, played by samuel l. jackson, and vince, portrayed by john travolta, debate this at length. on one hand, jules chooses to believe that things happen for a reason. in a twisted sense of the idea, jules is a christian. he believes in a higher power and in divine intervention. ultimately, he believes that his life has been pre-determined and that god has a bigger plan for him, whatever happens to him has nothing to do with his own actions, his actions only even happen because they must. consequently, jules chooses to perceive the world as a giant unsolvable puzzle where everything has a specific place. we can not randomly pick where the pieces are going because they are not designed to fit in more than one way. life is not a series of random events that occur because of us, it is a predetermined puzzle that we must strive to solve. at least, that's how jules lives. on the contrary, vince believes that the world is entirely random. the tv show ""rick and morty"" best captured this ideology in its first season by saying ""nobody belongs anywhere. nobody exists on purpose. everybody is going to die. come watch tv."" (rick & morty s:1/ep:8 - created by justin roiland and dan harmon) because he believes there is no god or greater plan. he believes that everything is driven by choices, rather than destiny. things only happen to us because we make them happen. life is a chaotic series of events that we have to manage and control. to him, life is not a picturesque puzzle with a predetermined outcome, but rather an endless bin of lego bricks. people throw their hands in the bin and grab a fistful of lego, so in turn, whatever blocks you pull out will be entirely random, but what we choose to build is our decision. whether it stands strong or tumbles relies solely on those decisions. it's these fundamentals and opposing beliefs being crafted together in such a compelling manner that makes the decision of the audience between the two ideologies the crucial key to the success of the film. throughout the entirety of pulp fiction, things unravel and progress in strange ways. for example, at the beginning of the film, two thieves choose to rob a diner where there should be no heroes, however, jules is there. skipping forward a little, vince's drug dealer runs out of balloons and puts his drugs into a plastic baggy. eventually, this allows for mia wallace to find it and overdose, conveniently vince is in the washroom when she finds the drugs. after that fiasco, butch should be fleeing town but goes back to his apartment for a watch, while vince once again happens to be taking a dump. then after butch kills vince and gets his watch, he happens to pull up in front of marcellus wallace as he's crossing the street. in turn, causing them to stumble into the one store that happens to be run by rapists. plus of course, there's that time when vince and jules are shot at from point-blank range but all the shots miss them. all of pulp fiction plays out in what could only be defined as a random series of connecting events, but is it really random? the entire film demonstrates one massive domino effect. one event can not happen without the others, but the question remains: do these events happen because of the character's actions or is it all in spite of them? the audience is never given a clear answer. for example, butch ends up killing vince and having a crazy/ traumatizing experience with marcellus because of that choice. he chooses to go back to his apartment and get his watch, even though he knows he should be leaving town for his own safety. that choice brings him into contact with both vince and marcellus. however, everything else that happens is random, as aforementioned. it's only chance that butch got the upper hand on vince and it's only chance that marcellus was heading to the apartment at the exact same time butch is leaving. the film alternates between chance and destiny as the driving mechanism, of the film. unfortunately, tarantino never offers a blunt answer. instead, it's left up to the audience to decide what they believe, which is brilliant. the end of the film leaves the audience with the same unanswered questions as the characters. it creates a desire for us to return to the movie and begin studying it. the problem is that no matter how many times we watch pulp fiction, that question will only become more complicated and difficult to answer with every screening. creating something that would resonate for decades with its viewers and forever leave them wanting more may be the most legendary feat any filmmaker could ever aspire to.";10 September 2021;8;['absolute', 'good', 'fresh', 'unique', 'sharp', 'cunning', 'intriguing', 'memorable', 'impeccable', 'flawless', 'other', 'only', 'real', 'great', 'snappy', 'memorable', 'experiential', 'short', 'spectacular', 'random', 'pre', 'determined', 'most', 'free', 'free', 'twisted', 'high', 'divine', 'determined', 'big', 'own', 'giant', 'unsolvable', 'specific', 'more', 'random', 'predetermined', 'least', 'random', 'first', 'great', 'chaotic', 'picturesque', 'predetermined', 'endless', 'random', 'strong', 'compelling', 'crucial', 'strange', 'little', 'plastic', 'marcellus', 'blank', 'random', 'random', 'entire', 'massive', 'clear', 'own', 'random', 'upper', 'exact', 'same', 'brilliant', 'same', 'unanswered', 'many', 'complicated', 'difficult', 'more', 'legendary'];0.1449281609195402

1722;PresFos2007;in reality, pulp fiction is one of the most disorganized movies of all-time, but it was brilliant. to show all of those characters stories of a period of days and how they were connected was cool. jules is the most dynamic character of all of the them and he makes the movie. i would have nominated him for the best actor oscar. this movie showed samuel l. jackson at his best and funniest. jules was dynamic by incorporating violence with religion. vince resurrected john travolta back on top. vince was the cool junkie. vincent vega showed us that eating someone out can be just as sensual as giving a foot massage. stroke of genius. butch was also a one of a kind character. butch has major problems to go through because he's on the run from marcellus wallace and his men and the irony of it is that he beat the mess out of him and saved him from more humiliation by the pawn shop owner and the cop zed. his girlfriend even had a moment of shine by talking about blueberry pancakes, and losing butch precious watch that was his father's. quentin taratino is a genius for creating a movie this versatile and probably one of the greatest crime films ever. this is a must-buy movie and a movie you will never forget.;22 August 2006;10;['disorganized', 'brilliant', 'cool', 'dynamic', 'good', 'good', 'dynamic', 'cool', 'sensual', 'kind', 'major', 'marcellus', 'more', 'blueberry', 'butch', 'precious', 'versatile', 'great'];0.4552083333333332

1740;rutujwaghmare-41601;"in a diner, a man and a woman who call each other pumpkin and honey bunny eat breakfast in a booth. honey bunny teases pumpkin for not wanting to commit armed robberies anymore, and pumpkin explains that robbing the diner would be better than robbing convenience stores or banks. she agrees, and the two leap to their feet and draw their weapons, before the opening credits roll. across town, two men in suits named vincent and jules ride in a car discussing europe and fast food. jules tells vincent that marsellus, their boss, allegedly had a man thrown off a balcony for massaging his wife mia's feet, who vincent has been instructed to take out to dinner. they argue about the implications of foot massages, before storming an apartment with three men inside. jules kills one, and recites ezekiel 25:17 before killing another, named brett. vincent retrieves a briefcase, the contents of which glow, from a kitchen cabinet. in a bar, marsellus gives an envelope full of cash to a boxer named butch, bribing him to throw his next match. vincent and jules, now wearing tee shirts, enter the bar, and butch has a brief exchange with vincent on his way out. in the following scene, vincent buys heroin from his drug dealer, named lance, and talks briefly to his girlfriend jody. after buying three grams of heroin, vincent shoots up and heads to mia's house. mia does cocaine in the bathroom while vincent fixes himself a drink. they head to a restaurant named jackrabbit slim's, where they talk about mia's failed television pilot and the foot massage rumor, which mia denies. mia forces vincent to participate in a twist contest, which they win. back at mia's house, while vincent uses the bathroom, mia mistakes his heroin for cocaine and snorts it, falling unconscious. a panicked vincent rushes her to lance's house, although lance is reluctant to help. vincent is able to successfully revive her with an adrenaline shot straight to the heart. at the end of the night, mia tells vincent a joke from her television pilot, which she previously refused to divulge, and the two agree to keep the night's events a secret. a man named captain koons visits butch as a child, giving him a gold watch that is a family heirloom. as an adult, butch kills his opponent in a boxing match, rather than purposely lose as marsellus wanted. butch escapes in a cab driven by a woman named esmeralda, and calls a bookie named scottie who plans to collect butch's earnings. meanwhile, marsellus orders that butch be killed. at a nearby motel, butch's girlfriend fabienne waits for him, and the two talk and have sex. the next morning, butch realizes his gold watch is missing, and angrily leaves the motel in search of it. butch cautiously returns to his apartment, and initially finds no one there. he retrieves the watch and notices a gun on the counter. he hears the toilet flush, and kills the man who emerges from the bathroom, which turns out to be vincent. butch leaves and is spotted by marsellus at a stoplight. butch rams him with his car, and an injured marsellus chases an injured butch until both men are subdued inside a nearby pawn shop by the owner, named maynard. butch and marsellus awaken in the pawn shop basement, where maynard has bound and gagged them. a man named zed shows up, who orders maynard to get ""the gimp,"" a man in a full-body bondage suit who sleeps in a trunk. zed drags marsellus into another room to be raped while maynard watches, and butch manages to break free. butch is about to flee when he hears marsellus's cries and instead retrieves a katana sword and ambushes the men, killing maynard. now freed, marsellus shoots zed in the crotch, and tells butch that the men are even, as long as butch leaves town and never tells anyone about the incident. butch rides zed's chopper motorcycle back to the motel, and he and fabienne ride away together. the film flashes back to the scene where jules recites ezekiel 25:17, this time from the perspective of an armed man hiding in the bathroom. after jules kills brett, the man runs out and fires wildly, miraculously missing jules and vincent with his entire clip. jules and vincent kill him, and jules calls the event an act of ""divine intervention."" the two take marvin, the only surviving man in the apartment, with them, and leave. in the car, the men continue debating ""divine intervention,"" and jules pledges to give up his life of crime. vincent accidentally shoots marvin in the face, killing him. jules calls a nearby friend named jimmie, and they head to his house to deal with the cleanup. at jimmie's house, jules calls marsellus for help, who arranges for a man named winston wolfe to come over and help fix the situation. jimmie tells the men they have ninety minutes before his wife bonnie arrives home. wolfe arrives ten minutes later and instructs jules and vincent to wipe down the car upholstery. they place jimmie's blankets over the seat, and wolfe hoses a naked jules and vincent down in the backyard, before giving them old tee shirts to wear. they follow wolfe to a nearby auto shop, where the car is destroyed. wolfe introduces jules and vincent to his girlfriend raquel on his way out of the auto shop, and then leaves. jules and vincent decide to get breakfast at the same diner that pumpkin and honey bunny are about to rob in the first scene. vincent goes to the bathroom just before pumpkin and honey bunny draw their guns. when pumpkin demands jules's wallet and the briefcase, jules draws his weapon, and explains to pumpkin that he now understands the true meaning of ezekiel 25:17, and wants to find a non-violent solution. vincent emerges from the bathroom, resulting in a mexican standoff. jules successfully de-escalates

1783;knaak1;pulp fiction is one of the best movies ever. quentin tarantino has done a wonderful job, something he will never be able to reach again. it's his masterpiece. the cast is outstanding, and perfectly teamed up. the greatest duo to me is samuel l.jackson with john travolta. any director will be jealous of their dialogs. john travolta plays very cool when goes out with uma thurman, who is as cool as he is. this creates an interesting sphere between them. bruce willis shows he is more than just an average 'die hard' gorilla. his scene with ving rhames in the store, where he choses his way of revenge on the owners, made me laugh the hardest. christopher walken is as serious as he is scary, when he tells about his time in vietnam. harvey keitel does his best performance as a problem solver. he thinks fast, talks fast, acts fast, but is always in control of the situation. no one can do it better than himself. the story is of a no bulls*** kind. the things that aren't said, is what makes this movie so brilliant. the non chronological way makes it even more interesting to watch. quentin knew what he was doing. i've seen this movie over and over again, but it has never bored me a single minute. the funny thing is you can sit back and relax while watching this movie, it is never too violent or too shocking. it's the funniest kind of crime, your first response is laughing. it's just the best in its genre. if you have never seen this movie, i suggest you go buy it right now.;9 January 2004;10;['good', 'wonderful', 'able', 'outstanding', 'great', 'jealous', 'cool', 'cool', 'interesting', 'more', 'average', 'hard', 'hard', 'serious', 'scary', 'good', 'brilliant', 'non', 'chronological', 'interesting', 'single', 'funny', 'violent', 'shocking', 'first', 'good'];0.2109126984126984

1786;ghost859;there are few directors like qt out there, which i think is a tragedy. he makes films that are very, very clearly supposed to be pure entertainment, and artsy people attempt to find deep symbolism and meaning. the last sequence is really the only part of the movie that you can get any meaning from, other than the rather strange coincidences played out throughout the movie. look, people, starting a movie at the end doesn't automatically make the movie an epic of intellectually gargantuan proportions. this is not a top 10 film. it barely scrapes into the top 25. that doesn't mean it's not a fun film, though. the dialogue and ridiculously coincidental twists make it a lot of fun to watch. just watch it, enjoy the music and the dialogue, and walk away entertained.;16 April 2006;7;['few', 'pure', 'artsy', 'deep', 'last', 'only', 'other', 'strange', 'gargantuan', 'top', 'top', 'fun', 'coincidental', 'entertained'];0.099025974025974
1787;DKline1278;"*****spoilers***** this is one of the greatest movies of the 90's, if not the greatest. the direction and editing are bar none above almost anything else that was put out at that time. the script circles a lot around f bombs but that's ok because it gets it's point across. the 3 stories this movie goes around are hilarious, action packed, and drama filled. it has everything you want in a movie, all though there is no real love story sorry ladies. this is the movie that launched samuel l. jackson's now amazing career, and to think it may have never happened as he almost lost the part. john travolta also came back completely because of this movie. ving rhames has gone on to be just a bad man (in a good way) because of this movie. it opened a lot of peoples eyes to uma turman as well, even though it was almost 10 years later in another tarantino movie before she really got back to the ""mainstream"". harvey keitel, who is an underrated actor in a great role. tim roth, one of tarantino's favorites, is good in the small role he has. plus bruce coming in on a very un bruce like low key role. now i know a lot of people reading this would disagree but this is also the movie that opened everyone up to tarantino, i know reservoir dogs is highly considered a better movie but this brought him into the lime light. so we have pulp fiction to thank for all of the above, some are upset about the travolta part but hey in the right role he's an amazing actor. the way the movie just jumps around w/the end being in the middle and the middle being in the end was genious. at the time i couldn't say i'd ever seen anything like it befor. the fact that the movie is more about the dialogue than anything else is what separates pf from a lot of other movies of this type of genre. while the action in the movie is very entertaining it's what is coming out of the charaters mouths that drives the movie. to quickly introduce some of the characters. you have jules/jackson quoting from the bible. vincent/travolta with his now infamous royal with cheese conversation. wallace/rhames being just a bad dude and delivering his lines a smooth as anyone. mia/thurman and her quirky character. the wolf/keitel just coming in and smoothing everything over as only the wolf can. i know i'm being vague w/details but if you haven't seen this movie stop reading the review and go watch it, if you have seen it your hopefully getting my point. spoilers below. the action should not be dismissed, it is very well done. you have the very well put together way of butch/wills not throwing his fight but you don't see it all you see is him running out of the building. then him meeting up w/wallce later and running him over in a his car. the following part at the pawn shop is both disturbing and funny. the whole part of when we see vincent and jules going to collect from the kids who stole from wallace is brilliant. right down to the kid coming out of the bathroom with, as vincent puts it, a ""hand cannon"". then there is my favorite part of the movie. the vincent and mia date. this is just so well put together the dialogue between the two of them is great, plus the sexual tension between them adds a little drama too it. then the drug overdose that happens at the end is gut renching and is what makes it my favorite part of the movie. there is the ""bonnie situation"" which as sad as it is that someone dies in the beginning of that part of the story that it is one of the funniest parts of pf. this is where we meet tarantino, a good role for him to play even if he's not the best actor in the world. heck you can stand him in it because everyone else is so great. the wolf is also in this part of the story as a basic mr. fix it guy who comes in and saves vincent and jules after what they did to the poor kid in the car. the last one is, i know i went out of order and if i forgot anything i appologize, the robbery at the coffee shop. this is what made jackson in my opinion, his banter with travolta in this sceen is once again great. but what makes it is when jules/jackson won't let roth's character take the brief case. when he has roth at gun point and starts to talk that is some of the best acted and spoken dialogue you'll see maybe ever. in closing i appologize for the review being jumpy and not well put together, when i think about this movie so many things come to mind as it is non stop from beginning to end with no slow parts. for 2 1/2 hours your just sitting on the edge of your seat because you have no idea what is going to happen next. that's how i felt watching it in '94. now movies have changed a lot from back then, in part i think, because of this movie so you may not feel the same way as i did watching it then. it holds the test of time as well now 10 years later. so if you read this review and haven't seen the movie, i appologize if i gave too much away but go and watch it now and let us know what you think. i would give this movie 3 1/2 out of 4 stars (i don't give a lot of 4 stars btw)";24 February 2004;9;['great', 'great', 'ok', 'hilarious', 'real', 'sorry', 'amazing', 'bad', 'good',

1791;jscmns;"tarantino takes us through a journey of the postmodern abyss his characters are dropped in. you might retort this by saying i don't speak english, but frankly, i think i speak the new language. that's right, the new language of postmodernism. the language of a land where every character is a victim of subjectivism, where every time we want to look at the movie we peer to nothing whole. we only get sneak peeks of the performances of the actors and the landscapes and places they find themselves in. it never becomes a coherent whole. this is a movie that clashes with peoples' sense of what a movie should be. it's precisely a movie that shouldn't be. the ""incoherent"" story lines and ""pointless"" dialogues lead us to the same place. there is barely any change we just move in a circle. and there goes another confrontation to the modernist though: time is not linear, postmodernists say. now, i doubt tarantino has any idea what postmodernism is, since he's a filmmaker, not a philosopher, and i doubt you could consciously make a postmodernist film. but this is, without a doubt, the truer representation of our times: a bunch of characters lost in an urban hell, who interact with each other, something we think would be relevant to the storyline, but wasn't. there is no ulterior motive here, it's just a day in the life of a few assholes in a hellish l.a. which looks remarkably average, not exceptionally detached from our experience. the dialogue is one contentious point with people who are used to dialogue leading somewhere. dialogue doesn't lead anywhere in this case. it barely moves forward, except when it needs to move forward. otherwise it just gets stuck in the same place, like real dialogue. this is not your average hollywood drama. tarantino liked to do this around this time. he liked subverting cliches. now, his filmmaking style doesn't subvert cliches, because he has made his style a cliche. we know what to expect from a tarantino film. but when pulp fiction came out, everyone was astounded. what's surprising is that people still are shocked by it, and still don't understand what the film is getting at. that's right, it's getting right at your preconceived notions of time and space. other films along the same line are fargo, big lebowski, fight club, anything by inarritu, and of course, the quintessential postmodern film, breathless, by jean luc-godard. good art should be questioned. this movie raises a number of questions, not deep, philosophical tirades about existence, no. it raises the question of how we perceive ourselves in time and space, how we conceive of our place in the world. and like all postmodernist though, it provides no answers.";18 July 2016;10;['new', 'right', 'new', 'whole', 'coherent', 'incoherent', 'pointless', 'same', 'linear', 'postmodernist', 'truer', 'urban', 'other', 'relevant', 'ulterior', 'few', 'hellish', 'average', 'contentious', 'same', 'real', 'average', 'tarantino', 'astounded', 'surprising', 'right', 'right', 'preconceived', 'other', 'same', 'big', 'quintessential', 'postmodern', 'good', 'deep', 'philosophical'];0.0981195887445887

1811;Xkinhe;"twenty years on, quentin tarantino's pulp fiction has been released in cinemas, and it looks as mesmeric and mad as ever: callous, insolent, breathtaking. the icy wit, the connoisseur soundtrack, the violence (of which the n-bombs are a part), the extended dialogue riffing, the trance- like unreality, the inspired karmic balance of the heroin scene and the adrenalin scene, the narrative switchbacks that allow john travolta to finish the film both alive and dead, the spectacle of him being made to dance badly, but also sort of brilliantly above all else, the sheer direction-less excitement that only tarantino can conjure. in 1994 it broke over my head like a thunderclap, and in 1990s britain this touchstone of cool seemed to extend its dangerous influence everywhere: movies, fiction, journalism, media, fashion, restaurants, you name it. everyone was trying to do irony and incorrectness, but without his brilliance it just looked smug. (the americans get tarantino; we get guy ritchie and jeremy clarkson.) travolta and samuel l jackson play vincent and jules, a couple of bantering hit men working for marsellus (ving rhames), who is highly protective of his wife, mia (uma thurman), and about to conclude a payday from a fixed boxing match; marsellus's fighter, butch (bruce willis), is haunted by a childhood encounter with his late father's best friend (a jaw- dropping cameo from christopher walken). everyone's destiny plays out with that of a couple of freaky stick-up artists, played by amanda plummer and tim roth. in 1994, all the talk was of former video-store clerk tarantino's indifference to traditional culture. that patronized his sophisticated cinephilia, and in fact, 20 years on, the writerly influences of edward bunker, elmore leonard and jim thompson seem very prominent. don delillo began the 90s by warning that the us is the only country in the world with funny violence. maybe pulp fiction was the kind of thing he had in mind. unmissable";16 July 2015;10;['mesmeric', 'mad', 'callous', 'insolent', 'connoisseur', 'extended', 'karmic', 'alive', 'dead', 'sheer', 'less', 'dangerous', 'smug', 'tarantino', 'protective', 'fixed', 'late', 'good', 'former', 'traditional', 'sophisticated', 'writerly', 'prominent', 'only', 'funny', 'unmissable'];0.0172222222222222

1815;filtros805;pulp fiction is the second film by writer/director quentin tarantino. the film, wisely, has no real plot: it's all skill and structure. the story involves 2 hit men (john travolta and samuel l. jackson) who are doing a job, a boxer (bruce willis) who is supposed to take a fall on his next fight. the man who told willis to take a fall is the boss of travolta and jackson (he is played by ving rhames). also, uma thurman stars as ving rhames's wife, who gets involved with travolta. after reading this, you probably don't think this is a good movie. however, this film alone may have redefined the cinema of the 20th century. it is a complete original, it is ingenious, it was put together flawlessly, and always keeps you entertained. what makes the film an original is the non-linear story-telling screenplay, which tells the parallel stories through time: the first thing the characters did could appear in the middle of the film, instead of the beginning. you could watch the movie over and over again and not know what comes next. the performances were perfect, the actors are perfectly cast, the dialog is great, and quentin tarantino's lack of caution while making this film make it one of the best films ever made.;7 June 2005;10;['second', 'real', 'next', 'good', 'complete', 'original', 'ingenious', 'entertained', 'non', 'linear', 'parallel', 'first', 'perfect', 'great', 'good'];0.4022727272727273

1824;lodi_70005;"few films have the ability to cover the whole ""grade"" spectrum, however, leave it to tarantino to pull it off. i have read many comments on this film and if i didn't know any better i would have to use the term controversial to describe quentin tarantino. what other word could better describe a film that receives icon status with the obligatory perfect 10 rating from a reviewer only to be followed by a ""bomb"" 1 or 2 rating. well, i gave the movie a 9 and if someone would start a drum roll i will tell you why. normally, i would have given this movie a perfect ten due to the fact that i never tire of watching it. if i need a laugh, throw pulp fiction into the dvd player because it never fails to deliver. however, i had to go way back to 1994 to remember why i have to give it a nine. pulp fiction almost lost me when i watched it the first time. i described the movie in 1994 as ""very slow in the beginning, but stick with it and it all pays off"". i use the term ""lost me"" because it best describes the art form that i most love and even perform on a regular basis. i am a stand up comedian. you may be saying so what? well when you watch this movie from my point of view, then you might appreciate it for what it is(which i will get to in a moment if i don't lose you). stand-up comedy if not for the faint of heart. unless you are a well known commodity(chris rock, george carlin), audiences will not give you time of day. if you don't grab their attention in the first thirty seconds, then you have probably lost them for good. it doesn't matter if the rest of your act would make the warden from ""shawshank redemption"" roll over in his chair barely able to breathe from laughter, its a lost cause. well, the first time i saw pulp fiction, the film was about ten seconds from losing me in the first 45 minutes. now that i have developed an appreciation for the movie, it never comes close to losing me as i am watching a masterpiece unfold. the problem with people who give this movie a 1 is that they take ""filmwatching"" too seriously. pulp fiction is not citizen kane. surprise!! pulp fiction did not want to be citizen kane. not every movie is made with the intention of making you look deep into your own soul to discover the meaning of life. there is nothing wrong with movies that have a profound positive impact on people. ""shawshank redemption"" is my favorite movie of all time and i admit that it always brings a tear to my eye. there is nothing wrong with movies that teach you something about people of a different era or race. i love ""the color purple"" and ""driving miss daisy"". i would give all three of the above mentioned films a 10(shawshank, color purple, driving miss daisy). i know some of the people who have coined pulp fiction with terms like ""i worry about the world i live in when i see people rating this trash a ten"" are probably thinking that i must be bi-polar.however, when you look at these four films as a whole, there are many recurring themes. rape occurs in most of the above mentioned films and all the films have racial overtones. so if these classics have so much in common, then why such a disparity in the way these films are graded? pulp fiction isn't trying to say that rape is cool. tarantino is simply taking a very dramatic experience and finding a way to derive some humor from it. often, the best laughs come unexpectedly and for a comedian like me not to see the punchline coming from a mile away is very much appreciated. you must admit that tarantino has some filming courage. i can only imagine the crew on the set of pulp fiction during the car scene. to have blood and human brains splattered across the car while listening to tarantino asking samuel jackson and travolta to be funny with the dialog must have been hilarious. only a very skilled filmmaker could make the following quote funny. ""what now? let me tell you what now. i'ma call a coupla hard, pipe-hittin' n-word, who'll go to work on the homes here with a pair of pliers and a blow torch. you hear me talking', hillbilly boy? i ain't through with you by a damn sight. i'ma get medieval on your ass. very few people could read that dialogue and make it funny. i'll close with this. . just loosen up a bit and watch the movie with lowered expectations. criminals do have everyday conversations. they don't just talk about killing people all day. in fact they probably don't discuss it much at all. didn't you learn anything from the godfather or goodfellas? its always ""take care of that thing with that short guy from the south"". that is the point that tarantino is trying to establish in the opening scenes with the whole ""royal with cheese"" dialogue that people whine about so much. once you loosen up and realize that this isn't one of those groundbreaking films that teaches us values blah blah blah....then you might see that pulp fiction isn't that different than some of your favorites. most of the classic films tackle issues like rape, racism, and violence. the difference between pulp fiction and the other classics is that sensitive issues are dealt with in comedic fashion rather than the standard dramatic flair that most of us are use to. psychologist always recommend humor to ""break the ice"" prior to dealing with sensitive issues. so think about that before you throw a one out of ten grade to a film that obviously deserves better.";24 August 2006;9;['few', 'whole', 'many', 'well', 'controversial', 'tarantino', 'other', 'obligatory', 'perfect', 'perfect', 'due', 'first', 'slow', 'good', 'most', 'regular', 'known', 'first', 'able', 'lost', 'first', 'first', 'filmwatching', 'own', 'wrong', 'profound', 'positive', 'favorite', 'wrong', 'different', 'color', 'above', 'many', 'most', 'above', 'racial', 'much', 'common', 'cool', 'dramatic', 'good', 'human', 'funny', 'hilarious', 'skilled', 'funny', 'coupla', 'hard', 'blow', 'damn', 'medieval', 'few', 'funny', 'everyday', 'short', 'whole', 'royal', 'much', 'different', 'most', 'classic', 'other', 'sensitive', 'comedic', 'standard', 'dramatic', 'most', 'sensitive'];0.1696969696969696

1827;Tom_Salmon;"before i write about this movie, i'd just like to say that this would probably be my favourite movie of all time. the dialogue is witty and the acting cool and slick. pulp fiction is a brilliant story split into three tales about different groups of people and how they're lives become intertwined. the events though, do not appear in chronological order. this makes the movie much more interesting. tarantino arranges his first scene to merge with his final one in a remarkable way. those confused by the structure will see everything clearly once the final line is spoken. the first of the three stories starts off with jules winnfield and vincent vega (john travolta). they are making a hit for their boss, marsellus wallace (ving rhames). on their way to this hit vincent tells jules that about his upcoming job for marsellus and how uneasy he feels about it. his job is to take his wife, mia, out and show her a good time (nothing sus). this story goes on to show us the time had between mia and vincent. ""the path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. blessed is he who in the name of charity and goodwill shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and a finder of lost children. and i will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. and you will know my name is the lord when i lay my vengeance upon thee."" this is jules' (samuel l. jackson) version of ezekiel 25:17. and it is this that he recites before he kills. but the rest of the story is about mia and vincent and their time together. the second story, ""the gold watch"", is about a boxer, butch (bruce willis). it starts off with the story of his gold watch that his dad gave to him. all of the trouble that he went through to giver him his watch. after this reminisces, it comes to the present where marsellus is paying butch to throw the upcoming fight. i wont list the events that happen in this part of the movie, as i don't want to spoil anything. the third and final story, ""the bonnie situation"", clears up a few things. this chapter ties up the start of the movie and tells us how it got to the point in the cafe. it also introduces jim (quentin tarantino. vincent and jules take a dead body to his place in order to clean up the car and so forth. this is where the wolf is called in. (harvey keitel). this last scene is a great example of closure and how the characters lead up to the events already shown in the movie (hope that made sense). an excellent movie. again, the dialogue was witty and everything in it had that feel that come when watching a tarantino movie. 10/10. fantastic. will be next to impossible to beat";20 April 2006;10;['favourite', 'witty', 'slick', 'brilliant', 'different', 'chronological', 'interesting', 'tarantino', 'first', 'final', 'remarkable', 'final', 'first', 'hit', 'upcoming', 'uneasy', 'good', 'righteous', 'evil', 'weak', 'great', 'furious', 'thee', 'second', 'upcoming', 'third', 'final', 'few', 'dead', 'last', 'great', 'excellent', 'witty', 'tarantino', 'next', 'impossible'];0.1637820512820512

1829;maxedward;jules, vince vega and butch. a few of the greatest characters to ever hit the screen. all characters in the film are very separate with ideas, motivation and of course personality. gangsters, robbers, a boxer and confederate rapists and an african american 'mr. big'. when you put these kinds of characters together (head to head) the atmosphere is more than explosive. quentin tarantino states recently ('kill bill' special features) that one of the greatest aspects of a film is when great footage goes great with great music. pulp fiction is a perfect example of this. each song reinforces and brings out a tremendous energy of each scenes particular focus. each scene in pulp fiction presents itself with morals, whether it's loyalty, murder, manslaughter or helping out one's own enemy. many scenes present themselves in the format of 'what would you do if you were in this situation?' the unique style of placement of scenes makes the film ever more interesting. it most definitely is a film that crosses many different genres. thriller, action, drama, romance and film noir all in one. it may be important to watch several times to understand what you originally perceived. the greatest masterpieces of all time have always been film's one can look back on and give deep thought on. below there are 3 categories of what creates that 'look back period' and why pulp fiction highly rates- 1) clever factor: about links from issue to issue- this is shown in pulp fiction perhaps more than any film released in the past couple of decades. the film is driven by three main plots and then countless subplots that are interwoven within the main story line. the extreme detail every item is set to from the briefcase numbers to vince vega walking in the background at the first scene obviously involve a lot of 'the clever factor'. 2) quote factor: memorable quotes that can be thought about- all that is said is done so in a way that they are new age casual poetic phrases. a closer look will examine the true meaning behind a character's slang statement of interest or a bible passage. 3) cool factor: exhilarating to the mind- no doubt every viewer will appreciate, if not admire the wild and sometimes wacky thoughts varied characters have to offer. unlike many modern day r rated movies there are few deaths in pulp fiction. but every single death is built up in a way that means a great deal for the audience and at least a character involved. in conclusion, pulp fiction is a film that can be interpreted many different ways. there are so many fascinating features one could talk all day, but it is up to the individual to seek out his or her own desires within the film. pulp fiction is definitely a film of high inspiration but it could be decades before we see another film within the likes of it.;18 July 2005;10;['few', 'great', 'separate', 'african', 'more', 'explosive', 'special', 'great', 'great', 'great', 'great', 'perfect', 'tremendous', 'particular', 'own', 'many', 'unique', 'interesting', 'many', 'different', 'important', 'several', 'great', 'deep', 'clever', 'more', 'past', 'main', 'countless', 'main', 'extreme', 'first', 'clever', 'memorable', 'new', 'casual', 'close', 'true', 'slang', 'bible', 'cool', 'wild', 'wacky', 'varied', 'many', 'modern', 'few', 'single', 'great', 'least', 'many', 'different', 'many', 'fascinating', 'own', 'high'];0.3139748917748917

1878;scurvydog84;after reservoir dogs was released, miramax gave quentin tarantino carte blanche for his next film. the studio was well aware of his strength as a storyteller and filmmaker, and was ready to back just about any project that tarantino could put forth.. john travolta's career had been declining sharply and steadily for the past decade, and tarantino wanted him to play vincent. travolta was cast, and a career was instantly and miraculously resurrected. why select travolta for the lead? the answer is simple. quentin tarantino is fascinated with pop culture, or to be more specific, with pop culture relics. he is a man who is still in love with all the little things that he loved as an adolescent, and many of these things are found within pulp fiction. the film's well-crafted film noir storyline is flooded with references to 70s cartoons, 50s hipster chic, and the instituted amenities of the middle class. even the film's music and casting are retro nostalgia. pulp fiction, is something more than tarantino's breakthrough film, it is his chance to show the audience and the world all the 'cool' things that he's still hanging on to. we first meet the two lead characters, vincent vega and jules winnfield in the second scene of the film. as they begin their workday driving to their 'jobsite,' the two wax intellectual on the 'little differences' between europe and the united states. as vincent goes on to explain, these differences include european names for mcdonald's sandwiches and the availability of beer in movie theatres. he doesn't address the differences in social norms, political structures, or underlying philosophies of europe. he is more concerned with the fact that europeans use mayonnaise instead of ketchup to flavor their fries. the modern middle-class american cares little about anything outside of his/her immediate realm, and we see the characters of pulp fiction in this light. after the revelation of the 'royale with cheese,' jules goes on to ask about the names of other sandwiches in europe, as though this knowledge could possibly have great bearing on his life. americans identify themselves by the products they consume, and by finding the european version of these things, it is as if jules comes to a greater understanding of european culture. in the review for the film on screenit.com, one reads 'didn't everyone think this was set in the 70's, what with the soundtrack, afros, clothes, etc.' one other item that they neglected to mention is the cast. john travolta had not starred in a movie that was a success primarily because of his acting since urban cowboy in 1980.

1888;lozkko;if you are sick and tired of the pathetic holliwood crime movie- full of special effects but overall repetitive and with poor characterization and sense of humor-this is the movie you have got to watch. quentin doesn't shoot this movie simply because he wants to provide us good entertainment, but also because he wants to pay a tribute to the great tradition of films noir. and he does this in an impeccable way. in pulp fiction the bad guys are nastier than ever before, and even the police are given to pure brutality ( cannot say more, watch it). the camera work is probably the best i have ever seen for a variety of reasons. first of all tarantino uses a hyper-sensitive camera film which has the effect of making the colors brighter , so that the characters and the setting seem really to belong to a pulp book. besides some scenes, such as the one of the injection, are very ingenuous and original, and i really appreciated such creativity especially vis-a-vis the repetitiveness of many modern crime movies. finally, the non-linear plot of pulp fiction is simply amazing. with its numerous flash-backs and flash-forwards it contributes to keep your adrenaline high (especially in light of the fact that until two-third of the movie it is very hard to follow the plot), but at the end everything pieces together and you feel as content as when you solve a rubrik's cube. as far as the acting is concerned, this is also of very high quality since all the actors seem very convincing (particularly john travolta, uma thurman and bruce willis), and they manage to alternate ultra violent parts with very humorous lines ( do i look like a bitch? then why are you trying to f**k me like a bitch) overall, i rate pulp fiction as 9.5, 10 . not only it is the best movie by tarantino but probably one of the best film noir ever.;31 May 2000;10;['sick', 'tired', 'pathetic', 'full', 'special', 'overall', 'repetitive', 'poor', 'good', 'great', 'impeccable', 'bad', 'nasty', 'pure', 'more', 'good', 'tarantino', 'hyper', 'sensitive', 'such', 'ingenuous', 'original', 'such', 'many', 'modern', 'non', 'linear', 'amazing', 'numerous', 'hard', 'content', 'high', 'convincing', 'ultra', 'violent', 'humorous', 'good', 'tarantino', 'good'];0.1016282642089093

1934;enriquelr-50976;"i think the genius of pulp fiction comes in its ability to take multiple unique stories and weave them together perfectly through unconventional means. it can be argued that the chapters of the film work independently, but when put in an ensemble, each one gives us a peak into a world that feels lived in and larger than what we're presented with, at the same time, pulp fiction still changes the audiences perspective of the world it takes place in with each subsequent chapter while still feeling like the world we were introduced to in the very first scene. the chapters are famously unchronological and i believe it's a testament to quentin tarantino's creative genius and skills as a writer that a lot of its potency and impact as a film can be accredited to its unconventional sequence. its a film about perspective, at least that's what i took from it, and i appreciate how the only real ""point"" or ""message"" it has is precisely that anyone can come to a conclusion about it, much like the theories revolving around the contents of the briefcase that pushes the plot forward in the first place.";8 August 2020;9;['multiple', 'unique', 'unconventional', 'large', 'same', 'subsequent', 'first', 'unchronological', 'creative', 'unconventional', 'least', 'only', 'real', 'first'];0.1414285714285714

1961;omarhaloul-44489;pulp fiction the movie i started hating and yet it came to be one of my favorite movies, i completely loved the originality of the film and the gorgeous dialogue the main theme the film articulates is chance and the random nature of life and how our decisions are conformed accordingly. the mantle of the film is for sure the dialogue which fleshes out the main theme and drives it forward. the best performance for sure goes for samuel l jackson and got the best character arc ,too. the dialogue is subtly written keeping you immersed in the film, it crafts the perspectives of the characters and their approach to life and how seriously they take the definition of redemption. the narrative of the film is upside down , scattered and randomly told emphasizing the chaotic nature of life , and the unpredictable situation we may encounter, and the impact of these random situations on our perception and pursuing reconsideration when the opportunity is offered. the movie doesn't attempt to avoid luck but it depends on it that is precisely the thread which make the plot tight. the movie demonstrates the theme by dividing the story into four characters and putting them in what is supposed to be a turning point of their lives. obviously the movie raises imperative questions we arguably could relate to, could really a singular moment be sufficiently enough to persuade you to reconsider your choices? is it really random and we don't get to choose the coarse of our lives or this is just a justification? each character faced these questions differently, mia wallace was almost dead by overdose but she was saved by luck so she was offered a chance to redeem her spoiled life, butch when he decided to save wallace instead of letting him torture that settled things between them and now he gets to start over, vincent after him and jules miraculously dodged bullets they had controversy on perception of this situation jules decided that it was a sign to leave his criminal life and pursue righteousness and he did so he gets to live, while vincent who arrogantly insist to neglect the chance and not to magnify it so that gets him killed. the film got minor issues not in the narrative wise but in the pacing a little bit some scenes didn't really add up something to the main theme, but other than that the movie is a masterpiece.;3 January 2021;9;['favorite', 'gorgeous', 'main', 'random', 'sure', 'main', 'good', 'good', 'chaotic', 'unpredictable', 'random', 'imperative', 'singular', 'enough', 'random', 'dead', 'spoiled', 'dodged', 'criminal', 'minor', 'wise', 'little', 'main', 'other'];0.087938596491228

2005;lonsdalegeezer;"pulp fiction is a singular show. the best way to describe it is that it is as if you sit down in the living room with the television and are immediately transported to a roller coaster going full speed through a fun house of ghoulish images. this is complemented with one of the funniest, smartest, and filthiest dialogs i have heard in a long time. there is no other movie i can compare it to. it has the adrenaline flow of speed, the intelligent dialog of my dinner with andre, the violence of the goriest part of the godfather, and the comedy of austin powers. all that having been said, it is like none of the above other than the superficial aspects i just mentioned. if extreme violence (e.g., brains blown on car windows) is something you can not endure, if 700 uses of the f word is something you can not tolerate, if heavy drug use is something you care never to see (cocaine is passe we learn, all of the in-gangsters now do heroin), then do not pay your money to see pulp fiction. on the other hand, all of the above really works in this show. this is a parody of criminal life and a really funny one. this is a show that takes one chance after another. john travolta and samuel l. jackson are nothing short of terrific in it. oscars are possible here. they play the hit men for a major bad guy (marsellus wallace). the bad guy is also paying a boxer (bruce willis) to take a dive. harvey keitel plays a fixer of problems for the bad guy. tim roth and amanda plummer play a couple of two-bit crooks who like robbing restaurants because nobody else does that. eric stoltz plays a low class drug dealer and rosanna arquette plays his girlfriend who has rings in every part of her anatomy (yes, there too). christopher walken shows up in a single long important scene. uma thurman plays the major bad guy's wife. whew, and i probably missed a lot of other people who did some great acting. the major hero and the one who took the most risks in this movie was the scriptwriter. he was also the director - quentin tarantino. the script went from funny scenes like a restaurant where all the staff were 50s famous look-alikes to a scene where the two hit men were first discussing what a mcdonald's quarter-pounder is called in france and why to a discussion of whether it was okay to kill someone for massaging your wife's feet. this is a movie that to describe it will only make you want not to go see it, yet it is mesmerizing and wonderful. the intensity level of the movie is off the scale. people were laughing like crazy in the theater and to intelligent dialog too. other scenes had the audience gasping for breath and uttering out loud ""oh, my god"". several scenes were worse than the finger cutting scene in the piano. the camerawork was mainly standard stuff, but there are several scenes where it got pretty experimental. the best example is the long scene of wills staring into the camera without moving while he listens to the major bad guy, whom we have not yet seen, delivering a long lecture. it then switches to a view of only the back of the bad guy's head with everything else out of focus while willis listens for quite a while more.";1 September 2002;9;['singular', 'good', 'full', 'fun', 'ghoulish', 'smart', 'filthy', 'long', 'other', 'adrenaline', 'intelligent', 'goriest', 'above', 'other', 'superficial', 'extreme', 'heavy', 'passe', 'other', 'above', 'criminal', 'funny', 'short', 'terrific', 'possible', 'major', 'bad', 'bad', 'bad', 'low', 'single', 'long', 'important', 'major', 'bad', 'other', 'great', 'major', 'most', 'funny', 'famous', 'okay', 'wonderful', 'crazy', 'intelligent', 'other', 'loud', 'several', 'bad', 'standard', 'several', 'experimental', 'good', 'long', 'major', 'bad', 'long', 'bad', 'more'];0.0206199460916442

2007;samlikeschicken36;as an avid movie watcher, i had heard the many rave reviews of this particular film, pulp fiction. also, seeing its astonishingly high ranking on the imdb top 250 prompted me to watch it as well. i am glad to say that it was not the mainstream violence fiesta i expected it to be, but an original, clever, and plot-twisting drama. the plot contains a few different stories, one of a boxer, hit-men, and some others, that intertwine throughout the film. tarantino's style of visual narration is one of boldness, as he uses a frequently often mixed up timeline that really leaves the viewer guessing what's going to be revealed next. his directorial excellence in this element really made me appreciate the film and screenplay that much more. at times, some points in the story seemingly became meaningless, and may have possibly ended up being that way, but it was the brilliantly entertaining dialogue that effortlessly filled these gaps in my attention span and didn't let the odd tales cause a dismay in my opinion on the film. all of tarantino's scripts ooze humor, intelligence and emotional suspense, and this film i believe to be his most orally inventive. no conversation goes without a laugh or a provoked thought. the dialogue in this movie was just plain amazingly real, as these could have likely been real conversations. it is for this reason, i hold pulp fiction in such high regard as a movie, and as a game changer in the industry as far as screenplays go. the acting, i'm sure to nobody's denial, was excellent. all the characters, samuel l. jackson's being my personal favorite, executed their lines with the power and connotations that their writer intended. many fans of the actors in this film will see their favorite stars portray unlikely roles, as all of the interestingly weird people in the movie are abnormal, and great, if i might add. without argument, the acting in pulp fiction propelled its story and settings to a whole new level in cinema. though the awesomely smart, action-packed, and witty pulp fiction had some slow areas in its story and development, its excellent dialogue and quirky characters pushed it to cinematic glory. a wonderfully non-ubiquitous movie, i give pulp fiction 8/10.;2 December 2008;8;['avid', 'many', 'particular', 'high', 'glad', 'fiesta', 'original', 'clever', 'few', 'different', 'visual', 'directorial', 'more', 'meaningless', 'entertaining', 'odd', 'emotional', 'inventive', 'real', 'real', 'such', 'high', 'sure', 'excellent', 'personal', 'many', 'favorite', 'unlikely', 'weird', 'abnormal', 'great', 'whole', 'new', 'smart', 'witty', 'slow', 'excellent', 'quirky', 'cinematic', 'non', 'ubiquitous'];0.2047740005092946

2015;threewishes;"i saw this for the first time today. and whilst i cannot say i loved pulp fiction, it is extremely difficult to criticise. i gave it a 10 rating purely for its quality; it deserves nothing less. it was my curiosity to know 'what the big deal is?' that led me to finally see it. and whilst i'm not qualified to say that the film was a turning point in cinematic history, redefining its genre and such, it is undeniably an excellently executed film. if film-making could be eloquent this would be a prime example. as one reviewer pointed out, the story did not need to be told, but none-the-less it is given such style and energy and...pizazz that it feels worth it. the word 'pulp' does full justice to both its definitions. perhaps to someone who has experienced enough cinema pre-pulp fiction, it could be seen as a slap-in-the- 'this is how you tell a story folks!'. it shows that you can take characters that the audience usually treats as one-dimensional plot devices/illustrators and turns them into the 4-dimensional complex beings that they are. the characters can no longer be construed even in the loosest sense as 'good' or 'bad' and i don't think it particularly matters. people aren't good or bad; that is what makes them complex and interesting and most importantly - human. the dialogue is sharp, well-timed and original. a lot of the spoken word conversations are extremely ordinary in content, but they have the ability to make you think. it is the sort of observation you would usually keep to yourself rather than say out loud, almost as if the characters don't think before they speak. the acting of course is flawless as one would expect with the great slew of well-used talent. i could not recommend this film to anyone but a true film enthusiast - it is a fine piece of art with a 'devil may care' attitude. too cool for school but smart enough to know its boundaries. i am certainly curious to see what else tarrantino has to offer.";31 August 2009;10;['first', 'difficult', 'less', 'big', 'qualified', 'cinematic', 'such', 'prime', 'less', 'such', 'worth', 'full', 'enough', 'pre', 'pulp', 'dimensional', 'dimensional', 'complex', 'loose', 'good', 'bad', 'good', 'bad', 'complex', 'interesting', 'human', 'sharp', 'timed', 'original', 'spoken', 'ordinary', 'loud', 'flawless', 'great', 'true', 'fine', 'cool', 'smart', 'curious'];0.0974418055063216

2018;madscientistrock;"in 1994 quentin tarantino released his second movie called ""pulp fiction"". the movie is based off of pulp comics and magazines. it tells the stories of two hit men, a boxer, a crime boss, and his wife. one obvious difference with this movie, compared to others, is the way tarantino shows the events of his characters' story lines. so, the beginning is the middle, the middle can be the end, and the end is the beginning. the movie starts off in a coffee shop in los angeles and ends with this exact scene. vincent (john travolta) and jules (samuel l. jackson) are sent out by their boss (ving rhames) to collect a briefcase which has unknown contents. the only thing that is shown to the audience is a golden glow. they stroll in and surprise the three men eating a ""nutritious breakfast of big kahuna burgers."" jules speaks to these men of why they are here and what they want. after killing two of the men, a gunman comes out of the bathroom unloading a clip at them. he misses and jules and vincent take him out. this is the point where jules gains a new outlook on life. he believes that the gunman missed because of divine intervention. he decides to quit his job and walk the earth because of his made up assumptions of religion. the second story is about vincent taking his boss' wife out while he is away in florida. mia (uma therman) is a cocaine addicted woman who wants to go to a vintage fifties diner. after some persuasion, she gets vincent to go. mia's drug addiction gets the best of her and she overdoses on vincent's heroin. this leads up to one of the most memorable scenes in the movie. the last story is about a boxer (bruce willis) and a watch. this watch was passed down from his father in the vietnam war. he takes money from the crime boss to ""go down in the fifth."" instead of losing he wins. when he arrives at the hotel room, his girlfriend forgets the watch back at the apartment. in a furious rage he risks his life to get it back. when he gets it, he meets the boss at an intersection. and a brawl commences. this is the theme of the movie: being in the wrong place at the wrong time. mr. tarantino is by far the best in my opinion at creating very detailed story lines. he writes unique dialogue which binds the characters together. this is why he is my favorite director of all time, and this is my favorite movie. the way he uses time manipulation pulls the audience into the movie. anyone watching will try and guess the time line of when the events happened. i would recommend this to any action/thriller lover.";21 July 2009;5;['second', 'obvious', 'middle', 'exact', 'unknown', 'only', 'golden', 'nutritious', 'big', 'new', 'divine', 'second', 'vintage', 'din', 'vincent', 'good', 'memorable', 'last', 'fifth', 'furious', 'wrong', 'wrong', 'good', 'detailed', 'unique', 'favorite', 'favorite'];0.1630681818181818

2033;Mudo675;profanity, violence, and pop culture references abound in pulp fiction, the new movie by quentin tarantino. some may know tarantino as the screenplay writer for true romance or the writer-director of the critically acclaimed reservoir dogs, and just like those previous efforts the heart of pulp fiction lies in tarantino's brilliantly written conversations among the various characters. dialogue fuels pulp fiction to vividly show the contemptible lives of each character. tarantino has the gift of propelling the movie along through the spoken word, whereas lesser creators might rely solely on action, violence or special effects. you should note that the movie is shown in a non-linear time structure reminiscent of the critically acclaimed independent film mystery train, but this should not be an annoyance because the movie is basically a series of three related vignettes that individually add up to one great movie.;11 August 2013;7;['new', 'tarantino', 'true', 'reservoir', 'previous', 'various', 'contemptible', 'tarantino', 'spoken', 'less', 'special', 'non', 'linear', 'reminiscent', 'independent', 'great'];0.1455747955747955

2036;lindamillerpt;"pulp fiction. where do i even begin to review a film like pulp fiction. let me just start out by saying that i have never seen another film like pulp fiction. this was my first quentin tarantino film, and in my opinion none of his other films have even come close to this masterpiece. one of the greatest things about this film, and also something that sets it apart from most any other movie, is that it revolves around the dialogue. the conversations between characters in pulp fiction are unlike any conversations between characters that i have ever seen in a film, because they are absurdly realistic. this film is the most quotable movie i have ever seen, to the point where the last scene of the film i know almost every line. usually if a film tries to revolve around the dialogue, it ends up being really boring. this is because not many directors can do dialogue the way that quentin tarantino does dialogue. the acting in this movie is also incredible. this is my favorite role that samuel l. jackson has played (jules winnfield) and also my favorite role of john travolta's (vincent vega), as well as my favorite role of uma thurman (mia wallace) and tim roth (ringo). there is not one weak performance in pulp fiction. tarantino's non-linear, non-story based masterpiece is the most unique film that i have ever seen. it is entirely left up to your own interpretation. nothing in this film is explained for you. you are free to think of it however you want, and make up your own stories. once you see the film you will no doubt be left with questions such as ""what is in the briefcase,"" one of the longest standing questions asked of a film. people try to come up with the answer, but the truth is that there is no answer. the answer is whatever you want it to be. never before have i seen a film that leaves so much up to the viewer's interpretation, and does it so well. if you do not see this movie, you are missing out on one of the best movies ever made, and possibly the most unique film that you will ever see. this quentin tarantino's masterpiece by far. pulp fiction obviously gets a 10 out of 10.";11 May 2014;10;['first', 'tarantino', 'other', 'great', 'most', 'other', 'realistic', 'quotable', 'last', 'boring', 'many', 'incredible', 'favorite', 'favorite', 'favorite', 'weak', 'non', 'linear', 'non', 'story', 'unique', 'own', 'free', 'own', 'such', 'long', 'good', 'unique'];0.2723484848484849

2095;kieronmoore;"for the record, this is my favourite film of all time. a personal preference of mine in cinema is an emphasis on dialogue rather than action; and tarantino's masterpiece certainly provides in that field. the in-depth character analysis in this film is impeccable and evident from the get go; the seemingly irrelevant discussion between the characters gives the viewer an insight into the characters and also effectively makes you feel like you know them. never has a discussion about burgers and foot massages between two eccentric hit men been so entertaining. the dialogue here in this film is so great that by the time the violence comes around, you may not even care for it. this is an essential example of how not everything needs to be 'michael bay-ified' to be popular. another thing that struck me about this film is it's underlying maturity despite the 18 rating. the film is almost devoid of negative stereotypes, for example female characters are portrayed as having power; as well as one of the main and most philosophical characters being a black male alongside his apparent less powerful white colleague. another mature aspect to this film is the lack of sexual content. sure, there are a ton of references and innuendos; however no actual sex is ever shown. i feel it's too easy now for films to stay 'interesting' through the use of sex scenes. if you are expecting a run of the mill crime film, then think again! the dialogue is exceptional, the acting is exceptional (despite tarantino's personal involvement, but that's besides the point), the blend of comedy and violence is exceptional, and the characters are simply iconic. yet another point, the soundtrack is probably the best you will ever encounter in a film. it fits the mood absolutely perfectly, and whenever you hear a piece of music from this film in the future you will inevitably think of the scene in which it is from.";5 May 2014;10;['favourite', 'personal', 'impeccable', 'evident', 'irrelevant', 'eccentric', 'entertaining', 'great', 'essential', 'popular', 'devoid', 'negative', 'female', 'main', 'philosophical', 'black', 'apparent', 'powerful', 'white', 'mature', 'sexual', 'actual', 'easy', 'interesting', 'exceptional', 'exceptional', 'personal', 'exceptional', 'iconic', 'good'];0.2442528735632184

2110;jamiepearson1996;the film that perpetuated tarantino to an icon in the history of cinema is without question this one. pulp fiction is written in such a way that even though it isn't filled with wall-to-wall action it glues the audiences' eyes on the screen from beginning to end thanks to it's snapping, self-referential dialogue, layered engaging characters and at the time revolutionary form of storytelling. the film focuses around several plot lines all of which somewhat connected in their own shakespearian way, and of course the mysterious contents of the briefcase. another strong feature in the film is the stellar performances from jon travolta, samuel l jackson and uma thurman (all of which were nominated for academy awards as a result) who brought their a-game to the set, each delivering famous, ultra-quotable phrases throughout the film. yes pulp fiction is a timeless classic that will live on throughout film history.;1 May 2015;10;['referential', 'revolutionary', 'several', 'connected', 'own', 'shakespearian', 'mysterious', 'strong', 'stellar', 'famous', 'ultra', 'quotable', 'timeless'];0.2972222222222222
2111;m-golshani32;"twenty years on, quentin tarantino's pulp fiction has been rereleased in cinemas, and it looks as mesmeric and mad as ever: callous, insolent, breathtaking. the icy wit, the connoisseur soundtrack, the violence (of which the n-bombs are a part), the extended dialogue riffing, the trance-like unreality, the inspired karmic balance of the heroin scene and the adrenalin scene, the narrative switchbacks that allow john travolta to finish the film both alive and dead, the spectacle of him being made to dance badly, but also sort of brilliantly above all else, the sheer directionless excitement that only tarantino can conjure. in 1994 it broke over my head like a thunderclap, and in 1990s britain this touchstone of cool seemed to extend its dangerous influence everywhere: movies, fiction, journalism, media, fashion, restaurants, you name it. everyone was trying to do irony and incorrectness, but without his brilliance it just looked smug. (the americans get tarantino; we get guy ritchie and jeremy clarkson.) travolta and samuel l jackson play vincent and jules, a couple of bantering hit men working for marsellus (ving rhames), who is highly protective of his wife, mia (uma thurman), and about to conclude a payday from a fixed boxing match; marsellus's fighter, butch (bruce willis), is haunted by a childhood encounter with his late father's best friend (a jaw-dropping cameo from christopher walken). everyone's destiny plays out with that of a couple of freaky stick- up artists, played by amanda plummer and tim roth. in 1994, all the talk was of former video-store clerk tarantino's indifference to traditional culture. that patronised his sophisticated cinephilia, and in fact, 20 years on, the writerly influences of edward bunker, elmore leonard and jim thompson seem very prominent. don delillo began the 90s by warning that the us is the only country in the world with funny violence. maybe pulp fiction was the kind of thing he had in mind. unmissable";31 July 2015;10;['mesmeric', 'mad', 'callous', 'insolent', 'connoisseur', 'extended', 'like', 'karmic', 'alive', 'dead', 'sheer', 'directionless', 'dangerous', 'smug', 'tarantino', 'protective', 'fixed', 'late', 'good', 'former', 'traditional', 'sophisticated', 'writerly', 'prominent', 'only', 'funny', 'unmissable'];0.0303571428571428

2136;carloskonrad;i am a huge movie fan, and i watch movies almost daily, but pulp fiction is one of the few movies that made me stay on the couch and admire the experience i've just had when the credits started rolling in. pulp fiction was the movie that brought me to the crazy world of now a day legendary movie-maker quentin tarantino, known for reservoir dogs, kill bill, inglorious basterds and nearly all of his films. pulp fiction, set in the early 1990's, skillfully blends the stories of jules and vincent(samuel l. jackson and john travolta), a pair of wise-cracking hit-men and their stash of unidentified merchandise, marcellus wallace(ving rhames),the criminal kingpin they work for, his cocaine-snorting wife, mia wallace(uma thurman) and butch coolidge(bruce willis), a cold-hearted prizefighter. the chaos and fun starts when the odd lives of all these characters cross. the movie is great in all ways. tarantino is in my opinion one of the greatest directors of all time, and he shows his passion in every scene in pulp fiction. the screenplay, created by quentin tarantino and roger avary is extremely well written and the way the movie mixes it's scenes is just fantastic. it is constructed in such a nonlinear way that you could see it a thousand times and still not be able to remember what comes next. the surf-rockish theme song by tribal thunder fits the movie perfectly. many speak of memorable scenes and memorable lines from certain films, but every scene, every character and nearly every line in this film has become iconic. as much as i would like to recommend this movie to all viewers, i have to warn you that this movie is pretty violent. it includes some strong drug scenes, a very graphic rape scene and there are as well a couple of murders, so it's not really a movie to watch with your family on a friday night. otherwise, if you're a tarantino fan or like violent, wicked and dark comedies, this is the movie for you and i strongly recommend it.;26 October 2017;10;['huge', 'few', 'crazy', 'legendary', 'reservoir', 'inglorious', 'early', 'wise', 'unidentified', 'criminal', 'cold', 'hearted', 'odd', 'great', 'tarantino', 'great', 'fantastic', 'nonlinear', 'able', 'tribal', 'many', 'memorable', 'memorable', 'certain', 'iconic', 'violent', 'strong', 'graphic', 'tarantino', 'violent', 'wicked', 'dark'];0.1578674948240166

2140;scyyoung;pulp fiction is a pop cultural icon that deserves 5/5 stars. tarantino is so good at the techniques he utilizes which include non chronological events, dialogue, and a macguffin throughout the course of the film. these techniques add an effect not many other films add which divulge the viewer and graphs them close to the plot and story line throughout the film. pulp fiction utilizes a macguffin throughout the film which is a briefcase that heavily drives the plot and the respective characters and becomes so sought after but we never get the luxury as to see what it is that drives everyone and everything around them. we know this is a macguffin as it drives the plot and is crucial to the overall story line and drives all motives but we never understand exactly what it is. pulp fiction carefully constructs a non-chronological story line that is essential to the plot but seems unusual at first. this is a cool and creative directorial technique but there seems to be a method behind the madness. tarantino utilizes a non-chronological sequence of events to tell a story using a vastly different method. tarantino utilizes this technique to tell the story in a more entertaining way and makes the taste after the film that much better due to the fact that the end is pretty much in the middle of the film and we have no idea and so key events in the film are told at an immaculate time such as vincent's death. pulp fiction uses various techniques of dialogue to convey the meaning of something, foreshadow something, and set a tone throughout pulp fiction not used in many other films. dialogue is a very important factor utilized vigorously throughout the entirety of the the film. dialogue used throughout isn't used to drive the story rather than to establish a mood and set the scene. sometimes at first listen some conversations such as the fast food conversation between jules & vincent, but nothing throughout the movie is said for no reason behind every word/sentence is a meaning, such as relating back to the fast food conversations gets followed by a foot massage conversation which during their interrogation is brought up as marcellus had a man throw out of a window for giving his wife a for massage establishes the following scene where vincent takes marcellus's wife out on a date, so while the conversations are happening they might seem meaningless but later or maybe prior knowledge will explain what that conversation meant and why it was said. the theme of pulp fiction is as simple as these things happens and all characters that are so different and wouldn't expect anything more than a passing glance happen to all intertwine with one another and all of the core characters either get 'saved' or 'save' someone which is ironic due to the fact all of them are somehow involved with criminal activity. marcellus is saved from getting raped, vincent saves the gangster's wife. furthermore the use of various film techniques tarantino utilizes throughout the course of pulp fiction seemingly make 'main' characters turn into an 'extra' or non essential character and he makes the transformation seeming less. the macguffin, non chronological sequence of events, and camera angle/lens create an entire modern day atmospheric presence that indulges you into the story, which is told out of order, and forces you the viewer to really immerse yourself into the film which is why i would say pulp fiction deserves a 5/5 and commend quentin tarantino on this film.;5 June 2017;10;['pop', 'cultural', 'tarantino', 'good', 'non', 'chronological', 'many', 'other', 'respective', 'crucial', 'overall', 'non', 'chronological', 'essential', 'unusual', 'cool', 'creative', 'directorial', 'tarantino', 'non', 'chronological', 'different', 'tarantino', 'entertaining', 'well', 'key', 'immaculate', 'such', 'various', 'many', 'other', 'important', 'such', 'fast', 'such', 'fast', 'following', 'meaningless', 'prior', 'simple', 'different', 'more', 'ironic', 'criminal', 'various', 'tarantino', 'main', 'extra', 'non', 'essential', 'non', 'chronological', 'entire', 'modern', 'atmospheric'];0.0968253968253968

2150;soxfan6978;"quentin tarantino is the jerry lee lewis of cinema, a pounding performer who doesn't care if he tears up the piano, as long as everybody is rocking. his new movie ""pulp fiction"" is a comedy about blood, guts, violence, strange sex, drugs, fixed fights, dead body disposal, leather freaks, and a wristwatch that makes a dark journey down through the generations. seeing this movie last may at the cannes film festival, i knew it was either one of the year's best films, or one of the worst. tarantino is too gifted a filmmaker to make a boring movie, but he could possibly make a bad one: like edward d. wood jr., proclaimed the worst director of all time, he's in love with every shot - intoxicated with the very act of making a movie. it's that very lack of caution and introspection that makes ""pulp fiction"" crackle like an ozone generator: here's a director who's been let loose inside the toy store, and wants to play all night. the screenplay, by tarantino and roger avary, is so well-written in a scruffy, fanzine way that you want to rub noses in it - the noses of those zombie writers who take ""screenwriting"" classes that teach them the formulas for ""hit films."" like ""citizen kane,"" ""pulp fiction"" is constructed in such a nonlinear way that you could see it a dozen times and not be able to remember what comes next. it doubles back on itself, telling several interlocking stories about characters who inhabit a world of crime and intrigue, triple-crosses and loud desperation. the title is perfect. like those old pulp mags named ""thrilling wonder stories"" and ""official detective,"" the movie creates a world where there are no normal people and no ordinary days - where breathless prose clatters down fire escapes and leaps into the dumpster of doom. the movie resurrects not only an aging genre but also a few careers. john travolta stars as vincent vega, a mid-level hit man who carries out assignments for a mob boss. we see him first with his partner jules (samuel l. jackson); they're on their way to a violent showdown with some wayward yuppie drug dealers, and are discussing such mysteries as why in paris they have a french word for quarter pounders. they're as innocent in their way as huck and jim, floating down the mississippi and speculating on how foreigners can possibly understand each other. travolta's career is a series of assignments he can't quite handle. not only does he kill people inadvertently (""the car hit a bump!"") but he doesn't know how to clean up after himself. good thing he knows people like mr. wolf (harvey keitel), who specializes in messes, and has friends like the character played by eric stoltz, who owns a big medical encyclopedia, and can look up emergency situations. travolta and uma thurman have a sequence that's funny and bizarre. she's the wife of the mob boss (ving rhames), who orders travolta to take her out for the night. he turns up stoned, and addresses an intercom with such grave, stately courtesy buster keaton would have been envious. they go to jack rabbit slim's, a 1950s theme restaurant where ed sullivan is the emcee, buddy holly is the waiter, and they end up in a twist contest. that's before she overdoses and stoltz, waving a syringe filled with adrenaline, screams at travolta, ""you brought her here, you stick in the needle! when i bring an o.d. to your house, i'll stick in the needle!"" bruce willis and maria medeiros play another couple: he's a boxer named butch coolidge who is supposed to throw a fight, but doesn't. she's his sweet, naive girlfriend, who doesn't understand why they have to get out of town ""right away."" but first he needs to make a dangerous trip back to his apartment to pick up a priceless family heirloom - a wristwatch. the history of this watch is described in a flashback, as vietnam veteran christopher walken tells young butch about how the watch was purchased by his great-grandfather, ""private doughboy orion coolidge,"" and has come down through the generations - and through a lot more than generations, for that matter. walken's monologue builds to the movie's biggest laugh. the method of the movie is to involve its characters in sticky situations, and then let them escape into stickier ones, which is how the boxer and the mob boss end up together as the captives of weird leather freaks in the basement of a gun shop. or how the characters who open the movie, a couple of stick-up artists played by tim roth and amanda plummer, get in way over their heads. most of the action in the movie comes under the heading of crisis control. if the situations are inventive and original, so is the dialogue. a lot of movies these days use flat, functional speech: the characters say only enough to advance the plot. but the people in ""pulp fiction"" are in love with words for their own sake. the dialogue by tarantino and avary is off the wall sometimes, but that's the fun. it also means that the characters don't all sound the same: travolta is laconic, jackson is exact, plummer and roth are dopey lovebirds, keitel uses the shorthand of the busy professional, thurman learned how to be a moll by studying soap operas.";29 November 2005;10;['new', 'strange', 'dead', 'dark', 'last', 'good', 'bad', 'tarantino', 'gifted', 'boring', 'bad', 'bad', 'intoxicated', 'very', 'very', 'loose', 'scruffy', 'fanzine', 'nonlinear', 'able', 'several', 'triple', 'loud', 'perfect', 'old', 'official', 'normal', 'ordinary', 'few', 'mid', 'level', 'violent', 'wayward', 'such', 'french', 'innocent', 'other', 'good', 'big', 'medical', 'funny', 'bizarre', 'such', 'stately', 'envious', 'sweet', 'naive', 'dangerous', 'priceless', 'young', 'great', 'private', 'doughboy', 'more', 'big', 'sticky', 'sticki', 'weird', 'most', 'inventive', 'original', 'flat', 'functional', 'enough', 'own', 'tarantino', 'avary', 'same', 'laconic', 'exact', 'dopey', 'busy', 'professional'];0.0732954545454545

2158;grantsmyhre;a movie with no real solid plot, pulp fiction launches you smack dab in the middle of the happenings and the inter-connectedness of a group of characters. structured unusually and executed freely, the movie is deliciously cliched and groundbreaking all at once. it offers a careless normalcy to violence and crime and expresses this through the sickly humor. tarantino becomes the master of creating so much with so little, which is especially evident in the pointless yet captivating dialogue, and with the drawn out but mesmerizing shot composition. it's over the top but hell that's the fun of it all.;30 August 2020;10;['real', 'solid', 'inter', 'connectedness', 'cliched', 'careless', 'sickly', 'tarantino', 'little', 'evident', 'pointless'];-0.2336309523809524

2191;Elliot R;"pulp fiction is one of the greatest movies of the decade and a testament to the genius of quentin tarantino. building on the success of his debut, resevoir dogs, tarantino delivers a superbly-scripted, masterfully-directed, crime epic. three stories (created by tarantino and roger avery) are intertwined through the film and it unfolds, much like reservoir dogs, out of chronological order. the film was criticised by many as being too violent, although by modern standards i think it is rather tame. the violent scenes are directed and acted so well, however, that they stick in the viewer's mind long after watching the movie. i am convinced that there is a spiritual level to the movie and the theme of redemption is a very strong one; the film finishes with jules's decision to leave the violent lifestyle, although this decision is not chronologically at the end of the story. and the mysterious bright glow from marcellus's briefcase will certainly leave you wondering about unearthly elements in the film. a strong cast, including john travolta, samuel l jackson and bruce willis, certifies this film as a true classic.";15 April 1999;9;['great', 'tarantino', 'reservoir', 'chronological', 'many', 'violent', 'modern', 'tame', 'violent', 'convinced', 'spiritual', 'strong', 'violent', 'mysterious', 'bright', 'unearthly', 'strong', 'true'];0.0571428571428571

2230;william-young6;this is my all-time favorite movie, and it's hard for a guy who watches as many movies as me to even have an all-time favorite. quentin tarantino created this film at a time when movies were so stale, it made me sick. other big hit movies of 1994: homeward bound, house party 3, ernest goes to school, and cherry poppers 3-6. yeah, ok, the porns weren't really hits and neither was house party 3, but you get the picture i hope. movies sucked in '94. until pulp fiction. i begged my mom to take me to see it in theater, me being the tender age of 12 still when it came out. she wouldn't let me go until she saw it first. after she saw it, she told me to never see it. this only piqued my interest more. after all, my mom had let me rent jason goes to hell. so, sadly i had to wait for video release to see the movie. i went down to jim's market, and yes, it's actually called that. i grew up in a town of less than 200. our video store had 1 copy of every movie, and it was always in. even star wars episode 1, the day after it came out. i went down to the store, got the film (they really didn't care about ratings and kids in this small town), snuck it home, and watched it in my room while my mom played bridge with her friends. i was blown away. this movie is the movie that made me start to really appreciate cinema. this movie, made me look at all the little details that make a movie good. from his choice of actors to the soundtrack to the story presentation and amazing cinematography, this movie is as close to perfect as a movie gets. i have watched the film over 100 times easily, and it never really gets old for me. totally worth getting grounded for a week when my mom caught me slipping the video into my school bag to take back to the video store.;4 April 2006;10;['favorite', 'hard', 'many', 'stale', 'sick', 'other', 'big', 'less', 'small', 'little', 'good', 'amazing', 'close', 'old', 'worth'];0.0332057823129251

2234;bonnach;almost every serious cinephile has seen this masterpiece of neo-noir by now. i love how this film nods to classic noir, but takes it beyond the pale into the present, or the present as it was in the 90s. everyone thinks about the main thread of jules and vincent, but the true noir factor is the whole bruce willis thread as the palooka who turns the tables on the fight fixers and gets away with it, though not without suffering his just dues by the hand of zed and the gimp. every character brings something important to the show, no matter how short and seemingly insignificant their role. some of the best lines are spoken by waiters and waitresses. and bringing the gimp out of the box in the finale is just like the cherry on top. who saw that coming? the negatives? well, as with all tarantino films, the script is a bit talky. i'd like to see one of his films with minimal dialogue in the future. his latest efforts are waaaay too wordy. i get what he's doing, but god, just get on with the story already. anyway... pulp fiction has just groundbreaking editing, acting and classic storytelling all around. you can tell how influential it was by how many imitators were slapped together in the decade after if was released. it is the template that all of his subsequent films should been crafted from.;18 October 2016;10;['serious', 'classic', 'main', 'true', 'whole', 'just', 'important', 'short', 'insignificant', 'good', 'tarantino', 'talky', 'minimal', 'late', 'wordy', 'classic', 'influential', 'many', 'subsequent'];0.1474358974358974

2238;dannyswole;"unbelievable. the masterpiece without a message one of the early scenes in ""pulp fiction"" features two hit-men discussing what a big mac is called in other countries. their dialogue is witty and entertaining, and it's also disarming, because it makes these two thugs seem all too normal. if you didn't know better, you might assume these were regular guys having chit-chat on their way to work. other than the comic payoff at the end of the scene, in which they use parts of this conversation to taunt their victims, their talk has no relevance to anything in the film, or to anything else, for that matter. yet without such scenes, ""pulp fiction"" wouldn't be ""pulp fiction."" i get the sense that tarantino put into the film whatever struck his fancy, and somehow the final product is not only coherent but wonderfully textured. it's no wonder that fans spend so much time debating what was in the suitcase, reading far more into the story than tarantino probably intended. the film is so intricately structured, with so many astonishing details, many of which you won't pick up on the first viewing, that it seems to cry out for some deeper explanation. but there is no deeper explanation. ""pulp fiction,"" is, as the title indicates, purely an exercise in technique and style, albeit a brilliant and layered one. containing numerous references to other films, it is like a great work of abstract art, or ""art about art."" it has all the characteristics we associate with great movies: fine writing, first-rate acting, unforgettable characters, and one of the most well-constructed narratives i've ever seen in a film. but to what end? the self-contained story does not seem to have bearing on anything but itself. the movie becomes a bit easier to understand once you realize that it's essentially a black comedy dressed up as a crime drama. each of the three main story threads begins with a situation that could easily form the subplot of any standard gangster movie. but something always goes wrong, some small unexpected accident that causes the whole situation to come tumbling down, leading the increasingly desperate characters to absurd measures. tarantino's originality stems from his ability to focus on small details and follow them where they lead, even if they move the story away from conventional plot developments. perhaps no screenplay has ever found a better use for digressions. indeed, the whole film seems to consist of digressions. no character ever says anything in a simple, straightforward manner. jules could have simply told yolanda, ""be cool and no one's going to get hurt,"" which is just the type of line you'd find in a generic, run-of-the-mill action flick. instead, he goes off on a tangent about what fonzie is like. tarantino savors every word of his characters, finding a potential wisecrack in every statement and infusing the dialogue with clever pop culture references. but the lines aren't just witty; they are full of intelligent observations about human behavior. think of mia's statement to vincent, ""that's when you know you've found somebody special: when you can just shut the f--- up for a minute and comfortably enjoy the silence";4 May 2019;9;['unbelievable', 'early', 'big', 'other', 'witty', 'entertaining', 'normal', 'regular', 'other', 'comic', 'such', 'final', 'coherent', 'textured', 'much', 'many', 'astonishing', 'many', 'first', 'deep', 'deep', 'brilliant', 'numerous', 'other', 'great', 'abstract', 'great', 'fine', 'first', 'unforgettable', 'easy', 'black', 'main', 'standard', 'wrong', 'small', 'unexpected', 'whole', 'desperate', 'absurd', 'small', 'conventional', 'well', 'whole', 'simple', 'straightforward', 'cool', 'generic', 'tarantino', 'potential', 'clever', 'witty', 'full', 'intelligent', 'human', 'special'];0.1702147525676937

2242;s-39418-30378;"the well established filmmaker and director quentin tarantino is known for his violent and satirical subject matter, untraditional and nonlinear narrative form, and ensemble casts with actors who have regularly appeared in previous tarantino's movies. when i personally think of a quentin tarantino film, i think of over-the-top graphic violence and eloquent, dynamic, punchy, and sometimes extended dialogue. i believe that tarantino's second film, pulp fiction is the most distinguished and prominent tarantino film to ever hit the box office because there is no film that will completely make an utter mockery of america's key principles and moral and cultural values like pulp fiction does. it also has an extremely profound script which creates an ironic twist between humor and gore. the storyline is interwoven with numerous different characters and their relationships to one another. vincent vega (john travolta) and jules winnfield (samuel l. jackson) are the world's' most philosophical hitmen. they are hired by a gangster named marsellus wallace (ving rhames) and his beautiful wife mia (uma thurman). when marsellus gets screwed over in a deal by the famous boxer butch coolidge (bruce willis), marsellus hires vega and winnfield to take care of him. a particular scene that stuck out in the film was when vincent vega and jules winnfield were driving in their car after they broke into an apartment to complete a contract. they had taken the only survivor from the apartment, a young man named marvin. vega accidentally shot him in the face with his .45 caliber during a seemingly harmless conversation. this scene is one of the most violent scenes, yet one of the most humorous because vega and winnfield are yelling back and forth while the whole backseat (and winnfield's hair) has brain matter splattered about. this scene is important because it provides evidence that pulp fiction has an exceptional cast and an exceedingly rich script. there are a few negatives and flaws i would point out. the storyline jumps around to different characters and different points in time which can confuse the audience and make them unaware of what is currently taking place. another negative would be the fact that the overall plot is interfered with tarantino's self-indulgence with his own personal fixations. this can draw attention away with the themes and perspectives that really matter. lastly, the most important flaw is the blatant homophobia and racism that can be extremely offensive to some more sensitive viewers. the abundance and excessive use of the n-word has the potential to probably turn off a sufficient target audience. the prejudices found in this movie seem to fly due to the fact there is usually a pop-culture reference or joke that is said directly afterwards that seem to mask the potentially disconcerting message. the reason why i previously stated that pulp fiction is the greatest tarantino film to ever hit the box office is because i loved the screenplay and the acting. the script was extremely perplexing because it didn't seem like quentin tarantino and roger avary tried too hard to write it. tarantino's first film, reservoir dogs, was critiqued for its screenplay because movie critics thought that the writers were ""trying too hard to be cool."" i liked the acting because i am personally a fan of john travolta and samuel l. jackson. i also thought it was entertaining to see tarantino slip himself into a couple minor scenes. the special effects were superb for the year it was released in 1994. this is important because tarantino loves to entertain the audience with exaggerated violence and gore, and weak special effects in this film would hamper the movies quality, and make it look cheesy and low budget. i also enjoyed the aspect of the storyline not being presented in chronological order. i found this to add a unique and somewhat unpresidented style to the film. lastly, i thoroughly relished the overall style and setting of the movie. i have never seen a somewhat neo-noir crime thriller that somehow sprinkles in a perfect concoction of dramatic themes with a dark comedic blend. overall, i found pulp fiction to be incredibly sublime and remarkable. i advise anybody to see this film, as it is a cornerstone for independent movies. i truly believe that this film is a classic, and one of the best movies created in film history, but i'm sure many would object. this movie has no specific genre, so if you like movies in general, i would advise to see it.";3 June 2019;9;['violent',

2327;sean_baker1;pulp fiction has to be the closest a director has come to creating a masterpiece!!! tarantino has assembled an all-star cast, written one of the most creative scripts to date, and cleverly directed arguably the movie of the 90's.... pulp fiction the film is usually labeled as an action film, although to be honest, the film creates its own genre. a genre most of tarantino's films can be categorized under.. as his films all have this mood and feel to them, which he has achieved through the brilliance of his script and direction. the casting for this movie is spot on. travolta (who plays one half of a hit-man duo), must have thanked tatantino for arguably reviving his career. travolta fictional character, vincent vega, was the perfect way for him to be acknowledged by critics and steer him away from his musical/good-boy image. arguably the star of the film is samuel l. jackson. his role as jules winfield, is the role i'm sure he shall be remembered by. it know wonder he was nominated for an academy award. bruce willis, ving rhames & uma thurman also give memorable performances, ones which arguably igniting there careers, especially helping willis remove his image as a action-hero. if i was told to recommend one film to anybody... this would always be the film which first comes to mind, as pulp fiction is quite truly tarantino brilliance.

2364;bdgfrx;when i first saw pulp fiction i was blown away. i saw it twice the same day, basking in the gloriousness of this film. the film is an amazing amalgam of fabulous characters, a great plot, and the best dialogue i have ever heard in a movie. the driving force behind the film is tarantino's, sheer wild ass joy of film-making. he loves to make his characters fun yet real, having them participate in dialouges that range from food in europe to the cleanliness of pigs and dogs. though the film tears apart the conventions of a linear story, the plot still manages to be easilly followable and never feels too complicated or convoluted. this is the aspect of the film that i enjoy the most. tarantino's masterpiece is the finest film of the nineties, a clever mix of characters with angst and well written grit. pulp fiction is a milestone in modern film, defying rules and making new ones in the process.;23 October 2006;10;['same', 'amazing', 'fabulous', 'great', 'good', 'sheer', 'wild', 'real', 'linear', 'followable', 'complicated', 'convoluted', 'most', 'fine', 'clever', 'modern', 'new'];0.2656926406926407

"" if butch goes to indoe, china; i want a n***'a hidin' in a bowl a rice, ready to pop a cap in his a$$!""-marsellus wallace. but, when butch and his gal fabienne are on their way to tennessee, he discovers that his priceless gold watch(which had a troubled history getting to butch) isn't packed with his other stuff, so he must go get it. which leads to alot of suspense throughout the rest of the segment. this segment is my second favorite because of the wonderful bruce willis in a different role then his die hard films, and because of suspense i spoke of earlier. and finally, we have the bonnie situation, my favorite segment because it contains my two favorite actors: harvey keitel & tim roth. this one's plot is simple and takes place in about two different places. if i told you it would give away some of the best jokes. and believe me, the situation in this segment is best kept unsaid. rating: 4 stars out of 4";4 October 2001;10;['great', 'perfect', 'enough', 'good', 'many', 'great', 'much', 'brief', 'first', 'good', 'second', 'next', 'ready', 'gal', 'priceless', 'troubled', 'other', 'second', 'favorite', 'wonderful', 'different', 'hard', 'favorite', 'favorite', 'simple', 'different', 'good', 'unsaid'];0.3293333333333333

2404;rachabeth;"this film wins the title of my ""all time favorite movie"". why? oh, i could babble on for hours, but i won't bore or spoil you. quentin tarantino has created a masterpiece, three separate (yet intertwined) stories filled to the brim with violence, black humor, and memorable dialogue. many ""gangster"" movies overlook a crucial aspect of writing - character development. that is not the case with ""pulp fiction"". every single character (even the minor ones) is beautifully developed in their actions and words; the actors on the screen seem like real people - not just highly wealthy performers with guns. bruce willis and samuel l. jackson deliver a particularly great performance, though the other major players are marvelous as well. the three separate stories are not told in chronological order, and the viewer may become confused at times - i was definitely lost when i first watched the movie. but after viewing ""pulp fiction"" a couple times, i came to appreciate the artistic angle, the overall story being more clear and real to me. the fact that tarantino is able to pull off such a feat speaks highly of his ability. some may call this movie ""overrated"" and ""unoriginal"" but i have to disagree. while some elements of this film could be seen as cliche, tarantino delivers them in a fresh and enjoyable way. i'm a great hater of cliches, myself, and did not notice many glaring ones during the duration of the movie. it should be noted that this movie is not for everyone. there is foul language and violence abound, which may turn off some people. if you have a strong stomach and absolutely adore black, ironic humor (like me!), give ""pulp fiction"" a chance. one more great thing? the film is close to three hours long (i think. don't quote me on that), and it feels like you've been glued to the television for an hour. i have the most difficult time paying attention to longer movies, and tarantino keeps the viewer so engaged throughout, that you will feel like you've wasted no time at all. happy viewing!";21 September 2007;10;['favorite', 'separate', 'black', 'memorable', 'many', 'crucial', 'single', 'minor', 'real', 'wealthy', 'great', 'other', 'major', 'marvelous', 'separate', 'chronological', 'confused', 'artistic', 'overall', 'clear', 'real', 'able', 'unoriginal', 'fresh', 'enjoyable', 'great', 'many', 'glaring', 'foul', 'strong', 'black', 'ironic', 'great', 'close', 'difficult', 'long', 'happy'];0.2633134920634921

2522;bryce_iwaschuk;"before i could speak, i loved cinema and the films within it. i'd spent hours upon hours sitting, with my head leaning upon the television screen - probably why i now need glasses - and witness what others had to say about the world around them, or far away galaxies resting upon the edge of the universe. i was incorporated within the worlds of winnie the pooh, the wizard of oz, star wars, the godfather, or saving private ryan. i was infatuated with the entire concept behind it, and though my tastes may have broadened, few films have had such an impact on my view of cinema, as that of the quentin tarantino 1994 independent gem pulp fiction ever did. at first, it was the film's structure and creative dialogue that gripped me and hurled me headfirst into this idiosyncratic environment. yet what i have come to love the most about the film, is how much i have in common with the director, and the brilliant structure he uses to showcase these interests better than i ever could. because never has there been a director with such an infatuation towards film, that while watching his work, you could sense the satisfaction he derives through making it. because of this, all of his films, and in particular pulp fiction, brim with cinematic allusions and pastiches. and as a self-reflexive postmodern film, it comes across as a crazy house of homages and unconventional filmmaking structures. however, quentin tarantino's masterpiece remains more than a bright neo-noir shock flick of gore and black humor - it's an ode to a genre, and a contradiction of everything wrong with it. the title: pulp fiction, is a reference to the hard boiled crime novels and pulp magazines popular throughout the mid- 20th century. they were thrillers or noir-like stories printed on cheap paper made of wood pulp, and would obtain suggestive, lurid, and violent graphic novels. their characters were hard hitting, tough, and sexually inviting, all for 10 cents a copy. so yes, tarantino's 1994 film contains the same content of these wwii magazines, and even has the gritty and rough look of the authentic paper they printed on. yet the iconology is distinctive. as obsessed with cinema as he may be, tarantino drew the line between reality and film. unlike other memorable noirs such as the maltese falcon, goodfellas, or the slightly more recent drive (which i will add, are all suburb films), the characters were cardboard cutouts - being my main critique for the vintage novels, as well as these classic films. yet, to look at vincent vega, jules winfield and butch coolidge, (the three main characters through- out pulp fiction,) it is easy to recognize real individuals, who are tough, and still have fear over a situation: such as when jules' reacts to vincent after he 'blows' marvin's head off in the back seat of a car; and as well, don't spend ever hour of the day sitting at home, sharpening their knives. although the sopranos later perfected and brought reasoning to this fact, making their characters part of society and disguising themselves as members, pulp fiction places them within the daily activities of an odd group, distinguishes them from ordinary civilians, and keeps them afloat through simplistic dialogue demonstrating the needs and wants of a first world audience; such as relationships, religion, or something as simple as, what to eat for breakfast (, and i don't know about you, but i was thoroughly disappointed when fabienne had to get buttermilk pancakes instead of blueberry). it feels like a cliche to say it, but for a long time pulp fiction was my favorite film. it was as influential to me in 2010, as it was to the people who first saw it in the mid-90s. i could go on for hours discussing the unconventional style of chronology, the homages to such films as the bodyguard (: jules' famous ezekiel 25:17 biblical quote is shown within the films opening crawl), on the waterfront (: bruce willis' character butch's resemblance to marlon brando's character through a self-dilemma), or the aristocats (: from the famous twist-dance contest where uma thurman bases her moves from that of the duchess character in the 1970 disney animation). yet what makes the film so unique is not the homages to films or magazines mainstream audiences wouldn't recognize, nor the bleak humor, but through these characters and their reflections through an array of bizarre and oddly connected events. i continue to adore this film for several rationales, but to me, the people were always the most specific. they were original, just like the film, and shaped the american audience into viewers ready to find enjoyment from extraordinary people discussing foot massages and european hamburgers for several minutes of screen time. quentin tarantino... you are a genius!!!";26 November 2013;10;['private', 'entire', 'few', 'independent', 'creative', 'idiosyncratic', 'most', 'much', 'common', 'brilliant', 'particular', 'cinematic', 'reflexive', 'postmodern', 'crazy', 'unconventional', 'more', 'bright', 'neo', 'noir', 'black', 'wrong', 'popular', 'like', 'cheap', 'suggestive', 'violent', 'graphic', 'tough', 'same', 'gritty', 'rough', 'authentic', 'distinctive', 'other', 'memorable', 'such', 'maltese', 'recent', 'cardboard', 'main', 'vintage', 'classic', 'main', 'easy', 'real', 'tough', 'such', 'back', 'daily', 'odd', 'ordinary', 'afloat', 'simplistic', 'first', 'such', 'simple', 'disappointed', 'long', 'favorite', 'influential', 'unconventional', 'such', 'famous', 'biblical', 'famous', 'unique', 'mainstream', 'bleak', 'bizarre', 'several', 'specific', 'original', 'american', 'ready', 'extraordinary', 'european', 'several'];0.0525462962962962

2527;fonzi01;"pulp fiction is the excellent work of director quentin tarantino. the story and overall theme consists of four separate stories that are following the different characters through their interactions with one another in a non-chronological manner. the first story consists of gangster hit men vincent vega (john travolta) and jules winnfield (samuel l. jackson). the second story is with marsellus wallace (ving rhames), who is vincent and jules' boss, and his wife mia wallace (uma thurman). the third story follows a boxer butch coolidge (bruce willis). the final storyline is with yolanda (amanda plummer) and ringo (tim roth), which bookends the movie making its appearance at the beginning and end of the film. tarantino utilized a similar style of story in reservoir dogs, starting the movie at a point that was brought back into focus much later in the film. the story starts with yolanda (also known as honey bunny) and ringo (also known as pumpkin) discussing the finer points of how robbing liquor stores business is getting to be too risky of a business at a coffee shop. they decide they now would be a great time to rob that coffee shop as they saw it to be easy money. this will play a large role later in the movie. then you are introduced to vincent and jules. they are hit men working for marsellus. you get to see into to their gangster lifestyle. as with the execution style murder they commit to retrieve a briefcase of marcellus'. first hand, you get the see the angle of the murder like you were sitting in the room with them. a man unbeknown to vincent and jules pops out of a bedroom and fires shots at vincent and jules from point blank but they all miss. jules looks on this as being a miracle and says he's a changed man and wants to reform his life. however, the next task that vincent is assigned is one he's not familiar with. vincent has been asked by marcellus' request to show his wife a good time while marcellus is out on business. this leads into the next storyline with vincent and mia wallace. vincent accompanies mia on a dinner where they enjoy themselves over getting to know you talk and then ultimately vincent drives mia home. as vincent goes inside the wallace residence to use the restroom, mia gets what she thinks is a bag of cocaine out of vincent's jacket and helps herself to a line of it. this turns out to be a nearly fatal error as what she snorted ended up being ""the mad man"" heroin he had just purchased earlier in the day. he is able to save her life by rushing her to a friends house and administering an adrenaline shot that once again makes you think that you are in the room with them at the time its happening. after this sequence butch is introduced. when you meet him he is telling marcellus wallace that ""in the 5th he is going down"", taking a dive as they say in boxing. however, butch does not make good in his promise to marcellus and ends up killing the other boxer in the ring. he plans on making off with marcellus' money and fleeing. the best aspect of the movie is how these almost separate stories are sewn together are tied together by smart storytelling. vincent and jules are on their way to do a job for marcellus to retrieve his bag. at this job they have an informant that is waiting there for them. after the job is done they take this man (marvin) back to his side of town, but along the way while asking marvin a question vincent's gun accidentally fires off completely blowing away marvin's head in the car. they take the car to a safe house to clean it out. to rid themselves of their bloody clothes, the man who owns the safe house (jimmie) gives them very uncharacteristic, beach attire to wear. you see them earlier on in the movie in these clothes but you don't know why yet. after they get the car situation with marvin's blood all over it resolved, they stop to pick up breakfast. they go to breakfast at the same place where yolanda and ringo are planning to hold up at the beginning of the movie. the closing sequence is jules talking ringo down from holding up to the store and ultimately letting ringo go as he said he can change his ways just as jules has proclaimed he has changed his. then later on days later after a few days after the butch kills the man in the ring and tries to make off with the money. vincent is waiting for him in his apartment. however at the time that butch comes home vincent is in the bathroom, butch sees vincent's gun on the counter and ends up shooting vincent. the movie makes great strides to tell you story of the characters involved. tarantino's style of character building is excellent in this film. the first time you see the movie you might not quite understand where the story is going, but you will realize the genius of the movie by the time you are through watching it.";2 February 2011;10;['excellent', 'overall', 'separate', 'different', 'non', 'chronological', 'first', 'second', 'marsellus',

2528;klfishyklfishy;the theme of pulp fiction is how our lives interact with others and how the decisions we make now affect our lives. john travolta (vincent vega), samuel jackson (jules), bruce willis (butch), and uma thurman (mrs. mia wallace) are the four main characters in this movie. all their lives are somehow entwined with one another and are affected by decisions they make, by themselves or one of the other characters. this movie is different from other movies because it contains mini-movies rather than one movie as a whole. each mini-movie contains its' own plot that centers on the theme of the movie. it helps explain how the characters know each other and how the events that happen in their lives mix with the other characters lives. the first story revolves around a couple low-life robbers', the second is two hit men's lives, and finally a boxers life. all the stories are broken up and in random order, which was part of the movie's unique characteristic. vincent and jules are two hit men in search of their boss' briefcase. in the course of their travels they interact superbly with one another. samuel jackson, who plays jules, does a wonderful job of getting into character. bruce willis plays a character named butch who is an aging boxer wanting to make a comeback. butch is the type of character that you root for in a movie. he is down to earth, funny, and the audience can relate to him. in a way, we watch him grow from childhood to adulthood. the writer/director quentin tarantino, first made his debut with the film reservoir dogs in 1992. reservoir dogs showcased quentin's movie making magic, which also is showcased in pulp fiction. according to www.imdb.com he has written 18 scripts for television/movies and directed 15 titles (retrieved from www.imdb.com on february 5, 2010). there are two scenes that standout in my mind. first i must notify the reader that this might be a spoiler if you haven't seen the movie. the first scene is when vincent is buying drugs from his dealer. the scene goes from two people having a conversation to a close-up shot of a needle being stuck into a vein in the arm. the background is completely black and we see the needle puncture the vein, draw up blood, and then watch the blood swim in the barrel of the needle. the second scene that sticks out in my mind is when jules and vincent are riding in the car talking with marvin. this is another potential spoiler alert. the scene goes from all three characters discussing divine intervention when suddenly vincent's gun goes off. the camera starts out in the car, moving from character to character. right after the gun goes off, the camera angle is outside the car, from behind looking in. the rear window is covered in blood and then the camera moves back into the car showing the effects of what happened. jules and vincent are covered in blood, brain tissue, and pieces of skull. in conclusion, the movie pulp fiction shows how the choices that we make affect our lives. if one analyzes the movie, looks closely at each character, and what they go through in the movie we begin to understand about choices, actions, and consequences. quentin tarantino and the superb acting from the cast of the movie make it a must watch.;6 February 2011;10;['main', 'other', 'different', 'other', 'own', 'other', 'other', 'first', 'low', 'second', 'random', 'unique', 'wonderful', 'funny', 'first', 'close', 'black', 'second', 'potential', 'divine', 'rear'];0.0958333333333333

2531;treadw02;"the movie pulp fiction is a film by quentin tarantino (1994). the film host a tremendous amounts of hollywood talent notably; john travolta, samuel jackson, uma thurman, bruce willis, ving rhames, harvey keitel and even a brief cameo by christopher walken. the hollywood star power comes together to create a very unique filmed based on the very bizarre lives of a couple hit men, a boxer, a man who takes care of problems and a mob boss and his wife. pulp fiction is a very dark humored film that focuses on the misadventures of several seemingly unrelated characters whose attempts to resolve issues in their bizarre worlds only to find themselves even deeper into trouble. sam jackson and john travolta know in the film as vincent vega and jules are a couple of hit men who carry on very humorous banter about such worldly items such as how big mac's are referred to in london. the banter between vega and jules adds to the dark motif of the film as the characters are presented in a very likable light even after they execute a man. one of the most significant characteristic of the film has very little to do with the actual characters but yet instead is on the way the film is edited. bucking traditional movie flow tarantino starts the movie with a scene from the end of the film. much like the tarantino film reservoir dogs the film jumps forward and backward at will and introduces characters throughout the film that seemingly has not tied in to each other or the plot if they ever do at all. while the film is set in relatively modern times in california the movie has a very old fashioned feel to it. the costumes worn throughout the film are dated to the seventies, vega and marcellus' wife go to an old fashioned shake and burger shop and the film's soundtrack also creates a retro vibe throughout the film. the dark theme that i mentioned early in the dialogue and action is carried forward in the lighting throughout much of the film. the dark vibe of the film however is clearest seen in the scene sequence where marcellus and butch who are held hostage in the basement of a red neck gun store. the lighting in this scene is very dark as it is in an old basement. a character is dressed in an all black gimp suit and marcellus is taken off screen and sexually assaulted by the redneck store owner. while this event all takes place off screen the sounds creates a horrible visual image of the abuse going on. the movie pulp fiction is a fantastic movie both in regards to entertainment and cinematic value. the movie creates suspense in the way it is edit and scenes are shown out of order and the dialogue is very witty and entertaining in a very dark and humorous way. this film is by far the best that i have ever seen of all tarantino creations.";19 March 2011;8;['tremendous', 'brief', 'unique', 'bizarre', 'dark', 'several', 'unrelated', 'bizarre', 'humorous', 'such', 'worldly', 'such', 'big', 'dark', 'likable', 'significant', 'little', 'actual', 'traditional', 'tarantino', 'other', 'modern', 'old', 'fashioned', 'old', 'fashioned', 'dark', 'much', 'dark', 'red', 'dark', 'old', 'black', 'horrible', 'visual', 'fantastic', 'cinematic', 'witty', 'entertaining', 'dark', 'humorous', 'good', 'tarantino'];0.1001157407407407

2569;cjsabres16;"pulp fiction movie review although i am only 18 years of age, barely a legal adult, i must firmly say the film ""pulp fiction,"" directed by quentin tarantino, is the best film i have ever seen, hands down. the screenplay and storyline of the movie is not only intense, but deeply intriguing as well. the balance which is struck so masterfully by tarantino to appeal to a wide variety of movie enthusiasts is what makes the movie spectacular. being a self proclaimed tarantino fan, the structure and flow of this movie reminds of his first ever film, reservoir dogs. the film was nominated for over 5 oscar awards, but ended up winning only one, best original script. winning best original script is no small achievement. this award is a testament to the quality and time that tarantino puts into each of his movies, and the script and plot line in ""pulp fiction"" is no different. additionally, the film has some of the best actors in the modern era starring in the movie. the star cast includes samuel l. jackson, john travolta, bruce willis, uma thurman, tim roth, and ving rhames. jackson and travolta team up in the movie to play a pair of hit men, contracted to certain jobs by their boss, ving rhames. bruce willis plays the other hit men that has a personal ""beef"" with the boss of jackson and travolta. uma thurman stars as the wife of ving rhames. finally, roth plays the psychotic husband of the couple that holds up the diner at the end of film. each of the main actors in the movie have won at least two awards for their performances in prior films, showing the quality of each actor. together, all six of them mesh beautifully to create a smooth yet emotional film. after receiving what seemed like no praise or appreciation from the media, ""pulp fiction"" finally won an oscar, best screenplay. this is by far the most original and well made film that i have ever seen. many people have said that because the movie switches scenes and plot lines so much that the movie is ""unorganized"" and has no ""true story line."" i couldn't disagree with this statement more. the way that the directors mesh the different scenes and plot lines of the movie is what makes the film legendary. for example, the main storyline in the movie is the combination of jules winfield (samuel l. jackson) and vincent vega (john travolta), two hit men that work for marcellus (ving rhames). at times, the film will show the two men carrying out hits, extorting money, or extracting information by ""all means necessary."" one of the prime examples of this is the ""apartment scene,"" in which jackson and travolta enter the apartment of a handful of young men, believed to be holding cash and information. after they ask a few questions, poke around for a bit, and find what they need, they make sure that all of the men are dead, preventing them from causing future problems. this is meant to show the ""business savvy"" side of travolta and jackson, and evoke intense emotion from the viewer. but in the next scene, a completely different type of john travolta is shown, which is what makes his character so dynamic and appealing to the audience. as travolta and jackson's boss leaves town, his boss, mia (uma thurman), asks travolta to take her on a date. both of them are clearly high on drugs when they meet, making for an interesting line of action. travolta takes her to a 1950's diner which doubles as a dance club at night. as the scene progresses, thurman volunteers them for a dance, much to the dismay of travolta. travolta reluctantly accepts, following thurman to the stage. the dance goes well, as the two perform beautifully and receive a standing ovation from the crowd. but, this is just the beginning of a disastrous night. as the two leave the diner, they return to thurman's house. as travolta goes to the bathroom, mia discovers a bag of heroin, which she mistakes to be cocaine. as travolta comes back to the living room, he finds her lying on the ground, motionless, with blood running down her nose. this leads travolta to believe that it is an od. travolta brings thurman to a friend's house, where she is administered an adrenaline shot, straight to the heart. this sequence of the film is a prime example of balancing slow, suspenseful action with intense, on the edge of your seat emotion. no other director has the talent or formula to combine drama, action, mystery, and suspense all into one screenplay besides tarantino. grossing over $107,000,000 lifetime, many fans and movie enthusiasts agree with me as well (boxofficemojo.com). each time i watch the movie, i realize that it is one of the few films that i can enjoy every single time. the legendary actors, skillful directing, and balance of several different plot lines creates a masterpiece. in my opinion, that is why ""pulp fiction"" is the greatest film of all time.";19 December 2011;10;['legal', 'good', 'intense', 'intriguing', 'wide',

store clerk with a voracious appetite for movies of every conceivable style is talented and worth imitating. while tarantino has made some movies worth discussing for their positive qualities (reservoir dogs is, by far, his best effort), this group of movies is rather small, especially considering that he has only directed five movies. there is another school of thought who regards his works as inane, self-indulgent, and bloated. pulp fiction, written and directed by tarantino, and released in 1994, is his most divisive movie simply by virtue of being his most well-known. upon its release, it was hailed as a warning shot to a complacent hollywood- the maverick behind the indie hit reservoir dogs apparently had something else up his sleeve. pulp fiction is ostensibly a crime story featuring the interconnecting lives of several characters. however, upon repeat viewings, the viewer begins to wonder exactly what that something is. personally, i found this movie ran too long in spots, likely because tarantino is so ridiculously in love with the sound of his own voice as spoken by different actors that he is afraid to cut one speech or even a single line. dialogue, though it doesn't necessarily need to serve the story to justify its inclusion, should not be so dense as to drive the viewer out of the experience. when john travolta and samuel l. jackson, on the way to retrieving a briefcase for their employer, are talking about european hamburgers and foot massages, the scene plays like a witty outtake- as though the actors so understood the style of the movie that they were in that they felt comfortable riffing with the material. not so- the rest of the movie is filled with conversations of a similar type, including (but not limited to) body piercing, blueberry pancakes, hamburgers (again), and coffee (this one performed by quentin tarantino himself, as though he couldn't wait to get a shot at delivering his own lines). the strangest thing is, while the characters are ""in character"", as samuel l. jackson says in an opening scene, the movie is quite enjoyable. when the characters are placed into real confrontations, the movie takes on an entirely different persona and becomes at least a decent crime movie. ultimately, however, these scenes are few and far between and, unfortunately, the movie clocks in at 154 minutes. there's really only a decent short film in all of this. the movie also lacks what i would call a plot. the movie is described as three stories about one story, though that one story (ending, chronologically, with bruce willis and his irritating euro girlfriend riding off into the sunset) doesn't connect the characters enough to be truly about one thing. ultimately the movie is a prime example of what happens when a vcr and a wide selection of movies replace film school. the movie lacks a coherent center and seems more like something that was made for the sake of just committing something to film and resurrecting the flagging career of john travolta. the movie is too large in scope to sustain itself, and, in the end, implodes because there is really no conviction behind the presentation- too concerned with being a hipster-cool riff on a crime story, rife with pop in-jokes and 70's music (perhaps the best part of the movie is the soundtrack), somebody must have neglected to mention that the movie went nowhere and lacked the momentum to even get there. while all of these qualities combine to form a truly deplorable viewing experience, i do have to mention bruce willis and samuel l. jackson as two performers in this movie who, i felt, got away clean. bruce willis probably gets away with it because he's alone for the majority of his segment and, therefore, doesn't have anybody with whom to trade despicably derisible dialogue. samuel l. jackson gets a mention because of the scene at the very end of the movie in which he confronts tim roth's character and makes him realize that there are far more fearsome powers at work in the world than robbing a diner. in fact, the scenes coming directly at the beginning and the end of the movie are the two best, and everything else is filler. as you no doubt have guessed, i fall squarely in the latter of the two groups i mentioned at the beginning of this review. pulp fiction is inane, self-indulgent, and bloated.";18 February 2008;1;['many',

2589;mandorka74;"for those unfamiliar with writer/director quentin tarantino's cult masterpiece pulp fiction, it is a twisted combination of plots that capture the very pulp of society that are evident in its title. the plot is a non-linear combination of three main stories that intertwine with the five main characters popping in and out of all of them. all three of the stories are very simplistic in theory and purposely made stereotypical by tarantino. however, his goal was to take these classic mobster stories and add a twist to all of them. it is these aspects of tarantino's stories that change the formula from something generic and unoriginal to three of the most intense and memorable stories of film history. the glue that progresses and ties all of these stories together is the sharp natural dialogue that tarantino is so well known for. he is at the top of his game in pulp fiction providing the most natural and genuinely interesting dialogue that not only serves as something to listen to, but also actually progresses the story just as much as the character's actions do. these actions are actually what the film is most criticized for with the movie being rated r for almost everything. some claim that the movie is just an excuse to set up extreme situations of violence and substance abuse. this has caused the film to be known for its excessive and brutal nature. however, when paying closer attention, it is quite easy to see that it is largely a story of redemption. since the film revolves around less than moral individuals, it is not surprising to say that everyone who is killed in this movie could easily be considered a ""bad person"" but when examined, one will notice that every character that seeks forgiveness for their actions is alive when the credits roll. the soupy morals and excessive nature are what this movie is known for. for good reasons too, further supporting the choice for the title of the movie. however, the reason this movie has reached a certain level of greatness over the years is not only from its drugs and violence but also from its tangled story superb dialogue. with pulp fiction being the masterpiece of a director as talented as quentin tarantino, any movie fan owes it to themselves to see it.";25 March 2012;10;['unfamiliar', 'twisted', 'very', 'evident', 'non', 'linear', 'main', 'main', 'simplistic', 'stereotypical', 'classic', 'generic', 'unoriginal', 'intense', 'memorable', 'sharp', 'natural', 'natural', 'interesting', 'extreme', 'excessive', 'brutal', 'close', 'easy', 'less', 'moral', 'surprising', 'bad', 'alive', 'soupy', 'excessive', 'good', 'certain', 'tangled', 'talented'];0.0314625850340136
2590;danielsefton3;"i am sure this has been said before, but pulp fiction is one of my favourite movies. i have watched it numerous times and with each viewing more details appear, it is almost impossible to suggest that one would be able to predict every twist and every turn that occurs in this film. tarantino breaks the typical chronological order in which a movie usually functions, this is what makes pulp fiction so intelligent it is a particularly unusual feeling that occurs when the movie comes full circle and returns to the beginning as a means to conclude. it is a tool he can use to provoke different reactions from viewers, for example the death of a main character (vincent) during the middle of the movie comes as a shock especially when he resurrects unscathed scenes later. it is the lack of chronology that allows tarantino to play with his characters whilst keeping their roles prominent. this is never easy when applied to a movie in chronological order for example the death of llewellyn moss in 'no country for old men' leaves the focus on anton chigurh (though this is a coen brothers production and not a tarantino one it still assists in illustrating the importance of tarantino's chronological confusion.) as well as tarantino's intelligent filming method he uses a cast that match their character's personality, for example samuel l jackson usually plays the role of a tough yet eccentric and interesting type and christopher walken plays tends to play knowledge filled and enigmatic characters. i am in no way saying these actors are generic, i merely scrape the surface of what they are capable of. tarantino's characters (as well as other roles played by these actors) have detailed and interesting back-stories which add a significant amount of detail to the plot. he leaves the viewer with such quotable phrases such as jules' ""ezekiel 25:17"" passage (which i have found is a favourite when friends come to quote the movie.) as if the plot, characters and dialogue is not enough to gain the viewer's undivided attention it is padded with a number of details that are not directly linked to the plot yet still add interesting twists to the story. this is why the movie has to be viewed at least twice to understand most of the aspects that occur. it is tarantino's intelligent use of the minor details that make this film what it is. for example the significance of his characters in relation to his other films (when given insight) is mind-blowing. vincent vega being a direct link to reservoir dogs' 'vic vega'. and the consistent time on all of the clocks . agreed i have only touched the surface of what this movie is about, yet the detail on which this film is based cannot be put directly into words, i can simply pick up on the intelligent use of dialogue, characters the numerous twists and turns that occur and the small yet significant details that can be observed. so i really do suggest you give it a watch :)";29 March 2012;10;['sure', 'favourite', 'numerous', 'more', 'impossible', 'able', 'tarantino', 'typical', 'chronological', 'intelligent', 'unusual', 'full', 'different', 'main', 'unscathed', 'tarantino', 'prominent', 'easy', 'chronological', 'old', 'coen', 'tarantino', 'chronological', 'intelligent', 'tough', 'eccentric', 'interesting', 'enigmatic', 'generic', 'capable', 'other', 'interesting', 'back', 'significant', 'such', 'quotable', 'such', 'ezekiel', 'favourite', 'enough', 'undivided', 'interesting', 'least', 'most', 'intelligent', 'minor', 'other', 'direct', 'consistent', 'intelligent', 'numerous', 'small', 'significant'];0.1808785529715762

2601;khaliloz160;"quentin tarantino is the jerry lee lewis of cinema, a pounding performer who doesn't care if he tears up the piano, as long as everybody is rocking. his new movie ""pulp fiction"" is a comedy about blood, guts, violence, strange sex, drugs, fixed fights, dead body disposal, leather freaks, and a wristwatch that makes a dark journey down through the generations. seeing this movie last may at the cannes film festival, i knew it was either one of the year's best films, or one of the worst. tarantino is too gifted a filmmaker to make a boring movie, but he could possibly make a bad one: like edward d. wood jr., proclaimed the worst director of all time, he's in love with every shot - intoxicated with the very act of making a movie. it's that very lack of caution and introspection that makes ""pulp fiction"" crackle like an ozone generator: here's a director who's been let loose inside the toy store, and wants to play all night. the screenplay, by tarantino and roger avary, is so well-written in a scruffy, fanzine way that you want to rub noses in it - the noses of those zombie writers who take ""screenwriting"" classes that teach them the formulas for ""hit films."" like ""citizen kane,"" ""pulp fiction"" is constructed in such a nonlinear way that you could see it a dozen times and not be able to remember what comes next. it doubles back on itself, telling several interlocking stories about characters who inhabit a world of crime and intrigue, triple-crosses and loud desperation. the title is perfect. like those old pulp mags named ""thrilling wonder stories"" and ""official detective,"" the movie creates a world where there are no normal people and no ordinary days - where breathless prose clatters down fire escapes and leaps into the dumpster of doom. the movie resurrects not only an aging genre but also a few careers. john travolta stars as vincent vega, a mid-level hit man who carries out assignments for a mob boss. we see him first with his partner jules (samuel l. jackson); they're on their way to a violent showdown with some wayward yuppie drug dealers, and are discussing such mysteries as why in paris they have a french word for quarter pounders. they're as innocent in their way as huck and jim, floating down the mississippi and speculating on how foreigners can possibly understand each other. travolta's career is a series of assignments he can't quite handle. not only does he kill people inadvertently (""the car hit a bump!"") but he doesn't know how to clean up after himself. good thing he knows people like mr. wolf (harvey keitel), who specializes in messes, and has friends like the character played by eric stoltz, who owns a big medical encyclopedia, and can look up emergency situations. travolta and uma thurman have a sequence that's funny and bizarre. she's the wife of the mob boss (ving rhames), who orders travolta to take her out for the night. he turns up stoned, and addresses an intercom with such grave, stately courtesy buster keaton would have been envious. they go to jack rabbit slim's, a 1950s theme restaurant where ed sullivan is the emcee, buddy holly is the waiter, and they end up in a twist contest. that's before she overdoses and stoltz, waving a syringe filled with adrenaline, screams at travolta, ""you brought her here, you stick in the needle! when i bring an o.d. to your house, i'll stick in the needle!"" bruce willis and maria de medeiros play another couple: he's a boxer named butch coolidge who is supposed to throw a fight, but doesn't. she's his sweet, naive girlfriend, who doesn't understand why they have to get out of town ""right away."" but first he needs to make a dangerous trip back to his apartment to pick up a priceless family heirloom - a wristwatch. the history of this watch is described in a flashback, as vietnam veteran christopher walken tells young butch about how the watch was purchased by his great-grandfather, ""private doughboy orion coolidge,"" and has come down through the generations - and through a lot more than generations, for that matter. walken's monologue builds to the movie's biggest laugh. the method of the movie is to involve its characters in sticky situations, and then let them escape into stickier ones, which is how the boxer and the mob boss end up together as the captives of weird leather freaks in the basement of a gun shop. or how the characters who open the movie, a couple of stick-up artists played by tim roth and amanda plummer, get in way over their heads. most of the action in the movie comes under the heading of crisis control. if the situations are inventive and original, so is the dialogue. a lot of movies these days use flat, functional speech: the characters say only enough to advance the plot. but the people in ""pulp fiction"" are in love with words for their own sake. the dialogue by tarantino and avary is off the wall sometimes, but that's the fun. it also means that the characters don't all sound the same: travolta is laconic, jackson is exact, plummer and roth are dopey lovey-doveys, keitel uses the shorthand of the busy professional, thurman learned how to be a moll by studying soap operas. it is part of the folklore that tarantino used to work as a clerk in a video store, and the inspiration for ""pulp fiction"" is old movies, not real life. the movie is like an excursion through the lurid images that lie wound up and trapped inside all those boxes on the blockbuster shelves. tarantino once described the old pulp mags as cheap, disposable entertainment that you could take to work with you, and roll up and stick in your back pocket. yeah, and not be able to wait until lunch, so you could start reading them again.";13 May 2019;8;['new', 'strange', 'dead', 'dark', 'last', 'good', 'bad', 'tarantino', 'gifted', 'boring', 'bad', 'bad', 'intoxicated', 'very', 'very', 'loose', 'scruffy', 'fanzine', 'nonlinear', 'able', 'several', 'triple', 'loud', 'perfect', 'old', 'official', 'normal', 'ordinary', 'few', 'mid', 'level', 'violent', 'wayward', 'such', 'french', 'innocent', 'other', 'good', 'big', 'medical', 'funny', 'bizarre', 'such', 'stately', 'envious', 'sweet', 'naive', 'dangerous', 'priceless', 'young', 'great', 'private', 'doughboy', 'more', 'big', 'sticky', 'sticki', 'weird', 'most', 'inventive', 'original', 'flat', 'functional', 'enough', 'own', 'tarantino', 'avary', 'same', 'laconic', 'exact', 'dopey', 'busy', 'professional', 'old', 'real', 'blockbuster', 'old', 'cheap', 'disposable', 'back', 'able'];0.0881269592476489

2625;radfor04;the plot of pulp fiction contains three separate but intertwined stories about people living a criminal lifestyle. there is a boxer, butch coolidge, who is played by bruce willis and a gangster, marcellus wallace, who is played by ving rhames. butch and marcellus are conspiring to fix a boxing match so that marcellus can profit by placing a bet on the match. there is the wife of marcellus, mia wallace, who is played by uma thurman and a hit man, vincent vega, who is played by john travolta. while marcellus is out of town on business vincent is tasked with entertaining mia for the evening and they manage to get into trouble. there is vincent vega and another hit man, jules winfield, who is played by samuel l. jackson. vincent and jules are tasked with collecting a valuable package on behalf of marcellus and that turns out to be a very violent encounter. the theme of pulp fiction is one reaps what one sows. in several instances main characters that seem to be living a comfortable lifestyle get involved in some risky behavior and each of them ended up suffering dire consequences as a result. a motif which is repeated in pulp fiction is the bible verse ezekiel 25:17. over the course of my life i have spent far more time attending church services than i have watching pulp fiction, but this motif is so memorable that it has become the only bible verse which i have memorized. the initial citing of the verse was near the beginning of the film and it was told in a vengeful manor. when the same verse was repeated at the very end of the movie the same words told a tale of redemption. the lighting in pulp fiction is quite bright through the film. even in scenes such as a darkened bar or a convertible with the top down at night where one would expect the characters to be cast in shadows they are illuminated to the point where it almost feels as though they are facing a spotlight. there is a significant amount of violent content in pulp fiction and the entire story revolves around characters engaging in illegal conduct. despite those facts there is a definite comedic sense which emanates from the film. some of the violent scenes were so outrageous and over the top that i found myself reacting as though i was watching a cartoon where yosemite sam was firing a shotgun at bugs bunny. it doesn't get much more violent than firing a gun in the direction of another being but the audience tends to laugh it off because the action is clearly not real. another movie which intertwines the separate stories of people engaging in criminal activity is heat. heat was directed by michael mann and was released in 1995. unlike the over the top violence in pulp fiction, heat has a tone which is quite serious, and it is realistic to the point where the viewer feels as though they could be watching a live portrayal of actual events.;13 September 2012;10;['separate', 'criminal', 'marcellus', 'hit', 'vincent', 'hit', 'valuable', 'violent', 'several', 'main', 'comfortable', 'risky', 'dire', 'bible', 'more', 'memorable', 'only', 'bible', 'initial', 'vengeful', 'same', 'very', 'same', 'bright', 'such', 'convertible', 'significant', 'violent', 'entire', 'illegal', 'definite', 'comedic', 'violent', 'outrageous', 'violent', 'real', 'separate', 'criminal', 'top', 'serious', 'realistic', 'live', 'actual'];-0.0781655844155844
2626;kuntsepeace1;"novels written in the early 20th century for general audience, emphasizing exciting and titillating plots. that's what ""pulp fiction"" is defined as, and that's just what pulp fiction is, exciting and titillating. ever since reservoir dogs back in 1992, tarantino has kept on producing top quality films such as this one in 1994, the kill bill series, death proof, and most recently, inglourious basterds. one of quentin tarantino's greatest work and truly a masterpiece in it's own sense, the timing was perfect; made during the transition phase from the 20th to the 21st century, pulp fiction isn't too intense for the past generation and isn't too old for the current to disapprove of. it won the palme d'or award when it premiered at the cannes film festival. although tarantino and his screenplay partner roger avary received the award only for the best original screenplay, it was also nominated for the best picture and the best director at the 1995 academy awards. there are numerous other awards and countless nominations that pulp fiction has received over the years. if you're familiar with tarantino's earlier works, then you know that nonlinear storytelling is his trademark. this is also incorporated in pulp fiction where the narrative is structured around three separate but intersecting story lines. the lead of the first story is the mob hit-man vincent vega, played by john travolta. the boxer butch coolidge, played by bruce willis, is the lead of the second, and vincent's partner, jules winnfield, played by samuel l. jackson, is the lead of the third. it is an excellent example of a postmodern film, where mainstream conventions and norms are twisted and churned into brilliance. but i do warn the easily queasy and squeamish, there is a lot of graphic violence, drug use, and profanity in this movie. it is definitely not a movie for children to watch and i wouldn't recommend taking your date out to watch it. however, if you aren't familiar with this type of storytelling and think you can handle the violence, you should definitely give it a go. when i first saw pulp fiction, i didn't know what to expect either. the movie poster seemed like an old cheap rundown book cover and i had never heard of tarantino before. however, after my first watch, i was totally sold. the acting by travolta, willis, and especially, jackson were profound; it was their prime performance. the cinematography, lead by the same people who had worked with tarantino on reservoir dogs, fit the story very well. an excellent portrayal of this is in the scene in the car where vincent accidentally shoots marvin in the face and his matter is spread all over the interior of the car. marvin's body and the gunshot wound aren't shown in the movie; the audience only sees the gunshot and a lot of blood in the car. this allows the viewer to imagine the scene in his/her own way. the nonlinear storytelling is also well portrayed in this movie. it might throw the average viewer off at first; however, you get accustomed to it, and by the end, you've a good understanding of the plot. also, the dialogue in the movie is very plain and normal; the characters' conversation is what an average joe would have when doing the same thing. this makes the characters relate with the audience. an example of this is in the scene in the beginning of the movie where vincent and jules discuss about a quarter-pounder with cheese from mcdonalds being called royale with cheese in france because of the metric system. pulp fiction is truly something worth watching in your lifetime. i definitely recommend this movie; even if you don't enjoy it, you will appreciate the genius it oozes. so grab your popcorn with extra butter and your diet pepsi, or what have you, lie back on your couch, and enjoy!";24 September 2012;9;['early', 'general', 'exciting', 'exciting', 'reservoir', 'top', 'such', 'inglourious', 'great', 'own', 'perfect', 'intense', 'past', 'old', 'tarantino', 'good', 'original', 'good', 'good', 'numerous', 'other', 'countless', 'familiar', 'early', 'nonlinear', 'separate', 'first', 'second', 'third', 'excellent', 'postmodern', 'queasy', 'squeamish', 'graphic', 'familiar', 'old', 'cheap', 'tarantino', 'first', 'profound', 'prime', 'same', 'reservoir', 'excellent', 'own', 'nonlinear', 'average', 'accustomed', 'good', 'plain', 'normal', 'average', 'same', 'metric', 'worth', 'extra'];0.2671201814058957

2630;phillipjlindsey;the post-modern film relies heavily on both music and visual style to create something which has ultimately inspired a new generation of filmmakers. it's main strength comes from the character driven monologues and stellar performances of its a-list cast. pulp fiction takes on a new dimension upon repeat analysis and evolves with it audience and time period. give it another watch and your likely to pick up a new interpretation hidden in the existing world of this top-notch film. unlike quentin tarantino most current line of revenge films, pulp fiction has a slow and less action oriented pace which gives his witty dialogue more of a stage for the actors to push the boundaries of realism and formalism.;11 April 2016;8;['post', 'modern', 'visual', 'new', 'main', 'stellar', 'new', 'likely', 'new', 'top', 'current', 'slow', 'less', 'witty', 'more'];0.147077922077922
2631;carlitosway-1;for many conversations that have started with my friends asking top ten movies of all time, i always have this movie in the top 3 and that is only because there a couple of mobster movies that i like to place as one & two and they are the godfather and the untouchables but the race between the three is so tight!! i like to think of mr. tarantino as king midas because for me, anything he touches turn to gold, at least in my mind!! and pulp fiction is his magnum opus!! first of all john travolta owes him his career, john travolta had fell off the hollywood map of sorts before he catapulted him back into the actor that is in demand now. every character in this movie had a charming personality and could stand on their own merit to make their own spin off movies. as quentin's evident and consistent style the soundtrack of the movie was eclectic and alluring, there isn't a single song in that soundtrack that i don't enjoy and i can honestly say that before this movie if i knew more than 2 of the songs it was probably a lot! the dialogue, the dialogue, omg!! the brilliant dialogue!!! this movie has some of the very best lines ever, my friends and i will sit down and watch the movie and see how much more one of us knows than the other and every chance we get we quote the movie!! for those of you who live under a rock and have never seen this movie you will find that it stimulates your cinematic palate for the rest of your life or you simply don't get it, nor desire to and quite frankly i feel bad for the latter!! if you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for!?!? and if you have seen it, it's time you see it again, then again, then again at least 100 hundred more times, for me it never gets old and i always enjoy it beginning to end!! thank you mr. tarantino for this masterpiece!!!!!!;13 May 2012;10;['many', 'top', 'top', 'tight', 'least', 'magnum', 'charming', 'own', 'own', 'evident', 'consistent', 'eclectic', 'alluring', 'single', 'more', 'brilliant', 'good', 'more', 'other', 'cinematic', 'bad', 'latter', 'more', 'old'];0.2726190476190476
2632;finephily2;absolute carnage pulp fiction is a dramatic narrative of the lives of two diner armed bandits, a boxer, a gangster's wife, and two mobster hit men that unravel into four separate tales of violence and redemption. as the turn-of-events of each story unfolds, it starts with the beginning from the end of each individual story and ends at the beginning. a single bible quote, illegal drugs, pawn shop mayhem, and an unexpected robbery kept the viewers at the edge of their seats. the film successfully attempts to correlate all four story lines simultaneously. i believe it was the intention of the writer quentin tarantino, to depict the characters of their completely different life styles. i think tarantino wanted to show how different each lifestyle was, but they all had one thing in common. they all thought that they were the most powerful entity in the stages of the game, but they found themselves vulnerable to others. the crime boss thought no one was more powerful than he, until he got caught up in the pawn shop mayhem. feeling very much in control and powerful, the hit men had a mishap and found themselves controlled and powered by another. the gangster's wife felt she was powerful by being married to the crime boss, but she lost her power by her illegal drug habits. from a direct order from the crime boss, the boxer chooses to ignore the directions thus, showing his power. his power was taken away as soon as he did not fulfill the deal. the two diner bandits had the power of a handgun, but soon lost their power when meeting up with the hit men with guns pointed at them. i found a couple mistakes in this movie in which i believe there should have been more accuracy. recitation of the bible quote, ezekiel twenty-five, was not quoted accurately as it is written in the bible. the acura that mr. wolf drove was a two seat vehicle and he invited his girlfriend to breakfast and offered to give the hit men a ride home. how is this possible? i often wondered how a hit man for a crime boss could leave his gun in the kitchen of the steak-out house and use the restroom! i found the film unique, challenging to watch, and written well.;19 October 2012;10;['absolute', 'dramatic', 'din', 'armed', 'separate', 'individual', 'single', 'bible', 'illegal', 'unexpected', 'different', 'different', 'common', 'powerful', 'vulnerable', 'powerful', 'powerful', 'powerful', 'married', 'illegal', 'direct', 'din', 'more', 'bible', 'possible', 'hit', 'unique'];0.0210119047619047

2644;gogoenriques;in my opinion pulp fiction is the best written film of all time. pulp fiction started out as what was supposed to be four different shorts, all put in one movie, each directed by a different filmmaker. four rooms is an example of this. writer/director quentin tarantino came up with the idea of melting all the short movies together to make one, and let me tell ya, it was the best decision he's ever made to date. pulp fiction isn't only a landmark in cinema and film history it is also one of the greatest examples of pop culture. the music is another element that makes this movie great. quentin tarantino has said that in movies he looks forward to the moment when the music in a scene is blended to it. according to him, and to me, music should't just escort a scene, it should't just serve the purpose of not letting the audience feel bored during a long romantic/existential scene. the music should be part of the scene, meaning that if the music isn't there neither is the scene. an example in the movie is surf rider at the very end. personally pulp fiction is my favorite film, at the same level of outrage by takeshi kitano. many have compared the two great directors because of their great use of violence in their movies. i don't agree, personally they are opposite and that is why i like them. yes, they both use violence, but in completely different ways.;5 October 2015;10;['different', 'different', 'short', 'good', 'great', 'great', 'bored', 'long', 'romantic', 'existential', 'very', 'favorite', 'same', 'many', 'great', 'great', 'opposite', 'different'];0.28125

2650;shmakaka6;when i first heard about pulp fiction it was from my father who told me that it is a really cool, unique crime film. i was 8 years old and it wasn't that i couldn't see the movie because my parents aren't crazy like that. i didn't come around to see pulp fiction until i was 13. i found it on hbo on demand and decided to rent it because it was something i always wanted to see. i absolutely fell in love, not just with mia wallace, the directing, the music, the beauty of three unique stories scattered around to form something that can be considered one of the best movies of all time. quentin tarantino immediately went down as my favorite director and a genius. i bought it on dvd vhs the soundtrack, the poster, i'm buying the script signed by all the cast. it is nothing less than a masterpiece. from two hit-man arguing over whether a foot massage or eating a girl out is in the same ballpark, to a mysterious briefcase that shines gold, pulp fiction is everything you want in a movie, and more. never have i seen such a movie that goes deep into the characters and their actions. pulp fiction is like the day in the life of a crime bosses' wife, two hit men and a boxer and how it all fits together. outstanding.;31 August 2004;10;['cool', 'unique', 'old', 'crazy', 'unique', 'good', 'favorite', 'less', 'same', 'mysterious', 'more', 'outstanding'];0.2194444444444444

2652;hobbylos96;as someone who hasn't seen that many movies but knows a bit about literature, arts etc. i can definitely admire most of the movie. i see why this movie has become so important for cinematography. besides, it is also enjoyable to watch, some scenes are just straight out funny in their own and odd way. still, i can't really get into a flow when watching the movie, there is no magic taking place for me like it is with the best of the best movies. this is probably due to a lack of knowledge on my part but also owed to the fact that the movie is not made to be the most entertaining one, but rather to show what is possible when it comes to narration style and combining different style elements. so in summary: you won't get bored watching the movie, you sort of have to have seen it and you will definitely realise that this movie is a piece of art, it is however, a different question to what extend you can admire that. hence the 8/10, for me the movie should be a bit more plot driven to get 9 or 10 stars, but of course it was intentionally decided against that;20 February 2016;8;['many', 'most', 'important', 'enjoyable', 'funny', 'own', 'odd', 'good', 'good', 'due', 'entertaining', 'possible', 'different', 'bored', 'different', 'more'];0.2723958333333333

2654;raoulvdhoorn;"for stuart turner, the road to my skeleton has been long and winding. edinburgh native, optimo regular, dj, red bull music academy graduate, refugee from rock groups such as degrassi, russia and american men, and for a short period a trainee corporate lawyer, much of turner's debut album as claude speeed was sketched out on a guitar and laptop while he was travel-ling through india, singapore and cambodia. subsequently, this material was refined and mixed at locations including hudson mohawke's studio in london and kuedo's studio in berlin, but it would be wrong to assume my skeleton was in any way designed for club consumption. instead, turner's recent fact mix which eschewed beats in favors of twinkling drifts and droning computer music offers a useful signpost to my skeleton's contents. present here is the fluorescent cynthy glow and adhd maximals that's common to his peers on the luckyme roster, but what's within is on a dreamy, ambient tip, melding classical minimalism, post-rock, cosmic cynthy and systems music with an eye for personal exploration and spiritual reflection. contemporary readings of such genres sometimes feel like the stuff of battle re-enactment, too studied to transcend their rich histories. on my skeleton, though, turner often takes pains to keep his music feeling living and breathing. 'tiger woods' and 'spectral choir' employ dancing steve reich patterns, but through these turner laces weaving woodwind and ringing strings with half-heard field recordings from his travels, the bustle of a marketplace or the hum of traffic. there are songs, too: the melancholic twinkle of 'hold on', featuring the folksy tones of female vocalist lw; or 'taj mahal', in which turner takes the mick in a manner that reminds me a little of phil elverum's work in lo-fie experimentalists the microphones, his sleepy and sincere words half- buried under droning soft xanthus and star bursts of heavily treated post- rock guitar. the title track breaks from the record's largely electronic recreations to employ a real string quartet, although thanks to pitch- shifting and diligent layering, there feels like no hard breaks between the real and the synthesized. there is trauma here, too, albeit sublimated into these woozy folds of sound. turner's trip was prompted by bereavement, and here and there my skeleton takes a turn into darkness. the dom post-rock build of 'prove you exist' apparently went by the working title of 'claude speeed you black emperor', while 'some other guy', which vacillates between diaphanous ambiance and harder mego-like drones, is supposedly inspired by a visit to a tower of human skulls in cambodia's killing fields. in the hands of some, this might come across slightly glib, a bit selie- at-auschwicz, but throughout my skeleton, there's the sense that turner is out to honestly communicate his own experience, even when emotions are embryonic, or sensations twisted by tiredness or fever. the result is a record that keeps the sense of a human being on a passage of exploration, its internal emotional landscape porous to the influence of the tumult and chaos of the world outside.";10 August 2014;10;['long', 'winding', 'optimo', 'regular', 'red', 'such', 'american', 'short', 'trainee', 'corporate', 'much', 'wrong', 'recent', 'useful', 'present', 'fluorescent', 'cynthy', 'common', 'within', 'dreamy', 'ambient', 'classical', 'post', 'cosmic', 'cynthy', 'personal', 'spiritual', 'contemporary', 'such', 'rich', 'spectral', 'melancholic', 'female', 'little', 'phil', 'sleepy', 'sincere', 'soft', 'electronic', 'real', 'diligent', 'hard', 'synthesized', 'dom', 'post', 'rock', 'black', 'other', 'diaphanous', 'hard', 'mego', 'like', 'human', 'glib', 'own', 'embryonic', 'human', 'internal', 'emotional', 'porous'];0.0039141414141414

2675;adammurrayxd;tarantino for me is a good director. not a great director and certainly not the best. many people i know hail pulp fiction as not only tarantino's best film ever, but the best film of all time. i like tarantino. he is a smart writer with a lot of interesting ideas. some of which i think are better than the others. pulp fiction contains a lot of those brilliant unique ideas but i feel, fails to put them into practice in order to make an interesting and exciting film. *spoilers ahead if you haven't seen the film already go watch it and decide for yourself. then see if you agree with me after.* any good film should have characters that the viewer can care about and be interested in. now seeing as pulp fiction is split in to different stories of different people that is already a hard thing to do. hard but not impossible. sin city despite its many faults had me rooting the whole way through hoping that bruce willis would be safe and manage to rescue jessica alba from the clutches of that strange yellow guy. pulp fiction however does not manage the same. after the incredibly smart conversation between travolta and jackson in the opening scene i was loving the film. i really liked the writing even if this sort of philosophical conversation didn't quite fit travolta's pony-tailed hit-man character. the abrupt switching to bruce willis' story then made me almost forget about travolta all together, so much so that when, who i thought was the main protagonist, gets shot halfway through the film. it didn't really mean anything. i moved on. it wasn't impacting enough for me to feel any sort of emotion. it was like when the wise talking heavy gunner in a vietnam movie gets shot. you quite liked him. but you can move on without him. the scene with harvey keitel however was brilliant. my favourite part of the film without a doubt. its just a shame he didn't play more of a part. other than characters, i felt that the films real weakness was the lack of any strong plot. yeah all of the crooks stories manage to inter-wind but i didn't feel that they were interesting enough for that to be the films main selling point. i felt at the end i had quite enjoyed what i just saw but really i could have not seen it and went on with my day. i personally feel like pulp fiction is a film that relies entirely on its style to try and carry it forward. i will admit, it is a film with a very well written script, great conversation pieces and an incredible cast. it just fails at being anything more than boring.;28 June 2013;6;['good', 'great', 'good', 'many', 'good', 'good', 'smart', 'interesting', 'well', 'brilliant', 'unique', 'interesting', 'exciting', 'good', 'interested', 'different', 'different', 'hard', 'impossible', 'many', 'whole', 'safe', 'strange', 'yellow', 'same', 'smart', 'philosophical', 'fit', 'pony', 'abrupt', 'main', 'enough', 'wise', 'heavy', 'brilliant', 'favourite', 'more', 'other', 'real', 'strong', 'inter', 'interesting', 'main', 'great', 'incredible', 'more'];0.3409407665505227
2676;tranquilo1212;"quentin tarantino makes this film what it is. his attention to detail, sense of irony, dark humor and ability to create characters with equally recognizable and memorable traits make this movie an unparalleled masterpiece. the vastness and complexity of the plot prevents flaws and keeps the viewer intrigued. it also contains the element of surprise. tarantino makes fun of surprise twists, so the results are often darkly hilarious and occasionally quite disturbing. the movie is in essence a study of four cases of characters with rigid personalities meeting and seeing who gives in first. samuel l. jackson plays jules winnfield, a gangster who doesn't budge to anyone and takes advantage of others with his voice. jackson has talked down opponents in many movies, but never as well as he does here. jules' partner in crime, vincent vega, is played by john travolta. this movie was a renaissance for travolta, as it began his trend of playing tough guys who play it cool (as in ""get shorty""). the boss of jules and vincent is marsellus wallace, who is played by ving rhames. marsellus is clearly defined as someone you do not want to anger or mess with, like any traditional mob head. his wife mia, played by uma thurman, is a drug addicted party girl who lives the flashy life her husband's business has made her accustomed to. finally, there is butch coolidge, a tough as nails boxer whose wits and disobedience put his life in danger. all these characters meet up with each other in different ways in the intertwining stories of the movie. the interactions between these characters are what makes the movie work despite the lack of a truly linear plot. the way that scenes are filmed and the plot is placed is taken from other movies; tarantino is a genius at combining elements of older movies into a film that is equally intricate and rich in humor, gore, characters, plots. he has done this for all of his films. however, of all of his films, this is his best. and for the intricacies involved, it may be the best movie...of all time. if nothing else, this movie will be revered 40 years from now the same way that ""the godfather"" is today.";20 February 2005;10;['dark', 'recognizable', 'memorable', 'unparalleled', 'tarantino', 'hilarious', 'disturbing', 'rigid', 'many', 'tough', 'traditional', 'flashy', 'accustomed', 'tough', 'other', 'different', 'linear', 'other', 'tarantino', 'old', 'intricate', 'rich', 'good', 'good', 'same'];0.0804012345679012

2679;NuXta;"i have read many of the negative reviews of this film here, and i must say that, on the surface of the matter, i agree with a good deal of what is being said. however, i propose that most of these like-minded reviewers have missed the point. they unwittingly give the film (and its self-loving, narcissistic director) too much credit by taking it seriously enough to attempt enough of an analysis to draw out its transparent weaknesses. the title itself is a giveaway as to the significance of this film. pulp fiction does not have a purpose beyond appealing to base drives and hormonal imbalances masquerading as emotional responses to meaningless, juvenile drivel that is endowed with flashes of various disturbing imagery. it is really nothing more than a sick slice of hollow experimentation in what too often passes for praiseworthy film-making nowadays. the distinct lack of a coherent plot, the disjointedly interwoven and half-baked story lines, the absence of characterisation and dramatic depth (or plausibility), the pointless and empty dialogue, the banal pop culture references, and the graphic, overblown, absurd depiction of grotesque acts of rape, sordid violence, drug abuse and superfluous profanity, among other things one could point out all of which is tauntingly presented as ""a bit of fun"" only serve to reinforce tarantino's depraved worldview, hunger for attention, and bloodlust for indulging in cynical exercises in arson that unfortunately pass for artistic merit, in the nihilistic vein of the so-called postmodern ""style"". so much for cinematic realism. are we supposed to be shocked or impressed by any of this? do we honestly expect anything better? tarantino celebrates human excesses, but there is virtually no humanity in most of his work. i would not go so far as to state that his films are unwatchable (i quite enjoyed jackie brown), but they are certainly not improving with the passage of time. the present state of life in america, and all over the world, poses a demand for conscious filmmakers and artists to fill the cultural void to represent conditions as they are experienced. quentin is incapable of filling that void. he is part of the void. anyone looking for substance, inspiration, or even just a decent ""art house"" flick, will likely be disappointed by pulp fiction. the best thing about this piece of work is by far the soundtrack. the trouble with ratings is that most fans of this film are now, or were teenagers when it was released (including myself), and cannot bring themselves to shake off the hype that came out with it. i will admit i was one of them too, at the tender age of 14. thankfully, i rapidly grew out of the phase and developed a sense of perspective. i understand that there is a place for films such as this in our society, but it is definitely not anywhere near the top. i place it towards the bottom of the heap. too many others of my generation have failed to take this step, largely due to their lack of exposure to genuinely great works of art, coupled with confused political misconceptions. as a consequence, they generally don't have much of an eye or a taste for quality, because in a sense, they barely seem to believe in the validity or redeemability of the human condition. a pitiable state of affairs, really but one whose examination might make for a far more interesting film, if anyone with talent and insight dared to make it. i'm looking at you, kiarostami.";27 March 2010;2;['many', 'negative', 'good', 'most', 'like', 'minded', 'narcissistic', 'much', 'enough', 'enough', 'transparent', 'hormonal', 'emotional', 'meaningless', 'juvenile', 'various', 'disturbing', 'more', 'sick', 'hollow', 'praiseworthy', 'distinct', 'coherent', 'interwoven', 'half', 'dramatic', 'pointless', 'empty', 'banal', 'graphic', 'overblown', 'absurd', 'grotesque', 'superfluous', 'other', 'depraved', 'cynical', 'artistic', 'nihilistic', 'postmodern', 'cinematic', 'well', 'tarantino', 'human', 'most', 'unwatchable', 'present', 'conscious', 'cultural', 'incapable', 'decent', 'good', 'most', 'such', 'many', 'due', 'great', 'confused', 'political', 'much', 'human', 'pitiable', 'interesting'];0.0292207792207792

'misirlou' sets a funky tone for the film during the opening credits. structurally, the film is divided into seven sequences, which have connected stories. as expected, the cameo from tarantino himself as jimmie, the distraught husband in arguably the most entertaining part of the film - the bonnie situation - proves to be the cherry on the cake.;19 August 2014;10;['magnum', 'absolute', 'visual', 'exemplary', 'nonlinear', 'open', 'powerful', 'black', 'tarantino', 'interesting', 'replete', 'iconic', 'twist', 'mexican', 'hearted', 'violent', 'great', 'funky', 'entertaining'];0.1666666666666666

2700;kedarshetye;the outrageously funny dialogue of this movie is what really drives it. quentin tarantino writes some of the most entertaining dialogue there is to write between two characters. despite its over two and a half hours long run-time, pulp fiction does not drag in the slightest as it is basically multiple exhilarating movies rolled into one with an all-star cast that perfectly fits in tarantino's zany universe. you actually are left wanting for more as the end credits begin to roll. even after watching the movie more than a dozen times, i still can't remember what scene comes next. however, it's non-linear narrative structure isn't what makes pulp fiction a near masterpiece, its true strength comes from the excitingly fresh characters and the crazy events that take place in the film. and of course, the quirky-smart dialogue. the characters in the movie are always talking yet always so interesting. you never really think you'd enjoy a movie about the lives of two mob hit men, a boxer, a gangster's wife, and a pair of diner bandits, it all just feels so random, yet it intertwines so brilliantly. i love it. undoubtedly, one of the most quotable movies ever and most certainly my favourite movie of all time. so, pulp fiction, 10/10? correctamundo.;3 June 2016;10;['funny', 'entertaining', 'long', 'slight', 'multiple', 'more', 'more', 'non', 'linear', 'near', 'true', 'fresh', 'crazy', 'quirky', 'smart', 'interesting', 'din', 'random', 'quotable', 'favourite'];0.1265079365079364
2701;rolandoh22;i liked the way quentin tarentino he took the story back and ford and how he developed the inciting incident in the storytelling. the character development for the protagonist was great. john travolta's performance was great. he knows how to transform a character and leads viewers to believe one thing instead of what it really is. uma thurman delivered a spectacular performance. she can really bring a character to it's maximum state of craziness. the cinematography could have used more work but overall it was good. i always thought tarentino can show viewers different types of movies. he can take a story and develop it to make some drastic moves. overall is a must watch kind of movie since everyone can interpret it differently.;24 September 2013;7;['great', 'great', 'spectacular', 'maximum', 'more', 'good', 'different', 'drastic'];0.5666666666666668
2702;d-neal3444;"pulp fiction is a story of how two hit men vincent and jules who work for l.a.'s crime boss marcellus wallace and how jules begins to have a change of heart due to feeling that he witnessed a miracle for god. it is also about a boxer who double crosses the crime boss and how they eventually handle their conflict. there are also sub plots about marcellus wallace's wife and her night out on the town with her husband's employee vincent vega. all of these stories culminate in jules having an epiphany as he spare the lives of a ""would be robber"" couple. in this film, quentin tarantino weaves several extreme stories together- some romance, a little contract killing, drug use and overdose, kidnap, rape, a double-cross and a manhunt- into an extremely shocking, yet entertaining coherent film. in this movie there are multiple themes communicated to the viewer. one of the prominent themes was about never judging people because anyone at anytime can change and choose to become more. he demonstrated that theme in scenes where enemies become allies and hit men save life instead of taking it. another major theme was that every choice a person makes has its inevitable consequences. tarantino emphasized this by showing those who choose to hurt people will be repaid in kind. the cheater gets cheated, a killer gets killed, and people who abuse drugs nearly die from overdose. tarantino also uses his creative license throughout this film in order to jump back and forth in time thus drawing the viewer in. tarantino deliberately leaves the viewer trying to figure out what is going on piece by intriguing piece, as well as allowing the viewer to try and understand the behavior of characters in earlier scenes that while entertaining seemed shocking and sometimes comically absurd. although sometimes viewers may know or think they know what will happen to a particular character before it happens, it is still impossible to know how that character will react or what kind of impact it may have on the other characters within the film. quentin tarantino is totally unpredictable so that makes outguessing him nearly impossible. tarantino's movies on the other hand, always have his signature flare. this movie is filled with shocking dialog, and he creates comedy by contrasting extreme violence with irony. there are instances where characters would have casual conversations about being vegetarian, or the big kahuna burger while in the process of killing a roomful of people. one of them even asked one of the soon to be victims if he could taste his kahuna burger and have a sip of his tasty beverage. the length of the movie was a bit long (two and a half hours) and does have long stretches of dialog with little action, but the outrageous and shocking action scenes that follow definitely make them worth tolerating. overall this film is very entertaining with surprising plot twists and a powerful conclusion. with shocking scenes and witty dialog, along with an all star cast, this movie should be on everyone's must see list.";11 August 2013;9;['marcellus', 'marcellus', 'tarantino', 'several', 'extreme', 'little', 'double', 'shocking', 'entertaining', 'coherent', 'multiple', 'prominent', 'more', 'major', 'inevitable', 'creative', 'intriguing', 'early', 'shocking', 'absurd', 'particular', 'impossible', 'other', 'unpredictable', 'impossible', 'other', 'flare', 'shocking', 'extreme', 'casual', 'vegetarian', 'big', 'tasty', 'long', 'long', 'little', 'outrageous', 'shocking', 'worth', 'entertaining', 'surprising', 'powerful', 'shocking', 'witty'];-0.106469298245614

2705;Divinelink;it actually took me so long to watch this movie, even though it has be suggested to me so many times but for some reason i would not just watch it. and boy, i was so wrong. it is well known that quentin tarantino has done prodigious work over the years of his career followed up by reservoir dogs and kill bill: vol 1 & 2 but pulp fiction is without a doubt his masterpiece. now to the movie review. what i like most of this film is that it will keep you interested during the whole experience without the existence of unimportant scenes and characters, boring gaps in between the scenes and leaving no unanswered questions or plot holes. there are plenty of characters and with that said almost every viewer can associate with someone. during the movie you will experience a bunch of feelings: sadness, pity for some characters, gross and laughter. trust me on this one, you will laugh a lot. especially with samuel l. jackson's acting and generally the conversations between them. not only that though, some things said will make you appreciate life, question some things you may have in your life, decisions and principles leaving you at the end of it a better man or at least a skeptical one. to sum up, some good points of the movie: realistic and moving conversations, check! incredible acting, check! interesting flow without getting bored, check! music & soundtrack that fits the movie, check! it's a unique experience and i would recommend it to everyone, especially to drama/crime fans out there.;21 February 2016;9;['many', 'wrong', 'prodigious', 'reservoir', 'most', 'interested', 'whole', 'unimportant', 'boring', 'unanswered', 'gross', 'well', 'least', 'skeptical', 'good', 'realistic', 'incredible', 'interesting', 'bored', 'unique'];0.0465686274509803

(obviously talking about who directed it, etcetera) since its kinda like the 'lighthouse' which is just insanely good also for being a suspensful, strange, surreal movie... just odd that daniel day lews isnt in it, but then again, considering that willem dafoe did such a job, doubt they would've needed ddl. not saying i'm not a fan, i am, same with this fine and very humour driven actor named christoph walz(t?) who's by far blown me and my fellow movie lovers away with his performances and from what i've gathered, using research and such, quentin was the man who found another nugget, heck, he could probably make anyone shine, just cause he's that darn good, plus i love that he loves old school cinema too, them robert rodriguez flicks he made, grindhouse, death proof etcetera, just shows how much he's evolving from golden oldies like this, insanely great movies.... and just cause its from 1994, dont let it fool ya, it will leave any youngun who thinks a movie has to have michael bay blowing stuff up for 9 hours non stop, gasping for air after watching a viewgasm like this. a hundred pints raised from a tiger born in the sign of leo, ex-spetznas alfagruppe #1733 batallion, greetings to imdb and much love to anyone who loves a good movie, cheers from chris/sweden.;7 April 2020;10;['most', 'subjective', 'such', 'least', 'great', 'great', 'perfect', 'imho', 'high', 'up', 'least', 'able', 'certain', 'more', 'sure', 'christian', 'different', 'old', 'old', 'sweet', 'same', 'black', 'fourth', 'good', 'suspensful', 'strange', 'surreal', 'odd', 'same', 'fine', 'such', 'old', 'golden', 'great', 'much', 'good'];0.2518586789554531

2730;CaptainSavaho;everybody has an issue with dysfunction. dysfunction with family, in the workplace, in social circles or elsewhere in their lives, but everybody in today's society suffers from some type of dysfunction. this film illustrates the very meaning of dysfunction. in looking at any one of the characters from the john travolta and samuel jackson roles as professional hit men (vincent and jules respectively) to the head mobster and his wife, marcellus and mia played by ving rhames and uma thurman, all were drowned in dysfunctional issues. the highpoint of the film is that in comparison to your own situation at home where you looked at the familial relationships as being the pinnacle of microcosmic sociopaths, this film makes them appear as angels. i believe one factor that helped make this film come together was the dialog. the wit of jules was expounded brilliantly. in essence this film appears to have three separate and distinct story lines - which helps those of us with add. there is the component of mystery. for example it was never revealed what was in the briefcase vincent and jules were sent to retrieve. while i have actually viewed this movie on more than one occasion, i am not certain i can narrow one single plot or story line as the primary. the theme of the movie was the social implications in a dysfunctional world. while this is a very loose association, i would think that the horror movie (series) saw is the closest thing i can offer in suggesting thematic comparison. his (tarantino's) use of props and shock value are two of the most important components to tie into the movie's theme. if i had to pick a third, it would be the creative dialog between the characters. the film did not follow a strict chronological sequence which, in keeping with the dysfunctional theme managed to work in the film's favor. tarantino uses his now well-known knack for the dramatic to create and develop roles that are violent, mysterious, humorous and charismatic all at the same time. somehow this movie fits together. the direction, cinematography, and editing work to make a film with apparent random scenes somehow mesh. this particular film is indicative of the mind of tarantino. anyone who has developed a liking of his style and inner goings-on will appreciate this work. it is destined to be a classic in the minds of movie buffs everywhere.;17 December 2013;7;['social', 'very', 'professional', 'dysfunctional', 'own', 'familial', 'microcosmic', 'separate', 'distinct', 'more', 'certain', 'single', 'social', 'dysfunctional', 'loose', 'close', 'thematic', 'important', 'creative', 'strict', 'chronological', 'tarantino', 'dramatic', 'violent', 'mysterious', 'humorous', 'charismatic', 'same', 'apparent', 'random', 'particular', 'indicative', 'inner'];0.0889536550406115

2807;ohsotricky;"pulp fiction, a dark, gangster drama, directed by quentin tarantino, received many awards for best screenplay and revived many careers of the actors in the film. at the time of its release, the film reeked of cinematic expression. mr. tarantino is a clever storyteller, giving the audience exactly what they want in a gangster movie. the story is anything but typical and unconventionally follows the lives of a very colorful cast. to catalog pulp fiction in just one genre would be to discount it from other's and would be unfair. often referred to as a ""black comedy"", the tale centers on the relationship between two gangsters / hit-men and could be categorized as an off -beat gangster flick. however, the story (like the scenes in the movie) jumps from one place to another. for example, one moment it is a serious ""drama"" (as characters are brutally assassinated), then comes a ""romance"" between a couple desperately attempting to escape reality. a night on the town, with flirtation amongst bizarrely matched characters leads to an overdose. this movie includes everything a tarantino film lover demands; drugs, violence, sex, romance, music, dancing, sport, and even retention of one's soul. each scene is developed first by dialog and then through actions, creating a series of consequences with serious and profound results. at first, the non-traditional editing was disturbing. however, after re-watching certain scenes again, it became clearer. mr. tarantino challenges the viewer to reassemble the pieces of the story in chronological order on their own. figuring out what came first, the chicken or the egg is key to providing insight in solving the many puzzles in this story. the use of sound and score in pulp fiction effectively provided texture to each scene. the songs chosen for the film effortlessly set the stage for each escapade. listening to the soundtrack provokes multifaceted thoughts and memories. the cunning cinematic techniques used in pulp fiction include eccentric configurations and framing, supporting both the tone and mood of the movie. the long pauses' precluding the violence fosters tension on screen, creating intensity driven drama. the use of such a wide variety of camera angles provides the audience with a unique viewing experience and indicates the work of a true artist. the direct and indirect influences of this movie are not readily apparent to the viewer. each social class represented in pulp fiction faces some type of moral dilemma, and each character must work through their respective dilemma, despite their current situations. lack of value and consequence seems to be the meaning of the story. following the path of the righteous man is a common theme throughout. i feel as though each scene contained an exaggerated amount of morality, and the screenplay suffered a bit because of this. too much time was spent on showing the audience the bad stuff, and not enough on the characters' lives. the best part of the film was the music and the dance scene between vincent and mia. i would recommend the film to a very mature, bored audience, as if you watch all 154 minutes of this film, you may wish for your time back.";24 September 2014;6;['dark', 'many', 'good', 'many', 'cinematic', 'clever', 'typical', 'colorful', 'other', 'unfair', 'black', 'off', 'serious', 'tarantino', 'serious', 'profound', 'non', 'traditional', 'certain', 'clear', 'chronological', 'own', 'key', 'many', 'multifaceted', 'cunning', 'cinematic', 'eccentric', 'long', 'wide', 'unique', 'true', 'direct', 'indirect', 'apparent', 'social', 'moral', 'respective', 'current', 'righteous', 'common', 'exaggerated', 'much', 'bad', 'good', 'mature', 'bored'];0.0361904761904761

2809;jrleedom90;you are the critic: part ii if you like the intensity of, drugs, crime, twists and some of hollywood's best actors, pulp fiction is a recommendable movie. pulp fiction was given a nine out of ten on the rating scale which is agreeable. the movie was a prime example of crime that could of occurred in the early 1990's. the rating is accurate due to the outstanding creative writing that several viewers agreed on. although the movie gave a lot of glory to different types of criminals, the movie did have an interesting plot and the characters were synchronized with the whole movie. john travolta and uma therman did an outstanding job in their roles. they worked well together and the chemistry was believable. samuel l. jackson also played an important role and was significant to the movie. there was also friendly chemistry between him and john travolta throughout the whole movie and it seemed realistic. the two in the movie came off as intimidating and fearless. the setting was realistic and took place in several different areas. the only argument i would have over the movie is how the movie jumped from scene to scene. it went back and forth between bruce willis's character and john travoltas which was kind of misleading and confusing the first time i watched it until the end. there were also several other characters who played important roles at different times. there was the crazy couple who held up the restaurant in a robbery when john travolta happened to be there eating in his character. it was kind of confusing as to what was going on but made you curious as to what was going to happen next. there were some scenes that where a little too extreme such as the rape scene but made the movie edgy and kept you guessing and wondering. there was a mixture of all different types of people who commit crime that also intensified the movie. there was anything from a boxer, to gangsters and robbers. there is lots of yelling, screaming, deep conversations and gunshots through the whole movie. the movie genre is classified as crime which is ideal. it is also thriller which is also accurate due to all the violence that takes place throughout. it is definitely considerably a drama as well. there is some slight comedy but is not mentioned on the imdb profile for this movie. the movie was pact full of different intensifiers. there was crime, lust, forbidden romance, drugs, money and all the above intertwined to make for a good movie that won several awards. the ending was unexpected but put all the pieces together as to why some of the characters were even in the movie and helped it make sense. all in all the movie was a masterpiece and lots of positive feedback and reviews from viewers and critics. i personally enjoyed the film and i would recommend the film to mature audiences only of course. the movie is captivating and can easily snag your attention for a couple hours.;24 September 2014;9;['good', 'recommendable', 'agreeable', 'prime', 'early', 'accurate', 'outstanding', 'creative', 'several', 'different', 'interesting', 'whole', 'outstanding', 'believable', 'important', 'significant', 'friendly', 'whole', 'realistic', 'fearless', 'realistic', 'several', 'different', 'only', 'first', 'several', 'other', 'important', 'different', 'crazy', 'confusing', 'curious', 'little', 'extreme', 'such', 'edgy', 'different', 'deep', 'whole', 'ideal', 'accurate', 'slight', 'full', 'different', 'good', 'several', 'unexpected', 'positive'];0.1637827134986226
2810;kellisale;pulp fiction was filmed in 1994 in the city of los angeles. this movie falls into the film genre under action thriller. this movie fits well into the typical crime drama that we all know so well. this movie has two hit men, a boxer, his girlfriend, and a gangster's wife. the main point of the story is the two hit mean vincent vega and jules are on a mission to retrieve a briefcase that has something mysterious insides that leaves the audience guessing. while the two men are on their quest, they encounter some problems like a restaurant robbery, a dead body in the back of their car, and a boxer on the run. the editing and the transition in this film were amazing and had perfect timing to make the movie flow smooth. there were perfect establishing shots that set up the scenes and give you an idea of what the story line was going to look like. the sound of music throughout the movie had good synchronous sound. the music fits into the background and the scenes really pop and fit together with the sound effects that were chosen. some of those scenes would not have been as intense if the right music was not put into the correct places. this movie is hard not to get emotionally involved in. as stated above, the music or score elicit plays a major part in making scenes related to the audience. for example, the car scene where the gun goes off accidentally and the sound effect off the gun going off has a huge impact on someone's feeling and the way they react to it. this is not the only scene where music comes into play and makes an impact on the viewers. cinematography is another art of film making that supports the tone of the movie. the camera perspective, the positions, and the camera distances. pulp fiction uses a variety of zoom shots and deep focus shots that you have eye level shots that really focus in on the characters and capture their facial expressions. the angels and the position of the camera really allows the audience to be involved in the film. everything that it takes to make this film happen works through the magic of cinematography. after watching this film for the first time, i can't say i can pin point the meaning of the movie. there are three different story's that happened within this film and they are tied together to make the film a true thriller. i believe every movie has a story behind each one and something to tell the audience about morals and everyday decisions with the impact of real life situations. being a first time viewer and not knowing what to expect i had no personal influences or any biases that made my decision regarding this film. i loved everything about the movie, the plot, and the characters. pulp fiction was well written and directed and i loved it. this movie was enjoyable to me because it had twists and turns and it kept me guessing about the briefcase. i was able to follow the dialog and stay interested throughout the entire movie without missing any key points.after everything is said and done i would 100% recommend this movie to anyone looking for a new action thriller. the actors are mind blowing and the movie is so different in a way that's hard to explain without viewing it for yourself. nothing about this film will disappoint you and it will leave you wanting more.;25 September 2014;2;['typical', 'main', 'mean', 'mysterious', 'dead', 'amazing', 'perfect', 'smooth', 'perfect', 'good', 'synchronous', 'intense', 'right', 'correct', 'hard', 'major', 'sound', 'huge', 'only', 'deep', 'facial', 'first', 'different', 'true', 'everyday', 'real', 'first', 'personal', 'enjoyable', 'able', 'interested', 'entire', 'new', 'different', 'hard', 'more'];0.2004165026892299

2813;tkoeste;"quentin tarantino is one of the greatest directors of all time. it is not a coincidence, therefore, that pulp fiction, one of his most well recognized and known movies, is one of the best movies of all time. between the eclectic and comedic plot and the supreme group of actors that tarantino used for the movie, it is inarguable otherwise. for many people, for instance some of my friends who have watched pulp fiction, the plot is a negative. these people have got to be type a's who require a structured and well planned plot with a more developed and organized background and character set. they usually think this because the movie simply picks up at different places and is not in chronological order. the movie also introduces characters to the audience without any name, background or insight into the character. these two things can most easily be seen in the beginning and middle of the movie. in the beginning, when the ""honey-bunny"" scene is introduced for the first time, it is easy for the audience to be dumbfounded and confused as to what the movie is about and who the characters are. the audience may also be confused in the middle of the movie when marsellus wallace is talking to butch. there are no obvious indications as to who the two men are. the audience has to draw from context clues that the black man is marsellus wallace and that butch is a boxer who is supposed to go down for him. it is easy to see that this may irk somebody who has a type a personality. to me, however, this is a very positive and refreshing aspect of pulp fiction. movies are too predictable today. they present too many known and common variables. all of quentin tarantino's movies, or at least most are unpredictable. this unpredictability is refreshing. the randomness, especially in pulp fiction, is positive, new and makes watching the movie fun and exciting. much of the randomness factor in pulp fiction comes from random little extras that mean nothing to the plot of the movie. an example of this is when vince and mia are on the date and mia calls vince a square. but rather than saying square, she outlines a square with her fingers in the air, and lines follow her fingers on the screen. another random yet comedic part of the movie is when butch comes home to his girlfriend fabienne and she says she wants a pot belly. this is where the audience first learns that fabienne is quite weird and oblivious. besides these two scenes, there are many other strange little jokes or bizarre piece of humor intertwined into the movie. an excellent example of this is when butch learns that the watch he receives from his dead father's comrade was kept inside both of their rectums. of course the vocabulary tarantino uses for these for these scenes is quite vulgar, but the vulgarity adds to the hilarity factor. the actors are also part of what makes pulp fiction as good a movie as it is. tarantino usually uses many of the same actors, especially uma thurman and christopher walken. thurman plays mia and walken plays a more minor role. besides thurman and walken, many acting greats including john travolta, bruce willis and samuel l. jackson take major roles. in my opinion, pulp fiction is the best movie i have seen bruce willis play in as he does not play some cheesy, cliche character with cliche lines like in all the die hard movies. john travolta also plays his role very well, as he also does not take himself too seriously. samuel l. jackson, in many aspects is the funniest and best character of the movie. his violent rants and outbursts are hilariously awesome and challenge his famous ""go the _____ to sleep."" pulp fiction also leaves the audience with questions. the biggest question is what is in the suitcase. all that is known about the contents of the suitcase is that they glow orange and that marsellus wallace is the owner and needs them back. the audience also gets to see that anybody looking at the contents freezes and stares when they see what is inside. when i saw the movie for the first time, i thought that the content was gold bars, which may explain the orange glow that hits characters' faces when they opened up the suitcase. but, after investigation on the internet, unaware that the subject was of hot debate, i learned that tarantino wanted the suitcase to hold diamonds, but used diamonds in another movie so he just did not show the contents at all. it is these small mysteries that add interest and debate over the quality of movies. because of the actors, hilarity, and mystery in pulp fiction, it can be considered one of the best movies of all time. tarantino did not disappoint with this 1994 movie. he intrigued many with a more artist and abstract way of making plots and directing movies.";1 October 2014;10;['great', 'good', 'eclectic', 'comedic', 'inarguable', 'many', 'negative', 'structured', 'different', 'chronological', 'first', 'easy', 'obvious', 'black', 'marsellus',

2815;cynthia-flageolle;"pulp fiction is a crime, drama, thriller that was released in october 1994 and directed by the infamous quinten tarantino. currently pulp fiction holds a rating of 9 out of 10 on imdb.com and is rated r based on the movie rating scale. as a crime drama thriller it is expected to be fast paced, keep you on the edge of your seat, and tug at your heart just a little and pulp fiction did just that. pulp fiction was nothing short of a typical movie in the crime drama thriller genre. the way the film was set up was not in typical chronological order. the movie is set up in what i would call a chapter format, and it covers stories of individuals and through those stories you learn how they are all connected. although i feel this is a good way to format a movie, it was a little confusing at time and made me go ""huh?"". i think the editing in this film fit what tarantino was trying to convey to the audience. the only part like i said before that was not conducive for a movie goer is how it can be confusing at times. for example there is a moment in the movie where vincent vega played by john travolta was killed by butch coolidge played by bruce willis and immediately following that ""chapter"" vincent vega was alive and well, it was not until later in the movie it was understood that this movie was done in the chapter format. the editing throughout this movie was spot on. the sound through the movie was the done impeccably. the music fit every scene perfectly. for example when vincent vega and mia wallace played by uma thurman went to dinner at a dinner that replicated famous era's in the past and had servers that were look alike to past famous people the music was from the 50's era. during the twist competition the music was the music they played back when the twist was in style. during the fast paced scenes it was a fast paced sound that made your heart pump a little faster and helped with the anticipation the audience would be feeling. overall the sound was very effective. the crime aspect of this film was very apparent. i think it had more crime than drama and thriller. there were a lot of crude remarks made. one thing i found offensive and turned me off on the movie a little, was the amount of racial slurs that were used throughout the movie. another thing there was not a lack of was gore. there were a lot of killings, blood, guts, and an inappropriately sexual scene. crime movies usually include drugs and pulp fiction was no different, however i do not think it was an abundance or unusual amount for a crime genre. because of the amount of blood, gore, drugs and mainly racial slurs used in this movie my opinion is not as high as it could be about this movie. if i am solely looking at the editing, sound, cinematography, and other aspects of film making it was an excellently crafted film, however the content left a little to be desired. i would not recommend this film to anyone under the age of 18 however i would recommend this to adults that like the genre of crime and thriller because it contains everything i would expect of that genre and will not leave them unhappy.";3 October 2014;8;['infamous', 'little', 'short', 'typical', 'typical', 'chronological', 'good', 'little', 'confusing', 'fit', 'tarantino', 'only', 'conducive', 'alive', 'famous', 'famous', 'paced', 'little', 'effective', 'apparent', 'more', 'crude', 'offensive', 'little', 'racial', 'sexual', 'different', 'unusual', 'racial', 'high', 'other', 'little', 'unhappy'];0.0264506172839506

2862;David_Colon;"quentin tarantino is the jerry lee lewis of cinema, a pounding performer who doesn't care if he tears up the piano, as long as everybody is rocking. his new movie ""pulp fiction"" is a comedy about blood, guts, violence, strange sex, drugs, fixed fights, dead body disposal, leather freaks, and a wristwatch that makes a dark journey down through the generations. seeing this movie last may at the cannes film festival, i knew it was either one of the year's best films, or one of the worst. tarantino is too gifted a filmmaker to make a boring movie, but he could possibly make a bad one: like edward d. wood jr., proclaimed the worst director of all time, he's in love with every shot - intoxicated with the very act of making a movie. it's that very lack of caution and introspection that makes ""pulp fiction"" crackle like an ozone generator: here's a director who's been let loose inside the toy store, and wants to play all night. the screenplay, by tarantino and roger avary, is so well-written in a scruffy, fanzine way that you want to rub noses in it - the noses of those zombie writers who take ""screenwriting"" classes that teach them the formulas for ""hit films."" like ""citizen kane,"" ""pulp fiction"" is constructed in such a nonlinear way that you could see it a dozen times and not be able to remember what comes next. it doubles back on itself, telling several interlocking stories about characters who inhabit a world of crime and intrigue, triple-crosses and loud desperation. the title is perfect. like those old pulp mags named ""thrilling wonder stories"" and ""official detective,"" the movie creates a world where there are no normal people and no ordinary days - where breathless prose clatters down fire escapes and leaps into the dumpster of doom. the movie resurrects not only an aging genre but also a few careers. john travolta stars as vincent vega, a mid-level hit man who carries out assignments for a mob boss. we see him first with his partner jules (samuel l. jackson); they're on their way to a violent showdown with some wayward yuppie drug dealers, and are discussing such mysteries as why in paris they have a french word for quarter pounders. they're as innocent in their way as huck and jim, floating down the mississippi and speculating on how foreigners can possibly understand each other. travolta's career is a series of assignments he can't quite handle. not only does he kill people inadvertently (""the car hit a bump!"") but he doesn't know how to clean up after himself. good thing he knows people like mr. wolf (harvey keitel), who specializes in messes, and has friends like the character played by eric stoltz, who owns a big medical encyclopedia, and can look up emergency situations. travolta and uma thurman have a sequence that's funny and bizarre. she's the wife of the mob boss (ving rhames), who orders travolta to take her out for the night. he turns up stoned, and addresses an intercom with such grave, stately courtesy buster keaton would have been envious. they go to jack rabbit slim's, a 1950s theme restaurant where ed sullivan is the emcee, buddy holly is the waiter, and they end up in a twist contest. that's before she overdoses and stoltz, waving a syringe filled with adrenaline, screams at travolta, ""you brought her here, you stick in the needle! when i bring an o.d. to your house, i'll stick in the needle!"" bruce willis and maria de medeiros play another couple: he's a boxer named butch coolidge who is supposed to throw a fight, but doesn't. she's his sweet, naive girlfriend, who doesn't understand why they have to get out of town ""right away."" but first he needs to make a dangerous trip back to his apartment to pick up a priceless family heirloom - a wristwatch. the history of this watch is described in a flashback, as vietnam veteran christopher walken tells young butch about how the watch was purchased by his great-grandfather, ""private doughboy orion coolidge,"" and has come down through the generations - and through a lot more than generations, for that matter. walken's monologue builds to the movie's biggest laugh. the method of the movie is to involve its characters in sticky situations, and then let them escape into stickier ones, which is how the boxer and the mob boss end up together as the captives of weird leather freaks in the basement of a gun shop. or how the characters who open the movie, a couple of stick-up artists played by tim roth and amanda plummer, get in way over their heads. most of the action in the movie comes under the heading of crisis control.";21 April 2015;10;['new', 'strange', 'dead', 'dark', 'last', 'good', 'bad', 'tarantino', 'gifted', 'boring', 'bad', 'bad', 'intoxicated', 'very', 'very', 'loose', 'scruffy', 'fanzine', 'nonlinear', 'able', 'several', 'triple', 'loud', 'perfect', 'old', 'official', 'normal', 'ordinary', 'few', 'mid', 'level', 'violent', 'wayward', 'such', 'french', 'innocent', 'other', 'good', 'big', 'medical', 'funny', 'bizarre', 'such', 'stately', 'envious', 'sweet', 'naive', 'dangerous', 'priceless', 'young', 'great', 'private', 'doughboy', 'more', 'big', 'sticky', 'sticki', 'weird', 'most'];0.0444503171247357
2863;wjackson-66353;"pulp fiction is a movie that begins and ends in the same place, a diner. this being said, the movie is not just a single layer film. pulp fiction has layers upon layers that build upon it. major characters and bit players all contribute to the convergence of story line in this film. to watch it once does not truly do it justice. to appreciate the film, the viewer needs to take in every moment. the movie follows the movements of 2 mob hit men (vincent vega and jules winnfield) played by john travolta and samuel l. jackson as they try to obtain and return a briefcase containing some unknown glowing ""beautiful"" item. this movie is better understood if it is pictured as a giant circle. when the movie starts is actually where it's ending. this could be considered madness or genius on the part of the director, quentin tarantino. as the hit men try to get the briefcase to their boss, marsellus wallace, played by ving rhames, they encounter a boxer who is trying to stiff marsellus, named butch played by bruce willis. a memorable scene in the movie involves uma thurman who plays marsellus' wife, mia. vincent saves her from overdosing on cocaine. as the movie unfolds, each nuance plays into the overall plot of this film. the theme of the film deals with the truth of human nature. pulp fiction doesn't delve deeply into each character's background, history or story; it merely gives you a small bite of the character. an example of this is when mia asks vincent about amsterdam. he states that he just got back after being there for 3 years. not why he was there or what he was doing there, just that he was simply there. this film focuses only how each character plays into the overall purpose of jules and vincent getting the briefcase to marsellus and then weaves each character into the plot. when we meet butch, we find out why his father's watch is so important, but we never meet the father. tarantino only wants us to know how the watch leads to his encounter with marsellus. each character is merely a representation of a type of person: the hit man, the mob boss, the boxer, the mob wife, etc. tarantino likes a lot of dialogue in his films. some cannot get past his excessive use of profanity and long conversations. he uses this in most of his films, such as kill bill which has been dubbed a ""revenge film,"" but there is a lot of dialogue throughout the film that leads the viewer on the journey to revenge. two important elements in the movie are the importance of visual imagery and the use of music. from the iconic scene at jack rabbit slims with the retro theme to the basement at maynard's shop with the gimp to the inside of jules' car after he accidentally shoots marvin, visual imagery is key. music is also very important, again at jack rabbit slims during the twist contest when ""you never can tell"" is playing and again later when mia comes back home and is dancing to ""girl, you'll be a woman soon,"" each song creates the scene for the audience. the soundtrack for this film is still head and shoulders above the all others and to this viewer is the most memorable part of the film itself. when pulp fiction came out, people rushed to buy soundtracks to movies and this proves why. each song has a purpose and its purpose, just like the entire movie itself, is pure genius.";26 April 2015;10;['same', 'single', 'major', 'unknown', 'beautiful', 'giant', 'hit', 'memorable', 'overall', 'human', 'small', 'vincent', 'overall', 'important', 'hit', 'tarantino', 'excessive', 'long', 'most', 'such', 'important', 'visual', 'iconic', 'visual', 'key', 'important', 'memorable', 'entire', 'pure'];0.1442142857142857
2864;mbarger-38754;"vincent vega (john travolta) and jules winnfield (samuel l. jackson) are hit men with a penchant for philosophical discussions and their storyline is interwoven with those of their boss, gangster marsellus wallace (ving rhames); his actress wife, mia (uma thurman); struggling boxer butch coolidge (bruce willis); master fixer winston wolfe (harvey keitel) and a nervous pair of armed robbers, ""pumpkin"" (tim roth) and ""honey bunny"" (amanda plummer). wallace has also asked vincent to take his wife mia out a few days later when wallace himself will be out of town. this movie is a series of less-and-more related but separated short stories of crime and comedy that each result into an unexpected ending including unexpected deaths, sudden twists, black comedy events and horrific conclusions of crime and its following consequences. the theme of pulp fiction is power when marsellus is the sort of character who looms over the entire film while being invisible most of the film. the theme of power is very prevalent during jules winnfield's scene at the apartment and with one of the most controversial aspect of the film, which is the literal use of the n-word. when you watch the movie, you can tell that marsellus has some severe power over all the actors in one way or another. since i don't have a massive list of movies i watched, i can't really make a reference to another film due to the fact that of the films i watched, none of them match what pulp fiction has for its theme. the film uses the motif of the control marsellus has over the characters, by using shadows to stay hidden and the fact that he is merciless, like when vincent hears that marsellus threw someone out the window for giving his wife a foot massage. when marsellus is on the screen you can clearly see that the other characters are scared of him. the lighting of the film is very appropriate and it looks like there is a bunch of natural light when the scenes are near windows or outside and the use of the lights from the bulbs in the indoor scenes, where the light comes from those bulbs and not from an external source of light (studio lights to make the scene brighter). fear and power are some of the easiest ways to gain respect from people, but it can lead to having some of your people to oppose you.";1 May 2015;10;['philosophical', 'nervous', 'armed', 'few', 'less', 'short', 'unexpected', 'unexpected', 'sudden', 'black', 'horrific', 'entire', 'invisible', 'most', 'prevalent', 'controversial', 'literal', 'severe', 'massive', 'hidden', 'merciless', 'other', 'scared', 'appropriate', 'natural', 'indoor', 'external', 'easy'];-0.0120833333333333
2865;albor_bozo;pulp fiction quickly came to be regarded as one of the most significant films of its era. in 1995, in a special edition of siskel & ebert devoted to tarantino, gene siskel argued that the work posed a major challenge to the ossification of american movies with their brutal formulas. in siskels view, the violent intensity of pulp fiction calls to mind other violent watershed films that were considered classics in their time and still are. hitchcock's psycho 1960, arthur penn's bonnie and clyde 1967, and stanley kubricks a clockwork orange 1971. each film shook up a tired, bloated movie industry and used a world of lively lowlifes to reflect how dull other movies had become. and that, i predict, will be the ultimate honor for pulp fiction. like all great films, it criticizes other movies;26 December 2017;10;['significant', 'special', 'tarantino', 'major', 'american', 'brutal', 'violent', 'other', 'violent', 'tired', 'bloated', 'lively', 'dull', 'other', 'ultimate', 'great', 'other'];-0.1390731292517006

(pulp fiction only had an 8 million dollar budget which makes it even more remarkable). so pulp fiction stars samuel l jackson and john travolta, and i would say they are the main characters, as we see them the most, but the plot in this movie is essentially 3 stories about 1 story, so you really make your own mind up. samuel l jackson and john travolta act very well in this movie, they are two hit men with very good dialogue. his role in pulp fiction also saved john travolta's' film career. i think the best part of this movie is definitely the dialogue, as this movie isn't shot perfectly, or acted perfectly by ever actor. but it's the dialogue the characters say that makes this movie great.;6 August 2016;9;['basic', 'interesting', 'more', 'most', 'remarkable', 'main', 'most', 'own', 'good', 'good', 'great'];0.5196969696969697

2907;me-22253;"a critic of the film once told me, ""pulp fiction is tarantino's most successful work at trying to say so much and at the same time saying nothing at all."" of course, he wasn't wrong. it seems he didn't recognize the significance of the debut of postmodern film in pulp fiction. film critics, movie buffs, and the like are often coming at the film from different angles, always asking the question, what does it all mean? naturally the answer is absolutely nothing, and that is exactly what makes pulp fiction such a masterpiece. tarantino has made a perfect film without having to make it about anything in particular. his dialogue draws the viewer in and captures their attention, placing them in the room, arguing and bantering alongside the characters which he has set in place. the various sub-plots are nothing if not unique, incorporating shocking events such as an adrenaline shot to the chest after a heroin overdose, a blown- up head leading to theological retribution, or butch choosing to save his nemesis from his raper. the result is a film that is completely new, completely unheard of, and yet saturated with allusions, familiar faces, familiar music, and the timelessness of pop culture. upon finishing pulp fiction, whether for the first time or the hundredth time, the feeling one often gets is satisfaction. however, every time, i find myself finishing the film and longing for conviction. it is this slight failure of the film to make you feel one way or another that leaves the viewer with a non-convicted feeling of satisfaction, after presenting such stark and shocking material. it is tarantino's ability to not just make people feel something, but to make people want to feel something that they can't quite put their finger on which truly makes this film a postmodern masterpiece, not to mention a charming screenplay, bold cinematography, and an enthralling star-studded cast.";30 January 2016;10;['successful', 'much', 'same', 'wrong', 'postmodern', 'different', 'such', 'tarantino', 'perfect', 'particular', 'various', 'unique', 'shocking', 'such', 'theological', 'new', 'unheard', 'familiar', 'familiar', 'first', 'hundredth', 'slight', 'non', 'such', 'stark', 'shocking', 'postmodern', 'charming', 'bold', 'enthralling'];0.0759379509379509

2911;kirschbaluke;"guns, gangsters, blood, and blow. it can all be found in quentin tarantino's 1994 movie, pulp fiction. this exciting, and notably disturbing, thriller unfolds the story of two hit men vincent vega (john travolta) and jules (samuel l. jackson) as they rampage about los angeles doing dirty work for their drug kingpin boss, marsellus wallace (ving rhames). in this midst of kicking in doors, the boys are given an order by the boss man himself to kill a boxer named butch (bruce willis) for not throwing a match. the bloody murdering and drug-overdosing events that happen during the course of the film is what leaves viewers oddly begging for more (note: not a movie for children). cinematographer, andrzej sekua, paints a beautiful setting of los angeles in this movie. from the run down neighborhoods where the drug dealers abide to marsellus' upscale house in the hill, this movie will make your eyes fall in love. the small elements of the film such as the paint chipping off the apartment hallway walls or the dim, smoke- filled bars are what really make the picture quality stand apart from other productions. of course there are scenes that aren't so pleasant, but necessary to add to the aura of the movie. in one scene, vincent vega ""accidentally"" shoots a drug dealer right through the eyes in a car and it literally shows pieces of brain splattered entirely throughout. a darker scene yet depicts marsellus wallace being tied up and brutally raped by a backwoods pawn store owner that looks as if he should have starred in the movie deliverance. it's scenes like this that made me feel i truly had to take a shower afterwards because it was so gruesome and dirty, but at the same time powerful. and then there is how the actors are portrayed physically. vincent is shown as this sly, hair slicked back guy with an earning in his ear. it's no doubt from the start viewers know he's the ladies' man. jules on the other hand is portrayed as being scarily philosophical, complete with an afro, lamb chops, and a gold chain. both these men are sharply dressed in suits which shows they are to be reckoned with. the downside but somewhat interesting part of this movie is the plot. it requires the viewer to stay completely in tuned to what is going on. in fact, i would never have liked this movie if i did not re watch it a second time to understand it better! this is due in part of quentin tarantino's famous nonlinear plot style. this means the movie does not follow in perfect sequence but instead falls back on itself from time to time. the opening scene shown in the movie actually does not even take place until the very end. this can leave viewers confused because actors are shown immediately in the movie that do not show up until the end. if you are a movie goer that just likes to see big explosions whilst lacking an in depth story line, this movie is not for you. on the contrary, if you are the type of viewer that feeds off how certain ambiguous scenes tie together in the long run, i would strongly advise watching this movie. if you want to know how in the hell quentin tarantino managed to link a scene that opens the movie to a scene that ends the movie, get this movie at all costs!";10 February 2016;9;['exciting', 'disturbing', 'dirty', 'bloody', 'more', 'beautiful', 'upscale', 'small', 'such', 'other', 'pleasant', 'necessary', 'dark', 'marsellus', 'gruesome', 'dirty', 'same', 'powerful', 'other', 'philosophical', 'complete', 'interesting', 'second', 'due', 'famous', 'nonlinear', 'perfect', 'very', 'big', 'certain', 'ambiguous', 'long'];0.0249118165784832

2925;idohadar;pulp fiction is an interesting movie. pulp fiction is not an excellent movie. it is completely average. but what makes people think it is so good? the movie begins with a conversation of two people talking about robberies, and then deciding to rob the same restaurant they are in. the dialogue, as in every tarantino movie, is clever and sharp. but as (i hope) we know, clever and sharp dialogue doesn't guarantee a good movie, as a dialogue just doesn't have to be clever and sharp after all. in fact, i think that by tarantino's style of writing, abducts different kind of character developments, by making them as a cardboard typecast, with a little bit of their own story characteristics. and that really is my problem with pulp fiction. the characters are not full. the characters can be smart as they are, but they are not full. all we get here is people who say smart things with cool typecast and environment. when jules and vincent for example, talk about burgers in france, you can't not notice the lack of feelings and states of mind they do not have. so they talk and you listen, and you get blended in with their style and intelligence, but never anyhow feel the characters appliance on true emotions and true values' cinema,as with life at all. talking about the plot, as with tarantino non linear story-line, he manages to hide the film's lack of interesting plot and instead making scenes which completely does not not relate cinematically to each other. even with holding the non linear story line. talking about the scenes themselves separately (which is always not a good way of talking about a movie), the scenes themselves are full of surprises and other cinematic values like tension who blend really well in this un plotted movie. saying that, if the movie had a different cinematic state, stronger emotions and real life setting' which hover beyond the lameness (that's the word) and norma of films like that, i'm pretty sure the tension and cinematic values will just not fit in. and to summarize! pulp fiction is a nice film to watch if you love normal cinema. a cinema which doesn't discuss different states by its nature and nature by its state. if you like technical cinema, definitely go watch it. you will learn a lot. although, if you want to see real cinema, which tells a story, with empowered deepness characters and real values of the existence of people's life, go see almost any other movie, bad or good.;19 September 2016;6;['interesting', 'excellent', 'average', 'good', 'same', 'tarantino', 'clever', 'sharp', 'clever', 'sharp', 'good', 'clever', 'sharp', 'different', 'little', 'own', 'full', 'smart', 'full', 'smart', 'cool', 'true', 'true', 'tarantino', 'non', 'linear', 'interesting', 'other', 'non', 'linear', 'good', 'full', 'other', 'cinematic', 'different', 'cinematic', 'strong', 'real', 'sure', 'cinematic', 'nice', 'normal', 'different', 'technical', 'real', 'empowered', 'real', 'other', 'bad', 'good'];0.212485481997677

2928;chacalhu-67159;"it is very difficult to talk about pulp fiction dispassionately. the film was one of the most impactful of the 90s and created - and still creates - a number of direct and indirect quotes in movies, series and conversations on our day-to-day. even those who do not like the film, and there is no sin in it, have to at least recognize the pop phenomenon that the second work directed by quentin tarantino generated. the main feature of the film is its non-linear narrative. many will say that it was not quentin tarantino who created this form to assemble and tell a story (or several), but he never said it was. there are undeniable classics as citizen kane, rashomon and annie hall who ventured down this path, with undeniable success. even the very tarantino, discreet and cleverly, had tried to embrace this technique in reservoir dogs, his directorial debut enviable. it turns out that what tarantino did in pulp fiction was, on the one hand, to popularize this form of narrative and on the other, make it almost in its own narrative, giving the ""tarantino touch"" it. proof of popularization of non-linear narrative is the amount of films that followed this trend throughout the 90s and 2000s, culminating in perhaps amnesia and city of god. about transform non-linear narrative into something her, this is one of the most misunderstood features of tarantino. the director is accused of copycat, copycat and all kind of synonym for this, as if no other director to do the same or as if the own tarantino had not already stated that copies but works like. but what the director can do is to turn all copy or borrow something in itself. we know that we are watching a tarantino movie even though we presented the work by the middle. the same can be said for directors like woody allen and steven spielberg. if this is something good or bad, it is not here to judge. what is clear is that tarantino knows to take what is apparently commonplace and make something with your signature and that's what he did with the non-linear narrative in pulp fiction became the basics in a structure that unfolds in several stories parallel and sometimes tangential, that at the end, make it evident the domain that the director has on the camera and on the assembly, besides the always present and always perfect soundtrack. see, for example, the temporal leap tarantino is in the middle of the film, when we see the little butch (the character played by bruce willis) receiving a visit from captain koons (christopher walken), who lived with his father when the two were prisoners of war. all this scene, which tells a story with one long monologue koons in a single plane-sequence, which does not deviate from the character, aims to demonstrate to us the importance of butch's father's watch. this already happens in the middle of the narrative intersected tarantino imposes, but when the flashback happens, we accept naturally, without awkwardness or without for a moment fail to understand what is happening. today, we find that something obvious and unimaginative, but try to be transported to 1994, when tarantino pulp fiction launched in cannes almost as an experimental work and received a standing ovation for several minutes. nobody before had built a movie like this, at least not consistently and telling several stories at the same time. and here, of course, fit the applause due to wistful sally menke's favorite automaker director and perhaps most responsible for the actual genesis of ""tarantinesca identity.""";25 August 2016;9;['difficult', 'impactful', 'direct', 'indirect', 'least', 'second', 'main', 'non', 'linear', 'many', 'several', 'undeniable', 'undeniable', 'tarantino', 'discreet', 'reservoir', 'directorial', 'enviable', 'other', 'own', 'tarantino', 'non', 'linear', 'non', 'linear', 'most', 'other', 'same', 'own', 'tarantino', 'same', 'good', 'bad', 'clear', 'commonplace', 'non', 'linear', 'several', 'parallel', 'tangential', 'evident', 'present', 'perfect', 'temporal', 'little', 'long', 'single', 'tarantino', 'obvious', 'unimaginative', 'tarantino', 'experimental', 'several', 'least', 'several', 'same', 'wistful', 'favorite', 'responsible', 'actual'];0.0869922969187675

""pulp fiction,"" is, as the title indicates, purely an exercise in technique and style, albeit a brilliant and layered one. containing numerous references to other films, it is like a great work of abstract art, or ""art about art."" it has all the characteristics we associate with great movies: fine writing, first-rate acting, unforgettable characters, and one of the most well-constructed narratives i've ever seen in a film. but to what end? the self-contained story does not seem to have bearing on anything but itself. the movie becomes a bit easier to understand once you realize that it's essentially a black comedy dressed up as a crime drama. each of the three main story threads begins with a situation that could easily form the subplot of any standard gangster movie. but something always goes wrong, some small unexpected accident that causes the whole situation to come tumbling down, leading the increasingly desperate characters to absurd measures. tarantino's originality stems from his ability to focus on small details and follow them where they lead, even if they move the story away from conventional plot developments. perhaps no screenplay has ever found a better use for digressions. indeed, the whole film seems to consist of digressions. no character ever says anything in a simple, straightforward manner. jules could have simply told yolanda, ""be cool and no one's going to get hurt,"" which is just the type of line you'd find in a generic, run-of-the-mill action flick. instead, he goes off on a tangent about what fonzie is like. tarantino savors every word of his characters, finding a potential wisecrack in every statement and infusing the dialogue with clever pop culture references. but the lines aren't just witty; they are full of intelligent observations about human behavior. think of mia's statement to vincent, ""that's when you know you've found somebody special: when you can just shut the f--- up for a minute and comfortably enjoy the silence."" what is the movie's purpose exactly? i'm not sure, but it does deal a lot with the theme of power. marsellus is the sort of character who looms over the entire film while being invisible most of the time. the whole point of the big date sequence, which happens to be my favorite section of the film, is the power that marsellus has over his men without even being present. this power is what gets vincent to act in ways you would not ordinarily expect from a dumb, stoned gangster faced with an attractive woman whose husband has gone away. the power theme also helps explain one of the more controversial aspects of the film, its liberal use of the n-word. in this film, the word isn't just used as an epithet to describe blacks: jules, for instance, at one point applies the term to vincent. it has more to do with power than with race. the powerful characters utter the word to express their dominance over weaker characters. most of these gangsters are not racist in practice. indeed, they are intermingled racially, and have achieved a level of equality that surpasses the habits of many law-abiding citizens in our society. they resort to racial epithets because it's a patter that establishes their separateness from the non-criminal world. there's a nice moral progression to the stories. we presume that vincent hesitates to sleep with mia out of fear rather than loyalty. later, butch's act of heroism could be motivated by honor, but we're never sure. the film ends, however, with jules making a clear moral choice. thus, the movie seems to be exploring whether violent outlaws can act other than for self-preservation. still, it's hard to find much of a larger meaning tying together these eccentric set of stories. none of the stories are really ""about"" anything. they certainly are not about hit-men pontificating about burgers. nor is the film really a satire or a farce, although it contains elements of both. at times, it feels like a tale that didn't need to be told, but for whatever reason this movie tells it and does a better job than most films of its kind, or of any other kind.";11 February 2018;10;['early', 'big', 'other', 'witty', 'entertaining', 'normal', 'regular', 'other', 'comic', 'such', 'final', 'coherent', 'textured', 'much', 'many', 'astonishing', 'many', 'first', 'deep', 'deep', 'brilliant', 'numerous', 'other', 'great', 'abstract', 'great', 'fine', 'first', 'unforgettable', 'easy', 'black', 'main', 'standard', 'wrong', 'small', 'unexpected', 'whole', 'desperate', 'absurd', 'small', 'conventional', 'well', 'whole', 'simple', 'straightforward', 'cool', 'generic', 'tarantino', 'potential', 'clever', 'witty', 'full', 'intelligent', 'human', 'special', 'sure', 'entire', 'invisible', 'most', 'whole', 'big', 'favorite', 'present', 'dumb', 'attractive', 'controversial', 'liberal', 'more', 'powerful', 'weak', 'most', 'racist', 'many', 'racial', 'non', 'criminal', 'nice', 'moral', 'sure', 'clear', 'moral', 'violent', 'other', 'hard', 'much', 'large', 'eccentric', 'well', 'most', 'other'];0.1692765567765567

2996;Cylon_Crichton;pulp fiction, an academy-award winning film by quentin tarantino, became an instant favorite of mine. the plot focuses on the intersecting lives of several people in unique and unusual tough situations, from a hit man who decides to leave the business to a fighter who wants to keep his honor. from shootings to normal conversations to drugs and back to casual conversations, the film does a superb job of tying the viewer to the characters by making them average people you could see yourself hanging out with, despite their extreme situations and sometimes shocking actions. i, personally, could really enjoy a movie made up of nothing but conversations if they were written well enough, as i'm constantly amused by debating issues with friends and random facts. though this film had much action and plot, it also had those regular situations that grounded it all, like conversations about what cheeseburgers are called in foreign countries and whether or not a foot massage is too intimate. to me, these kinds of things are the most important in a film like this. tarantino is masterful and humanizing everyone in his films, causing you to identify with them and care for their fate. this is what makes you really care when the action starts. a diner is robbed. a young woman very nearly dies from a drug overdose. a man's head is accidentally shot to pieces in the back of a car in broad daylight. these are just a few of the situations in pulp fiction that have your heart racing, hoping the carefully crafted characters can make their way out of. the action was all done very well, each conflict scripted in a way that made each scene uniquely interesting, occasionally disturbing, and wonderful. another thing that tarantino's films do well is to give each random side character that gets involved their own life, so that the audience gets the definite feeling that the snapshot we get of their lives isn't the whole of the filmmaker's creation, but rather a window into something more vast. overall, i have only good words for this movie. i loved the looped time line. the characters were focused upon highly without the action or drama lacking at all. everything was well written, be it the odd conversation about a tv pilot or even conversations themselves, or a foiled assassination. i'm certainly looking forward to my second viewing of this amazing film.;2 April 2008;8;['instant', 'intersecting', 'several', 'unique', 'unusual', 'tough', 'hit', 'normal', 'casual', 'superb', 'average', 'extreme', 'shocking', 'random', 'much', 'regular', 'foreign', 'intimate', 'important', 'tarantino', 'masterful', 'young', 'broad', 'few', 'interesting', 'disturbing', 'wonderful', 'random', 'own', 'definite', 'vast', 'good', 'odd', 'foiled', 'second', 'amazing'];0.0881272401433691

3003;guccdiamonds;"to begin, i loved this movie. i don't know if it was the adult themed story, the classic lines that you could find yourself repeating as if it was a cult classic, or the simplistic nature of the story, but i simply fell in love with this wacky piece of cinema. spongebob is not your typical hero, and his friend patrick, doesn't seem to fit the mold of your typical ""best-friend role"". i found myself laughing at this film because of the messages that it taught and how i guy like me, stuck in the retail world, could easily identify with the trauma that spongebob was experiencing. also, this film was flat out hysterical. i wasn't expecting anything except for kids humor when i first watched it, but after the final credits rolled i was impressed by how adult oriented the humor truly was. the comic timing was perfect, the music resonated perfectly in my ear, and i can honestly say that from the opening pirate credits to the final jump in the air, this film was the rawest form of cinematic perfection and the best film i have seen this 2005 year (so far). i know you are probably thinking, ""andy, you watch a lot of movies, why did you like this one so much?"" and i really don't have a straightforward answer to that question. perhaps it is the repetitive nature of the films that i am currently watching that had me running towards the arms of this spongebob movie, or maybe because comedies are not quite the caliber of humor as they once were (resorting to restroom humor and sex instead of actual ""funny"" comedy), or maybe it was because it told a story that i could relate to, but whatever the case may be this film ranks among the best. i have seen this movie about 20+ times already and cannot wait to see it again. it is one of those films where i catch something new each time, i still laugh at most of the scenes (the bar scene is my personal favorite), and i get that aura of excitement every time i place the dvd in the player. this film is like my unquenchable drug of choice. spongebob is one of those heroes that i can, and i think most in the retail/working sector of the world, relate to. he works hard, he wants promotion, and continues to live his life as his heart allows like a kid. isn't that what we all desire? i know that is a crucial element to my life to ensure that i stay true to those and myself around me. also, it has always been a dream of mine to have a seaweed mustache, and this film promotes the use of this green apparatus. i don't want to sound repetitive, but i cannot wait to add this film to my dvd collection. it provided, and still provides, at least an hour and a half of pure, uncut, humor that will leave some great songs in your mind and this new found respect in your heart. who hasn't walked into your office one day just singing, ""i'm ready, promotion. i'm ready, promotion"". or better yet, ended the day singing, ""i'm ready, depression. i'm ready, depression."" ha, this has me nearly falling out of my seat as i type this now. the heart, humor, and childlike feeling for this hero will have children falling over to see this film (though where i work most children are not huge fans of this film they say that television program is better), and if it is watched by an embarrassed adult, you will be surprised on how much you could probably relate to this film. we are all ""goofy goobers"" inside, and sometimes it takes a film such as this to pull it out of us. we all wish that we could break out into song whenever possible or even spend an evening at a bar enjoying round after round of ice cream treats. overall, i loved this movie. well, actually, i more than loved it, i thought it was one of the best films that i have seen this year. so many times we watch movies that get too caught up in themselves. they are too serious or too violent or too goofy for what they set out to be, and it was an honest delight to finally find something that was just what it was. spongebob is my new hero and i have already found myself watching the television programs whenever possible. you have a new fan spongebob i hope that you will always remain the ""goofy goober"" that i fell in love with!!";25 January 2018;10;['themed', 'classic', 'cult', 'simplistic', 'wacky', 'typical', 'typical', 'good', 'retail', 'flat', 'hysterical', 'final', 'comic', 'perfect', 'final', 'raw', 'cinematic', 'good', 'much', 'straightforward', 'repetitive', 'spongebob', 'actual', 'funny', 'good', 'new', 'most', 'personal', 'unquenchable', 'most', 'crucial', 'true', 'seaweed', 'green', 'repetitive', 'least', 'pure', 'uncut', 'great', 'new', 'ready', 'ready', 'ready', 'ready', 'most', 'huge', 'well', 'embarrassed', 'surprised', 'much', 'goofy', 'such', 'possible', 'good', 'many', 'serious', 'violent', 'goofy', 'honest', 'new', 'possible', 'new'];0.1428648274802121

3024;kmancrazy;"pulp fiction's mise en scene weaves uber-classical big hollywood set design with lackadaisical realism. jack rabbit slim's, the retro diner with the $5 milkshakes, is an ode to the grandiose production quality of older films that treated the screen as a stage. tarantino seems to purposefully date his film by basking in the old rules of cinema. film noir, for example, makes an appearance when butch is in the backseat of a taxi after unintentionally killing his boxing opponent. everything from the smoking cigar in his teeth, to his stiffly squinted eyes, to the directionally shaded light, screams of the archetypal crime drama. yet there are these deeply personal sequences in which the camera takes on an amatuer role. as butch limps away from wallace, we follow him through a handheld, shaky frame that seems to trip and fall each time one of them does. it harkens back to tarantino's early original, my best friend's birthday, in the way it is juvenile yet action-seeking. nonetheless, it's interesting. and there's something about its craft that manages to drag you into a world that is totally over-the-top. a large part of what is so captivating about this film is its sense of a closed frame. tarantino is gratuitous with the facial close-up, drawing out sweat like a stroke of a paintbrush and allowing us intimate views of each character's scars (both literally and symbolically). while butch converses with wallace toward the beginning of the movie, we see him trapped in the frame behind the shoulder of a man who has been beat and will always recover, as indicated by the band-aid on the back of his head. this film is, after all, a character piece first and an action film second. every character has to watch their back in some way, like butch in his claustrophobic hotel room and the poor soul that samuel l jackson puts a startling end to. tarantino doesn't do anything particularly ""new-age"" with his directing, instead paying homage to the techniques of classic samurai films and the like. the moment the adrenaline needle plunges into mia's heart with a pop, the camera jolts to her wide eyes and then cuts back to a neutral shot as she awakens in a frenzy. it's reminiscent of a sequence in alfred hitchcock's psycho from 1960, following the simple pattern of an attack, the victim's facial surprise, and then the ensuing reaction. in this sense, pulp fiction achieves the perfect balance of extending on, but not copying, the greatest techniques in the history of cinema. yet, with the film's style made timeless by all these technical approaches, there are some uses of the medium that transform the viewing experience. as butch dances stealthily back to his apartment to retrieve his father's precious watch, the camera floats inexplicably behind him, appearing to pass straight through a fence. it's an impossible view that gives us an omniscient perspective of the impending danger. or consider the extreme low-angles we get from the trunk of vincent vega's car or during his cocaine purchase -- the frame is placed in a location that evokes the feeling of watching secretly from a hidden spot. we are seeing something we're not supposed to see. this angle isn't used in the typical context to give an actor ominous power, and this is how the film gets its unique tone from sort of shrugging off the savage nature of the character duo. pulp fiction shows that tarantino is best at creating situations. the camera is merely pointed where to look, occasionally hesitating on a mesmerizing visual element to enhance the aesthetic of the situation. it is unconventional in that it leans into the realist components of the lives of screen villains, and that is why its combination of classic tricks with personal style is ultimately cohesive. although the film appears to be a product of the story, a consistent dedication to style is the key to tarantino's creation of a captivating, fresh bit of cinema.";8 February 2018;8;['classical', 'big', 'lackadaisical', 'din', 'grandiose', 'old', 'old', 'archetypal', 'personal', 'amatuer', 'handheld', 'shaky', 'early', 'original', 'good', 'juvenile', 'interesting', 'large', 'closed', 'tarantino', 'gratuitous', 'facial', 'intimate', 'claustrophobic', 'poor', 'startling', 'new', 'classic', 'like', 'wide', 'neutral', 'reminiscent', 'alfred', 'simple', 'facial', 'perfect', 'great', 'technical', 'precious', 'impossible', 'impending', 'extreme', 'low', 'typical', 'ominous', 'unique', 'savage', 'good', 'mesmerizing', 'visual', 'unconventional', 'realist', 'classic', 'personal', 'cohesive', 'consistent', 'fresh'];0.0754223418857565

3059;as-hleyk;"pulp fiction is an american crime movie in which jules winnfield, played by samuel l. jackson, and vincent vega, by john travolta, are two hitmen out to retrieve a stolen briefcase from their employer, a mob boss named marsellus wallace, played by ving rhames. in a connecting story, wallace also asks vega to take his wife uma thurman's character, mia, out while he is out of town, and bruce willis' butch coolidge, an aging boxer, is paid by wallace to lose his fight. the series of seemingly unrelated stories are interwoven in a film full of twists, violence, and redemption. appropriately so, the film's title is a direct reference to pulp magazines popular during the first half of the 20th century, known for their dialogue and lurid scenes. the film focuses on the conversations between characters, which lead to each character's own development, and is infamous for its extensive use of violence. although quentin tarantino's pulp fiction may confuse some viewers due to the film's nonlinear organization and lack of clear protagonists, it is one of the most influential movies of all time for its memorable dialogue and soundtrack. since its debut in 1994, pulp fiction has been considered one of the most highly commended films of all time. in just over two years, the movie won 64 times out of the 69 times it was nominated for an award. these awards and nominations ranged from oscars for ""best writing, screenplay written directly for the screen"" and a cannes palme d'or to polish awards for ""best foreign film"" and brit awards for ""best soundtrack."" imdb rates this film as within the top 10 rated movies of all time. with many more nominations and wins for various awards worldwide, it is difficult not to be curious about the publicity around the movie. however, there are many people who can't seem to understand the film's success. according to adam g., a critic on imdb, pulp fiction was one of tarantino's ""insane, self-indulgent, and bloated"" works. in reality, tarantino's ""insanity"" is what led to the film's success. tarantino created a final product that somehow remained coherent while retaining all the creative, impulsive decisions he made while directing the film. if pulp fiction was directed in the same way every other movie has been and is, it definitely wouldn't be the popular and beloved film it is to this day. one of the most polarizing aspects of pulp fiction is the dialogue. adam, alongside many other unhappy viewers, argued that tarantino let the movie run too long because he ""was in love with the sound of his own voice."" although some parts of digression sound like they should have been cut out of the final film, many parts of dialogue are full of pop culture references and observations on human behavior, making each tangent philosophical and unique. this a far contrast to the generic black-and-white conversations in every other action film. especially between vega and winnfield, there is a sense of realism that gets lost in the production of big-screen movies. the conversations between them hold something theatrical while sounding natural at the same time. it's a combination which demands the audience's attention. tarantino's famed dialogue actually has led to some of the most memorable lines from movies of all time. a conversation about burgers across the globe may seem like something that should have been left out of a crime movie, but some users of the internet used this scene to portray brett kavanaugh's hearing. in the midst of controversy over kavanaugh being accused of sexual assault, the internet turned him into a fearful character in a well-known pulp fiction scene, allowing for others to express their opinions regarding the case. not only has this ""useless"" scene become iconic in modern day culture, it has also become a way for relevant information to be relayed. like many others who left negative reviews under pulp fiction, adam also argued that the movie ultimately lacked a plot. while the larger meaning of the movie remains unclear, the film definitely has a story to tell. tarantino's unique play on the gangster crime film is seen by how he uses details to drive the movie, even if it digresses from the typical film's plot development. as much as i'd recommend watching the movie, i'd also strongly recommend watching it for the second time since the movie will be more easily understood and enjoyed after understanding the story in chronological order. this is not to say that this film would be better off organized less abstractly. in fact, tarantino's use of chapters and flashbacks piece together each scene in an original and creative way. by rewatching the movie, the sense of familiarity to the characters and story will bring out new details overlooked the first time watched and give viewers a changed perception of the film. to some, the film is about power, explaining the character's actions and motives and the mystery which surrounds marsellus wallace. like abstract art, this film has piqued the creativity and curiosity of many viewers, leading to numerous interpretations and fan theories. in addition to all of the visual aspects of the film, pulp fiction included a soundtrack that matched the endearing amount of 'coolness' which the film itself possessed. tarantino again boldly took the path untaken by using music that wasn't particularly popular at the time. in an interview, tarantino stated that he was completely against the 'cheap' idea of using music to create a sense of period. instead, he used a variety of obscure tunes to define what the next music trends would be. the movie was largely built around 60's surf music, and has become synonymous with tracks like ""misirlou."" as a result of this, tarantino successfully brought a resurgence of surf music into the 90s pop culture. the soundtrack is also filled with many other genres of music other than surf rock. for example, when marcellus wallace is focused on in a scene, tarantino uses funk and soul music to create a mood of powerful calmness that wallace possesses. as a result of the influence that pulp fiction's soundtrack had on pop culture, the film was also able to boast numerous awards from mtv, the brit awards, and beyond. although some may find the non-chronological organization of pulp fiction and the lack of distinguishment between the 'good guys' and 'bad guys' confusing, it is one of the most influential movies to date, being referenced in pop culture and growing in popularity over 10 years after its debut. with many awards, hidden details, and a plot which keeps an audience on their toes, the film seems to automatically draw in audiences. the most outstanding attributes to this movie include its dialogue and the soundtrack. many people can agree that this is a film worth your time, securing a spot as one of the best movies of all time.";13 October 2018;10;['american',

3070;jenniaden;my thoughts before we start this movie is the movie that you record and then watch when there are no good movies on because you know that if you watch even if it is your 50th time watching it will still be good and pulp fiction may not be for but still thats why your reading this isn't it. the introduction pulp fiction opens up its story in a diner where a couple is talking about how to rob a bank and how easy it is getting to rob places and proceed to rob the diner that they are in. this tells you what kind of movie this is an indicator to a violent crime movie which is what it is and it rocks it. after it opens up to two hitmen going to complete a job and this is when the movie takes off the characters there are many main characters and you have to guess their names based off of what people call them. i am not going to tell the names of the characters because it doesn't matter. one of them is a boxer that takes money from a mob boss to lose and the winner and is on the run from him. there are these two hitmen and one of them quotes a bible verse all the time and the other is a italian guy who just got back from a job in france. the action there are many great action scenes in this movie there are scenes in cars and in houses and in torture chambers yes torture chambers also there are car chases and firefights and i sound like a little kid. also i haven't mentioned all of the times people die in the movie and people die a lot so if mind that get out of here. the thing that is so great about pulp fiction action scene is that they are quick and straight to the point and i like that. the end at the end of the story it ends with one of the characters learning and well you can't have a better ending than that especially considering he was a hitman;30 November 2018;9;['good', 'good', 'easy', 'violent', 'many', 'main', 'bible', 'other', 'italian', 'many', 'great', 'little', 'great', 'quick', 'well'];0.2939102564102564
3071;tibizlt-n;when i first saw this movie i wasn't impressed at all, but growing up later and seeing it again about 4 or 5 times really changed my mind about this. the average action movie viewer is not used to this type of psychological portrayal of violent situations, so the first time they'll see the film they won't get much out of it. pulp fiction is a fun experience every time, it never grows old on you, the performance of samuel l. jackson is arguably the best in all the movie, too bad the supporting actor academy award went to another film. the principal argument that makes this such a captivating movie is the unusual use of spontaneous day to day dialog in the majority of the scenes that would usually been contained in the macho action hero blockbusters.if i would stand and explain all the reasons that make this such a great film it would take me whole pages, but i state this, any film-goer that hasn't seen pulp fiction must get their hands as fast as possible on the dvd release!!!;3 March 2006;10;['average', 'psychological', 'violent', 'first', 'fun', 'old', 'good', 'bad', 'principal', 'unusual', 'spontaneous', 'macho', 'great', 'whole', 'possible'];0.1153846153846153
