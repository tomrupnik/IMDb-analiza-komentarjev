0;MartinHafer;"""the godfather: part ii"" is seen, by many, as the greatest sequel in movie history and one of the best films of all time. some even think it's better than ""the godfather"". as for me, who am i to argue?! the film is great--and deserved the best picture award and its placement at #3 on imdb's top 100 list! and, since there are over 500 reviews for it on the site, i can't think of why i am even bothering to review it. after all, what's one more review that sings its praises?! the acting, writing, direction and entire production is perfect. what more can you say? if you do see the film (and you must), try to watch the version that combines the first two films into one--and adds additional story to make it one huge and perfect epic. you simply can't be a film buff without seeing this picture.";30 March 2013;10;['many', 'great', 'good', 'well', 'great', 'good', 'top', 'more', 'entire', 'perfect', 'more', 'first', 'additional', 'huge', 'perfect'];0.5884615384615385
1;TheLittleSongbird;i do have to agree that calling godfather part ii a sequel is rather insulting. it is one of those rare sequels that almost outdoes the first, and considering how amazing the first godfather was that says a lot. the godfather part ii is longer, but in some ways it is also richer. people may say like with the first it is slow and takes a while to unfold. of course, but i think that was deliberate. both this and the first godfather have an elegiac quality to them that makes them even more compelling. for one thing, the film is very well made. the cinematography is simply gorgeous, whether it is dark or autumnal or picturesque, and the settings are wondrous. the music once again is outstanding, it is haunting and sticks in your head for a very long time. then there is a brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent and thoughtful, masterly direction from francis ford coppola and a fabulously constructed story. the film does have some wonderful scenes-: the scenes where vito flees sicily has the grandeur of a silent movie, while the scenes in cuba actually avoid being clumsy and confusing and the climax is extremely chilling. not to mention the pop goes the weasel scene, which was very funny. the acting is superb once again. vito is brilliantly portrayed by robert deniro in one of his better performances. i was also taken with robert duvall as loyal tom, john cazale and diane keaton. but the picture belongs to al pacino. he was great carrying the first godfather movie, but he is even better here. he is simply phenomenal, and to be honest i think he should have won that oscar. overall, an amazing film and one of the best sequels ever to be conceived. 10/10 bethany cox;24 November 2010;10;['insulting', 'rare', 'first', 'amazing', 'first', 'long', 'rich', 'first', 'slow', 'deliberate', 'first', 'elegiac', 'compelling', 'gorgeous', 'dark', 'autumnal', 'picturesque', 'wondrous', 'outstanding', 'long', 'intelligent', 'thoughtful', 'masterly', 'wonderful', 'silent', 'clumsy', 'confusing', 'chilling', 'funny', 'superb', 'well', 'loyal', 'great', 'first', 'well', 'phenomenal', 'honest', 'amazing', 'good'];0.2696236559139784
2;bkoganbing;although most movie sequels never equal the original this is certainly not the case of the godfather: part ii. many would argue it surpasses the original. with both films declared the best picture by the motion picture academy in their separate years, i'd hate to argue the difference. in this case we should thank the executives at paramount for retaining both director francis ford coppola and the original the godfather author mario puzo to put their talents to this film. i'd hate to think what would have happened in other hands. certainly these two men knew their characters and knew how to expand on them. and the best thing about the godfather: part ii is that one can pick up the story, at least the modern portion of this one without reference to the original. in fact viewing this film will give you a burning passion to see the first. unlike the godfather and the godfather: part iii, this film runs on two parallel tracks. the modern story is a continuation of al pacino as michael corleone now residing on the shores of lake tahoe and now directing the family affairs from nevada where the corleone family is heavily into gambling as we well know organized crime was back in those days of the fifties and sixties. he's going into partnership with lee strassberg playing hyman roth, a thinly veiled portrait of meyer lansky. but there are a lot of things making pacino hesitant about this move into cuba under the battista dictatorship. the prequel parallel story is how young vito corleone came to this country as an orphan and worked his way up to establish himself as a crime boss. here coppola does a brilliant job in capturing the flavor of pre-world war i new york in the italian ghetto. robert deniro is young vito corleone and won a best supporting actor oscar. remarkable when you consider that two of his rivals were lee strassberg from this film and michael v. gazzo playing frankie pantangeli from this film as well, the mafia kingpin turned senate witness modeled on joe valachi. deniro and marlon brando have the unique distinction as players of winning an oscar for playing the same role. the woman do better in this film as in the original. talia shire got an oscar nomination in the supporting actress category as connie corleone rizzi. you remember her husband betrays the family and is killed in the original. she now is a drunken dependent on pacino. diane keaton's character of kay adams corleone is expanded here as well. she's a cultural outsider and the sicilian vendetta code that she's expected to approve without comment becomes too much to bare. her scene with pacino when she tells him she's leaving him is one of the best for both in their respective careers. overlooked unfortunately at award time was john cazale as fredo corleone. he's the middle son who's passed over for succession after eldest son james caan is killed in the godfather. fredo's big moment in the godfather is being unable to fire his weapon in defense of his father being shot and how he breaks down. fredo's got feelings as john cazale dramatically points out. he does something really stupid in this film and it costs him dear. cazale has some of the best moments in this film. if the first godfather film doesn't do it, the godfather: part ii will have you permanently hooked on the inner workings and dynamics of the corleone family both in the criminal and personal sense.;17 March 2008;10;['most', 'original', 'many', 'original', 'good', 'separate', 'original', 'other', 'good', 'least', 'modern', 'original', 'first', 'parallel', 'modern', 'corleone', 'organized', 'hesitant', 'battista', 'prequel', 'parallel', 'young', 'brilliant', 'pre', 'world', 'young', 'good', 'remarkable', 'unique', 'same', 'original', 'oscar', 'corleone', 'original', 'drunken', 'dependent', 'cultural', 'much', 'bare', 'good', 'respective', 'middle', 'eld', 'big', 'unable', 'stupid', 'dear', 'good', 'first', 'inner', 'corleone', 'criminal', 'personal'];0.2135135135135135
3;Leofwine_draca;"a lot of people seem to consider the godfather part ii to be the best film ever made, a film that's even better than it's already excellent predecessor. unfortunately, i have to disagree. while this movie is very good, and as well made as the original, i think the original has the edge. the reason for that is the script, which was just better, and more involved, the first time around. here, there are dual narratives, one of which follows the traditional sequel route of showing that happened to the corleone family after the events of the first movie, while the second is a prequel revealing how vito corleone became the mafia boss he ended up as. while i love robert de niro and i enjoyed the flashback scenes, i felt this whole sequence was slightly unnecessary. from the material given, the viewer can already guess how the de niro character rose through the ranks and the events we witness feel a little bit superfluous. sure, the pair of assassination scenes are excellent, but the rest just feels obvious and expected. meanwhile, the pacino narrative also has its problems, although cast and director aren't at fault; coppola reunites many of his principals here and to excellent effect. however, there isn't nearly as much incident in the narrative and the whole story feels a little dragged out, a little over-emphasised. in the first film, the pacino character had three or four major plot points to deal with, whereas this time the events are limited; for example, the entire film focuses on the situation with roth, whereas in the godfather that would have just taken up half an hour or so. therefore the ending, when it comes, is admittedly powerful, but not as effective in comparison to the genuinely amazing things we saw in the first film. it's been done before, and apart from a little more depth and character focus, we can't take much more away from this sequel. so it's very good, but not quite up there to the level of the first.";7 April 2014;8;['good', 'well', 'excellent', 'good', 'original', 'well', 'first', 'dual', 'traditional', 'corleone', 'first', 'second', 'prequel', 'whole', 'unnecessary', 'little', 'superfluous', 'excellent', 'obvious', 'many', 'excellent', 'much', 'whole', 'little', 'little', 'first', 'major', 'limited', 'entire', 'powerful', 'effective', 'amazing', 'first', 'little', 'more', 'more', 'good', 'first'];0.2892281105990783
4;SnoopyStyle;"the saga continues with michael corleone (al pacino) fully in charge as the unflinching leader. the family drama just gets more and more darker. we are seeing the moral disintegration of michael. the movie also gets a separate timeline for young vito corleone (robert de niro). while that is interesting at times, it is very disruptive especially since it's all in italian. meanwhile, michael's story keeps getting better. how could you forget ""i know it was you, freddo. you broke my heart."" or ""keep your friends close, and your enemies closer."" and john cazale shines as fredo. his exchanges with al pacino are epic. and the emotional grenade tossed by kay (diane keaton) is absolutely stunning. all in all, it is a great effort for a sequel to a masterpiece.";28 November 2013;9;['more', 'dark', 'moral', 'separate', 'young', 'interesting', 'disruptive', 'italian', 'well', 'close', 'epic', 'emotional', 'stunning', 'great'];0.235
5;Hitchcoc;"it's only a sequel because of the part ii thing. this simply fills in the spaces with one of the greatest characters of all time. remember, the two were put together in an incredible sage, putting things in chronological order. talk about your psychological studies. inside the head of michael corleone is a sense of power at all costs. yet, he sees himself as a moral man. i wonder if one could look at organized criminals like one might look at a mideast country, because they have their own principalities, their own history, almost their own religion. they have parceled out their land and protect against invaders. they fear and react to threats from the outside, from ""non-family"" members.the product they sell is terror. of course, all participants live on the edge. their human failings are dismissed and magnified as weakness and disloyalty. brothers kill brothers. i haven't a lot to add because i am not a film expert. as uncomfortable as this film makes me (like the first one), i continue to watch. and in my heart of hearts i wonder if i were cast into this setting, could i stand up to the expectations of my culture?";16 February 2007;10;['great', 'incredible', 'chronological', 'psychological', 'moral', 'organized', 'mideast', 'own', 'own', 'own', 'non', 'human', 'uncomfortable', 'first'];0.2954545454545454
6;Horst_In_Translation;"this is ""the godfather: part ii"", an american movie mostly in the english language, but there are segments in italian included too. and even a few other languages. i think nothing really needs to be said about the film's status. way over a million ratings here on imdb are self-explanatory and so are over a thousand reviews. i will happily add mine now and i hope you will like the read. this was by far not the first time that i watched this film, maybe third or fourth, so it was not new or refreshing to me, but this film is certainly also still a high-quality watch the tenth or twentieth time. it's also been quite a long time since i saw this film before yesterday, so i cannot really elaborate on stuff i perceived differently. one aspect, however, is that i remember liking the de niro parts a lot more on first or second viewing than i did now. no contest for me now that pacino is the heart and soul of the film and i think most people agree. i have read many film buffs even say that pacino is better than brando in the first. the makeup sure helped the latter with the epic status of his role there. still a bit sad that pacino did not get the oscar here. no offense to art carney though. of course, it is also always about the competition. look at the supporting players from the first godfather film coming short against joel grey. i doubt de niro would have won there, but it's all speculation anyway. probably the best picture win was even more obvious for this sequel. best director sure was. i got to watch this film at the big screen the other day which had of course to do with the 50th anniversary of the first godfather movie. they did not show the third though, just the first and second, maybe also because of the big time gap between the second and third film. anyway, let's look at the plot now. this is to some extent two films in one because a lot of the film takes place before thre first film even while other parts show us what happened after the death of vito corleone. it's also not chronological. i remember that i thought de niro was lead here, but his scenes are so rare in the film's first half that i agree now that probably pacino is the only lead here. in the second half, there was a lot more de niro, which helped him with his awards ambitions too i guess. of course, we also never see de niro and pacino on the screen together because there's decades between their characters. we do see de niro's character though with young michael when he was a baby. and with young fredo as well. it's a pity cazale did not manage to score a nomination for his work here. his scene when he complains about his brother that he was overlooked was one of the finest from the entire film. maybe his other scenes were not significant enough. same can be said about diane keaton here, who plays michael's wife. the scene in which she confronts michael with the unborn's death being an abortion was among the very best from the film, but other than that her screen time was limited. must also mention pacino in this scene. of course, there is a lot of anger with his character, but you will never see him more angry than in this exact moment. he also never really physically attacks people, but there it had to come out. his speech about how it is just not an option that she will get the children was also very haunting. just like the moment in which he closes the door later on right into keaton's face. there are so many memorable and haunting moments in here that i cannot mention them all. you just have to experience them and i definitely think you should watch the other film first to really understand the story. comedy is something you will not find in here at all and if maybe very briefly (you think) you do, then it has a bit to do with fredo's character like how he will not let go of the suitcase containing the money. you can also wonder if fredo knew what was about to happen to him in the spectacular finale. there you see how michael really gets his will again. one antagonist commits suicide. another is murdered by a contract killer and his own brother also has to pay for what he did, even if it was a long time ago. this killing stays of course maybe most in the mind with how michael thinks about fredo and talked about him before that, how he understand that it was fredo, the kiss, how he confronts him, how he talks to his mother on one occasion. another brilliant scene. his mother is not a factor otherwise, even if she is a character who is part of both seperate story lines, once as a young woman, once being close to her death. her being alive was also a guarantee for fredo to stay alive. i also liked the way the film ended. the setting is basically between both story lines. the boys are grown-up and they tried their best with makeup to have them look young. especially interesting to see michael there telling his plans to his brothers and how he is not 10% of the alpha he is for the rest of this film. briefly before brando/vito enters. even one of the actors from the first film is brought back for that. one who died there in a pretty spectacular sequence. but this sequel here is not chronological at all and does not have to be to fully succeed. my review is not particularly chronological either. i must say the truly great moments from de niro's character's story here are missing if there is anything to criticize. it is still interesting to watch how he rises, also to see the (familiar) characters he surrounds himself with. how he takes care of the one bullying the neighborhood to kinda become a more distinguished, more dedicated version of him. also interesting to see how vito ends up being called vito corleone. very brief moment early on. actually, there was some comedy to how he dealt with a greedy landlord and this showed us how important loyalty is to him. i mean the comedy included mostly the scene in which the landlord returned. back to the other scenes again, i must also mention michael v. gazzo. would have loved to see him win the oscar here. i definitely preferred his antagonist portrayal over hyman roth, although it is probably almost impossible to compare those two because their characters could not have been any more different really. both really good for different reasons. also interesting to see lee strasberg in here with his famous acting institute of course. one of gazzo's character's most memorable scenes included his brother, but how he unleashed early on against everything non-italian, no matter if we are talking ""pop goes the weasle"", jews or black people, was also highly entertaining. nothing against a good tarantella i suppose. as for roth, i found his most memorable scene was maybe the one from new year's eve, even if his character was basically just sleeping there or being in a coma. this was when a hit actually did go wrong, although i wonder where those saviors suddenly came from. the talk between him and michael (strasberg's first scene) was good too though. another hit that went wrong involved pentangeli (gazzo). i am not sure i got this right, but it was not michael's folks behind that one there. sure turned out clumsy. one character i have not talked about at all was the corleone sister played by talia shire. she had her own agenda and the guy she chose as husband did not make michael happy. not much else to say about her. i am surprised shire was nominated for an oscar honestly. but yeah all is possible when somebody who is considered (one of) the greatest lead performance(s) in film history does not win his category. also i must mention robert duvall (tom hagen). hagen is still loyal to the family, but his bond to michael is just not as strong as his bond to michael's father. not even close. there are steady conflicts between these two, but they kinda overcome them without their relationship really improving, even if there's moments in which michael tells hagen that he is the only one he can trust now. no fredo, nobody else. you can surely say that michael also has a tendency to not trust anybody. there was a good quote on that too. i think it came from pentangeli about the difference in how michael dealt with the jews and how vito did. speaking of vito again, as i am getting close to the end of my review, let me of course mention his moment of great revenge when he kills the man who is responsible for murdering his father, his mother and his brother. that had to be included 100% and you simply knew it was going to happen, even if the bad guy was very old at that point already and vito literally opens his chest with a massive knife. disguised as a potential olive oil deal. so yeah, also some italian cuisine aspects included here. no pizza really though. but politics and law. a senator has to find out what happens when he makes an enemy in michael corleone. and there is a fairly lengthy courtroom trial too that culminates basically in the scene with pentangeli's brother that i mentioned earlier already. so many great metaphors and symbolisms in here. look at fredo acting almost like a dad towards michael's son before his demise and how he can finally say that (with the help of god) he was more gifted than his brothers. even if it was only about fishing. how he talked about fishing being a family tradition etc. how de niro's character pretty much won over the bad guy in his story line thanks to his grit and courage. and then still proceeded to kill him in the following scene. sneaky over the rooftops. there's really too much to choose from what your favorite scenes could be. or favorite shots too. i mean look at the very final shot with michael having succeeded with every plan of his. how he sits there. this would have been amazing ultimate closure too without a third film happening 15 years later. back when this was made, coppola was just in his early 30s. what an achievement for a pretty young filmmaker! now he is in his early 80s. ""the godfather: part ii"" is a must see. huge thumbs-up.

7;kosmasp;not only the arguments if this one is better than the first godfather (godfather ii has been used by many as an example that sequels can be better than the original movie), but also the time line of the movie. so while this is the first movie that includes al pacino and robert de niro in one movie, the time line constraints did not allow for them to be in the same scene (wouldn't make any sense, you'll understand when and if you have watched the movie). also de niro won an oscar (funny fact, for the same role/character marlon brando won one in the first godfather, must be a first and i don't know if it happened again, doubt it though) while al pacino didn't. and while it may seem unfair to pacino, it was more than well deserved for de niro, who really merged himself into the character that brando created. from the way he talked, to gestures to mannerisms. everything is there! but the movie won a few oscars and the acting was really good too. the story continues (though gives us a few flashbacks) from the ending of part 1. so while the first one is conclusive and has a satisfying ending itself, the story could be continued. especially with the original author on board (mr. puzzi). there are new themes introduced in this movie. one big one is loneliness. and it's not only about being alone when you have power or being the godfather. as with the first movie this explores quite a lot of things in gang related family living. a great movie that was even longer than the first one (and the sequel that came after it). but you probably won't mind the length. especially if you buy into the drama, that really works. and even without it stating the time jumps/leaps it makes, you'll get the (time) change on your own. a great sequel to a great movie;4 February 2013;9;['well', 'first', 'many', 'well', 'original', 'first', 'same', 'funny', 'same', 'first', 'first', 'unfair', 'few', 'good', 'few', 'first', 'conclusive', 'original', 'new', 'big', 'loneliness', 'alone', 'first', 'related', 'great', 'long', 'first', 'own', 'great', 'great'];0.2454545454545454
8;classicsoncall;"it's difficult to imagine that ""godfather ii"" could trade punches with the original and still remain standing, but this is one brilliant film. masterfully tracing the history of the corleone family from vito's arrival at ellis island in 1901 to the lake tahoe empire of 1958, the story is a decades spanning saga that makes you wonder how almost three and a half hours can blow by so quickly. the picture's numerous flashback scenes work well to establish the beginnings of don corleone's rise to power, and robert de niro's portrayal of the young vito effectively allow us to forget about asking why marlon brando didn't show up even once. pacino is no longer the fresh faced kid home from the military who takes up the family business, but the brooding, brutal leader of a crime syndicate with a chessboard strategy of staying two and three steps ahead of his enemies at all times. if you haven't seen the movie in a long time, you might be surprised like i was while watching today. it's easy to recall the highlights like frank pentangeli's courtroom scene and subsequent suicide, and the way fredo met his timely demise. what i had long forgotten was the way the picture opens with the sicilian back story, and the way the new york neighborhood flashback thread literally runs throughout the entire picture. it's funny how i recall those scenes as a single sequence leading up to the murder of don fanucci, but it just goes to show you how faulty memory can be. you know, it's hard to believe that the first two godfather movies are nearing the forty year mark since their original release. they've become american classics that have well withstood the test of time, and will continue maintain their appeal. it's fair to say that seeing both of these iconic films are a must for the true cinema fan.";10 April 2010;10;['difficult', 'original', 'brilliant', 'corleone', 'numerous', 'young', 'fresh', 'faced', 'brutal', 'long', 'surprised', 'easy', 'subsequent', 'timely', 'entire', 'funny', 'single', 'faulty', 'hard', 'first', 'original', 'american', 'fair', 'iconic', 'true'];0.1354875283446712
9;lee_eisenberg;"everyone has probably heard that ""the godfather: part ii"" is as good as the original, and it's true. perhaps it's better, that's debatable. picking up where the first film left off, we see the corleones' control over las vegas. also, michael (al pacino) gets involved with hyman roth (lee strasberg), one of his father's former cohorts. meanwhile, in flashbacks, we see young vito andolini immigrate from the town of corleone, sicily, to new york city in the early 20th century. as he ages (the adult vito is played by robert deniro), vito becomes increasingly involved in mafia business. the climax (at least in my opinion, it was the climax) happens in cuba on new year's eve in 1958. you may recall that the mafia helped prop up fulgencio batista and his reign of terror. anyway, while michael and fredo (john cazale) are at a party at the presidential palace, michael angrily yells at fredo ""i know it was you, fredo! you broke my heart!"" at that moment, just as it turns into 1959, the revolutionary forces enter havana, proclaiming the revolution's victory. the combination of these two events shows that things won't be the same anymore, whether in the corleone family or in cuba. to be certain, kay (diane keaton) has some unexpected news for michael when he returns home. the point is, this movie disproves the notion that all sequels suck. this sequel is a masterpiece, with splendid performances by pacino, keaton, deniro, cazale, strasberg, robert duvall and talia shire. but of course, most of all, this movie's superbness owes to director francis ford coppola. he knows exactly how to make a movie, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise. 10/10.";26 July 2005;10;['good', 'original', 'true', 'well', 'debatable', 'first', 'former', 'young', 'early', 'least', 'new', 'presidential', 'revolutionary', 'same', 'corleone', 'certain', 'unexpected', 'splendid', 'talia', 'most'];0.2399273345701917

(no wonder the film is so long!!). and with the risk of being politically incorrect, you can almost smell the garlic in every scene, so realistic are the accents and the background flavor of the entire film. so many plot developments are almost throwaways because the screenplay seems to be deliberately ambiguous about certain plot elements. and yet, the film has a certain holding power and all of the performances are more than competent. especially poignant--and chilling--is the scene where fredo's fishing expedition takes place with stormy looking clouds setting the eerie scene to perfection as the expected murder takes place. with murderous intentions just around the corner in practically every scene, it's a fascinating film to watch, especially since the murders themselves are so deftly handled by the actors involved. diane keaton is especially convincing in the final confrontation with pacino. i don't think godfather ii compares favorably to the original film with brando, particularly since it's not always successful in telling two stories--the one involving the young vito (robert deniro) and the present story--but it still packs a wallop when it gets to the intense moments. the double strand of stories doesn't always mesh well, a weakness of structure that hurts the film. despite this major flaw, it's a superior piece of film-making.";31 March 2008;7;['somber', 'dimensional', 'compelling', 'first', 'long', 'incorrect', 'realistic', 'entire', 'many', 'ambiguous', 'certain', 'certain', 'more', 'competent', 'poignant', 'chilling', 'stormy', 'eerie', 'murderous', 'fascinating', 'convincing', 'final', 'original', 'successful', 'young', 'present', 'intense', 'double', 'major', 'superior'];0.2076140873015872

""the godfather"" doesn't look or sound quite like any gangster film before it, with it's muddy lighting and sound. it's also much more ambiguous morally than the usual hollywood gangster film, at least any produced up to that point. the line between crime and justice is blurred sometimes beyond distinction, and the corleone family at times acts with more honor (in its own way) than the institutions charged with upholding freedom, justice and morality. in this way, ""the godfather"" offered a scathing critique of the foundations on which america as a country was built. coppola, however, drives this point into the ground over the course of three films. there's really not much more to say after the first film (it's already apparent that michael corleone's style of rule is different from his father's, his coldness and ruthlessness necessitated by a changing time), but we have to sit through a nearly 3 1/2 hour second installment that does nothing but reiterate this point again and again. part ii at least is saved by the back story of vito corleone (played by marlon brando in part i and robert de niro in part ii), and that story alone keeps part ii afloat. but part iii is wholly unnecessary and mars the whole enterprise, turning the franchise into the stuff of parody and camp. al pacino is the glue that holds the trilogy together, though his character really isn't as complex as a first viewing would have you believe. the major conflict facing him is resolved in the first film, and the second and third films give him nothing to do but replay what are essentially the same scenes over and over again. other standouts in the cast include robert duvall, diane keaton and talia shire (who alone makes the third chapter worth watching). obviously a must see for cinema buffs, or even casual fans, but don't feel you have to label this trilogy as great just because of the reputation that precedes it. grade: part i: a part ii: b part iii: c-";26 July 2006;7;['american', 'disappointing', 'influential', 'first', 'last', 'stinky', 'peggy', 'third', 'most', 'promising', 'important', 'american', 'whole', 'overrated', 'great', 'cultural', 'wrong', 'least', 'first', 'interesting', 'entire', 'first', 'good', 'able', 'extreme', 'faithful', 'artistic', 'muddy', 'ambiguous', 'usual', 'least', 'corleone', 'more', 'own', 'scathing', 'more', 'first', 'apparent', 'different', 'second', 'least', 'back', 'unnecessary', 'whole', 'complex', 'first', 'major', 'first', 'second', 'third', 'same', 'other', 'talia', 'third', 'worth', 'casual', 'great'];0.0926215277777777

30;Wuchakk;"released in 1974 and directed by francis ford coppola, ""the godfather: part ii"" is part sequel and part flashback to the first film with the main story focusing on michael (al pacino) in the late 50s as the stalwart corleone son who has taken over as 'godfather' with events taking place at lake tahoe, miami, new york city, havana (during the cuban revolution), and a congressional committee in washington dc. the flashbacks concern vito corleone as a kid in sicily and his arrival to ellis island with the story focusing on vito's life in new york city when he was in his mid-to-late 20s (robert de niro) where he cleverly and boldly establishes himself as the formidable new don. main cast: robert duvall plays the adopted lawyer son, tom, while john cazale appears as the weakest corleone son, fredo. diane keaton returns as michael's wife, who tries to put out of her mind her husband's shady business with talia shire reprising the role of corleone sister, connie. the good news is that the flashbacks pertaining to vito (de niro) are good, starting with the shocking opening scenes. the saga of michael (pacino), by contrast, is relatively dull, particularly the first half, which mostly involves overlong scenes of talky drama. michael's story simply lacks the energy and highlight-every-15-minutes of the prior film. moreover, pacino is thoroughly one-note solemn as michael, lacking the character's interesting story arc in the first installment and the dimension of the third. i'm not blaming pacino, as he simply played the role as written and does it well. i'm just saying that he's not a very captivating character, particularly compared to brando or de niro as vito. he's just too one-dimensional and therefore uninteresting. thankfully, things perk up in the second half culminating with an explosive showdown between michael and kay, which had to happen in light of the climatic scene of the previous movie. the moral of the story rings loud and clear: choosing the life of organized crime will result in a grim life of constant heartache and premature death all around you. life's hard enough without taking that shady route. bottom line: this is a worthwhile crime drama with some highlights, but imho it's not in the same league as the first movie in overall entertainment. it's good for what it is, but it's overrated by people who can't see beyond nostalgia-tinged glasses. if you're a fan of the first film it's almost mandatory that you watch this one; just don't expect the same dynamic greatness. i know it's sacrilege to say this, but part ii is on par with part iii in tone and quality, although i personally give part iii the edge in all-around entertainment value. the film runs 3 hours & 22 minutes (overlong) and was shot in sicily & friuli-venezia giulia, italy; the new york city area; lake tahoe, california; santo domingo, dominican republic; acireale, catania; las vegas; and washington dc. writers: coppola & mario puzo. grade: b";20 September 2017;7;['first', 'main', 'late', 'stalwart', 'corleone', 'congressional', 'corleone', 'late', 'formidable', 'new', 'main', 'weak', 'corleone', 'shady', 'corleone', 'good', 'shocking', 'dull', 'first', 'overlong', 'talky', 'prior', 'interesting', 'first', 'third', 'dimensional', 'uninteresting', 'second', 'explosive', 'climatic', 'previous', 'moral', 'loud', 'clear', 'grim', 'constant', 'premature', 'hard', 'shady', 'bottom', 'worthwhile', 'imho', 'same', 'first', 'overall', 'good', 'first', 'mandatory', 'same', 'dynamic', 'around'];0.0028696051423324

41;ElMaruecan82;"by tracing a parallel story between vito's ascension to power and the consolidation of this very power by his son michael, ""the godfather part ii"" has an epic scope that remarkably contrasts with the 'intimate feeling' of the first opus. yes, there's a cruel lack of warmth, of genuine love, of this very 'family spirit' that cemented the iconic greatness of ""part i"" but that's because the very purpose of the film is to show another kind of intimacy, the one between politics, business and crime, as to highlight a sort of inner perversity in the american dream. this is also why the film is regarded as an epic. in ""part ii"", it's not a five-families-war that structures the plot anymore, so there's no need for this 'team spirit' anymore, we're far from the good old days with sonny, hagen, tessio and clemenza, when the corleones were fighting for their survival. the bigger your territory gets, the more invisible is your enemy ... so invisible he can even be one of your own. indeed, even the first film ended with a betrayal from tessio, vito's trustful capo-regime, a shock that foreshadowed the idea expressed by michael in ""part ii"", the fact that ""loyalty relies on business"". what a world where you can't call your friends ""friends"" because they are only your ""associates"" but you still call your enemies ""enemies""! what a world when your enemies have to be kept closer than your ""friends""! and what a world when even your brother can betray you! ""part ii"" is a much darker film in its content because it plunges us in a world where there's no room for genuine and non-calculating people after all, isn't one of the many things that make the first film more enjoyable the presence of such characters as sonny- even michael has these words about fredo, ""he's a good heart but he's weak and stupid, and this is life and death"". life and death indeed, the family expanded its power, becoming one of the wealthiest in nevada, but it's not new york city anymore, it's time to deal with a new category of enemies, more dangerous because they are more respectable. the film opens with a conversation between michael corleone and senator geary, but this time the politician is not the criminal's friend, he not only despises him but explicitly affirms his intention to ""squeeze him"". michael's reply sets the tone of the film ""senator, my offer is this: nothing"", he wouldn't feign legitimacy with a man who just asserted his moral corruption. if politicians and criminals play in the same arena: business, then they'll play according to the rule of the strongest. crime has ceased to be an underworld, on the contrary, it embraced the world, getting ""bigger than us steel"" as hyman roth would say, in the name of making a profit that would go as far for legitimacy as pretending to serve a country's economy, las vegas, pre-revolution cuba, even be able to elect a new president. if coppola was accused of romanticizing the mob in the first opus, no one can hold the same accusation against ""part ii"", and the directing plays a significant role to that. indeed, it's impossible to end the second film with the same level of fascination created by the magical moment where neri shuts the door on kay's face, and maybe that's why we still enjoy the first film, because it has this sort of 'happy end' feel, because we are still within the corleone's inner circle and ""the good team won"" and could savor the victory behind the closed door. michael became another man, even more ruthless than his father, but he was the don in this 'underworld' context, so he can only inspire our empathy, if not our respect. but in part ii, crime, business and politics are all part of the same hypocrisy, and while michael could count on the loyalty of neri, rocco, hagen and even fredo at the end of the first part, in part ii, he becomes aware that greed and thirst for power can triumph over the most loyal individual.... and if he didn't knew that before, the assassination attempt he miraculously escaped from, sent a clear message about it. so, while ""part i"" established the necessity of a strong loyalty to overcome a clearly identifiable enemy, ""part i""i highlights the illusory aspect of loyalty when it comes to an invisible enemy that can be on your own side, even your own brother, consequently leading to michael's descent into paranoia. the first film was a consolidation of power, built on family, friendship and loyalty, incarnated by the warmth and quiet strength of vito corleone, we find him again with the traits of robert de niro, in his oscar-winning role. he represents the heritage of michael corleone, the proper use of power, of intelligence, of heart but the tragedy of ""part ii"" is to highlight the obsolescence of a figure like vito corleone in a world that got more blinded by greed and power, a world where machiavellian intelligence was a more valuable asset than pure intuition and where even love and brotherhood could be reduced to sheer abstractions. times have changed and michael realized that the time of his father is over, and that he can indeed ""lose his family"". the tragic irony is that he lost it by trying to preserve it. the second film deconstructed all the values that its glorious predecessor stood for to draw a dark, gripping and harrowing portrait of crime, incarnated by the cold and ruthless eyes of michael corleone, al pacino in what i believe to be one of the all-time greatest performances. it's thought-provoking, it's even more realistic, but maybe we blame it for not being 'more enjoyable' than the first film, more romantic i mean. for

47;secondtake;"the godfather part ii (1974) is this well made? dramatic? epic? beautiful? impressive? of course. is this better than the original godfather? in some ways, yes. it lacks the originality of the whole world novelist mario puzo (and co-screenwriter coppola) created, but it fills in background in italy and adds wonderful new elements about immigration and the revolution in cuba. it lacks marlon brando, who is a force of his own, but the presence of robert deniro in the many long flashbacks is moving (and he has more presence than pacino, frankly, who is intentionally stoic, but to the point of expressionless). is it a great movie? why not? what is a great movie supposed to do that this one doesn't? well, for one thing, i don't think it surprises at all. it doesn't reveal anything too deeply, despite all its deeply felt and emotionally turbulent scenes, and despite the apparent inner probing of the main character (who is last seen thinking very hard, staring into space). it doesn't suggest how to feel about any of this violence, this cold duplicity. and maybe it shouldn't do any of these things. it is an oddly ""confirming"" experience. it shows what we have come to think we already know, more or less, about the mafia world with its combination of loyalty and bloody revenge, its attachment to business and its selfishness, its emphasis on family even as it kills those in its own family. what coppola does do, as director, is suck you in. you get wrapped up in the world of these men (mostly men, of course, though with a great small role by talia shire and a famously troubled larger role by diane keaton, who makes a better annie hall by far). you are easily and gladly transported from new york to las vegas to miami to italy back and forth, across time and space, in warm colors and sweeping scenes, inside and out. the pieces of this rather complex story are put together with ""artful"" deliberation--it's a work of art, surely, despite its relatively straight forward intentions. it is also filmed, that is lit and photographed, with sensitivity, without becoming virtuosic for its own sake, by gordon willis. part of the immersion happens because of how everything is depicted, and it's easier said than done to make it all cohere and remain beautiful. so yes, it's surely a terrific movie. it might not be one of your favorite movies, and it really isn't one of mine. i've resisted watching it a second time for two decades, and finally have, and found my mind wandering sometimes. this might partly be a testament to the imprint the godfather movies have made on american culture and on the movies, because part of my distraction was that it's all so familiar. but it's familiar partly because it's so influential and convincing. but it's also partly true that there isn't a huge range of events here. i mean, a lot happens, but it falls mostly into a small diversity of power plays, deceptions, waiting games, and ruthless murders. it's all fascinating and terrifying on some level, but it all wraps around itself over and over again. you will find yourself understanding and even identifying with some of the characters, but you might not find yourself sympathizing with any of them, not the major ones, who are all (all) out for themselves in the end, or a pathetic followers yes men. in short, if you like this world and are fascinated by the male power aura, every second is filled with drama. but if like me this isn't really sufficient for over three hours of absorption, your mind might wander a bit, too. cosi sia.";6 May 2011;9;['dramatic', 'epic', 'beautiful', 'impressive', 'well', 'original', 'whole', 'co', 'screenwriter', 'wonderful', 'new', 'own', 'many', 'long', 'more', 'stoic', 'great', 'great', 'turbulent', 'apparent', 'inner', 'main', 'cold', 'more', 'less', 'bloody', 'own', 'great', 'small', 'troubled', 'large', 'well', 'warm', 'sweeping', 'complex', 'artful', 'straight', 'forward', 'own', 'easy', 'cohere', 'beautiful', 'terrific', 'favorite', 'second', 'american', 'familiar', 'familiar', 'influential', 'convincing', 'true', 'huge', 'small', 'ruthless', 'fascinating', 'major', 'pathetic', 'short', 'male', 'sufficient'];0.2039197781385281

53;The-Sarkologist;well, it seems that i agree partially with ebert on this film, except that he rated it higher than i did. the reason that i rated it lower is because there seems to be little to tie the entire film together. the character development and interaction is brilliant, but the plot itself seems to be quite loose and very thin in places. also the movie seems to follow very closely to the style of the first film, with an almost sudden ending, where everybody that appears to be an antagonist is simply killed, or put out of the picture. what this movie does well though is to offer a comparison between don vito corleone and his son michael corleone. here we see how vito's family was killed by a powerful mafia don in sicily, and then flees to america to build his empire. we then jump to the present (in the film, which is 1959) to see the crowning glory of what his family became. the difference is that michael corleone is a cold and heartless man who slowly pushes everybody close to him away, while vito corleone, even though he can be a brutal murderer at times, is an honourable man who is there to help the poor and the weak. we see this when he bullies the landlord who bullies a poor widow tenant. i guess the thing that strikes us most in this movie is how michael and vito corleone change. vito goes from being a poor orphan boy with small pox to a powerful mafia don, while michael goes from being a rich family man to a cold and powerful man with no friends. in the final scenes he falls to the lowest and kills his brother. i have never been all that great about sequels, and i feel that this movie is really no different.;3 March 2012;6;['little', 'entire', 'brilliant', 'loose', 'thin', 'first', 'sudden', 'powerful', 'cold', 'heartless', 'close', 'brutal', 'honourable', 'poor', 'weak', 'poor', 'corleone', 'poor', 'small', 'powerful', 'rich', 'cold', 'powerful', 'final', 'low', 'great', 'different'];-0.0582357859531772

""jaws"" for example, who does not hear the ""jaws"" theme and worry a little about what's below them when they are swimming just a little too far out in the ocean!! godfather 2 is another of those movies. even before the short opening credits have finished, the movie already starts to take effect. this is not just a gangster movie, it's a movie that poses deep moral problems for all of the main characters. it doesn't attempt to answer questions. the rights and wrongs that these people do to each other. what would i have done, had i been in michael corleone's shoes? of the cast, al pacino deserved the oscar for his work in this, the middle of his three oscar nominations for best actor in a row 73-75.

57;imseeg;2 word advice: watch it. just watch it. watch the restored 4k version if you can, the picture quality is breathtakingly gorgeous. this isnt a review by the way, it's just a long tribute to the brilliance of this work. for once a sequel is as powerful as the original. the godfather part 2 is the proof. it is more elobarate, with a more detailed, complicated story, compared to the original. it has more character devellopment than part 1. yet it definitely has a more saddening, melancholic mood as well. the original godfather is like watching spring, watching the godfather part 2 however is like entering a never ending winter. part 2 is as powerful, as mesmirising and as brilliant as the original, but so saddening to watch. sad, but beautiful. director francis ford coppola pulled of something no other director has ever achieved. he created 2 masterpieces of american cinema back to back, within 2 years. coppola was a mad man in the seventies. bordering on lunacy and also bordering on bankruptcy. although one would think the enormous succes of the original godfather made him a millionaire, he risked all his money for the sequel. that risk of investing all of his own money gave him a lot of creative control though, with consequentially terrific results. just to mention one example in which director coppola took risks no other director would dare take, i want to tell you about the robert de niro scenes shot in new york. the studio wanted to shoot these streetscenes on a cheaper indoor filmset, but director coppola insisted he wanted to shoot on the streets of new york. this was not just a regular shoot, no way. coppola cordoned off two entire city blocks for weeks on end. he redesigned the entire 2 blocks to make them look exactly like pre-war conditions. new yorkers being new yorkers were complaining about the inability to enter their own houses for weeks on end. the costs that cordoning off entire city blocks costed were skyrocketing. and for what purpose? coppola wanted an authentic looking scene of merely a couple a minutes in which robert de niro would walk the streets of his neighbourhood. these scenes do look stunning, and because i know how many millions these few scenes have costed, i cant help but admire coppola even more then i already did, for wanting to go to the limit in order to achieve ultimate credibility. and that is what the godfather oozes in massive amounts: credibility. never before or after have life and love and the bonds of family been portrayed with such cinematic craftmanship and soul. originally released in 1974. it was brilliant, mesmirising and taking my breath away back then. it still does, to this very day...;7 April 2019;10;['gorgeous', 'long', 'powerful', 'original', 'detailed', 'complicated', 'original', 'more', 'devellopment', 'saddening', 'melancholic', 'original', 'powerful', 'brilliant', 'original', 'sad', 'beautiful', 'other', 'american', 'mad', 'enormous', 'original', 'own', 'creative', 'terrific', 'other', 'cheap', 'indoor', 'regular', 'entire', 'entire', 'pre', 'war', 'new', 'new', 'own', 'entire', 'authentic', 'stunning', 'many', 'few', 'ultimate', 'massive', 'such', 'cinematic', 'brilliant', 'very'];0.2115299334811529
58;tomgillespie2002;"of all the wonderful things that can be said about francis ford coppola's american masterpiece the godfather (1972), above all else the film is a masterclass in storytelling. it's essentially a classic, romantic story of family, loyalty and the passage of time, undercut with a dark, violent portrayal of what it takes to achieve the american dream. it told a detailed, complex, and often confusing story featuring a large ensemble of characters, but this only matched the complexity of what coppola was trying to achieve. the director, adapting mario puzo's novel, famously had a torrid time at the hands of the producers, namely robert evans. yet when the resulting three-hour epic became a box-office and award-season smash, coppola would be given free reign if he was to helm a follow- up. the resulting three hour twenty minute sequel was the director grabbing his chance to have complete control and pouring all of his artistry into it. this wasn't to be another classical hollywood tale, but one of corruption, greed and pure evil. i first saw the godfather part ii around 20 years ago at the age of 12 when i was first allowed to start watching movies for grown-ups. watching it now, having seen it a handful of times in between, it's a completely different movie to the one i remember. i remembered it as an ambitious gangster movie with quite shocking violence, chocked full of great performances by actors who are now giants in their field. what i see now is a sequel truly like no other. a movie that is somehow optimistic and pessimistic in equal measures; one that sees its lead lose his soul while his father gains his; and quite possibly one of the saddest movies ever made. at first, part ii mirrors the narrative of its predecessor, beginning with a grand wedding as the don (now al pacino's michael corleone) makes his underlings sweat as they wait to greet the head of the 'family'. while the previous wedding was a joyous, boisterous occasion, this one is noticeably different. of the family that remains - john cazale's weak-willed fredo; talia shire's gold- digging connie - only the mother seems to be the same. the band doesn't even know any italian songs. while michael may have attempted to continue his father's legacy when he took over, the changing, capitalist world has driven him inward, isolating himself from everybody around him and drifting away from the sicilian values of his father. he was once a proud war veteran with a bright future, but now he is solemn and aggressive, and becomes even more so when a hit on his home almost kills him and his wife kay (diane keaton). his close brush with death only fuels his paranoia, and he must navigate perilous waters as he moves into business in cuba with one his father's business associates hyman roth (lee strasberg), who also happens to be backing a couple of brothers moving into corleone capo frankie pentangeli's (michael v. gazzo) territory. michael suspects a betrayer within his own ranks, suspecting everyone including his own family. it almost seems like a deliberately confusing plot to take in alongside michael's descent into pure evil, and it may all be too overwhelming had coppola not chosen to juxtapose this story with one of optimism and nostalgia; that of the young vito corleone's escape from a mafia boss in sicily and his eventual arrival in america. there is infinitely more colour and hope in these moments, and while these scenes may gloss over vito's own violent journey, it seems like coppola is making a point about where he feels his country was heading. of course, these flashbacks are made even more welcome by the astonishing performance from a young robert de niro. the godfather part ii currently sits in between the godfather and the dark knight as #3 on imdb's top 250 list, and while i have little faith in the accuracy of a list that relies so heavily on popularity, it must be one of the most difficult and uncompromising movies in there. i'm actually pleasantly surprised that so many people love it, given the lack of flashy moments of violence the genre is so popular for. it's an experiment that could have gone so horribly wrong, and one that certainly wouldn't have been made outside of the innovative 1970s. yet coppola gets everything spectacularly right, from the inspirational casting of the oscar- nominated gazzo and strasberg, to the chilling penultimate scene which sees james caan's sonny briefly return. in that final moment we realise that michael has always been alone, destined to carve his own path, while forever gazing into the past to ponder what could have been.";5 February 2017;10;['wonderful', 'american', 'classic', 'romantic', 'undercut', 'dark', 'violent', 'detailed', 'complex', 'large', 'torrid', 'free', 'complete', 'classical', 'pure', 'different', 'ambitious', 'shocking', 'full', 'great', 'other', 'optimistic', 'pessimistic', 'equal', 'sad', 'grand', 'previous', 'joyous', 'boisterous', 'different', 'weak', 'willed', 'same', 'italian', 'capitalist', 'sicilian', 'proud', 'bright', 'solemn', 'aggressive', 'close', 'perilous', 'corleone', 'capo', 'own', 'own', 'confusing', 'pure', 'overwhelming', 'young', 'eventual', 'own', 'violent', 'welcome', 'astonishing', 'young', 'dark', 'top', 'little', 'difficult', 'uncompromising', 'surprised', 'many', 'flashy', 'popular', 'wrong', 'innovative', 'right', 'inspirational', 'chilling', 'penultimate', 'sonny', 'final', 'own'];0.1207467532467532

60;redryan64;"the sequel has long been a reliable staple of hollywood's yearly output. forgoing any pretense of following a path toward the neither artistic aspects nor continuity. the all important a$pect$ of continuing a story from one hit movie i$, wa$ and always$ will be that of box office and profit$; also known as the 'bottom line"". this is all understandable, for after all, making movies is a business. hence, we generally treated to a parade of inferior stories, watered down story lines and lame ideas that get to the screen only because of perceived relationship to a real, true hit. the roster of examples are loaded with the likes of: son of kong, french connection ii, mchale's navy joins the air force, rteurn to peyton place, back to the future ii, iii, iv etc., city slickers ii, analyze that, belles on their toes, house of dracula and all of those friday the 13th & halloween spin-offs. on an occasional a rarity occurs. a sequel picture comes along which is not only on par with the original, but in some cases actually tops the original. titles such as bride of frankenstein, for the love of benji and superman ii come to mind as prime examples. there are others out there; but for the sake of brevity, we'll hold down the roll call. arguably the greatest example of a sequel that surpasses its progenitor is francis ford coppola's production of mario puzo's the godfather: part ii; which just happens to be today's subject for dissection and analysis. perhaps the success of the original godfather paved the way for such an unexpected surprise and hit. critically and at the box office, godfather ii is considered to be an even greater achievement of film making. the reason probably lies in a maturity and coming of age by director coppola . in later interviews, as well in his commentary that is included on the latest dvd set, mr. coppola speaks of the interference and attempted control of his artistic view of the picture was an almost daily bone of contention; especially during the early days of production. there was a great deal of meddling from the 'suits' from the board room of paramount pictures; even extending to rumors that the big company wanted to replace the director. luckily for f.f.c. and the rest of us, he managed to survive long enough to get the picture over the hump and into the final editing room. the resulting product came out of the film editors' shop as quite a sensational film; being one that would go down as, arguably, the best gangster film of all time. surely it could not be eclipsed! this unprecedented and unexpected success earned francis ford coppola his spurs as a full fledged hollywood director. his name would from that point on be mentioned in the same breath as capra, ford, hitchcock, welles, huston, spielberg and scorsase. following such prestigious accolades, the director now enjoyed full artistic control over his projects. mr. coppola was able to pull out all stops and do the picture he wanted in his own way. from this point on, the office gang at paramount corporate headquarters could go and pound sand. the corporate monkey of the 'bottom line' was off his back, for good. such freedom allowed for the drafting of a fine, complex story not only to serve as a sequel, but at the same time it was functioning as a prequel; which is a term that wouldn't come into usage for some years yet. the mounting of having both the story of michael corleone's ascension to the heights of the underworld, as well as the wonderful and lengthy flashbacks into the early life of don vito corleone, was truly a work of genius. by using this dramatic device, the screen play, a collaboration done by both mr. puzo and mr. coppola gave us a chance to compare the life and times of two generations of the family and our nation as well. we do know that the working title of the project was announced as the godson and some considerable amount of surgery had to be performed on the screen play; for the character of frank pentangeli (michael v. gazzo) was a late addition to the starting line-up; as the story had peter clemenca (richard castellano) in the role of the discontented cappo of the corleone family. but mr. castellano proved to be unavailable; due to his insistence that his own writer would be the one to pen any and all of the character's dialogue. refusing to give in to such demands, coppola and puzo wrote the clemenca character out of the story; due to an unusual case of natural death; replacing him with this pentangelli guy, who had been previously unmentioned.* within a short time of its release, godfather ii was hailed as a critical acclaim magnet; as well as being touted for its keeping high standards established in the first godfather effort. and just for good measure, coppola and the boys at paramount had them a real good pitcher and hot item at the all important box office.

61;Dr_Coulardeau;times go on a-changing. the second generation, with a few flashbacks to the very origins of the corleone family, how the last male survivor of the family is smuggled out of sicily to the usa where he can start a new line, by changing his name circumstantially since it is a not too wise customs officer that gives him unknowingly a new family name, and without forgetting the vengeance he will have to achieve later rather than sooner for the killing of his father and brothers by the local don in his village in sicily. we see him establish his business in the 1920s by killing the local mafia boss in his neighborhood and taking over in a more humane and just way. but this is a flashback. we are interested in the next generation and what they can do in the 1950s. the takeover has already been dealt with in the first part. the appointed son for this takeover has already asserted his power over the five families that could challenge him in the previous film. now he tries to develop his business. drugs had been allowed but he remains rather distant from that trafficking. he develops his business in gambling, hotels, entertainment, in one word luxury industry or commerce. he tries to get into las vegas but is rebuffed by a local senator, so he forgets about it. then he tries to move into cuba and take over some business there but too late it is the arrival of castro. so he goes back to new york and nevada, back to his traditional activities. but these attempts enable coppola to show some new problematics that are coming up in the second half of the 20th century. first of all the strong sectarianism italians have to face from politicians who declare they support italian-americans as good patriots in front, and behind try to make them pay twice a service or to ostracize them out of their constituencies. at the same time they have to face congressional and judicial complications with hearings about their businesses and business practices that are accused of being too criminal to be accepted. in other words we are beyond the time of al capone and prohibition. and the world is also changing. cuba of course is a big change. but women are no longer what they used to be in this sicilian culture. women do not want to be simple ancillary appendices to men they do not see any more. this second generation godfather is confronted to the abortion of his third child and second son by his wife while he is in cuba witnessing castro's conquest of the island. then she tries to take his children away and eventually get a divorce. she will get nothing except a separation but not the children. he also has to fight against some remnants of the old world that are handicaps and obstacles to his projects, such as the fact that he is the head of the family business and yet he is not the eldest son : hence he has to face his elder brothers, and that has been going on for a long time. the world is changing his way this time and he has to fight against the survival of what the world used to be. at this point this trilogy is becoming a vast fresco about the history of italian-americans or should i say sicilian-americans ? when the fresco is too vast we can wonder if it does not lose some of its possible meaning by diluting it into too many elements, periods and events. but it is certainly interesting to follow this intricate family history that verges onto a sitcom at times. dr jacques coulardeau, university of paris dauphine & university of paris 1 pantheon sorbonne;9 January 2007;9;['second', 'few', 'very', 'corleone', 'last', 'male', 'new', 'wise', 'new', 'local', 'local', 'humane', 'just', 'interested', 'next', 'first', 'previous', 'distant', 'local', 'traditional', 'new', 'second', 'strong', 'italian', 'good', 'same', 'congressional', 'judicial', 'criminal', 'other', 'big', 'simple', 'ancillary', 'more', 'second', 'third', 'second', 'old', 'such', 'eld', 'elder', 'long', 'vast', 'italian', 'vast', 'possible', 'many', 'interesting', 'intricate'];0.0875189393939394

64;johnnyboyz;"the second godfather film kicks off in a similar fashion to the first; with a large and overwhelming gathering of friends and family on a sunny day within the confines of the corleone family grounds. the event is the holy communion for michael corleone's (pacino) son, and much like the wedding with which the first film began, it represents the beginning of a new venture; of a new tale, or of a new chapter in life or in the franchise that is the godfather films, a new addition to the lives of this collection of mafia based individuals whom are forever being deconstructed on screen. and what a tale the piece eventually branches out into, giving us the next chapter in the lives of those in the 'present' tense, as well as seamlessly incorporating an interesting mesh of the rising of one gangster twinned with his lust for revenge. this second strand is, of course, the tale of vito corleone (de niro); an italian immigrant of the andolini family based on scicily and his coming of age in early 20th century new york. the godfather part ii is an extremely assured film; a film that is mostly everything a crime film can be, complete with a patient and mature aesthetic which helps in the distinct placing of it in the annuals of contemporary american cinema. the film is split into two equilibriums, one occurring from the late 1950's onwards while predominantly focusing on michael and his family and friends, where as the other initially unfolds in the very early years of the 20th century before branching out into the 1920s. this segment sees vito marry; get involved in petty crime; come up against a local crime kingpin as well as have a son but always retain an eye on a certain larger goal which awaits him back in scicily. each of the two equilibriums offer very different studies of the human condition. the equilibrium in the 'present' tense takes on a certain amount of substance to do with honour and trust; as well as incorporating the notion of expansion and moving on, which ties in with the idea of modernity and branching out in an attempt to keep up with the times. these are ideas michael brings up in the first godfather film, mainly through fear of his family's safety that they need to 'go straight' but additionally because he feels real estate and so forth acts as a healthy means, money-wise, to sustain the family for the years to come. the other equilibrium sees a much more simplistic and routine chain of events; a tale of revenge and a certain degree of ruthlessness brought about within one man as this study of this character evolves him from an innocent and frightened child; to a young man who is very much observant of this new world he's in; to cold-blooded killer. the installation of vito's story here is simplistic but very well done in both a story telling and character driven sense. vito becomes aware of the notion of crime in new york and learns of the rules of hierarchy. he observes his initial, more local, nemeses in don fanucci (moschin) in a close to voyeuristic manner; not necessarily gazing at the individual but at what the individual is: feared but additionally respected. vito is not afraid of fanucci, but the study of vito's involvement in crime, which begins with the stealing of someone's rug and the temporary holding of a neighbour's illegal firearms, act as lures into a world within the historically proclaimed 'new world' he has already arrived in. you might view vito's tale as a tragedy, since it is vito's entry into this line of work that will propel him into the mindset of a criminal and, ultimately, it is this line of work that develops the attribute of a cold blooded killer which enables him to fulfil his goal of revenge. the passage of film looking at vito sees the film revisit one of vito's ideation from the first edition; the notion of always killing for business and that there is nothing personal behind 'hits' - it is strictly business. vito and his goal as a young man in new york exist before these rules are drawn up; vito's hatred of don ciccio for the death of his father during the prologue is not business, but very much personal. it might be this that makes vito's strand of the godfather part ii the better of the two, and it may well be the reason people have more of a reaction to this edition of the trilogy; in the sense it is a piece establishing ideals and ideation's; before having, what is arguably its strongest character, confront what we already know he believes in and threaten its integrity. michael's segment of the film covers broader, more personal issues such as life and family ties and marital relationships. it is about expanding an empire on the outside just as much as it is the narrowing down of an empire on the inside: finding out who is actually who and where they stand. there is one such brilliant scene in which michael and fredo (cazale) confront one another and they fall out of favour. it is an establishing of power as michael, standing, towers over fredo who up to this point has become more and more of a loose cannon. michael's segment of the godfather part ii isn't so much about the mafia or crime as much as it is the human condition; it uses said setting as a means to explore these conditions within a criminal world, as death and increased pressure to make moves dominate person's lives. its dedicated and calm approach to psychologically chaotic and unnerving subject matter allows the film to retain a certain juxtaposed sense of dread throughout. perhaps undoubtedly, the godfather part ii will remain a somewhat timeless study of emotion, angst and so much more.";28 June 2009;8;['second', 'similar', 'first', 'large', 'overwhelming', 'sunny', 'corleone', 'holy', 'first', 'new', 'new', 'new', 'new', 'next', 'present', 'tense', 'interesting', 'second', 'italian', 'early', 'assured', 'complete', 'mature', 'distinct', 'contemporary', 'american', 'late', 'other', 'early', 'petty', 'local', 'certain', 'large', 'different', 'human', 'present', 'tense', 'certain', 'first', 'real', 'healthy', 'other', 'simplistic', 'routine', 'certain', 'innocent', 'frightened', 'young', 'observant', 'new', 'cold', 'blooded', 'simplistic', 'aware', 'initial', 'local', 'voyeuristic', 'afraid', 'temporary', 'illegal', 'new', 'cold', 'blooded', 'first', 'personal', 'young', 'personal', 'well', 'more', 'strong', 'broad', 'more', 'personal', 'such', 'marital', 'such', 'brilliant', 'more', 'loose', 'much', 'human', 'criminal', 'dedicated', 'calm', 'chaotic', 'unnerving', 'certain', 'juxtaposed', 'timeless', 'more'];0.0778667588450197

66;TheMovieDiorama;with many claiming it to be better than its predecessor. racking up a runtime of 200 minutes, this behemoth is the longest theatrical film i've seen. for those of you who read my review on part 1 would know that my only gripe was with pacing issues, particularly in its third act which dipped completely to a point where i became uninterested. with no marlon brando and a far superior runtime, does part 2 better its predecessor? drum roll please...the godfather part 2...is...the better chapter in this saga. yes, everything that made the first so well acclaimed still exists here but with a much more detailed end result. the pacing was perfect. there was always something happening whether it be the corleone family members just interacting with each other over family and business, or when the don himself michael conceptualises a thorough and genius plan to get him out of trouble. then, in addition, coppola brings in robert de niro to portray a young vito corleone depicting his rise to power in the mafia culture. this is interwoven brilliantly with the current story involving michael, the two plots bounce off each other and further the rich developed characters that coppola originally put on screen. the plenty of backstabbing as traitors lust for power and control makes for some tense and gripping moments in a bloated film. many more exotic locations to spice up the cinematography, from sunny havana to vintage corleone. i appreciated the inclusion of the italian language, coppola could've forced the scenes to be spoken in english and yet he didn't in order to keep the authenticity of these characters. everything i mentioned in part 1 still remains. coppola's direction is flawless, acting is masterful (particularly pacino and de niro), complex family narrative that left me compelled in every scene...i mean i could go on but there is no need to. the vast majority of reviews state everything that i'm describing here, which is why this is regarded as one of cinema's greatest films of all time.;25 February 2018;10;['many', 'well', 'long', 'theatrical', 'only', 'third', 'uninterested', 'superior', 'well', 'well', 'first', 'detailed', 'perfect', 'corleone', 'other', 'thorough', 'young', 'current', 'other', 'rich', 'tense', 'bloated', 'many', 'exotic', 'sunny', 'italian', 'flawless', 'masterful', 'complex', 'vast', 'great'];0.2692028985507246
67;insomniac_rod;"this movie can be watched as two different movies that connect masterfully when the actual events are about to reach a climax. ""the godfather"" plot gets more into the political aspects rather than on mafia wars or vendettas and that brings in consequence more dramatic situations inside the family. thus the film has a darker, more tense tone. it focuses more on the personal consequences provoked by the family's criminal empire in the us and in cuba. michael's character is explored and taken to a new darker level. we understand that his personal life is falling to pieces as his wife provoked an abortion and plans to leave him, while, at the same time, he faces a betrayal from his older brother and the burdens of his sister's life. michael, unlike vito, is more cold hearted but marvelous when playing his cards. vito made sure to establish his criminal empire before others could consider him as an enemy and with his guts, he decides to take down the mafia leader in the zone, don fanucci. later, vito starts a huge oil business and executes a long time vendetta. that was vito corleone, a brilliant negotiator, persuasion leader, calmed down, and smart italian-american who started from zero and thanks to his family's support, loyal associates, and leadership; soon started his own empire. when both character's reach a similar climatic situation; it's up to michael to learn through his mother how his father would act in order to keep his family safe or how to deal with a certain problem. after plenty of intermissions that show us vito's start in mafia; we construct in our mind a parallel story that will give us the ""weapons"" to know how michael is gonna act. vito, in his younger years, demonstrated to be very protective of his family and members of his ""other family"". he didn't have to face betrayal or similar situations when he started to build the empire; unlike michael who is in a very complex situation that not only deals with politics. the trial that the corleones face is absolutely brilliant on the political side because michael moves his cards in such a class act manner that witnesses who have the chance to take the business down suddenly regret on their accusations. michael is now a brilliant politician who has controls the strings of senators, judges, mafia bosses, etc. his the most powerful criminal in the country. this makes michael a true menacing leader with such power that he is feared, respected by everyone, including his close family. so the movie focuses primarly on michael and hyman roth, making vito in his young years a supporting character along with clemenza and tessio. the supporting characters from the actual events include favorites such as al neri (although he was in part 1), rocco, fredo once again, willi cicci, frank, connie, and mother corleone. tom hagen deserves a special spot for being the equilibrium of the family on the most difficult situations. he's just a splendid sidekick and opposite at the same time for michael. special mention for michael's extremely creepy and lethal capo-bodyguard who provided some of the most suspenseful scenes in cinema history just by making presence. he must be a role model for the giallo sub-genre. the atmosphere in the movie is absolutely amazing, beautiful. the funeral scene is sad and intense, while the cuban new year's eve party is glamorous, colorful, and nerve tensing. i enjoyed big time the carnival in vito's younger years. the movie is excellent, just excellent. it's a mix of classic score executed by orchestras, mixed with creepy piano elements, and classical/popular italian melodies. the acting is just wonderful. al pacino delivers the acting display of his career. michael corleone is a brilliant man, with an admirable temper, excellent knowledge of politics and human behavior. al pacino demonstrates he can act in every single possible situation. robert de niro's performance is highly regarded because of his masterful display of marlon brando's behavior translated translated through the vito corleone character. the movie focuses on both actor's characters and that's why you just explore them at full. the acting by robert duvall is a glory. the rest of the cast is just wonderful and deserve to be congratulated but let's face it; this is all about pacino and deniro. to be honest, myself as a die-hard horror cinema expert, i can say this sequel is amongst the most tense, suspenseful and stressing but pleasant viewing experiences i've ever experienced. there's plenty of tension, high-quality action sequences (my favorites include michael's murder attempt which is later spectacular when his gunmen search for the assassin's; frank's murder attempt when cicci gets injured; the cuban citizens rebellion, and the climax when frank commits suicide, roth gets killed, fredo pays for his betrayal, etc.). i loved the final sequence when the flashback takes place and michael is left alone, drinking tea or wine i can't remember... he just thinks and plans his future in that moment. it's a brilliant scene. please watch this movie because it's a lesson of life through tense situations that happen in real life, for some. ford coppola's delicate, classy direction makes this a great visual experience in all the sense of the word; he creates a whole new world in which we are invited without having to be worried. now, when a movie is part of your life you can say it's more than a great experience.";9 August 2009;10;['different', 'actual', 'about', 'more', 'political', 'dramatic', 'dark', 'tense', 'personal', 'criminal', 'new', 'dark', 'personal', 'same', 'old', 'cold', 'hearted', 'marvelous', 'sure', 'criminal', 'huge', 'long', 'corleone', 'brilliant', 'smart', 'italian', 'loyal', 'own', 'similar', 'climatic', 'safe', 'certain', 'parallel', 'young', 'protective', 'other', 'similar', 'complex', 'brilliant', 'political', 'brilliant', 'powerful', 'true', 'menacing', 'such', 'close', 'young', 'actual', 'such', 'special', 'difficult', 'splendid', 'opposite', 'same', 'special', 'creepy', 'lethal', 'suspenseful', 'amazing', 'beautiful', 'funeral', 'sad', 'intense', 'cuban', 'new', 'glamorous', 'colorful', 'big', 'young', 'excellent', 'excellent', 'classic', 'creepy', 'classical', 'popular', 'italian', 'wonderful', 'brilliant', 'admirable', 'excellent', 'human', 'single', 'possible', 'masterful', 'corleone', 'full', 'wonderful', 'honest', 'die', 'hard', 'tense', 'suspenseful', 'pleasant', 'high', 'spectacular', 'cuban', 'frank', 'final', 'brilliant', 'tense', 'real', 'delicate', 'classy', 'great', 'visual', 'whole', 'new', 'worried', 'more', 'great'];0.1925503886794208
68;Movie_Muse_Reviews;"the most brilliant thing about ""the godfather: part ii"" is that oscar-winning director francis ford coppola has seamlessly extended the original, and when i say seamless, i mean that coppola has created a sequel that looks and feels like the original and actually makes the first film better. if i could, i would go back and change my rating of ""the godfather"" to an 11 and make this a 10. with the exception of the lord of the rings films (and even that series didn't win two best pictures), no sequel can say that it strengthens the original film and that's why ""part ii"" is so good. at an epic 200 minutes long yet rarely boring, ""part ii"" tells not only the story of don michael corleone (pacino) as he takes over the family, but simultaneously tells the background of don vito corleone (deniro) who was played by brando in the original. to the modern viewer, deniro feels like a gimmick, but this was his first prestigious role and he is quite convincing as a younger version of brando's performance. leading man pacino is incredibly commanding yet again as michael as this time we see the weight of being don grow heavier and heavier on his shoulders. as usual, it's too difficult to explain the ""business"" plot of the film, which has plenty of double-crossings and twists that the pervasive feeling of paranoia that is so ingrained in the original continues quite masterfully in this film. the acting talent is across the board so good that you have to give casting team and coppola some of that credit. this film had three best supporting actor nominees at the oscar's for goodness sake. if the golden globes that year had the best ensemble category, this film would have won it hands down. my personal favorite is robert duvall as tom hagen. i would trust him with my life too. everything about this film is so well done (especially the set design for new york, italy, cuba, etc) that it's hard to notice sometimes because you're so drawn in to the plot and following it. coppola makes you think something tragic can happen at any second and when it does, it always delivers. the ending sequence is something that directors have stolen left and right when trying to make their ending just as powerful. while ""the godfather"" has more memorable scenes and dialogue, this film is a masterpiece in its own right despite not having as much glitz as the original. of course, in terms of themes, ""the godfather: part ii"" continues to address the original's themes in new and meaningful ways. the themes of what family truly is and means get expanded upon and become so complex as seen through michael's relationship with his wife and brother fredo. the back-in-time plot arch with vito sheds additional light on the ""michael"" part of the film as well. all of it just makes ""part ii"" a rock-solid classic.";22 June 2008;10;['brilliant', 'original', 'original', 'first', 'good', 'original', 'good', 'epic', 'boring', 'original', 'modern', 'first', 'prestigious', 'convincing', 'young', 'don', 'heavy', 'heavy', 'usual', 'difficult', 'double', 'pervasive', 'ingrained', 'original', 'good', 'good', 'golden', 'good', 'ensemble', 'personal', 'hard', 'tragic', 'second', 'right', 'powerful', 'memorable', 'own', 'much', 'original', 'original', 'new', 'meaningful', 'complex', 'additional', 'solid'];0.1988266119845066

72;Vartiainen;the original godfather was more about vito corleone (marlon brando) than it was about michael (al pacino), his son. michael was the other main character certainly, but it was vito's movie all around. in this sequel the roles are switched and while it's still about vito, specifically about his youth, it's much more about michael and his struggle with power, responsibility, pride and greed. the movie dances between two timelines, following both young vito corleone (robert de niro), and michael as the new head of the corleone family. the roles are also switched in that in the original film we followed the fall of an aging crime boss and the rise of a cunning mind in vito and michael, respectively. this time it's vito that's rising to become the most feared and respected man in new york, whereas michael is the one to suffer and watch as his life is torn down all around him. superb storytelling from francis ford coppola, and the main reason why this is such a beloved movie. in lesser hands all these separate strings, characters and plot points would have become a convoluted mess, but in coppola's hands they weave a tapestry of corruption, personal glory and ruthless ambition. and while it is a requirement to have seen the original film, it in no way takes away from the saga. in truth these films should be regarded as one long experience. the secondary reason why these films work so well are of course the actors. al pacino once again gives us the performance of a century. he has moved from young man plagued by naivety, responsibility and obligation to a man burdened by expectations beyond any reason, inner struggles of family and endless ambition to prove himself worthy of his father's legacy. robert de niro as young vito proves himself pacino's equal. in him we get a character that's eerily similar to young michael in intelligence, charisma and willingness to do what's necessary, but unlike his eventual son, this man isn't burdened by the expectations of larger society. he isn't an unreasonable man, but neither does he expect anything to be given to him if he isn't willing to take it by himself. fantastic roles, both of them. the only flaw i can name in this film in comparison to the original is the multitude of plot point and story lines. i mentioned that in coppola's hands they are not the disaster they would otherwise be, but that doesn't mean that the original movie isn't a purer, more streamlined experience. though only in comparison. this film is still a masterpiece by any standards.;11 July 2017;9;['original', 'more', 'other', 'main', 'more', 'young', 'new', 'corleone', 'original', 'cunning', 'feared', 'respected', 'main', 'beloved', 'less', 'separate', 'convoluted', 'personal', 'ruthless', 'original', 'long', 'secondary', 'young', 'inner', 'endless', 'worthy', 'young', 'equal', 'similar', 'young', 'necessary', 'eventual', 'large', 'unreasonable', 'willing', 'fantastic', 'only', 'original', 'more', 'streamlined'];0.1250202922077922
73;jzappa;"nino rota's musical score plays an even greater role in this equal but different successor than it did in the predecessor. yearning, lamenting, stimulating bygone ages, see how infectiously nino rota's music affects our sentiments for the savage events on screen. it is the pulse of the films. one cannot imagine them without their nino rota music. against all our realistic deduction, it guides us to how to feel about the films, and condition us to understand the characters within their own world. throughout the corleone family's many criminal actions, we understand that one doesn't have to be a monster in order to live with having done them. in what is both a dual expansion of its predecessor and a masterpiece of juxtaposition in itself, we see michael corleone forfeit his remaining shreds of morality and become an empty shell, insecure and merciless. as his father quietly knew in his latter days would be so, michael has lost sight of those values that made don corleone better than he had to be and has become a new godfather every bit as evil as he has to be. the score, with its tonal harmony, its honeyed and emotional aesthetics, is sad, and music can often evoke emotion more surely and subtly than story. consider several operas with ridiculous stories and lyrics yet contain arias that literally move us to tears. the devolution of michael corleone is adjacent with flashbacks to the youth and young manhood of his father, vito, played with paternal, home-loving subtlety by robert de niro. these scenes, in sicily and old new york at the turn of the century, follow the conventional pattern of a young man on the rise and show the mafia code being burned into the corleone blood. no false romanticism conceals the necessity of murder to do business. we don't look at vito as a victim of his environment, but a product of the depiction of the resorts to which the italian culture had turned, initially to both protect their homeland and protect their livelihood as immigrants who came to america to be paid less than the blacks. the film opens in 1901 corleone, sicily, at the funeral procession for young vito's father, who had been killed by the local mafia chieftain, don ciccio, over an insult. during the procession, vito's older brother is also murdered because he swore to avenge his father. vito's mother goes to ciccio to beg for the life of young vito. when he refuses, she sacrifices herself to allow vito to escape. they scour the town for him, warning the sleeping townsfolk against harboring the boy. with the aid of a few of the townspeople, vito finds his way by ship to ellis island, where an immigration agent, mishearing vito's hometown of corleone as his name, registers him as vito corleone. from this very opening, and the events that gradually follow, we see that vito's damnable early experiences have enhanced his sense of family, and his experience of revenge as a necessity was passed on to vito's sons. the life of young vito helps to explain the forming of the adult don corleone. as his unplanned successor michael, his youngest child, transforms, we hark back to why, when his true desire is to make the corleone family completely legitimate, he feels that he must play the game by its old rules. his wife says, ""you once told me: 'in five years, the corleone family will be completely legitimate.' that was seven years ago."" what we have are two all-too-real narratives, two superb lead performances and lasting images. there is even a parallel between two elderly dons: revenge must be had. i admire the way coppola and puzo require us to think along with michael as he feels out fragile deliberations involving miami boss hyman roth, his older brother fredo, and the death of sonny in the previous film. who is against him? why? michael drifts several explanations past several key players, misleading them all, or nearly. it's like a game of blindfolded chess. he has to envision the moves without seeing them. coppola shows michael breaking under the burden. we recall that he was a war hero, a successful college student, forging an honest life. ultimately michael has no one by whom to swear but his aging mother. michael's desolation in that scene of dialogue informs the film's closing shot. so this six-time oscar-winning three-and-a-half-hour gangster epic is ultimately a dreary experience, a mourning for what could've been. it is a contrast with the earlier film, in which don corleone is seen defending old values against modern hungers. young vito was a murderer, too, as we more fully understand in the sicily and new york scenes of part ii. but he was wise and diplomatic. murder was personal. as hyman roth says, ""it had nothing to do with business."" the crucial difference between the father and son is that vito is cognizant of and comprehending the needs, feelings, problems, and views of others, and michael grows in the very opposite direction. whereas the first movie was a taut ensemble piece, this second part is a more leisurely film that closely studies only these two characters, neither of whom share scenes with each other. everyone else is periphery. it must be seen as a piece with the consummate mastership of the godfather. when the characters in a film truly take on a simulated environmental existence for us, it becomes a film that everyone who cherishes movies to any extent should see at least once.";22 February 2009;10;['musical', 'great', 'equal', 'different', 'bygone', 'savage', 'nino', 'realistic', 'own', 'corleone', 'many', 'criminal', 'dual', 'empty', 'latter', 'new', 'evil', 'tonal', 'honeyed', 'emotional', 'sad', 'several', 'ridiculous', 'adjacent', 'young', 'paternal', 'sicily', 'old', 'conventional', 'young', 'corleone', 'false', 'italian', 'less', 'young', 'local', 'old', 'young', 'few', 'very', 'damnable', 'early', 'young', 'unplanned', 'young', 'true', 'corleone', 'legitimate', 'old', 'corleone', 'legitimate', 'real', 'lasting', 'elderly', 'fragile', 'old', 'previous', 'several', 'several', 'key', 'successful', 'honest', 'half', 'dreary', 'early', 'old', 'modern', 'young', 'sicily', 'wise', 'diplomatic', 'personal', 'crucial', 'cognizant', 'opposite', 'first', 'taut', 'ensemble', 'second', 'leisurely', 'other', 'simulated', 'environmental', 'least'];0.0473542826221397
74;freemantle_uk;sequels to oscar winning films normally don't type out to be that good and end up being flops. luckily the godfather: part ii is just as good as the original. it is a bold mix of a sequel and a prequel, showing michael corleane's decline in character as he leads the corleane crime family in the late 1950s/early 1960s, and showing vito from a poor orphan silian boy in 1901 and rises up the ranks of the mafia from 1917 onwards. michael corleane had been running the family for around five years and moved them to nevanda. things seem to be going well, he has political influence and is gaining money from legitimate means. but they are turning times ahead, having to deal with a conflict with a jewish gangster, hyman roth, a traitor within his ranks, the fbi and a senate committee investigation. he is suffering family problems (both crime and personal) and is around during the cuban revolution. vito starts the film as a 9-year-old boy and all the male members of his family have been murdered by don cirrio, a powerful local mafia chief in silicy. he see his mother beg for mercy before getting killed by cirrio's men and flees to new york. in 1917 the italian neighbourhood he lives was run by local gangster, don fanucci. he gets tired of his iron fist rule and ends up murdering the man and taking his position. with that he becomes respected in the italian community and a leading gangster and then looks for revenge for his family. this a complex, well plotted film, with many aspects of mafia life being looked at from a board time-period. it is well written, brilliantly directed, francis ford coppala at his best, and some great acting. it also has some good quotes which i think are some of the best in the series, like the 'i know it was you' bit and 'you are not a friend and your are not a brother'. the godfather part ii is a great example of a gangster film and i believe that it approach of a sequel/prequel influenced other films like infernal affairs part ii and iii. this was a very worthy oscar winning film and i think that this film is just as good as the first. i don't know how it compares to part iii because i haven't watched it, but i haven't heard good think about it.;7 July 2008;10;['good', 'good', 'original', 'bold', 'prequel', 'late', 'early', 'poor', 'silian', 'political', 'legitimate', 'jewish', 'personal', 'old', 'male', 'powerful', 'local', 'italian', 'local', 'tired', 'italian', 'complex', 'many', 'good', 'great', 'good', 'good', 'great', 'sequel', 'other', 'infernal', 'worthy', 'oscar', 'good', 'first', 'good'];0.2422222222222222

76;PWNYCNY;"this movie is about a struggle for power between two men: the pretentious upstart michael corleone, who is trying to establish his legitimacy as godfather, and hyman roth, the most powerful crime figure on the planet, whom michael both hates and wants to emulate. the movie also shows michael's depravity and hypocrisy. while committing the most vicious acts in the name of the family, he is actually systematically targeting for destruction every one closet to him. michael is nothing but a phony. he reveres his father, vito, who is his role model, but he can never be another vito. vito was respected and loved, while michael is feared and loathed. vito attracted people, inspired confidence, was acknowledged a leader, while michael repels people away. everyone close to michael is driven away or killed: tom, freddie, kay, pentangeli. they are on to michael and michael knows it, so he must have them eliminated. the character of michael corleone is one of the most chilling characters in cinema history. michael is cruel and depraved, yet tries to pass himself off as decent and moral. but that is a front which masks his greediness and deceit. everything he touches he destroys. michael is so nasty and mean that he even fights hyman roth, the one man who has real affection for michael. but even that is not enough for michael. for michael, being a predator, roth's good will is a sign of weakness to be exploited. the depth of michael's depravity is bottomless. and in the end, the man for whom family meant everything, has no one. he has either murdered or driven away everyone. he is alone. when this movie was first released oh those so many years ago, i liked it. recently i watched the movie again. this time, the movie wasn't that good. my main objections to the movie are: the repeated use of flashbacks and the character of michael. regarding the flashbacks, they ruined the continuity of the movie. is this movie about michael or is it about the first godfather? second, the character michael is so overblown and two-dimensional that not even al pacino's excellent performance could totally save it. it seemed that what michael needed was a therapist to help him work through his misplaced aggression. michael feels the need to defend his family but defend them against what? moreover, michael is married, is the father of two children, is educated and thoroughly middle-class. this profile does not suggest someone who is likely to be directing an organized crime syndicate. sorry, it just doesn't wash. and when michael has his older brother murdered, even though his brother is mentally challenged, that defies all logic, even for michael for whom the family comes first. if this movie is supposed to be a dramatic study of a deeply confused man who harbors paranoid delusions of persecution mixed with a big dose of grandiosity, then this movie is interesting. however, if this movie is trying to suggest that an intelligent, college-educated, married family man, who has the option to go ""legit"", would be interested in pursuing a career in organized crime, then this is stretching literary license a bit far. why not have michael run for political office instead? now that could make for an interesting and credible movie.";27 November 2005;10;['pretentious', 'powerful', 'vicious', 'close', 'chilling', 'cruel', 'decent', 'moral', 'nasty', 'real', 'enough', 'good', 'bottomless', 'many', 'good', 'main', 'first', 'overblown', 'dimensional', 'excellent', 'misplaced', 'middle', 'likely', 'old', 'dramatic', 'confused', 'paranoid', 'big', 'interesting', 'intelligent', 'married', 'legit', 'interested', 'literary', 'political', 'interesting', 'credible'];0.0616666666666666

78;ackstasis;"to call 'the godfather: part ii (1974)' a sequel doesn't quite do it justice. it is more of a companion piece to the original film, serving as both a prequel and a sequel, both expanding and enriching the characters and story presented in 'the godfather (1972).' this week i was fortunate enough to attend a cinema screening of the second film {each instalment of the trilogy played over three consecutive weeks}, and needless to say it was well worth the late night. when we last left michael corleone (al pacino), he'd just been ""baptised"" into the world of organised crime. now, years on, he must accept that his position of corrupt power can only lead to the disintegration of his family, and the loss of everybody he's ever cared about. michael's plateau of despair, following the impressive rise we witnessed in 'the godfather,' is here juxtaposed with the historical ascent of his father vito corleone (now played by robert de niro) from a humble but traumatic childhood in corleone, sicily. the comparison delicately suggests the downside of the so-called ""american dream"" in which vito believes so passionately. as with 'the godfather,' coppola's film could only have succeeded with interesting and authentic acting performances, and the cast doesn't disappoint. al pacino has rarely been better, playing michael corleone with a violent intensity that suggests the lasting influence of brother sonny (james cann), who was assassinated in the previous film. pacino's scene with diane keaton, in which we learn that she received an abortion for her unborn son, is one of the most traumatic moments of spousal interaction i've ever seen, with pacino exhibiting a barely-suppressed rage through his severe, almost fearful, eyes, and a quiver in the jaw. an under-appreciated john cazale brings depth and pathos to weaker brother fredo, and robert duvall is excellent as tom hagen. new to the 'godfather' cast are lee strasberg (president of the actors studio) and michael v. gazzo, as business associates who may be plotting against the corleone family. de niro won an oscar for his portrayal of a younger don vito, understatedly evoking the essence of the character without parodying marlon brando. 'the godfather: part ii' is certainly an impressive achievement, but it doesn't quite manage to equal its predecessor. whereas the original film achieved the bulk of its emotional power through the transformation of its central character, 'part ii' leaves michael hopelessly stranded in his despair, portraying neither his rise nor his downfall. having effectively sold his soul for the family in the previous film, michael must now come to terms with his desolation, alone in his misery, and having long forsaken any opportunity for salvation. he concludes the film still at the height of organised crime in america, and yet receives no reassurance from his position of power. michael is alone, a dejected and self-loathing soul, without comfort from the family he helped destroy. it's a haunting ending that will remain with you for hours afterwards, but nevertheless doesn't seem like a conclusive ending to the entire corleone saga. fortunately, coppola returned sixteen years later to direct 'the godfather: part iii (1990),' which charts, i believe, michael corleone's inevitable downfall. hopefully i won't be disappointed.";12 March 2009;9;['more', 'original', 'prequel', 'fortunate', 'second', 'consecutive', 'needless', 'worth', 'late', 'organised', 'corrupt', 'impressive', 'historical', 'humble', 'traumatic', 'american', 'interesting', 'authentic', 'well', 'violent', 'previous', 'unborn', 'traumatic', 'severe', 'fearful', 'weak', 'excellent', 'new', 'corleone', 'young', 'impressive', 'original', 'emotional', 'central', 'previous', 'alone', 'organised', 'dejected', 'conclusive', 'entire', 'corleone', 'inevitable'];0.0813582251082251

85;MaxBorg89;"after the huge success of the godfather, francis ford coppola and mario puzo go on with narrating the history of the corleone family. it picks up right where we left it: michael corleone (al pacino) has replaced his deceased father as head of the family, becoming one of the most powerful criminals in america. soon enough, however, he will realize absolute power also means absolute solitude. apart from his henchmen and his lawyer (robert duvall) he can't trust anyone (""keeps your friends close, but your enemies closer""), including his own brother fredo (john cazale). hell, even his wife (diane keaton) doesn't feel safe next to him anymore. as we witness michael's dealings with power, corruption and murder, we're also given the chance to see what gave birth to the corleone dynasty in the first place. we learn, through flashbacks, that a boy named vito andolini had to escape from his native sicily when his father was brutally assassinated. once at ellis island, his home-town was mistaken for his surname. from that day on, he would be known as vito corleone. yes, it's the same vito corleone who made ""offers you can't refuse"" in the first movie, and this time we're shown how he slowly became a feared gangster in his younger years. it's a riveting look at yesterday's society, which doesn't differ that much from ours: power is still as easy to obtain as it is to lose forever, and no matter how sophisticated man's methods can get, violence is still the ""best"" way to achieve something under specific circumstances. just like part i, this impeccable, superior sequel is masterfully staged by the filmmakers, their passion for the material breaking out of every single frame. the screenplay is flawless, coppola and puzo seamlessly moving back and forth in time to show us the origin and fate of the most beloved cinematic family that's ever shown up on a screen.the family theme emerges off-screen as well, as the director's father, carmine coppola, helps nino rota with the superb, tragic score. but let's not forget the extraordinary actors who made each member of the corleones memorable: pacino steals the show with his best performance alongside scarface's tony montana, while duvall, cazale and talia shire (not to mention james caan in a priceless flashback cameo) display the same charisma they had in the previous installment. yet there's one guy who tops all of them, the only one i haven't mentioned so far: robert de niro, who won his first oscar for playing the young vito corleone. it's one of those rare times people don't complain about the fact that a thespian was replaced in a sequel (okay, so marlon brando wouldn't have looked young enough for the part, but otherwise he would have been perfect): de niro's star-making turn has the power of not making you miss the older don for the entire movie. it's a top notch performance based on gestures and looks rather than words (but then again, he only speaks sicilian throughout the film), which would become de niro's trademark and which he proved to master perfectly long before travis bickle, jake la motta and jimmy conway made their appearance. before the godfather: part ii was released, all sequels were considered b-movies. i can see why opinions changed after this film: watch it back-to-back with its predecessor and you'll feel rewarded for giving that awesome twosome part of your time.";15 March 2006;10;['huge', 'corleone', 'deceased', 'powerful', 'absolute', 'absolute', 'close', 'own', 'safe', 'corleone', 'first', 'native', 'same', 'first', 'young', 'riveting', 'easy', 'sophisticated', 'good', 'specific', 'impeccable', 'superior', 'single', 'flawless', 'beloved', 'cinematic', 'tragic', 'extraordinary', 'memorable', 'good', 'tony', 'talia', 'priceless', 'same', 'previous', 'only', 'first', 'young', 'rare', 'young', 'perfect', 'old', 'entire', 'top', 'awesome', 'twosome'];0.3415413533834586

87;estebangonzalez10;keep your friends close, but your enemies closer. coppola's (or should i say puzo's) the godfather part ii is considered by many as the best sequel of all time, and some even consider it to be better than the original. in my opinion it is not as good as the first part, but there is no denying this is a great film nonetheless. coppola did a great job with the direction once again, and has created a timeless film that movie fans go back to time after time. there are several things he did well with this film. first of all he took a completely different approach towards romanticizing the corleone's. in the first film we were attracted to vito for his strong family beliefs and loyalty to his friends, in this film we see how michael completely begins to lose control of his family and friends. michael, who i admired in the first film, has become so blind in his lust for power that he losses the strong values his father had taught him. he has grown cold, distant, and even goes as far as to hitting his wife (something vito would never have dreamed of doing). the parallel story of young vito and how he became a don also works really well as it is told in flashbacks during michael's present reign as don. this story serves as a reminder of how distant michael has become from what his father wanted of him. part ii is more of a nostalgic movie as we see the decline in the once strong and united corleone family, and nino rota's score is a perfect example of that. the final scenes of the film only confirm this sentiment. the performance from the cast is as equally as brilliant as it was from the first, and gordon willis's cinematography is also equally impressive with its dark scenes that help set the mood of the film. the godfather part ii continues where the first one left off with michael (al pacino) as head of the corleone family and tom hagen (robert duvall) as his personal adviser and lawyer. they are living in nevada now and running the gambling business in that state during the late 50's. while we follow the present storyline, coppola introduces a series of flashbacks beginning all the way back in 1901 following the early life of vito (oreste baldini) in sicily. vito's father, brother, and mother (in that specific order) have been killed by don ciccio (giuseppe sillato), but vito is able to escape to new york. the film later jumps forward to 1917 where vito (robert de niro) is making a living working as a clerk for a small store in new york. the movie jumps back and forth between both stories. on the one hand you have michael trying to expand his empire traveling to miami and cuba, meeting with hyman roth (lee strasberg), a successful jewish businessman, who michael isn't sure he can trust. on the meantime he has problems back home with his wife kay (diane keaton), problems with nevada senator pat geary (g. d. spradlin), and problems in new york with frankie pentangeli (michael v. gazzo), clemenza's replacement and friend of the family. after an attack on his life michael isn't sure who is after him (or maybe he is and we don't know it). on the other hand, the other story continues to follow young vito as he meets clemenza (bruno kirby) and tessio (john aprea) and begins his imminent rise to becoming the don. marlon brando was a huge part of the success of the first film, but coppola, along with puzo, did a great job introducing new characters to the story that contributed to the success of the sequel. michael v. gazzo as frankie and lee strasberg as roth were great in this film and gave it a fresh new look. another contributing factor was the addition of the flashbacks because robert de niro was the right man to play young vito. his oscar winning performance was outstanding and he just stood out in every scene he was in. al pacino continued with his transformation in the first film, and now he portrayed a much darker and colder michael. he didn't have to say anything and we already knew what he was feeling. there are several memorable scenes in which he speaks louder with his facial expressions than he does with his words. the opening scene in nevada where the family is reunited celebrating michael's son's first communion is reminiscent of connie's wedding scene in the first godfather, and the same thing can be said of several other scenes as the final one. the sequel serves as a nostalgic memory of what the corleone's once were (or at least what coppola wanted us to think of them in the first romantic movie), it is much darker, but it still works and compliments the first part really well. the godfather part ii is not better than the original, but it is still a masterpiece. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/;22 September 2010;10;['close', 'many', 'good', 'well',

90;barnabyrudge;"the godfather: part ii has the rare distinction of being a sequel that is equal to, possibly even greater than, its predecessor. indeed, it is one of the finest films ever made, a gangster picture that manages to be epic in scope as well as length, showcasing a number of brilliant performances and proving that, for all the fancy special effects in the world, nothing beats a truly compelling story. the only thing to bear in mind is that the godfather: part ii relies heavily on a knowledge of the previous film it is not one of those follow-ups that can be watched out of sequence with any hope of grasping what is going on. 'sequel' might be the wrong word actually, as the film is divided into two sections, one continuing the story of the corleone crime family from where it left off at the end of part i, the other acting as a turn-of- the-century prequel, showing the rise of vito corleone from orphaned sicilian immigrant to powerful mob boss. in effect, the godfather: part ii is therefore a continuation of, and prequel to, the existing narrative dealt with in the original. following the death of his father and older brother, michael corleone (al pacino) is the new head of his family's empire, based now in nevada having moved out of new york several years earlier. running the 'business' is taking its toll on the once-honest michael his relationship with wife kay (diane keaton) is frosty and distant; his brother fredo (john cazale) is becoming more of a burden than ever; he must deal with rumblings of discontent from new york; and his pledge to legitimise the corleone family is further than ever from becoming a reality. following an unsuccessful assassination attempt, michael puts consigliere tom hagen (robert duvall) in charge of the family for a while, while he goes away to deal with some business matters and investigate who tried to have him killed. his adventures bring him into contact with jewish gangster hyman roth (lee strasberg), who may be michael's ally or enemy. the story traces michael's long descent into isolation and paranoia, alienating himself from everyone in his all- consuming quest to come out on top in this epic gangland-battle-of-wits. interwoven into the story are a number of flashbacks showing the rise of vito corleone (marlon brando's character from part i, here portrayed by robert de niro). after arriving in new york a poor immigrant, vito eventually finds honest work in a grocery store but is hounded out of his job by local gangster don fanucci (gastone moschin). making ends meet through petty burglaries, he gradually rises up the criminal ranks, killing fanucci and eventually becoming a feared and respected figure in the neighbourhood. whereas the godfather was criticised for glamorising violent crime and the mafia, the godfather: part ii shows things in a much uglier light. families are torn apart by jealousy and betrayal; relationships are destroyed by the lack of communication; innocence is tarnished irrevocably. in short, the world seems somehow more rotten and corrupt in the godfather: part ii. it's an altogether more ruthless film, harder-edged, shockingly authentic even. the performances are exemplary throughout. how pacino didn't win the best actor oscar of the year is beyond comprehension, creating as he does this incredible character whose grip on his empire comes at a terrible price. de niro is excellent as the young vito corleone; keaton fabulous as michael's neglected wife; duvall convincing as ever as the family lawyer; and strasberg mesmerising as the slippery hyman roth, one of the truly great characters of gangster cinema. if it seems like in this review i have done nothing but shower superlatives upon this film, that's because i have. the godfather: part ii is, quite simply, one of the greatest movies of all- time.";9 April 2014;10;['rare', 'equal', 'great', 'fine', 'epic', 'brilliant', 'fancy', 'special', 'compelling', 'only', 'previous', 'wrong', 'corleone', 'other', 'prequel', 'sicilian', 'powerful', 'prequel', 'original', 'old', 'new', 'several', 'honest', 'frosty', 'distant', 'more', 'corleone', 'furth', 'unsuccessful', 'jewish', 'long', 'epic', 'poor', 'honest', 'local', 'petty', 'criminal', 'feared', 'respected', 'violent', 'uglier', 'short', 'rotten', 'corrupt', 'ruthless', 'authentic', 'exemplary', 'good', 'incredible', 'terrible', 'excellent', 'young', 'fabulous', 'convincing', 'slippery', 'great', 'great'];0.1595977193538169

92;slokes;"the rise of a great man is set against the fall of his son in this powerful second installment of the ""godfather"" franchise. ""the godfather part ii"" is an eminently worthy successor to the classic first film, not nearly as accessible but entertaining and gripping in its own right. when we reconnect with michael corleone (al pacino), he is firmly established as head of the corleone crime family, now based in lake tahoe, nevada and as lethal as ever. as michael asserts control over his dominion, we occasionally go back in time to see his father vito (robert de niro) finding his own path to criminal power. michael speaks with more authority than honesty, we learn right away. ""senator, we're both part of the same hypocrisy, but never think it applies to my family,"" he says. the irony and tragedy of ""godfather part ii"" is how that hypocrisy is in fact never stronger than when it comes to michael's family, which is all but destroyed by michael's iron grip in service of evil ends. as sequels go, few are regarded as measuring up to the magnificence of ""godfather part ii."" it's everything you expect from the first film, building on the final moments we saw there of michael accepting his destiny as mafia don and developing what that all means. weighing in at over three hours, with lengthy flashbacks, it manages to hold your focus as director-co-writer francis ford coppola plays cards you didn't know were in the deck. the pacing is deliberate, never ponderous. like the first ""godfather,"" i found i enjoyed ""part ii"" more with repeat viewings. occasionally, as in an opening sequence set in sicily that is revisited late in the movie, the drama gets a bit strained as the revenge theme is overplayed. otherwise, the same subtlety that makes the first movie so great is in ample evidence here. pacino is fantastic as the older, harder michael. we don't quite root for him anymore, the way we did in the first film (another weakness of ""part ii"" as i see it), but his command in the role is startling to witness. in the first movie, we saw him get bloody; this time the wounds are more internal as he plays his scenes with dead-eyed calm. ""i've already made my move,"" he tells his brother fredo (john cazale), regarding his latest venture in cuba with a suspect business partner named hyman roth (lee strasberg). cazale and strasberg give the most memorable supporting performances (de niro is more a co-lead even though he has less screen time than pacino). cazale is more of a hot mess than ever, entertainingly so until the stakes get too high. strasberg is so low-key and charming you almost find yourself trusting him, until a key scene when his mask slips regarding a former associate named moe greene. other performances, many by returnees from the first film, are accomplished if somewhat superfluous, particularly robert duvall as michael's adopted brother tom hagen, diane keaton as michael's wife kay, and talia shire as michael's sister connie. all of them have big moments, but are also left in the dust, somewhat by design as the theme of this film is michael's loss of family ties. the vito sections could have been deadly, but coppola here is at his peak as a director, working from a section of the source novel by co-screenwriter mario puzo that was left off the first film. taking his cues from marlon brando's original characterization, but lending his own unmistakable spin, de niro plays vito as coy, gentle, but highly dangerous. i love how vito speaks almost entirely in his native sicilian dialect, except at certain key moments when he uses english, depicted here as the language of power. he handles the problem of a don who wants to ""wet my beak"" in vito's business with cold calculation. it amounts to a power play not only against the don, but his buddies clemenza and tessio, who soon find themselves taking orders from their former underling. the film climaxes, as the first movie did, with a trio of interconnected sequences showing michael's brutal effectiveness against his enemies. this time, however, there's no sense of triumph. michael's revenge is too excessive, his ""enemies"" too reduced or ambiguous to merit their ends in our eyes. that of course is the message of ""godfather part ii."" ultimately, ""godfather part ii"" is a masterful if muted examination of the price of family, how the ties that bind too often strangle. i don't think it packs the same punch as the first film, but hardly any film does. what it does well is bring the themes of the first film into sharper focus, so sharp they leave one feeling the scars.";30 May 2015;8;['great', 'powerful', 'second', 'worthy', 'classic', 'first', 'accessible', 'entertaining', 'own', 'corleone', 'lethal', 'own', 'criminal', 'more', 'same', 'strong', 'evil', 'few', 'first', 'final', 'lengthy', 'writer', 'deliberate', 'ponderous', 'first', 'more', 'strained', 'same', 'first', 'great', 'ample', 'fantastic', 'old', 'hard', 'first', 'startling', 'first', 'bloody', 'internal', 'dead', 'eyed', 'late', 'suspect', 'memorable', 'less', 'more', 'hot', 'high', 'low', 'charming', 'key', 'former', 'other', 'many', 'first', 'superfluous', 'big', 'deadly', 'first', 'original', 'own', 'unmistakable', 'coy', 'gentle', 'dangerous', 'native', 'certain', 'key', 'cold', 'former', 'first', 'brutal', 'excessive', 'reduced', 'ambiguous', 'masterful', 'same', 'first', 'first', 'sharp'];0.1226077097505669

95;Steffi_P;"in the movies, sequels have always been difficult. the franchise pictures of the twenties and thirties were always careful to repeat cast and basic formula without reopening story lines that had already run their course. while the following decades saw the rise of the tv series, the screen sequel became almost unknown. today the fad of numbered sequels, ubiquitous in the eighties, has now become synonymous with unspeakable badness. that tradition was started, quite innocently, by this 1974 follow-up to the godfather. being a drama, the godfather part ii's biggest asset is probably in retaining the sublime cast that made the original so powerful. al pacino picks up exactly where he left off a few years previously, retreating further into passive steeliness, suppressing all emotions except the occasional burst of anger. john cazale has a somewhat expanded role, getting to show off a more impressive acting range and making fredo seem sympathetic in his weakness. welcome returns are also made by diane keaton, robert duvall and talia shire. however the greatest turn is that of newcomer robert de niro. de niro gives a credible presentation of an up-and-coming mobster and proud family man, whilst cleverly working in mannerisms of marlon brando's middle-aged don in the godfather. it's still only a small demonstration of de niro's talents however. perhaps an even more important factor is the return of producer-director francis ford coppola. coppola demonstrates again his ability to focus drama, going to lengths to show us only what is important. take, as one example out of many, the scene where pacino and lee strasberg first meet. roth's wife greets pacino, and bustles in and out of the scene once or twice to utter a few lines, but watch the way coppola keeps her fluttering about in the foreground, often with her back to us, framed from the shoulder down so we never see her face. coppola allows her to appear for reasons of logic, but as she's not a character we need to remember, he doesn't allow us to connect with her visually. this is really intelligent filmmaking. but the godfather part ii is more than ever about stunning imagery. with a bigger budget, vaster sets and hordes of extras, coppola shows an impressive ability to create thriving tableaux of crowds and street scenes, repeatedly using horizontal scans to move us through an environment, showing off a hundred tiny instances of real life that really make us believe in the recreation of a bygone era. this is especially true in the young vito flashbacks, which thanks to the cinematography of gordon willis and the production design team lead by dean tavoularis, have a wonderful sepia-toned look to them. it's intriguing how coppola also tends to keep his camera further back from the action in the those scenes, giving us the impression of something we are looking in on rather than something we are in the midst of. and yet this concentration on the visual has perhaps been taken a little too far. there are too many rather blatant bits of symbolism, such as the business of the dividing up of the cuba-cake, which reminds me of some kind of twee history textbook illustration. this inconsequential prop gets several amount of close-ups, and even several references in the dialogue, everything but a flashing subtitle saying ""they're carving up cuba geddit?"" but instead of looking clever it just seems silly to have hyman roth going on about his stupid cake. and what's more, there are too many references to the best ideas in the godfather the dark lake tahoe office where michael does his dealings: the murderous little montage at the end all of which serve little purpose other than sly winks to those who are familiar with the earlier picture. none of these motifs is executed as effectively as they were first time round, and so really they look almost like poor copycats by some lesser filmmakers. the godfather part ii is in many ways a decent work, but compared to its illustrious predecessor it is lukewarm; a flawed attempt to rekindle some of the old magic. in fact, it is just what we have come to associate with the movie sequel.";31 July 2010;7;['difficult', 'careful', 'basic', 'unknown', 'numbered', 'ubiquitous', 'synonymous', 'unspeakable', 'big', 'sublime', 'original', 'powerful', 'few', 'passive', 'occasional', 'impressive', 'sympathetic', 'welcome', 'talia', 'great', 'credible', 'up', 'proud', 'middle', 'aged', 'small', 'important', 'important', 'many', 'few', 'intelligent', 'more', 'stunning', 'big', 'impressive', 'horizontal', 'tiny', 'real', 'bygone', 'true', 'young', 'wonderful', 'intriguing', 'visual', 'little', 'many', 'blatant', 'such', 'inconsequential', 'several', 'close', 'several', 'clever', 'silly', 'stupid', 'more', 'many', 'good', 'dark', 'murderous', 'little', 'little', 'other', 'sly', 'familiar', 'early', 'first', 'poor', 'less', 'many', 'decent', 'illustrious', 'lukewarm', 'flawed', 'old'];0.1649011299435027

100;Movie-ManDan;"the godfather part ii is said by many to be the best sequel ever. i personally think that is arguable, since it arguably surpasses its proceeder and checking out the lord of the rings sequels and the empire strikes back. say this is the best sequel ever and i will not disagree. say this is better than the first and i will agree. honestly, i keep changing my mind about which instalment is better every time i watch them. this last time i watched them, the first one seemed better to me. the time before, this one was the superior picture. i don't care which is better, as long as i have 200 minutes of no interruptions while watching this. with the success of the godfather in 1972, it was only natural for there to be a sequel. the godfather part ii acts as both a sequel and a prequel, with the sequel being written by coppola and puzo and the prequel being taken from the novel. when pacino broke out in the first movie, he topped it one year later with serpico. his performance in this tops serpico and everything else he's ever done. unfortunately, he lost his sure oscar win to art carney. yes, carney was worthy, but put him in the same category as al pacino for perhaps the best role ever and he becomes very unworthy. the people at the academy probably thought pacino would just get better and they could give him an award later. that would not come until 1993 when he won for a role in scent of a woman that was inferior to all that he did in the 70s. at least the academy got the best picture win right. that was a given. pacino's rival/friend/co- star, robert de niro took home the win for best supporting actor, beating out their acting teacher, lee strasberg. de niro became the first oscar winner to not say a word of english. i don't know what it was about his portrayal, but there was some sort of magic contained with utter brilliance. strasberg and michael gazzo where also fantastic, but both did not possess an unknown magic that few can bring to the table. the prequel follows a child vito corleone who's family is poor. he witnesses his family begin murdered by corleone's most powerful mob boss. he heads to america and grows up on the streets there too. years later, an adult vito (de niro) rises to the top of new york's underworld and is determined to avenge his family's death. revenge stories like this have been done to death, but almost none have been executed this good. the sequel takes place a few years after the first with michael (pacino) as the don. after he successfully dodges an assassination attempt, ordered by hyman roth (strasberg), michael's fears about loyalty, betrayal and murder lead him to a severe paranoid state making him a deadly madman. if there was one flaw this had, it would be that the antagonist in the sequel isn't much of a threat; we know michael can destroy him and all he has. one reason the first one worked so well was because the family was losing and audience did not know how the family would regain power. that masterstroke isn't quite achieved in this. so maybe the first one is better. both stories are less complex than the original, but both together make one hefty team. al pacino outdoes marlon brando and himself in one of the top five greatest roles of the screen. he leads an all-star cast in what is arguably better acting than the first. with most of this being arguably better than the first, coppola's direction surpasses the first. the cinematography, sets and camera tricks beat out all the first had, which were great. 4/4";4 December 2014;10;['many', 'good', 'arguable', 'good', 'well', 'first', 'well', 'last', 'first', 'well', 'superior', 'well', 'natural', 'prequel', 'prequel', 'first', 'sure', 'worthy', 'same', 'good', 'unworthy', 'well', 'inferior', 'least', 'good', 'right', 'rival', 'good', 'first', 'utter', 'fantastic', 'unknown', 'few', 'poor', 'powerful', 'determined', 'few', 'first', 'severe', 'paranoid', 'deadly', 'much', 'first', 'first', 'well', 'complex', 'original', 'hefty', 'top', 'great', 'first', 'most', 'well', 'first', 'first', 'first', 'great'];0.2853696741854636

(1974). both films are perfect in every way, and the vision and movie-making talent of a young director named francis ford coppola are simply awesome. his idea of making an american epic, the story of one family raise to power, the price it takes and the eventual fall instead of a low budget fast moving gangster movie as the mgm studio had planned proved to be the stroke of genius. it is not easy to choose the best of two but i prefer part ii because i found the way coppola tells two parts of the story by intertwining them and cutting effortlessly, seamlessly between the different time periods and geographic locations - incomparable. yes, it's been done before and after him but never was i touched so deeply and amazed by the artistry and brilliancy of moving between past and future. i am surprised that the film was not rewarded for the editing because the team of editors contributed enormously in what is the magic of the godfather, part ii. the film is unique by being at the same time a prequel and a sequel to the original godfather because it tells the stories of young vito corleone first steps to the top of the criminal world and of michael, his youngest son who became godfather after his father passing. part 2 has the most important scene in the whole trilogy, the scene when vito kills don fanucci - the choice that would eventually lead to his raise as the crime family patriarch. i can go on forever. it is known how many great performances al pacino gave back in the 70s, his prime time (four oscar nominations in the row, 1973-1976) but michael corleone in part 2 is something that has to be studied and admired for as long as the young aspiring actors dream of not being stars but the actors. i am not a fan of pacino's latest films and roles. he screams a lot, he overplays but all screams can't say more than one glance from the scene during the new year celebration in habana. he said so much by his eyes only that had literally darkened with disbelief, grief, anger, and despair when he realized that he had been betrayed by his own brother fredo - who broke his heart and left the viewers heartbroken. john casale had only given five performances during his tragically short career but every one of them was remarkable and every movie he worked in belongs to the best america has produced. ...robert de niro speaking only italian as young vito gives one of his finest performances speaking. he plays a beautiful, dignified, decent man, hard working, loving father and husband who would stop at nothing to make his family happy the best way he knows how... and above all - the melancholic, melodious, mournful score by nino rota, the requiem for a dream, the best rota's tunes outside federico fellini films, as great as it is, godfather part ii would never be the same without musical themes written by nino rota specifically for the film, especially the main theme or the kay theme - the sound of love lost and longing... and in the end - perhaps the best flash back scene ever filmed, christmas and vito corleone's birthday celebration - the family is close together, the grown up children sit around the table, talk about future, some choices have been made, but there is no alienation, betrayal, losses, regrets, death....yet.";30 November 2009;10;['past', 'present', 'american', 'epic', 'ultimate', 'ultimate', 'italian', 'little', 'most', 'well', 'original', 'perfect', 'young', 'awesome', 'american', 'eventual', 'low', 'easy', 'good', 'different', 'geographic', 'incomparable', 'amazed', 'future', 'surprised', 'unique', 'same', 'prequel', 'original', 'young', 'corleone', 'first', 'criminal', 'young', 'important', 'whole', 'many', 'great', 'prime', 'oscar', 'young', 'late', 'more', 'new', 'own', 'short', 'remarkable', 'good', 'italian', 'young', 'fine', 'beautiful', 'dignified', 'decent', 'hard', 'happy', 'good', 'melancholic', 'melodious', 'mournful', 'good', 'great', 'same', 'musical', 'main', 'good', 'back', 'close'];0.26482782369146

109;sme_no_densetsu;"""the godfather: part ii"" hit theatres a couple of years after the first film and made history by becoming the first sequel to win the academy award for best picture. today, it is routinely listed alongside the original as one of the best american films of all time. the story picks up a few years after the end of the first film. michael is firmly established as the head of the family and has moved to nevada where he is edging the family towards legitimacy. however, when he is beset by betrayals he systematically sets about dealing with the betrayers mercilessly. there is also a second story thread (told in flashback) that traces the early years of vito corleone and his introduction to mob life. the film clocks in at a hefty 200 minutes. unlike the first film, though, i couldn't really get caught up in either of the parallel stories so the film seemed to drag quite a bit. i didn't find the vito storyline particularly compelling and the michael storyline is little more than a convoluted extension of part one. these stories were meant to be compared but i don't feel that the director or the editor really constructed the film optimally for this purpose. nevertheless, the film still has a classic scene or two, though it's nowhere near as consistent as the first film. most of the actors whose characters survived the first film reprised their roles here. returnees al pacino & talia shire each landed oscar nominations and so did newcomers michael v. gazzo & lee strasberg. however, the only actor to take home an oscar statuette was robert de niro for his portrayal of the young vito corleone. personally, i think that pacino gave the best performance of the film. francis ford coppola won an oscar for his direction but i feel that the first film was a better effort. from a visual standpoint the film is attractive, though, and the nino rota score was justly rewarded with an oscar. ultimately, i don't feel that ""the godfather: part ii"" lives up to its pedigree. i've watched it a few times, so i'd say that i've given it a fair shake. that being said, i realize that i'm in the vast minority here so it must be a personal thing. as far as i'm concerned, ""chinatown"" deserves the best picture oscar that went to this film.";6 October 2010;7;['first', 'first', 'good', 'original', 'good', 'american', 'few', 'first', 'second', 'early', 'hefty', 'first', 'parallel', 'compelling', 'little', 'more', 'convoluted', 'classic', 'consistent', 'first', 'most', 'first', 'only', 'young', 'good', 'first', 'well', 'visual', 'attractive', 'nino', 'few', 'fair', 'vast', 'personal', 'good'];0.2501344086021505

112;BrandtSponseller;"series note: it is almost unthinkable to watch this film without having seen the godfather (1972) first. this is a direct continuation of that story. the good news is that the godfather part ii has many amazing qualities, including fantastic performances from a superb cast, sublime, unprecedented visuals that no one else has been able to capture since, and very engaging stories. the bad news is that this should have easily been a 10, but overall, it is so sprawling and unfocused that i can't possibly give it more than a 9, which it only earns because the assets transcend what's basically a mess overall. because it should have been a 10, and most other reviews will tell you about the positive points at length, i may pick on more things in my review than you would think i would for a 9, but rest assured that even with the flaws, the godfather part ii is still essential viewing. director/co-writer francis ford coppola cleverly begins the film with parallels to the godfather. we see michael corleone (al pacino) ""in the role"" of his father, vito (marlon brando), from the first film, accepting prostrating guests while a party is going on outside. like the first film, the party consumes a lot of time while we get to know some of the principal characters. perhaps during this segment, perhaps a bit after, we realize that maybe the beginning wasn't so clever after all, because the structure of the godfather part ii parallels the godfather from a broad perspective, as if coppola and co-writer mario puzo used the first film as something of a template to create this one. after the party is over, there is an attempted hit on michael, and we quickly learn that not everything is rosy in the corleone's mafia world. michael believes that someone on the ""inside"" was involved with the hit. this launches a complicated sequence of events that has michael, who is now living in nevada, traveling to miami, cuba, new york, and so on. he accuses different people of involvement in the attempted hit depending on whom he is talking to. this may have all been part of a grand scheme to set up the responsible parties, but one of the flaws of the film is that coppola doesn't convey michael's underlying thoughts about this very well, not even later, and not through his actions. rather than feeling like a clever set-up, it starts to feel like slightly muddled writing. during the middle section of the film, which goes on for hours, we also have a hint of a problem that plagued the godfather--a bloated cast. there are bit too many characters who aren't well enough presented or explained. you may need to keep a scorecard. coppola and puzo also treat us to many extended ""flashback"" segments, and i mean way back, to vito as a boy and young man, played by robert de niro. for my money, these were the best scenes of the film, although maybe that's a bit of my bias creeping in, as i'm a huge de niro fan. but let's talk about the main plague of the film--sprawl. this is maybe first evident in the flashbacks. as good as they are, they go on far too long, and happen far too frequently, to sustain the momentum of either the michael story or the vito-as-a-youngster story. it begins to feel like we're toggling back and forth between two films, which is the track that should have been taken. the prequel, at least, would have been a solid 10. there's also a lot of sprawl in the michael corleone segments. coppola appears to have been suffering from what i'd now call ""j.k. rowling syndrome"". that happens when an artist becomes successful enough that they can fire or ignore their editor(s). instead of taking good advice about where to trim fat, the artist decides to just leave much of it in, and they now have the clout to override any dissenting and more sensible opinions. the michael corleone story has a lot of fat, including much of the cuba material (for example, sitting around the table with the president, laboriously passing around a solid gold telephone), the senate hearings (which go on far too long to make and provide the dramatic points), and so on. the film begins to feel more like a couple seasons of a television show that coppola tried to cram into a 3 and a half hour film, or worse, a collection of deleted scenes. the scenes, except for the fat that needed to be trimmed, are excellent in isolation. but by the time the climax rolls around, the whole has more of an arbitrary feeling--this is especially clear in the denouement, which seems to just end. i've barely left myself room to talk about the good points. the first one, which most people mention, is the acting. there isn't a bad performance in the film, but pacino, de niro, and some relatively minor characters, like those played by diane keaton, talia shire and john cazale, really stand out. the second outstanding point, similar to the first film, is the beautiful visuals. although all of the cinematography and production design is great, what really impressed me were some of the darkly lit scenes. characters and features of sets emerge from pitch-blackness, and everything is rich, deep shades of burgundy, brown, and orange. amazingly, nothing gets lost in these scenes. it must be incredibly difficult to achieve without making the shots too dark, because i can't remember another film since that has been able to capture the same look. the flashback scenes are also in similar, but lighter, colors, creating an appropriate sepia-tone feel. although the broad perspective problems are unfortunate, a closer focus on most segments of the film provides exemplary artistry. given that, and the film's importance culturally, the godfather part ii is a must-see.";10 May

115;bobsgrock;the godfather: part ii is not a sequel in the traditional hollywood sense, rather a companion piece to one of the greatest films ever made in the godfather. here, the story is epic and sprawling, as it covers michael's reign as the new head of the corleone family by moving the business to nevada and at the same time flashes back to show the story of how a young vito corleone came to power and started the story now being continued. francis ford coppola returns to his old ground with writing partner mario puzo to expand on michael and establish vito and doing so by going back and forth. this leads to some incredible shots of the young vito and the young michael in the same frame, a haunting image and symbol of how far this family has come. it also shows how far coppola has come in terms of directing these films. once again, his direction is immaculate in every sense, perfectly balancing the time between michael and vito, always picking the right time to go from story to story. all this aside, i haven't even mentioned the other strong points, which are basically all of them. the flawless acting continues here with al pacino cementing his legacy in this very subdued yet emotionally upsetting performance as michael, the youngest who seemed ostracized from his family at the beginning and now has all the power and success and none of the love or affection his father had. indeed, one of the main themes of the film is to show how different michael handles things from his father and whether or not he is a better leader. diane keaton, robert duvall, talia shire and the tragic john cazale all contribute so much in their roles, and robert de niro made his name known with a flawless performance as the young, ambitious and loyal vito. once again, gordon willis photographs and once again the darkness shrouds the characters, symbolizing the heavy-handed situations surrounding them. this adds so much to the tone and atmosphere of the story that it completely takes us up in the story and makes the 200 minute running time fly by smoothly. the godfather and the godfather: part ii have long been recognized as required viewing for any film lover and i cannot argue. they are so well-made and engrossing that it is impossible to not feel for these characters and the choices they make. the final two scenes are quite something to behold. the first is a flashback to see the kids waiting for vito to surprise him on his birthday. here, we see how michael truly was treated and how sonny, tom, and connie related to one another and how it colored the rest of their existence. the final scene is michael, alone and contemplating everything that has happened. it is a scene for the audience to contemplate and wonder at the travesty that has abounded. and these two films are truly something to behold and admire for their sheer quality and intensity.;19 November 2009;9;['traditional', 'great', 'epic', 'sprawling', 'new', 'corleone', 'same', 'young', 'old', 'incredible', 'young', 'young', 'same', 'immaculate', 'right', 'other', 'strong', 'subdued', 'upsetting', 'young', 'main', 'different', 'well', 'tragic', 'flawless', 'young', 'ambitious', 'loyal', 'heavy', 'handed', 'impossible', 'final', 'first', 'sonny', 'final', 'alone', 'sheer'];0.1254908781694496

118;TheUnknown837-1;"""the godfather"" (1972) was, and still is, in my eyes as well as the eyes of most people, one of the greatest motion pictures ever made and without any doubts, the one that featured the quintessential cast for a mafia movie. it took me a long time to getting around to it, but at last a few weeks ago, i had the privilege to see director francis ford coppola's continuation of the trilogy. and during that long span of time, i had heard a lot about ""the godfather: part ii"" and how some have even built up the nerve to call it better than the original. i doubted it would even come close, even if it was great. boy, was i wrong. ""the godfather"" (1972) is still great and a true masterpiece, but much to my surprise and delight, part ii is even better. that's what i call a feat. perhaps the reason why ""the godfather: part ii"" matches and overpowers the original is becauseat least to methat it is really not a sequel, but rather a continuation of the first film, which was really just a warm-up for what was to follow. the first film ended with marlon brando's vito corleone dying and his youngest son michael (al pacino) turning from the weak little college kid who wanted nothing to do with his family, turning out to become the exact image of his father. and in part ii, we still have him as the image of his fatheronly worse. while don vito was ruthless, he was also sympathetic and likable. the new michael corleone, by contrast, is one of the most bone-chilling villains ever seen. part ii follows his endeavors as he carries on in his father's name and mixed up with this continuation is a flashback sequence. you see, part ii is both a continuation and a prequel to the original. inter-spliced with the sequel footage is a second story detailing the past of vito corleone, now played by a young robert de niro in an oscar-winning performance as the dumb-witted boy from sicily who became one of the most powerful mobsters alive. ""the godfather: part ii"", like its predecessor, is a legendary film for many reasons. apart from being one of the most important and entertaining films ever made, it also set new standards and records that have yet to be matched. it because the first sequel to win best picture at the academy awards, it started the now-common formula of using roman numerals for sequel titles, it has the irony where it, as well as the original, have an academy award win for two different actors playing the same characters (marlon brando as an old vito corleone in the original and robert de niro as a young vito corleone in part ii), michael corleone is one of the more frightening villains ever realized, and the look of violence and horror of a mafia world is twice as terrifying as what was seen in the first film. and of course, it marked the beginning of robert de niro's career. the irony of the first ""the godfather"" (1972) was how michael corleone was transformed from a ""nice college boy"" to quote his brother into a vicious crime lord who at the end of the first film authorizes the assassinations of all of his competitors without flicking an eyelash. and the irony of ""the godfather: part ii"" is not only is he now worse than his father ever was, but michael corleone is still driving himself down a road to his own relentless destruction and the moral destruction of those around him. his son, his wife, his sister, brother, brother-in-law, and close friends are both brought closer to him and alienated from him at the same time. alienated because they fear him. brought closer because they know better than to run away. in regards to the film's second story, the prequel about vito corleone, it's not only brilliant, but necessary and phenomenal. the prequel is one of the few major chapters from mario puzo's incredible book that could not be fitted into the original film. that's alright, because to me, the flashback was the only slow and unnecessary part that puzo wrote. but here, in this film, in this continuation, it not only fits and correlates, but belongs. again, it's to show how michael corleone is more vicious, more dangerous, more terrible than his father, who was at one time brutal and devilish. there was originally a scene that called for marlon brando to return as an old vito corleone, but i think the magic of this prequel footage would have been lost if it had, for we then compare the brando performance from the original, the de niro performance from the sequel, see how they blend perfectly together, and our imaginations become our eyes and ears. in regards to the film's music score, nino rota scores even higher than he did with his soundtrack for the first film. one noticeable thing is how the original theme score was sad and almost depressing, but the music for part ii is even more sad and even more depressing, for it's really a tragic story. rota knew what coppola and puzo were trying to show with their second film and he was dead-on with his somber, almost ironic musical score. ""the godfather: part ii"" also boasts a great deal of truly shocking moments that at times makes you jump in your seat and at other times, hang your jaws in awe, in a bitter disbelief to accept what has happened and the latter most certainly comes about in the final shots. and that ultimately is the power of coppola's film and that is why it is considered so terrific, even to the point of surpassing its superb predecessor. i honestly didn't think it was possible for part ii to be better than the original, but it is. this is a compliment of the highest order.";12 May 2009;10;['most', 'great', 'quintessential', 'long', 'last', 'few', 'long', 'original', 'close', 'great', 'wrong', 'great', 'true', 'well', 'least', 'first', 'first', 'young', 'weak', 'little', 'exact', 'bad', 'ruthless', 'sympathetic', 'likable', 'new', 'prequel', 'original', 'inter', 'spliced', 'second', 'young', 'powerful', 'alive', 'legendary', 'many', 'important', 'entertaining', 'new', 'first', 'good', 'common', 'roman', 'sequel', 'original', 'different', 'same', 'old', 'original', 'young', 'frightening', 'terrifying', 'first', 'first', 'nice', 'vicious', 'first', 'bad', 'own', 'relentless', 'moral', 'close', 'same', 'second', 'prequel', 'brilliant', 'necessary', 'phenomenal', 'few', 'major', 'incredible', 'original', 'alright', 'only', 'slow', 'unnecessary', 'vicious', 'dangerous', 'terrible', 'brutal', 'devilish', 'old', 'prequel', 'original', 'high', 'first', 'noticeable', 'original', 'sad', 'depressing', 'sad', 'depressing', 'tragic', 'second', 'dead', 'ironic', 'musical', 'great', 'shocking', 'other', 'bitter', 'latter', 'final', 'terrific', 'possible', 'well', 'original', 'high'];0.0303557312252964
119;fernandoschiavi;"this premise of drawing a temporal parallel between father and son, showing the ascension of both one and the other, manages to establish an excellent philosophical analysis about the relationship that exists between the choices of one over the other. while vito corleone (robert de niro), moved by love for the newly started family, makes his business grow based on the game of waist and punctual demonstrations of power; michael finds strength and constant intimidation the best way to keep things ""under control"" and thus preserve the family name, the memory of his father and the safety of his wife and children. and it is precisely at this point that we observe the son making the mistakes that the father avoided. michael is much more moved by the blind obstinacy of duty to the past than by the yearning to build something solid for the future. he wants to finish what his father started. this becomes perfectly clear as the film progresses and the stories intertwine. while facing the hatred of other families and the persecution of the senate that seeks in every way to exterminate the parallel power that the mafia represents, michael does not realize that the reason that, in the speech, he uses as a justification for his questionable actions, is flowing among his fingers. what would it be? yes, your family. this is one of the best conflicts in the film, by the way. more than the fierce arguments between michael's lawyers and the politicians who pursue him; more than the shots that are exchanged between your generals; the ""battles"" carried out by his family are the center of the plot. coppola achieves the feat of presenting interesting developments for each character, to a lesser or greater degree, allowing his actors to stand out in their roles. part ii, however, brings new directions to most of them, taking everyone to a higher level: even more mature, al pacino gives new touches of paranoia to michael corleone; diane keaton as the wife, kay corleone, stands out. revealing the nuances present in a woman left aside, keaton conquers us through the construction of the phases that the end of a marriage goes through. she starts faithful to her husband, but as he gets lost in the world of the mafia, the efforts she stars in are exhausted, as well as the love she once had for that man; strasberg proves what an ""method"" actor is capable of by bringing cynicism and bitterness beneath hyman roth's calm facade; and john cazale is the greatest asset of all, winning the chance to turn his character's apparent stupidity into a particularly tragic figure. despite all its epic scope and its many bumps, part ii manages to appear more intimate by following these characters. vito corleone's origin is magnificently well built. the reconstruction of that historical period, both in sicily and in new york, brings a strong poetic air to the film. combining this with the opera atmosphere that the original already possessed, the result is a magnificent cultural and social painting - merits of director of photography gordon willis who, like his predecessor, manages, with an almost theatrical light, to assertively portray the tense environment of history. counting the arrival of italian immigrants to new york, the film shows how vito (played by robert de niro) developed and what his motivations were, as well as those of several other secondary characters, such as the gangster clemenza, his partner at the beginning of the formation of the corleone empire. these leaps in time and the impeccable reconstructions of the period also help to create a romantic panorama of america at the beginning of the 20th century. the temporal reconstruction in the flashbacks is also to be admired, all enhanced by the magnificent soundtrack of nino rota and carmine coppola, creating new italian themes based on the musical notes of the first film - the result is epic. the current don corleone is not in serious danger of life - to the viewer he is considered to be a practically invincible figure. mike's real fear is losing his family, something that is made clear in a remarkable dialogue with his mother, in which she comforts him by saying: ""you can never lose your family"". it is interesting to note that since his transformation into this monstrous figure it is the first time that we have seen him really afraid. as much as his apparent sociopathy dominates his disposition towards the world in the vast majority of scenes, al pacino's work ensures that we see the care that this man has regarding the blood of his blood. the progression of the storyline, however, continues to transform the character - this time in a subtler way than in the first film, of course - taking him from a ruthless figure to an even more traumatized man, who opts for the dark and the silence, abandoning practically all the warmth he showed towards his family. the first of mike's impacts on the film, of course, comes from his brother fredo's betrayal and the discovery of that fact practically takes all of michael's air. what is interesting, however, is the way in which the script by francis and mario puzo does not leave this factor only in black and white. fredo didn't know that they would try to kill his brother and he clearly regrets it later. john cazale, who had a background character in the previous work, gives a real show. ""i should take care of you"" he repeats to his younger brother, at the same time that he practically shakes in the reclining chair and shakes his hands without the slightest force on his wrist. here we have the same fragile and childish figure from the first film, leaving us with nothing but a real pity for his final destiny, michael corleone's greatest sin. the second impact comes from the breakup with kay and the revelation that she miscarried her son. al pacino is an actor who notably likes to perform scenes in which his character explodes in anger and here we have the best of the entire trilogy. it is worth noting that the loss of his calm in those moments reiterates his concern for the family. the monster that michael becomes is practically undone here, when in his expression we can feel all his anger showing. there is a human behind this figure and it is sad to see that, after this explosion, he falls even more, almost completely burying that young veteran we met at the beginning of the godfather. the tension generated in the viewer, however, is not limited to michael's downfall. coppola knows how to work with precision the suspense of these two hundred minutes of projection. since the initial problems, we do not know who the protagonist really considers the culprit for the attempt on his life. was it hyman roth (lee strasberg, actor suggested by none other than pacino) or frank pentangelli (michael v. gazzo)? or both? the audience is left in the dark for much of the feature and, ironically, when the villain reveals himself the other also becomes one, leading us to audiences seeking to incriminate the corleones, an element that is inserted masterfully into the story by using the parallel narrative, that oscillates between vito and mike. both narratives, as they walk and reveal the fate that their protagonists will have, also close this excellent assessment of family inheritance. in michael's life everything goes wrong. the choices he makes - no more spoilers; watch the movie, please - lead you to a path of guilt and loneliness. with vito, on the other hand, we have a beautiful scene of the family gathered in the dining room waiting for him. as much as his son tried, he is not like don corleone. the overlap that takes us out of his dark room and takes us to the joyful father's dinner appears as a reminder, a reflection, the realization that he failed in his mission. he did not become the man his father dreamed he was. coppola's option of making sequences in the past and present longer works perfectly, making the rhythm of the work easy to follow. each scene acts as a chapter within the narrative, in the director's own words, as a short film. the fragmentation of the projection is then disguised by the aforementioned contemplative moments that perfectly unite the past and the present. disliking one side of the story is almost unthinkable, while both manage to engage us from beginning to end. michael's perspective continues his sad fall, while vito's introduces elements that we learned to love in the first film, in addition to offering well-positioned comic reliefs within the heavy climate that has been established since the opening minutes of the projection. the godfather: part ii achieves the impossible: to overcome his predecessor with a cohesive text, very inspiring performances and excellent direction. disguised as a film about the mafia, in fact what we see is a study of family complexities. it is definitely coppola's best work. part ii may not be superior to the first part of coppola's trilogy, but it is as powerful a film as it is ambitious - for both good and evil - and definitely one of the best and most successful sequences in cinema.";19 December 2020;9;['temporal', 'other', 'excellent', 'philosophical', 'other', 'punctual', 'constant', 'good', 'blind', 'solid', 'clear', 'other', 'parallel', 'questionable', 'good', 'more', 'fierce', 'more', 'interesting', 'less', 'great', 'new', 'most', 'high', 'mature', 'new', 'present', 'faithful', 'capable', 'calm', 'great', 'apparent', 'tragic', 'epic', 'many', 'intimate', 'historical', 'strong', 'poetic', 'magnificent', 'cultural', 'social', 'theatrical', 'tense', 'italian', 'several', 'other', 'secondary', 'such', 'impeccable', 'romantic', 'temporal', 'magnificent', 'new', 'italian', 'musical', 'first', 'epic', 'current', 'serious', 'invincible', 'real', 'clear', 'remarkable', 'interesting', 'monstrous', 'first', 'afraid', 'apparent', 'vast', 'first', 'ruthless', 'traumatized', 'first', 'interesting', 'black', 'white', 'previous', 'real', 'young', 'same', 'slight', 'same', 'fragile', 'childish', 'first', 'real', 'final', 'great', 'second', 'good', 'entire', 'worth', 'undone', 'sad', 'young', 'initial', 'other', 'much', 'other', 'parallel', 'excellent', 'wrong', 'more', 'other', 'beautiful', 'dark', 'joyful', 'present', 'easy', 'own', 'short', 'aforementioned', 'contemplative', 'unthinkable', 'sad', 'first', 'comic', 'heavy', 'impossible', 'cohesive', 'inspiring', 'excellent', 'good', 'superior', 'first', 'powerful', 'ambitious', 'good', 'evil', 'good', 'successful'];0.148871473354232
120;proud_luddite;"both a prequel and a sequel to ""the godfather"", this film tells parallel stories in different time periods. the early one takes place in the early 1900s when vito corleone escapes a traumatic childhood in sicily and becomes part of the crime scene in new york city . the later story in the 1950s has vito's son michael taking over the family's business of organized crime. as both crime drama and family drama, this film earns high marks in both categories. the later story includes a patriarch who is so ruthless and power-hungry that it would normally be tempting to despise him and those around him. yet, the skillful directing by francis ford coppola successfully tricks the audience into showing great interest to the clan almost to the point of sympathy. the later story is sometimes difficult to follow. it's extremely busy with many details and characters that are sometimes difficult to follow and remember. luckily, the earlier story is straightforward. each story is enhanced with differing styles of photography by the very talented gordon willis. the music of nino rota and carmine coppola is also beautiful. despite the mentioned flaw, this film has so much talent involved that it ends up as a memorable experience even after multiple viewings. the supporting cast members john cazale, michael gazzo, lee strasberg, and talia shire all have at least one scene that gives them a chance to shine. as vito, robert deniro shows greatness in the role that brought him to fame. but the highlight of the cast is al pacino as michael who personifies the worst side of humanity in subtle ways especially in two scenes. in one, where he has a serious confrontation with his wife, his still face can't fully betray his anger as his jaw shakes. in another scene, he is viewed from a distance behind a glass screen door. even at a distance, his silent pose conveys soullessness and evil. coppola's directing is at its best in crowd scenes, particularly a street festival in the earlier story where a murder is being planned; and a new year's eve party in havana in the later story. overall, ""the godfather part ii"" has aged very well. rating: 9 out of 10 outstanding achievements: directing by francis ford coppola acting by al pacino";8 June 2019;9;['prequel', 'parallel', 'different', 'early', 'early', 'traumatic', 'later', 'organized', 'high', 'later', 'ruthless', 'hungry', 'tempting', 'skillful', 'great', 'later', 'difficult', 'busy', 'many', 'difficult', 'early', 'straightforward', 'talented', 'beautiful', 'much', 'memorable', 'multiple', 'least', 'bad', 'subtle', 'serious', 'silent', 'good', 'early', 'new', 'later', 'outstanding'];0.068489898989899
121;Holt344;"the godfather part ii is an epic crime film produced and directed by francis ford coppola from a screenplay he co-wrote with mario puzo. the first film is a masterpiece but the increased budget is only positive in the sequel as everything is improved immensely and i'm talking about the production design and bigger scope, the superb writing and direction is still there. why is this film like it's predecessor regarded as a classic and of course among of the best films in history? you can write a whole essay regarding that but there's a lot of things that makes it into the masterpiece it is, there's simply just so much attention to detail and the writing is some of the best i have ever seen. it's 3 hours and 22 minutes long, every scene matters, even the flashbacks as it ties everything up nicely at the end. if not for the excellent and award worthy editing, the two parallel narratives wouldn't really work but it works in such a brilliant way. it flows so well and you see how much the two writers (especially mario puzo) how they care about the story and its characters. though they are hugely inspired by real people, you can just see how real these characters are as they are flawed and written as human as possible. mario puzo created a fascinating and truly mesmerizing story in his books, his and francis ford coppola's work for the film trilogy is on the same level if not better. there's also some comedic scenes like the previous film, if not for the actors and their execution, it wouldn't be funny. nino rota returns to make the musical score and honestly, it's phenomenal like always, superb work that just hits you with its emotion. the costume design are top notch and so is the art direction, sets and locations. the cinematography is excellent and mesmerizing, visually this is an incredible film, much thanks to gordon willis. this film shows francis ford coppola at his best, he created a masterpiece. it's considered to be one of the greatest films of all time. in 1997, the american film institute ranked it as the 32nd-greatest film in american film history. the film was nominated for eleven academy awards and became the first sequel to win for best picture. its six oscar wins also included best director for coppola, best supporting actor for robert de niro and best adapted screenplay for coppola and puzo. pacino won the bafta award for best actor and was nominated for the academy award for best actor. he got robbed of the oscar, his performance is brilliant in every way and tops even robert de niro's phenomenal performance, it might also be pacino's best performance of his entire career. robert de niro won an oscar for his performance and i'm behind that 100%, he lived in sicily for three months and spent four months learning to speak the sicilian language in order to play vito corleone, that's how he prepared for the role. it is the second installment in the godfather trilogy. partially based on puzo's 1969 novel the godfather, the film is both a sequel and a prequel to the godfather, presenting parallel dramas: one picks up the 1958 story of michael corleone, the new don of the corleone family, protecting the family business in the aftermath of an attempt on his life and as he attempts to expand the family business into las vegas, hollywood and cuba; the prequel covers the journey of his father, vito corleone, from his sicilian childhood to the founding of his family enterprise in new york city. the godfather part ii has many characters returning from the first film, they changed actors for the flashback/prequel story of the narrative, robert de niro takes over the role of vito corleone and i want to say that he does the character justice but it's almost impossible to stop thinking of the magnificent and perfect performance that marlon brando did as the older vito. some important characters are al pacino as michael corleone, robert duvall as tom hagen, diane keaton as kay adams-corleone, robert de niro as vito corleone, john cazale as fredo corleone, talia shire as connie corleone, lee strasberg as hyman roth, michael v. gazzo as frank pentangeli, g. d. spradlin as senator pat geary, richard bright as al neri, gastone moschin as fanucci and tom rosqui as rocco lampone. there's of course much more actors and fully fleshed out characters. hyman roth is a jewish mobster, investor and a business partner of vito corleone, and later his son michael corleone. he is based on new york mobster meyer lansky. frank pentangeli is a caporegime in the corleone family, running the family's operations in new york city while michael corleone, his brother and underboss, fredo and the other two capos, rocco lampone and al neri are based in nevada. the character arc for michael corleone in the first two parts of the godfather trilogy is brilliant and just a milestone in terms of storytelling, but it comes full circle here and sees the true nature of michael. i just think he's a brilliant character and even though he's such an ice cold person and evil person, i still sympathize with him because of who he once was and who he still is underneath it all. the godfather part iii is a satisfying end to his arc and it wouldn't be as excellent if it wouldn't be for this movie. rewatching this film made me appreciate it even more and i can finally say that this is among the best films i've ever seen. like goodfellas, this trilogy is worth coming back to again and again, i just hope it doesn't take me years to rewatch it again. in terms of camera, lighting, cinematography, composition, production design, costume, storytelling, writing and acting. it's flawless and a master class in filmmaking. with all that said, i just have to admit this, i think the story was better in the first film and that's mostly because of how the entire film was based on the book, whilst part ii is partially based on that book (it's only vito's backstory that's based on the novel, rest is original). on my first viewing, my thoughts were the opposite, i thought the story was better here but the first has a better story but i think this film has improved on everything. the godfather part ii is a masterpiece that i'll continue to study and to enjoy, almost 50 years and it's holding up better than some of the latest in the past two decades, i think letting francis ford coppola get complete freedom with the follow-up to the godfather was the right choice for the studio and for the trilogy. it wouldn't have been as good if that weren't the case, but we got an masterpiece and a classic out of it.";30 August 2021;10;['epic', 'first', 'increased', 'positive', 'big', 'good', 'whole', 'much', 'good', 'excellent', 'worthy', 'parallel', 'brilliant', 'much', 'real', 'real', 'flawed', 'human', 'possible', 'fascinating', 'mesmerizing', 'same', 'well', 'comedic', 'previous', 'funny', 'musical', 'phenomenal', 'superb', 'top', 'notch', 'excellent', 'mesmerizing', 'incredible', 'much', 'good', 'great', 'great', 'american', 'first', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'brilliant', 'phenomenal', 'good', 'entire', 'sicilian', 'second', 'prequel', 'parallel', 'new', 'corleone', 'sicilian', 'many', 'first', 'prequel', 'impossible', 'magnificent', 'perfect', 'old', 'important', 'frank', 'more', 'jewish', 'corleone', 'underboss', 'other', 'first', 'brilliant', 'full', 'true', 'brilliant', 'cold', 'evil', 'satisfying', 'excellent', 'good', 'worth', 'well', 'first', 'entire', 'original', 'first', 'opposite', 'well', 'first', 'well', 'late', 'past', 'complete', 'right', 'good'];0.3399913419913419
122;mentalcritic;the godfather, part ii is one of the most revered sequels of all time, if not the most. while i prefer the original for a few reasons, this sequel is not without more than its fair share of merits. however, it also has one or two flaws that, if i am going to be fair, i have to mention. since they will take up the least amount of space in my comments, i'll get them out of the way first. the first flaw, in my opinion, is a jumping sense of focus. as the story goes from one part of america to cuba to sicily to another part of america, one can get a little giddy with the to and fro. the other problem is that when the screenplay doesn't follow mario puzo's original writings, it doesn't quite work. the big conspiracy with a jewish smuggler and unnamed italian rivals in the new york or nevada underworlds doesn't quite seem to gel. both stories, the historical story of vito corleone and the present-day story of michael's decline, really needed three hours of their own. it is interesting to note that of all the deleted footage that went into the godfather legacy miniseries, the majority came from this film. the acting from all concerned is top-notch, especially from al pacino, who sells himself beautifully as the dangerous head of a mafia family in spite of needing to be on platforms to appear at the same height as many of his castmates. robert duvall gives a workman-like performance, but he has little to do here other than act out the part of the ever-loyal brother. i think the fact that he was almost irrelevant to the storyline here has a lot to do with duvall's refusal to join the cast of the third film. the real surprise here is john cazale, who fleshes out fredo corleone far beyond anything in either the first film or the novel. it is unsurprising that all of the films cazale has been in have been nominated for best picture. he portrays the rejected brother who just wants what he feels is his fair share with an uncanny grace. but these are just the highlights. the entire cast give top-notch performances, even the extras who appear for less than ten seconds. the best thing about a godfather film is how it builds a simple story of a family who, whether they wanted it or not, happen to be in the business of organised crime. the bloodshed of this film, much as was the case in the original, is secondary to the simple premise that these are ordinary people in an extraordinary position. francis ford coppola has previously stated that he saw the godfather as a (relatively) modern king lear, and that style is kept up in the sequel. michael is in essence the new king of the realm, but he learns the hard way that the more he tries to tighten his grip upon what is his, or what is loyal to him, the more it slips away. this is the film in which we learn why this is not what vito corleone wanted for his youngest son. sadly, fate has a way of getting in the path of our best intentions, and nowhere is this more evident than in diane keaton's dialogue. some of her speech to al pacino really sounds like it was either written at the last moment, or by someone who didn't have a whole lot of experience in writing films. like the other godfather films, the most satisfying moments are when the opponents of the corleone family get their hash settled in a big way. the montage shown in part ii is not as graphic as that of the original, but it brings the whole thing to a satisfying climax. lee strasberg's speech to the press after his character being deported from israel is priceless, as is the manner in which it ends. unfortunately, the etiquette that dictates i cannot reveal what happens at the end of the film means i cannot tell you anything about the most satisfying death in the film. being one of the most debated and criticised scenes among godfather fans, i am fairly certain that anyone with an interest in the film is going to hear about it elsewhere anyway. in spite of the fact that it, and the necessary lead-up, takes up most of the second half of michael's plot segment, it will leave many a viewer stunned. but that is one of the things that detracts slightly from this cinematic tour de force. with the screen time so sharply divided between two stories, sometimes the linking between plot points seems to fall by the wayside. i gave the godfather, part ii a nine out of ten. in contrast to the original, i noticed the passage of time on a few occasions in its two hundred minutes. still, if you're out to see a good drama, and you've already enjoyed the first godfather, then this is worth a couple of viewings. if every director adaptating the writings of others into a film format took as much care as francis ford coppola had here, then the world would be a better place.;8 May

123;gab-14712;mike is the head of his family, but he is broken, angry man and no one can escape his wrath, not even his poor older brother. this film is a film that laments for loss and is full of bitter emotions.but this is also arguably one of the greatest sequels of all time to one of the greatest films of all time. this is one of favorite all-time films, and i wouldn't hesitate to call it better than the first movie. this movie excels at everything, especially when it comes to storytelling. and the devolution of michael corleone's humanity and morality. the film invokes emotion from us for many reasons from the sad but powerful score by nino rota, to the powerhouse acting from everyone in the cast especially from al pacino, a story that introduces the past effectively, a very shocking ending, tight editing, powerhouse directing by francis ford coppola, and the list goes on and on. sequels were not a commodity back in the day, and this sequel to the huge 1972 film the godfather is one of the first of its kind. the success of this film is why today's movie business relies upon sequels to make money. regardless, this is one of the greatest films of all time. this film continues the saga of the corleone family as we continue from the events of the first film. michael corleone (al pacino) is trying to expand the family's business into places like hollywood and cuba. his character takes a dive as he clashes with his brother fredo (john cazale), his lawyer tom hagen (robert duvall), his wife kay (diane keaton), and his sister connie (talia shire). he is suspicious of his business associates activities such as folks like hyman roth (lee strasberg) and frankie pentangeli (michael gazzo). but this film incorporates another story into this story: the past. we meet vito corleone (robert de niro) when he was growing up in sicily and emigrates to new york city where be becomes connected with the mob life. i loved how the story is told thanks to the masterful storytelling by screenwriter mario puzo and director coppola. they successfully tell two stories over the course of the movie without any trouble. each story complements each other very well. the continuing saga of the present day family remains a high point. of course the central character is michael corleone. the first film he was a man reluctant to take over the family business, but now he is turning into a control monster who trusts no one, not even his inner circle. it's a sad thing to watch as his morality crumbles and the final scene-one of cinema's most famous scenes, makes the case to show why michael corleone turns into a monster. i enjoyed the flashback sequences featuring young vito. de niro absolutely nails his role as vito and he inherits the older vito's mannerisms very well. it was fun to see how vito turned into the man we knew him from the first film. the scenes in sicily, where he is connected with a local mob boss is very powerful because vito's mother was shot down. but that event helped turn vito into the kind of man he was and to my happiness, vito exacted the perfect kind of revenge. these scenes in sicily and new york are beautifully shot and they really understood what new york was supposed to be in 1910. this is a film full of performances, all of them wonderful. pacino excels as michael corleone once again. i really wish he won an oscar for this role because he deserved it. his performance was effectively scary. robert de niro was absolutely amazing as the younger vito and his role showed the kind of versatility this man has. diane keaton was effective as kay. this film has kay standing up to his man as she eventually leaves his side. duvall is always great as tom hagen. john cazale has a bigger part in the second film, as he tries to do what's best but simply does not have the brains and ultimately pays the price. his performance was a powerful one. then we have the likes of the little known actors who gave an impression like lee strasberg who played the business partner hyman roth who wants michael killed and michael gazzo who plays frankie, a relative and associate of michael's. the godfather part ii is one of the greatest films of all time. the godfather is an amazing film, but this one may just be a tad better. that is a rarity because 1.) just look at the quality of the first film and 2.) sequels are rarely better than the original film. speaking of sequels, this is the only sequel to this day that has won best picture at the academy award. indeed, it's a very amazing feat. although to be taken with a grain of salt, but on the website imdb, this movie is ranked #2 of all-time. that goes to show the commercial value of the movie. i loved this movie for many reasons. from al pacino's wonderful performance to the chill-inducing score by nino rota. there was also a flashback sequence that hearkens back to the first movie as it brings back james caan although marlon brando declined because he felt under-appreciated. anyhow, coppola does an amazing job with the first two movies in the series. that end shotjust wow. my grade: a+;18 October 2017;10;['angry', 'poor', 'old', 'full',

124;hall895;remember that young idealist michael corleone from the opening wedding scene in the godfather? that michael corleone doesn't exist anymore. his descent began in the original film as he took over the family business. in part ii the now ruthlessly evil michael bottoms out. he has money, he has power. but at what cost? it is hard to comprehend what he has become, so sad to see him cost himself everything he really holds dear. and, in a stroke of genius, as we watch michael fall director francis ford coppola at the same time flashes back and allows us to see michael's father rise. the rise of vito corleone, the fall of michael. either story on its own would be epic. interwoven together the two stories combine to make the godfather: part ii one of the most audacious and most brilliant films ever made. after a brief introduction to the vito storyline part ii thrusts us right back into that familiar godfather world which we left at the end of the first film. it is now 1958 and michael has moved family operations to nevada. we open at the family compound in lake tahoe with an elaborate party celebrating michael's son's first communion. yes, the parallels with the first film's wedding scene are obvious. rather than vito it is now michael who everyone waits to see. even his sister connie will have to get in line and wait her turn for an audience with michael. the real business of the day, involving a proposed corleone takeover of another casino to add to their empire, is conducted between michael and nevada senator pat geary. we see that michael is so powerful, and so sure of himself, that he thinks nothing of being totally dismissive and insulting towards a united states senator. safe to say this is not the most cordial of business meetings. nothing seems to be decided and geary, a true sleaze in his own right, leaves but you know we'll see him again. michael moves on to his next meeting with frank pentangeli, who is now running the old corleone new york territory. this meeting is bitter and hostile as can be. it's been a long day for michael corleone. and it's about to get much, much worse. an attempt is made on michael's life. bullets come flying into his bedroom. he and his family emerge unscathed and you know the film is now going to kick into high gear. this is going to get really, really good. and then the film immediately transports you back to 1917 and the story of vito corleone. so is coppola pulling the rug out from under you by leaving michael's story just when you can't wait to see what happens next? not at all. vito's story will prove to be just as compelling as michael's. and throughout the film coppola chooses the absolutely perfect times to jump from one story to the other, at emotional high points, places where the connections between the two stories are the most poignant. it's brave, brilliant film making. the audience is treated to two fabulous stories which fit together absolutely perfectly. as the film plays out we see vito begin to acquire power and michael consumed by power. we see the great love vito has for his family as we watch michael's family fall apart around him. we know vito is capable of some evil things but he still has some heart to him. michael has clearly lost his heart somewhere along the way. just telling michael's story would have been enough to make this a great film. weaving young vito's story in so seamlessly is what makes the film something truly special. as with the first film coppola is helped here by universally brilliant performances from his cast. and as with the first film it is al pacino who makes the biggest impression. his performance as michael is as powerful and captivating as anything you've ever seen. michael is such a complex character and his journey from the beginning of the first film to the end of this one is something that has to be seen to be believed. and over both films pacino is spot-on perfect every step of the way. in the parallel story it is robert de niro who gets the critical role of young vito and he does ever so well in giving life to the man who would one day be brando. we of course have the familiar faces from the first film. robert duvall as lawyer tom hagen, diane keaton as michael's long-suffering wife kay. there's talia shire and morgana king. and most memorably of all john cazale as hapless, hopeless fredo. part ii also gives us great new characters, making room for new performers to make their mark on the godfather saga. lee strasberg, michael v. gazzo, g. d. spradlin, gastone moschin, dominic chianese...the list could go on and on. such a huge cast and yet every performer seems to fit their role perfectly. the film tells two great stories and the acting is absolutely wonderful throughout. some two hour movies seem to drag endlessly. this nearly three and a half hour movie absolutely flies by. a monumental achievement for coppola, one of the best films of all time.;23 January 2011;9;['young', 'original', 'evil', 'hard', 'sad', 'dear', 'same', 'own', 'epic', 'audacious', 'brilliant', 'brief', 'familiar', 'first', 'elaborate', 'first', 'first', 'obvious', 'real', 'powerful', 'sure', 'dismissive', 'insulting', 'safe', 'cordial', 'geary', 'true', 'own', 'next', 'frank', 'old', 'bitter', 'hostile', 'long', 'about', 'much', 'bad', 'unscathed', 'high', 'good', 'compelling', 'perfect', 'other', 'emotional', 'high', 'poignant', 'brave', 'brilliant', 'fabulous', 'great', 'capable', 'evil', 'enough', 'great', 'young', 'special', 'first', 'brilliant', 'first', 'big', 'powerful', 'complex', 'first', 'perfect', 'parallel', 'critical', 'young', 'brando', 'familiar', 'first', 'morgana', 'hapless', 'hopeless', 'great', 'new', 'new', 'dominic', 'huge', 'great', 'wonderful', 'half', 'monumental', 'good'];0.2192766686050268

126;one9eighty;"as the name would suggest, godfather part 2 is the sequel to francis ford coppola's godfather film. this film is an extreme rarity because it divides feelings; some people have suggested that this sequel is actually better than the first film (which doesn't really happen often for sequels), while other die-hard fans would argue that a sequel could never out-rate an original. godfather 2 could actually be split into 2 separate films, both showing separate events, in different times, with only a family name and blood being the connecting factor. one film is a rewind to a time already gone - a young vito corleone (the godfather in the first film - played here by robert de niro). the other film; living in the present but with stark teachings of the past coming into fruition. it's been 7 years since the events of the first film, and michael corleone (al pacino) attempts to expand and develop the family business as the head of the corleone mafia family - looking to get a toehold in las vegas and cuba. woven into this we also get to see a young vito coleone in flashbacks as he comes from sicily to america and makes a new life for himself. the film uses these two stories to show similarities and contrast between father and son, separated by 30-40 odd years. this film is a masterpiece in storytelling, expanding on a world we've been introduced to via the first film, and moving forward with sublime character development and a complete story. throw in a 'who-done-it' for michael to solve (trying to find the mole in 'the family'), as well as the stresses he has to deal with from domestic family life and there is an awful lot going on. it could probably be argued that rather than being a sequel, this is a follow on. coppola expands on the groundwork laid out in the first film - it's not a whole new adventure, more the next chapter in a story that we, the audience, have been tantalized with in the first film. like the first film, it's not just a film about crime and mafia; it's as much a film about a man's struggle to live in the world that life has dealt him. it is brilliantly climaxed as we see michael, alone in his own compound at the end of the film, like he's strapped in his own head dealing with the thoughts and plots going on - playing a mental game of chess with himself in order to stay one step ahead of his real life enemies. pacino and de niro are both fantastic in their respective roles, and the supporting cast is brilliant. there is plenty going on, and in some instances it's what you don't see which is as important as what is explained to you. i love this film, i have no issue with awarding this 10 out of 10 the same as i gave the first godfather film.";31 January 2019;10;['extreme', 'well', 'first', 'other', 'die', 'hard', 'original', 'separate', 'separate', 'different', 'young', 'first', 'other', 'stark', 'first', 'corleone', 'young', 'new', 'odd', 'first', 'sublime', 'complete', 'domestic', 'awful', 'first', 'whole', 'new', 'more', 'next', 'first', 'first', 'much', 'own', 'strapped', 'own', 'mental', 'real', 'fantastic', 'respective', 'brilliant', 'important', 'same', 'first'];0.1357174688057041

129;RonellSowes;"often this film is listed as the sequel to the godfather,which it is to an extent, but yet it also serves as a prequel. francis ford coppola blended the two storylines together as well as one could with two that are so different. however, was the vito origin story really essential ? as the film follows michael's descent into evil it cuts back to how vito became the don which feels like more of a distraction than anything. with a total runtime of two hundred and two minutes the vito storyline at forty six minutes doesn't even make up a third of the film. in those forty six very little happens and for the most part the camera just meanders around him living his poor,italian immigrant life. then on the other side there's michael. the film starts off a little while after the end of the original and michael has moved the family to lake tahoe and is now a wicked,emotionless gangster. and that's pretty much how the rest of the story is. unlike the original which has a far more structured story this one really is just scenes that observe michael's life over a period. in the beginning an attack is made on his life which he works to solve and avenge. first he tries to kill the man responsible which fails but in the process he learns that fredo was involved. it also causes one of his friends to turn on him which leads to another small series of events. and don't forget, throughout we have the young vito scenes which feel like unnecessary deleted scenes in an extended edition. although the overall constitution of this film is inferior to the previous, coppola still injects some of the style of the godfather in it. for instance, the scene in which michael presumably forgives fredo and walks out to embrace him the camera focuses on michael looking past his brother and at one of his guards who understands his order. al pacino also deserves credit as well. if there's one thing that's as consistently good as the first its pacino. he brings the same quiet,cold brooding he did before that's so full of nuance. it's hard to imagine that this subtle,hushed actor became such a ham. marlon brando as vito corleone is possibly the greatest performance in film history and they were some pretty big shoes for deniro to fill. and while that part of the film may not be good he still gives a strong performance-at least as good as someone who's name doesn't start with marlon and end with brando can. as i close out this review i might as well mention the ending scene,which i found the best in the film. michael sits down on a bench and flashes back to him waiting for his father on his birthday along with sonny,fredo,connie,tom hagen and carl.it also happened to be pearl harbor and michael announces he's enlisted in the marine corps to the anger of sonny and tom hagen's shock;fredo of course congratulates him before he's silenced by sonny. they hear vito arrive and go to greet him leaving michael thinking alone at the table and then the park bench. it's the best note in an uneven composition.";8 November 2020;7;['prequel', 'different', 'essential', 'more', 'total', 'little', 'most', 'poor', 'italian', 'other', 'little', 'original', 'wicked', 'structured', 'responsible', 'small', 'young', 'unnecessary', 'extended', 'overall', 'inferior', 'previous', 'good', 'first', 'same', 'quiet', 'cold', 'full', 'hard', 'subtle', 'great', 'big', 'good', 'strong', 'least', 'good', 'good', 'sonny', 'marine', 'sonny', 'sonny', 'good', 'uneven'];0.1049019607843137

131;khanbaliq2;i think the film is simply one of the great american films. in 1958, michael corleone (al pacino) reflects on the problems of being a mafia don, and those of his father (robert de niro) before him. the godfather part ii is one of those rare sequels that genuinely eclipses the original film - quite an achievement, in this instance. but part ii fleshes out the history of the corleone clan, showing the rise of young don vito and reflecting on the increasingly icy demeanour of his son michael as he accommodates himself to becoming a ruthless don. the scenes in sicily, beautifully shot, have a lyrical, almost edenic quality, tinged with foreboding: we all know this idyll can not last. de niro is spellbinding as young vito, while pacino almost visibly transforms himself into the man michael corleone is becoming. it's an astonishing popular masterpiece.;30 June 2010;10;['great', 'american', 'rare', 'original', 'corleone', 'young', 'icy', 'ruthless', 'lyrical', 'edenic', 'young', 'astonishing', 'popular'];0.1675
132;ivo-cobra8;"the godfather part ii (1974) is one of the best sequel's out there! following the story right from the first film! i love this film as much a is love the first one. drawing on strong performances by al pacino and robert de niro, francis ford coppola's continuation of mario puzo's mafia saga set new standards for sequels that have yet to be matched or broken. francis ford coppola's legendary continuation and sequel to his landmark 1972 film, the godfather, parallels the young vito corleone's rise with his son michael's spiritual fall, deepening the godfather's depiction of the dark side of the american dream. in the early 1900s, the child vito flees his sicilian village for america after the local mafia kills his family. vito (robert de niro) struggles to make a living, legally or illegally, for his wife and growing brood in little italy, killing the local black hand fanucci (gastone moschin) after he demands his customary cut of the tyro's business. with fanucci gone, vito's communal stature grows, but it is his family (past and present) who matters most to him -- a familial legacy then upended by michael's (al pacino) business expansion in the 1950s. now based in lake tahoe, michael conspires to make inroads in las vegas and havana pleasure industries by any means necessary. as he realizes that allies like hyman roth (lee strasberg) are trying to kill him, the increasingly paranoid michael also discovers that his ambition has crippled his marriage to kay (diane keaton) and turned his brother, fredo (john cazale), against him. barely escaping a federal indictment, michael turns his attention to dealing with his enemies, completing his own corruption. the godfather part ii presents two parallel story lines. one involves mafia chief michael corleone in 1958/1959 after the events of the first movie; the other is a series of flashbacks following his father, vito corleone from 1917 to 1925, from his youth in sicily (1901) to the founding of the corleone family in new york. al pacino as michael corleone did do a strong lead and a wonderful perfect job he acted in this film superb and strong. robert de niro as young vito corleone did a brilliant performance i have ever saw. he played an italian immigrate superb and brilliant, there isn't any connection that he is american at all, his ascent is gone. it is like he was born an italian by birth. i love this film because you get both sides of the story, because you're able to see where de niro's coming from, just seeing those guys in the movie. again, i think there's something that, when a sequel can hit it right, to keep pushing, instead of, ""let's capitalize on what we did the first time."" and for me, maybe one the first movies where i felt like, ""ooh, we're getting a backstory."" that, to me, was really thrilling. and just to see those guys, that young and hungry. that's it, that is the right thing there. coppola is at the top of his form in both films.simply as a story, the michael scenes in ""the godfather: part ii"" engage our emotions. i admire the way coppola and his co-writer mario puzo require us to think along with michael as he handles delicate decisions involving hyman roth (strasberg), the boss of miami; fredo (cazale), his older brother, and the shooting of sonny (james caan). who has done what? why? michael floats various narratives past various principals, misleading them all, or nearly. it's like a game of blindfolded chess; he has to envision the moves without seeing them. but finally it is all about michael. even the attack on the night of his son's first communion party is on his bedroom, not our bedroom. his wife, kay (keaton), leaves him, and his focus does not waver: he will keep his son. tom hagen (duvall), the most trusted confidant of father and son, considered a brother, is finally even suspected. in michael's life, paranoia is a useful defense mechanism.coppola shows michael breaking down under the pressure. we remember that he was once a proud war hero, a successful college student, building a legitimate lifestyle. but on their wedding day, kay first began to fully realize what an all-controlling cocoon the corleone clan was. there would always be things she could not be told about, could not be trusted with. finally michael has no one to tell or trust except his elderly mother (morgana king). michael's desperation in that intense conversation explains everything about the film's final shot. the early life and career of vito corleone in 1920s new york is portrayed while his son, michael, expands and tightens his grip on his crime syndicate stretching from lake tahoe, nevada to pre-revolution 1958 cuba the godfather part ii is a 1974 american epic crime film produced and directed by francis ford coppola from a screenplay co-written with mario puzo, starring al pacino and robert de niro. partially based on puzo's 1969 novel the godfather, the film is both sequel and prequel to the godfather, presenting parallel crime dramas. the most memorable best epic francis ford coppola's classic masterpiece sequel ever, the film stunned everything for brilliance to superb acting. i love this film to death, i love it!!!!! score: bad-ass seal of approval studio: paramount pictures starring: al pacino,robert duvall,diane keaton,robert de niro, talia shire, morgana king, john cazale, marianna hill, lee strasberg director: screenplay: francis ford coppola, mario puzo producer: francis ford coppola rated: r running time: 3 hrs. 22 mins. budget: $57.300.000 box office: $57.300.000";17 October 2015;9;['good', 'first', 'much', 'first', 'strong', 'new', 'legendary', 'young', 'spiritual', 'dark', 'early', 'sicilian', 'local', 'little', 'local', 'black', 'customary', 'communal', 'present', 'familial', 'necessary', 'paranoid', 'federal', 'own', 'parallel', 'first', 'other', 'corleone', 'strong', 'wonderful', 'perfect', 'strong', 'young', 'brilliant', 'italian', 'brilliant', 'american', 'italian', 'able', 'first', 'first', 'thrilling', 'young', 'hungry', 'right', 'co', 'writer', 'delicate', 'old', 'sonny', 'various', 'various', 'first', 'useful', 'proud', 'successful', 'legitimate', 'corleone', 'elderly', 'intense', 'final', 'early', 'american', 'sequel', 'prequel', 'parallel', 'memorable', 'good', 'epic', 'classic', 'bad', 'paramount'];0.2325847763347763

135;Angry_Arguer;this is when pacino still tried to be human, though right after 'serpico'. this is in his pre-depalma days. that and the plot itself are needless in this case. as with the original, crime drama plots follow similar story topics. the differences lie in the acting, editing, characters, and camera. the editing here is less refined, trying to be kubrick when this is coppola. it isn't ponderous, but it's a contradictory style--much like 'the thin red line'. the camera is the same as before, not trying to do anything we haven't seen. even frankenheimer's 'manchurian candidate' contains more visual fluency than this effort. the characters/acting are where the giant u-turn occurs this time. this has no basis on puzo's book, but is completely constructed in coppola's mind and in the actors' presentation. are these rational steps being made? most aren't. the biggest surprise--deniro as brando. in a context like this (instead of vice-versa), the range is almost unlimited. coppola is one of few directors to use brando effectively, as 'apocalypse' would prove, and here deniro does his best work. everything after this (scorsese's works, 'deer hunter', 'heat') becomes useless. in those cases he is bored. in 'untouchables' he's energetic. here--he's duplicating a master. for that reason alone you should see this. see 'apocalypse now' after this to see coppola do the real cinematic deal. final analysis = = midrange material;19 January 2004;8;['human', 'pre', 'depalma', 'needless', 'original', 'similar', 'refined', 'kubrick', 'ponderous', 'contradictory', 'thin', 'red', 'same', 'frankenheim', 'manchurian', 'more', 'visual', 'giant', 'rational', 'most', 'big', 'unlimited', 'few', 'good', 'useless', 'bored', 'energetic', 'real', 'cinematic', 'final', 'midrange'];0.0249999999999999

140;Pedro_H;"a look back and look forward at how the mafia don vito corleone gained his original power and the continuing saga of how a son (michael) chooses to drive forward the criminal empire of his late father. as the great american novel has not been written (an opinion just as popular in america as elsewhere) our cousins over the sea have no option but to over praise the work of better-than-average pulp writers. the vastly overrated ernest hemmingway, the junk master that was a peter benchley and the schlock with snobbery that is thomas harris. don't get me wrong, all very readable - but great art? great vision? something you couldn't live a full and happy life without? as the groundbreaking film maker spaniard luis bunuel once said: ""today's culture is unfortunately inseparable from economic and military power. a ruling nation can impose its culture and give a worldwide fame to a second-rate writer like hemingway. steinbeck is important due to american guns. had dos passos and faulkner been born in paraguay or in turkey, who'd read them?"" the self-opinions of mario puzo (script and book) are probably in line with the above. until he wrote the godfather he even worried about keeping food on the table. how can you consider yourself an artist when you are writing rubbish like earthquake? however, give him credit, he saw hell's kitchen for real and it shows. with the godfather saga many people mistake a heavy subject for heavy writing. however well done it is (production values are sky high and the casting is a dream) this isn't anything more than a thousand tv writers couldn't knock up. while simultaneously looking back and looking forward can be confusing (one of these things that you need to warned about) it leads you to believe that the ex don is a better person than the future don simply because he had so much pushed on to his plate and had to make tough decisions. however he kills to replace the corrupt and becomes equally corrupt himself. only on a bigger scale. men of honour is nonsense - they beat/killed, threatened and bribed. they never made any money, they simply took money. if you are interested they took just as readily from criminals (like drug dealers) as they did from honest people. while this shows power being taken at the point of a gun - where are the goons beating the grocery store owner because he wouldn't pay the protection money? such a scene would shatter this movie like it would a 1,000 foot drop would shatter a chinese ming vase. coppola doesn't like film editors - they want to cut out scenes of people looking in to the middle distance, waiting for people to arrive and generally repeating themselves. the mafia is male world and the women don't have much of a life - they don't even get to bring in cups of tea. the men are not happy people, but if they paid their electricity bills and had a hobby it would help. the moral is an obvious one - money doesn't buy happiness. but it allows you to be miserable in (long island) comfort. director coppola and writer puzo had no choice but to write this as a tragedy. they lay it on too thick though, as they are trying to bring in higher morals to a story that doesn't have it and (as i said above) it doesn't want to kick over enough rocks. this accepted the cast is amazing - robert deniro is on especially fine form - but the message(s) are uneven and dubious. all cons are full time liars and they even lie to themselves - in this little world the words mean little and we have too many of them.";10 October 2006;8;['original', 'criminal', 'late', 'great', 'american', 'popular', 'well', 'average', 'overrated', 'wrong', 'readable', 'great', 'great', 'full', 'happy', 'groundbreaking', 'inseparable', 'economic', 'military', 'worldwide', 'second', 'important', 'due', 'american', 'many', 'heavy', 'heavy', 'high', 'more', 'confusing', 'well', 'future', 'tough', 'corrupt', 'corrupt', 'big', 'interested', 'honest', 'chinese', 'ming', 'middle', 'male', 'much', 'happy', 'moral', 'obvious', 'miserable', 'long', 'thick', 'high', 'enough', 'amazing', 'fine', 'uneven', 'dubious', 'full', 'little', 'little', 'many'];0.0892403628117913

146;ofpsmith;the godfather is a fantastic movie. it's one of the most celebrated in history and it has gone down in history as one of the best films ever made. and much of that can be repeated to be said in the godfather part 2. in this film it showcases michael corleone (al pacino) as the new don of the corleone crime family. it also shows the early life of don vito corleone (robert de niro) michael's father and the celebrated godfather. michael's story involves his rise to power . vito's story involves his early start in the business after he is forced into the us from italy as a child. the two stories are told in a parallel fashion. and both of them are what makes the film great. the two stories are helped by the great acting ability from pacino and de niro both. if you liked the first one watch this one. even if you haven't seen the first one, you should still watch the godfather part 2 because it is a great movie in it's own right.;19 March 2015;10;['fantastic', 'celebrated', 'good', 'much', 'new', 'corleone', 'early', 'celebrated', 'early', 'parallel', 'great', 'great', 'first', 'first', 'great', 'own'];0.4025974025974025
147;DarthVoorhees;the godfather is one of the best films of all time,it is a dark story and is brilliantly acted and told.it excelled in character development,directing,and acting.you'd kind of find it hard to believe that a sequel could be better,but godfather ii is the superior movie.godfather ii has the stories of the rise of young don vito corleone in the 1910's/1920's and the moral fall of his son michael corleone in the late 1950's.by the end of the original godfather you thought michael sank to the lowest he could be.here he was a good hearted guy,he just returned from world war ii,and he had plans to marry his girlfriend kay,but through the film he declines into a monster worse than his father.don vito was an interesting character,he was no doubt evil,but you could tell he had a big heart.coppola introduced a really great way to tell a story on film,you see michael and don vito at the same ages in their lives,you see how the two corleone generations differed,how one failed,and the other prevailed.don vito is played excellently by robert deniro.this is definitely one of deniro's best performances.don vito speaks in italian most of the film with subtitles,so deniro had to do a lot of work with his face,look,and posture.its one thing to excel at giving lines,but deniro excels at both verbal acting and non-verbal acting.deniro's vito isn't like the brando one at all,he's quieter,and sadder,but really you don't want them to be clones all good prequels set-up their character to become the character they are in the sequel movie.the best acting of the film though has to be that of al pacino as don michael corleone,he has changed for the worst between movies,in the first movie he ordered killings to get more business,in part ii he orders them to get even.his wife kay who stood by him through out all of his evil deeds in the original is loosing faith that michael is sane.even michael's good friend tom hagen(played brilliantly again by robert duval) tells michael he's won,and its over.michael even gets to the point where he kills his own brother fredo. coppola makes godfather ii a lot darker than the original.the film feels more evil.pacino gives arguably the finest performance of his career,his michael is downright evil.pacino has been able to create a character you know is dark,evil,and sinister.he's established a look for michael.when pacino's michael has eyes of fire you know he's angry.for those who thought the original godfather glamorized the mafia,you have to take a look at godfather ii,you cringe at what happens.better than the original and arguably one of the best films ever made. (personal note)i don't really think a 3rd godfather film was necessary,you didn't need to see michael physically die,he was dead mentally by the end of ii. a very very high 10/10;10 April 2005;10;['good', 'dark', 'hard', 'well', 'superior', 'young', 'moral', 'late', 'original', 'low', 'good', 'hearted', 'bad', 'interesting', 'evil', 'big', 'great', 'same', 'corleone', 'other', 'good', 'italian', 'most', 'verbal', 'non', 'verbal', 'sad', 'good', 'good', 'bad', 'first', 'more', 'evil', 'original', 'good', 'own', 'dark', 'more', 'fine', 'able', 'dark', 'evil', 'original', 'original', 'good', 'personal', 'necessary', 'dead', 'high'];0.1316279069767441

149;Christian_Dimartino;francis ford coppola won three oscars for his work on the 1974 film the godfather part ii, the rare sequel that outdoes the original. the original was a masterpiece, and everyone knew it. and i must say that it is pretty difficult to outdo a masterpiece. but coppola and his screenwriter mario puzo really knock it out of the park the second time. the godfather part ii tells two stories this time: one is of michael corleone (al pacino) who now has a family with his wife kay (diane keaton), but really nobody, including his sister connie (talia shire) loves him because he has let the power go to his head. after an assassination attempt, michael goes on the hunt for the bastard who tried to kill him. the second story is the back story of vito corleone (robert de niro), whose family was murdered when he was a boy, and basically he too is seeking vengeance. what i love about the godfather part ii, besides the fact that it tells two stories, is that it covers the ground that the original film did, but this one digs deeper. the first film mainly focused on family and betrayal. this one focuses on betrayal in the family, which makes for a much juicier and shocking story. the godfather part ii is a stunner, mainly because you never know where it's going to go, or how it's going to get there. the sequel is more interesting than its predecessor. this one feels a little more like a thriller. pacino gives one of his best performances here. here he plays such a complex character. you know that he never wanted any of this, and it is terrible just to see how far he will take it. what started off as a nice man slowly turns into a monster, and that is sort of what keeps the film afloat. the godfather trilogy is a special one, and this one is the main reason why. this film is a masterpiece, and it is no wonder that it became the first sequel ever to win best picture. it is a difficult decision, because i really do love the first one. but this is a much more interesting and fascinating film than the original. either way, they are both very amazing movies. i don't know when francis ford coppola will make another movie. but what i do know is that he won't be able to make another one like this again. a+;24 June 2013;10;['rare', 'original', 'difficult', 'second', 'second', 'back', 'original', 'first', 'much', 'shocking', 'interesting', 'little', 'more', 'good', 'complex', 'terrible', 'nice', 'special', 'main', 'first', 'good', 'difficult', 'first', 'interesting', 'fascinating', 'original', 'amazing', 'able'];0.1670855379188712

158;RossRivero99;"even though ""the godfather: part ii"" isn't as good as the first ""godfather movie it is still one of the best mo movies ever made and is probably one of the best movie sequels ever done in all of movie history. the movie shifts back between the present day in the past but in the present the movie picks up where the first movie left off with michael corleone (al pacino) in charge of the corleone crime family while still having his family members along with him, his step brother tom hagen (robert duvall), his older brother fredo (john cazale), as well as his younger sister connie (talia shire). also a new change was that he is married to his girlfriend kay (diane keaton) and had two children. unlike most directors who have directed mob movies in the past coppola shows a different side to the people in the mob than others like michael curtiz or martin scorsese who have also directed masterful mob movies, but the only difference is that coppola shows a more dramatic side as well as curtiz, but scorsese shows a much grittier and evil side. the flashbacks in the movie talk about the early life and the immigration to america of none other than michael's father vito corleone (robert de niro, whose dialogue is all italian.) this movie isn't like any other sequel in any other franchise that i've ever seen because most franchises are for action/adventure type movies, but the godfather series is the only popular crime franchise. however like the first godfather movie this one is nearly as flawless as this one with a great story, great cast, excellent and very effective dialogue co-written by francis ford coppola and mario puzo (who also wrote the novel), as well as excellent performances throughout. in this review i'll try not to spoil anything but some of the most effective scenes in the movie are where kay divorces michael, vito exacts his revenge on the man who did his family harm, and where michael doesn't love fredo anymore. this was a great movie and it makes me much more eager to see part 3. even though there were other great films in 1974 such as roman polanski's ""chinatown"", and ""the conversation"" which coppola also directed, but this one tops them all. in other words, this is the best movie of 1974.";12 April 2017;10;['good', 'first', 'good', 'mo', 'good', 'present', 'present', 'first', 'corleone', 'old', 'young', 'new', 'married', 'most', 'past', 'different', 'masterful', 'only', 'dramatic', 'gritty', 'evil', 'early', 'other', 'italian', 'other', 'other', 'most', 'only', 'popular', 'first', 'flawless', 'great', 'great', 'excellent', 'effective', 'excellent', 'effective', 'great', 'eager', 'other', 'great', 'such', 'roman', 'other', 'good'];0.2909275683665927

160;Aylmer;"as far as sequels go, this often gets trotted out as one of the best. personally i prefer even part iii to part ii for not being as obtuse and slow-going. i also didn't care for the constant cutting back and forth from the more interesting 1950's cuba / political corruption / rival gang story to the 1900's vito corleone origin story. it just felt like the film was a little too bloated for sake of completeness where some judicious cutting and a couple more shootouts would have helped keep things moving. added to that, it's extremely talky with scene upon scene of pacino meeting with people in dark rooms, trading lines and brooding stares. it's also a bit confusing with pacino playing so many characters off each other at the start, making you wonder if he's telling anyone the truth or lying to everyone. this only becomes clear(er) with the big kiss. that said, the film is an emotional roller coaster in a way that the other two films are not. it takes pacino's michael corleone into all new realms where he is easy to root for in some scenes and easy to hate in others, yet all the while mesmerizing to watch. his relationships with his wife, his lawyer, and his brother all come off as multi-layered, complex, and somewhat relatable. for those of us who loved the godfather, which in my opinion is one of the top 5 greatest gangster films ever made, this film serves as a solid companion piece and exploration of ""what happened next"" without besmirching the original's legacy. it's high on dialog and low on action and murders, so while not my favorite of the bunch i'll still certainly recommend it. love it or hate it, this film is meticulously crafted in a way that any other sequel would dream to be. though not quite as efficient and iconic as its predecessor, it has many moments that come close.";12 February 2022;8;['good', 'obtuse', 'constant', 'interesting', 'political', 'rival', 'corleone', 'little', 'bloated', 'judicious', 'more', 'talky', 'dark', 'confusing', 'many', 'other', 'big', 'emotional', 'other', 'new', 'easy', 'easy', 'multi', 'layered', 'complex', 'relatable', 'top', 'great', 'solid', 'original', 'high', 'low', 'other', 'efficient', 'iconic', 'many', 'close'];0.1817511655011655

164;Rickting;the godfather is one of the best films ever, so what can we expect when a follow up is attempted? a contender for the best sequel ever of course. this has 2 parallel time lines: flashbacks showing the young vito corleone rising to power and the continuation of the first film showing michael corleone handling both business matters and his personal life. it shouldn't have been as good as it is, but it knocks most sequels ever made into a bin liner. it's not quite as brilliant as some say it is. it's a bit too sprawling and tries to pack too much in. while the length in the first was excessive but just bearable, the second one has a bit too much. it can be a bit confusing and dips, but rarely. otherwise, this sequel has it all: amazing acting from everyone, even better direction from francis ford coppola than the first and a powerful, moving screenplay. the final hour of the film is perfection and the last shot of michael sitting alone in isolation, having lost everyone, has more emotional power than most films would squeeze into a ten minute monologue. al pacino gives one of the best movie performances of all time and it is a total outrage that he wasn't nominated for an oscar. everyone else is great. although the script is a bit sprawling, it gets a lot done and is very powerful. many of the scenes of assassinations are suspenseful and at times genuinely heart breaking. i didn't understand what was so great about robert de niro's performance, but you can certainly see marlon brando in his acting. coppola's direction is less subtle this time and he shows even more of his directional brilliance. some of the scenes, visually, and utterly phenomenal. it's darker, raises the stakes and expands the story like a sequel should. it's a moving, sobering story about power and how corrupting it is. in terms of sequels we could hardly have asked for a better follow up. aside from the excessive length and the fact that it makes the memory of al pacino humiliating himself in jack & jill even more painful, this is a sublime sequel and one which set the bench marks for all other sequels. 9/10;14 November 2014;9;['good', 'good', 'parallel', 'young', 'first', 'personal', 'good', 'most', 'brilliant', 'first', 'excessive', 'bearable', 'second', 'much', 'confusing', 'amazing', 'well', 'first', 'powerful', 'final', 'last', 'emotional', 'most', 'good', 'total', 'great', 'sprawling', 'powerful', 'many', 'suspenseful', 'great', 'subtle', 'more', 'directional', 'phenomenal', 'dark', 'well', 'excessive', 'painful', 'sublime', 'other'];0.2276960784313726

170;richieandsam;the godfather part ii this was a good sequel... i can understand why there is a lot of debate over which movie is better, part 1 or 2. personally i am sitting on the fence. part 1 was a good film... i enjoyed it as you can read below... but part 2 was a better story. this film has 2 stories in it... the rise of michael corleone as the new mafia boss, and the other story is about don vito corleone when he was young making his rise as the godfather. the casting as before was brilliant. al pacino returned as michael, and he played the part really well. robert deniro played his father (a younger version) don vito corleone. deniro was a fantastic choice to play the godfather... he looked the part. i could imagine deniro growing old to look like marlon brando. excellent stories. again though, it was pretty slow paced during parts of the movie... it is such a long film. i don't think it needs to be that long. i know i say that a lot about films, but it's how i fell. i don't think that about all long movies... there are some movies that i love that are over 3 hours long... but these films felt long. it probably didn't help that i had to keep pausing this movie all the way through. i actually watched it in 2 halves because it was taking me so long. i will give this film a 7 out of 10... i know i gave part 1 the same mark, but they are 2 completely different films. great story! for more of my reviews, please like my facebook page: http://www.facebook.com/pages/ordinary-person-movie- reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl;25 January 2013;7;['good', 'well', 'good', 'well', 'new', 'other', 'young', 'brilliant', 'young', 'fantastic', 'old', 'excellent', 'long', 'long', 'long', 'long', 'same', 'different', 'great', 'more'];0.2839646464646465
171;SKG-2;"as i've said before, i really hate sequels. technically, this may not strictly be a sequel (since half of this, the flashback half, was in the original novel), but what the hell; this is the rare sequel which is not only great, but improves on the original. if you held a gun to my head and asked me what my favorite movie was of all time, this would be the one. though i disagree with coppola, who felt he romanticized the corleones in part i, without that feeling, there would have been no part ii, and we must thank him for that. the way time passes from present to pass effortlessly, the way we see how past affects present, the way the story of michael corleone achieves the level of greek tragedy, the direction, the performances, the score, everything comes together even deeper than in the first one. but the primary reason to see this is al pacino. it is my humble opinion that not only is this the best of his five great performances from 1972-75 (the others being the godfather, scarecrow, serpico, and dog day afternoon), it is the greatest performance by an actor i have ever seen, period (liv ullman's performance in persona is the best performance by an actress i have seen). michael corleone becomes more closed off as he achieves power. he alienates friends, family, even the people who work for him, because he completely closes himself off from humanity. yet we feel for him, partly because pacino never plays for our sympathy, but gives a closed performance. it's easy to overact, it's hard to play still and close to the vest, and pacino chooses the more difficult path. we also feel for him because we can sense michael acts this way because it's the only way he feels he can run things. if he ever came out of his detachment, he'd have to admit he was a failure and was being immoral(which he does in part iii). a masterpiece.";5 March 1999;10;['original', 'rare', 'great', 'original', 'favorite', 'present', 'deep', 'first', 'primary', 'humble', 'good', 'great', 'great', 'good', 'closed', 'easy', 'hard', 'difficult', 'only'];0.2811403508771929

174;lagudafuad;"the godfather part ii stands among and will be seen as one of the best sequels out there thanks to the wonderful pairing of two fine actors with al pacino as michael coeleone, putting up such masterful display of acting that makes you want to hail him from the screen as ""the godfather"" and the other actor that was exceptional was robert de niro who played young vito corleone. the movie casting is one that will remain in the mind of film watchers for a long time. the film depicts the different paths in which the corleone family took, as vito took the high road of peace during his regime; michael took the path of violence and taking all his enemies out the moment they show their face, to the point that no matter whom there were, friend or family you cross michael you are dead. partially based on mario puzo's 1969 novel, the godfather, this 1974 sequel is in part both a sequel and a prequel to the godfather movie released in 1972. the movie features two parallel dramas, one focusing on michael corleone's reign and him trying to gain control of the family business, the other story is based on flash backs of how vito corleone (robert de niro), rose from his childhood in sicily italy in 1901 to his coming to america and the founding of the corleone family. the plot shows how michael was looking into expanding his family business to las vegas and cuba. during the process, an attempt on his life was made, and the person behind it was someone close to him, this led to michael taking out more people. michael's ruthless behaviour affected his family and trusted friends. being the first film to have part ii in its name, the godfather part ii was a box office success and it received critical acclaim as one of the best films ever made. the production had some production problems initially when pacino not wanting to be part of it because he felt the script wasn't ok enough, so coppola had to re-write it, before pacino came on board. the american film institute's 10th anniversary of greatest films has the movie rated number 32, and its ranked 3rd in imdb's top 100 movies of all time, with its predecessor the godfather ranked 2nd. it also got 11 academy awards nominations and it won best picture for that year. out of the 11 nominations it won six oscars which included best director for francis ford coppola, best supporting actor for robert de niro and best adapted screenplay for coppola and puzo. al pacino got a nomination for best actor but didn't win although in the bafta award he won the best actor award for the film. the godfather part ii is a classic sequel to one of the best films ever made, so there is no need to see the first if you are not planning of crowning it with the second. www.lagsreviews.com";25 November 2012;9;['good', 'wonderful', 'fine', 'such', 'masterful', 'other', 'exceptional', 'young', 'long', 'different', 'corleone', 'high', 'dead', 'prequel', 'parallel', 'other', 'corleone', 'close', 'more', 'ruthless', 'first', 'critical', 'good', 'ok', 'great', 'top', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'classic', 'good', 'first', 'second'];0.3358064516129032
175;pfgpowell-1;what exactly are we talking about when we amateur critics write these reviews? what exactly is 'a film'? certainly it is more than technical ability. it is more than just the acting, or the directing, or the story. it is everything which makes up that film. so the godfather ii (as did the first the godfather) presents us all with something of a dilemma. it was made in the early seventies when, possibly, the public, though not the police and the fbi, were largely unaware of the reality of the mafia. the yellow press (called the red tops here in the uk) gave them unlimited publicity, and even when we were shown pictures of the bullet-riddled bodies of bosses lying outside barbershops and restaurants, there was a certain thrill about it all. then came the sopranos, whose central conceit of a mafia head of a family suffering from panic attacks was more or less the keynote to a certain disrespect of the whole shooting match, and the public's view is different. we now see the mafia for what it they are: nasty, brutish, cynical, heartless, sadistic thugs with, it would seem, no redeeming features. forget all that talk of 'honour' and 'loyalty', these men, and the women who tolerated their brutality and were quite happy to live off its proceeds, were and are scum. so what to make of films such as the godfather series? they are extremely well-made, well-written, well-directed, well-acted, well-designed and they stand head and shoulders above their peers. but in an odd sort of way, these films are thoroughly devalued by the central lie they tell. vito corleone and his son michael are portrayed as honourable men, wise men, men to be admired. they are almost portrayed, in their convoluted heroism, as honest men. but they are nothing of the kind. they are brutal and murderous and do not deserve to be admired. the men in the sopranos apparently came far closer to portraying the real mafiosi. indeed real mafiosi are widely quoted as saying as much. so why did coppola choose to present them as something close to heroes? and that brings me back to my first question and the very real dilemma faced by someone making a judgement of these very well-made films: as the portrayal of what is basically scum as honourable men is so central to coppola's films, where does that leave the films? i really have no answer. as a piece of entertainment, of course, the godfather films are superb. but once you consider the wider context, the butchery, the misery, the killing, the heroin dealing, the pimping, the whoring, you do have to wonder. as film-making this would get 8/9 our of 10. but given the corrupt moral ambiguity at its centre, only a 5.;1 June 2009;5;['more', 'technical', 'more', 'first', 'early', 'unaware', 'yellow', 'red', 'unlimited', 'certain', 'central', 'certain', 'whole', 'different', 'nasty', 'brutish', 'cynical', 'heartless', 'sadistic', 'happy', 'such', 'odd', 'central', 'honourable', 'wise', 'convoluted', 'honest', 'brutal', 'murderous', 'real', 'real', 'much', 'close', 'first', 'real', 'honourable', 'central', 'superb', 'wide', 'corrupt', 'moral'];0.0862301587301587

177;Darkjak007;the godfather: part ii one of the most critically acclaimed sequel of all time to think that the concept of a sequel being to anything is has always been a bizarre concept, but to not only be recognized as one the best sequel ever, but to even to top the original is a master accomplishment even for back then. the godfather part ii countuite the story of the corleone family. as michael corleone( al pacino) try to expanded his family empire only to come to gripes that hardship of what it really means to be the godfather., while the other half of the film as he reflects we see the life and coming of age of his father vito(robert de niro) as a criminal. the first movie became a sensation for its gripping story telling and very romantic yet realistic tone. it's sequel captures all that in every way as michael evolution and complexity of his character descend deeper. al pacino really captured the essence of this man you has descend deep in this dehumanizing manner here it's completely shows that this is not at all the same you knew from the first film. he a completely different person and who reach that point where he will make those unforgiven decisions. you see how he he sort of reach that point with his business and his family. the scene of his father serve as a way a self reflection in a way. how would my father deal with this? he doesn't have that same tier status as his old man did. he's not as respected and feared the same way. as for vito scenes they were a excellent touches to not only michael's character, but also vito. where's the first film while marlon brando killed his role and made don corleone iconic. the first film you didn't really know anything about him, but he still had the honorable crime lord feeling to him. here you actually do get some pieces of what the kind of man he was in his youth and they also a relevant with michael journey. not much to say about de niro he was perfect casting having the voice and mannerism down of brando it felt believable that this it the same man in his youth. the tone is still dramatic and investing with death, scandal and betrayal. nino rota returned again for the soundtrack and it's just as somber and classy as the first and accompany the scene lighting and tone nicely.;25 March 2022;9;['bizarre', 'good', 'corleone', 'other', 'first', 'gripping', 'romantic', 'realistic', 'dehumanizing', 'same', 'first', 'different', 'unforgiven', 'same', 'old', 'same', 'excellent', 'first', 'first', 'honorable', 'relevant', 'much', 'perfect', 'believable', 'same', 'dramatic', 'somber', 'classy', 'first'];0.2416666666666666

182;dead47548;keeps the authentic, beautiful and rich feeling of the first film, while adding a level of intensity and interest throughout. the idea of producing parallel stories depicting the rise of a young vito corleone (played to perfection by robert de niro) and the loneliness and betrayal of michael corleone (the subtle and frighteningly intense al pacino) was a brilliant one. however, this is where the majority of the film's flaws lie. in creating these two separate stories, they made one much more interesting than the other. when watching the slow turn of paranoia and danger in michael's life, all i can manage to think about is what will happen next in vito corleone's rise to becoming the godfather. either way, these are two of the strongest and most complex characters of all time. vito loses his father, brother and mother to the same man who he luckily escapes from. he gains a family and rises to power, murdering another don in the process in one of the most intensely suspenseful scenes of all time, and returns to confront this now bitter and alone man. the death of don ciccio is one of the strongest scenes of the film, and certainly portrays how much more brilliant de niro is when he's playing quiet strength instead of shouting at the top of his lungs. in the late don ciccio, we also see a parallel to the story of michael corleone throughout the film. a man who is simply trying to keep his family in tact, while remaining at the same level of respect and power as his late father. instead, he falls into a world of betrayal on all fronts and the constant paranoia of being at the top of the food chain. he begins to feel as though he is the strongest man, waiting for the inevitable opportunity for another to bring him to the grave (just like what vito had previously done many years ago). this leads to a life of utter alienation, even from his family. three images in this film portray the most sympathetic form of isolation in cinematic history (michael looking out the window as fredo sails away, michael sitting in the park bench alone at the end, and michael sitting alone at the dinner table while everyone else joyously surprises vito on his birthday). we see the loneliness and rejection of a man who lives his life for his family, but eventually loses them all. the final dinner scene has so much complexity it left me stunned well after the credits rolled. definitely a film that has earned it's iconic status, featuring two performances that rightfully lit the fuel for the two most acclaimed careers the film industry has ever seen.;9 January 2008;9;['authentic', 'beautiful', 'rich', 'first', 'parallel', 'young', 'subtle', 'intense', 'brilliant', 'separate', 'interesting', 'other', 'slow', 'strong', 'complex', 'same', 'suspenseful', 'bitter', 'alone', 'strong', 'brilliant', 'quiet', 'late', 'same', 'late', 'constant', 'strong', 'inevitable', 'many', 'utter', 'sympathetic', 'cinematic', 'alone', 'final', 'much', 'stunned', 'iconic'];0.1762626262626263
183;malkane316;again, what can be said that hasn't already been said? the acting and direction are flawless, and we get a clearer view of the family and their background. i've never felt de niro's performance was oscar winning because his part in the movie simply isn't big enough, but he should easily have won several others for other performances over the years. if anything, the plot is more complex and involving than the first film. pacino's change from the first film is revolutionary, and cazale is perfect as the unfortunate fredo, and the rest of the massive cast are excellent. don fanucci is a great addition to the story, and has my favourite line-'just enough to wet my beak'. 10 out of 10;11 November 2004;10;['flawless', 'clear', 'big', 'several', 'other', 'complex', 'first', 'first', 'revolutionary', 'perfect', 'unfortunate', 'massive', 'excellent', 'great', 'favourite'];0.2673076923076923
184;TheHonestCritic;"""the godfather: part ii"" (1974), whenever i think of great movie sequels, this film always comes to mind, every time. not only is it just as good as the first godfather movie, it's even better in some aspects! it's tied with the first one as one of my top ten all-time favorite gangster films and it's also one of my top ten all-time favorite movie sequels. the crazy thing is, not too many sequels can hold a candle to the first film. but, ""the godfather: part ii"" is the epitome of a sequel done right. it has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and also a perfect soundtrack to tie it together. the plot for this one is a little different in terms of layout compared to the first movie. for those who think it's a continuation of the story, yes, it is that. but, it's also a prequel at the same time. in this film, we see a young vito corleone's rise to power, along with michael corleone's rise to power. now, that plot line has been done before in other movies. some do it well and some don't. granted, a story like that can become convoluted if it's not executed properly. that being said, ""the godfather: part ii"" does it seamlessly and it all ties together in the end. since it's a prequel and a sequel all at the same time, you're essentially watching two different movies for the price of one! they could've very easily split these two coinciding plots into their own individual films. but, they took a risk and spliced them both together, which was a huge gamble that definitely paid off. the runtime is 200 minutes in length and that could very possibly draw people away from watching it. that being said, the film makers utilized every single one of those minutes to perfection. there is always something going on and it keeps you hooked all the way from beginning to end. it's probably the fastest 200 minute movie you will ever see. seriously, you blink and it's over! plus, for a complex plot such as this, the long runtime is crucial for showcasing the story and not one of those 200 minutes are wasted. all of the acting is top-notch once again, from every cast member! the lineup of actors and actresses is absolutely insane. you have: al pacino, robert duvall, robert de niro, diane keaton, john cazale, talia shire and so much more. what a cast! one thing i was a bit worried about when i first saw this film, was the fact that marlon brando wasn't in it at all. he was fantastic in the first one! instead, vito corleone was played by robert de niro. his portrayal of vito corleone was sublime, he really nailed the character! so much so, that you won't miss marlon brando's presence on the screen. all of the performances from the whole cast is perfect, but, my personal favorite character portrayal in this movie is robert de niro's performance as vito corleone, with al pacino's portrayal of michael corleone as a very close second. this film has some of the best acting i've ever seen in any movie! they all nail their performances flawlessly and the chemistry between each one of them is nothing short of impeccable. all of the sets/locations are breathtaking and give the film a stunning atmosphere. as far as the special effects go, they are all perfect and still hold up to this day. finally, the soundtrack once again composed by nino rota, is a masterpiece. his film score sets the perfect tone and it helps tie everything together. ""the godfather: part ii"" is a home run in the aspect of sequels, and especially crime/gangster films. it may not be my favorite crime/gangster movie, but it's definitely somewhere in my top five! i'm giving this film 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 imdb stars. if you haven't seen ""the godfather: part ii"", what are you waiting for? go see it today! i guarantee that you'll love it, especially if you enjoy the first movie as much as i do. the film makers have managed to make lighting strike twice with this flawless sequel. if you don't see it, then michael corleone might mark you as a traitor!";16 August 2021;10;['great', 'good', 'first', 'well', 'first', 'top', 'favorite', 'top', 'favorite', 'crazy', 'many', 'first', 'perfect', 'perfect', 'perfect', 'perfect', 'special', 'perfect', 'little', 'different', 'first', 'prequel', 'same', 'young', 'other', 'convoluted', 'prequel', 'same', 'different', 'own', 'individual', 'huge', 'single', 'fast', 'complex', 'such', 'long', 'crucial', 'top', 'insane', 'more', 'worried', 'fantastic', 'first', 'sublime', 'whole', 'perfect', 'personal', 'favorite', 'close', 'good', 'short', 'impeccable', 'stunning', 'special', 'perfect', 'perfect', 'favorite', 'top', 'first', 'flawless'];0.3561177248677248

188;theshadow908;the godfather part ii is a complicated film. in its 3 hour run time it manages to pull off telling two stories. one that takes place in the 1950s, and one that takes place in the 1920s. in the 1920s we see vito corleone arriving in new york city and making a name for himself among the wealthy gangsters, starting a family, and eventually becoming don of the corleone crime family. the exact parallel is the 1950s story, where we see vito's son michael in his new role as don of the corleone family as he starts his own family. the godfather part ii is a superior film to the original because it tells a much more interesting story, and it does a better job at portraying what an organized crime family is really like. all of the great actors from the original are back including james caan in a flashback sequence. al pacino comes across as a great bad guy, and he seems to be ten times more cold hearted than his father ever was. he's a changed man. he started off a legitimate man who wanted nothing to do with his family's business, but now he's more into it than ever before. this movie features al pacino's second best performance in a film (second to dog day afternoon), and it shows what kind of actor he truly is. this is the film that made robert de niro a star, and rightly so. robert de niro portrays young vito corleone on his rise to power in new york. this is robert de niro's first big role and he plays it like he's been doing it for years. the best thing about it is that just about every line of his dialogue is in italian, and yet you still enjoy his performance. the godfather part ii contains the most realistic view of the mafia ever portrayed in film. in fact it's so realistic that the central characters don't even refer to it as the mafia. the godfather part ii tells a more interesting story than the original, and it's more fun to sit through. the godfather part ii is a great film that is both dramatic and epic as well as entertaining. great movie. 9/10;29 May 2006;9;['complicated', 'wealthy', 'corleone', 'exact', 'new', 'corleone', 'own', 'superior', 'original', 'interesting', 'well', 'organized', 'like', 'great', 'original', 'great', 'bad', 'cold', 'legitimate', 'more', 'second', 'good', 'second', 'young', 'first', 'big', 'good', 'italian', 'realistic', 'realistic', 'central', 'interesting', 'original', 'more', 'great', 'dramatic', 'epic', 'entertaining', 'great'];0.2715564738292011

195;jcbutthead86;the godfather part ii is not only one of the greatest films ever mad but is also the greatest sequel of all-time that is an excellent,brilliant and unforgettable masterpiece that combines amazing direction,terrific acting from a great cast,a wonderful script and a haunting score. all of those elements make the godfather part ii film making and francis coppola at their best. set in las vegas,nevada in the 1950s and in new york city in the 1910s and 20s,the godfather part ii tells two parallel rise and fall stories. the rise story depicts the rise of young vito corleone(robert de niro),showing vito as an italian immigrant who gets into a life of crime and becomes a don. the fall is the story of michael corleone(al pacino)who is still running the corleone family in las vegas but has to deal with betrayal and the family falling apart. the godfather part ii is simply a masterpiece of cinema and is the greatest and most ambitious sequel of all-time that is not only an instant classic from the moment you watch it but also an amazing and powerful follow-up to the original giving viewers not only a great continuation of the godfather saga but giving viewers the sequel to end all movie sequels. i won't say which film is better because in my opinion saying part i or part ii is better than one another would be disrespectful to the two films because both are works of art. with the godfather part ii director francis ford coppola has created not only created just a sequel but a film that is more epic with a bigger and larger scope than the first film giving viewers a powerful experience that never lets you go from the opening frame. with the godfather part ii viewers are not just given a movie about the mob,gangsters or the crime world but a movie about the on going tragedy,sadness and doom that hangs over the corleone family while showing the rise of a young vito corleone. this film is probably more darker than the first film because when we see the fall of michael corleone and the rest of the corleone family is almost like the fall of the roman empire. unlike most sequels the godfather part ii doesn't make the same story like the original but gives us something new and fresh with a great tale that is on par with the first film. the godfather part ii is an epic film in the truest sense of the word not just in the way it's film but the length of the film(at 3 hrs and 20 minutes)but the film moves by seamlessly that you forget you are watching a three and half hour film. i think the film moves at a fast pace is because of the amazing storytelling that coppola does with the film giving the movie a nonlinear style with the movie moving back and forth with the time periods but never getting lost in the narrative. in gfii we are given two tales about michael's downfall and young vito's rise. michael,while still a don and running the corleone family has become more ruthless and colder then he was in the first film further isolating himself from his other family members and becoming less trusting with the people all around him whether it's business associates or family where everyone was his enemy which leads to michael's tragic fall. in contrast we see a young vito corleone,a man who is about business but is also about his family and friends despite being in the violent world of the mob and vito handles things with calm and cool style. when we see michael and vito the lighting is different with michael constantly being surrounded by darkness and vito is surrounded in bright light showing the contrast in atmosphere. with michael and vito we see how complex and different they are not just as dons but as people. the screenplay by francis coppola and mario puzo is outstanding with scenes and dialog that is memorable and on par with the first film. while gfii isn't as violent or bloody as the original and doesn't have a huge body count gfii still has a few violent scenes that done with attention to detail and build-up. the ending of the godfather part ii is one of the best endings in movie history because it's sad,tragic and somber matching the dark tone of the rest of the movie and the ending will punch you in the gut. a powerful ending. the cast is perfect. al pacino is excellent,powerful and at his best as michael corleone,with pacino being cold,intense and ruthless in the performance. robert de niro is brilliant in his oscar winning role as young vito corleone,with de niro being cool and charismatic. robert duvall is wonderful once again as tom hagen,the corleone's lawyer. john cazale is amazing as fredo corleone,michael's dim-witted older brother. diane keaton is outstanding as kay,michael's suffering wife. talia shire is sensational as connie corleone,michael's sister. lee strasberg is terrific as hyman roth,an old time gangster and associate of the corleone's. michael v. gazzo is captivating as frank pentangelli,a member of the corleone family. bruno kurby and john aprea are great young clemenza and young tesso. g.d sparadin(senator pat geary),dominic chianese(johnny ola),frank sivero(genco)and richard bright(al neri)give great performances as well. the direction by francis ford coppola is amazing and stylish,with coppola bringing a beautiful and haunting visual style to the film. terrific direction,coppola. the score by nino rota is outstanding,powerful,haunting and beautiful matching the main scenes in the film. great score,rota. in final word,if you love francis coppola,gangster films,mob movies,the first godfather or movies in general,i highly suggest you see the godfather part ii,an excellent,brilliant and unforgettable masterpiece of cinema and is one of the greatest films and sequels of all-time and is a movie that you will watch again and again. highly recommended. 10/10.;31 March 2014;10;['great', 'mad', 'great', 'excellent', 'brilliant', 'unforgettable', 'amazing', 'terrific', 'great', 'wonderful',

198;GeorgeRoots;"mario puzo's epic ""the godfather"" novel, has gone on to set high standards in both literature and cinema. considering how the first one had managed to encapsulate so very well it's ""welcome to the family"" ideology. it gives the sequel a chance to now stand on its own two feet, without the necessities of an origin story. well it actually turns out we need those origin chapters more than ever. we are shown the past of how vito corleone, became the don, in contrast of his son micheal (al pacino). usually watching any flashback sequence in a movie feels so hard for me to get into, it happens so abruptly it feels less like an aid to the story but more of a throw in. francis ford coppola's execution is genius, because watching vito's upbringing is shown and depicted perfectly with the ""sepia"" feel, murky streets of little italy and a oscar winning performance from a then unknown robert de niro. seeing this perfectly executed with michael's story in comparison, it just instantly draws us in so well there's not many other films that do it this well. following the ""current events"" of the movie. michael is slowly growing distant from the family, and ultimately paranoia is settling in without help from the older, weaker brother fredo (a truly incredible performance from the late john cazale). by the time things escalate towards the end of the film, the family is ultimately destroyed. michael has officially isolated himself from both his own family and the other families, leaving him quiet and reminiscing. it is here we ask: ""do we see micheal as a man with a blood lust, or a tragic soul""? your choice. ""the godfather part ii"" is a stunning sequel, feeling more like a 7 hour long epic rather than a trilogy. but if you loved the first movie, i would not be hesitant to watch this one. it is one of coppola's finest pieces of writing and cinematography . final verdict: the american dream is continuously turned on its head, in this more than perfect sequel. 10/10.";30 August 2014;10;['epic', 'high', 'first', 'welcome', 'own', 'more', 'corleone', 'more', 'murky', 'little', 'oscar', 'unknown', 'many', 'other', 'current', 'distant', 'old', 'weak', 'incredible', 'late', 'own', 'other', 'quiet', 'tragic', 'stunning', 'more', 'long', 'epic', 'first', 'hesitant', 'fine', 'final', 'american', 'more', 'perfect'];0.1988440860215054

204;jamesjustice-92;"i never liked and never fancied sequels. i simply hate the whole concept of a continuation story - if it was the whole and complete body of work why would it need any additions? i always said, unless the sequel is bigger, better and brings something new and fresh it can be considered as such. there are not many thoroughly well done second parts, you can literally count them all down with fingers of one person's hands, and one of those is naturally ""the godfather part ii"". as with the first movie the second follows two people - vito, from his youth years to his greatest successes, and michael, continuing his story of self-exploration, vengeances, trials, tribulations and family matters. what i disliked though that there was way more time devoted to michael instead of dividing their screen time with vito equally because i felt that his story was more interesting and intriguing than that of michael's. vito was the man who built himself from scratch and surrounded himself with love and adoration from almost everybody who knew him well whereas michael took over whatever was left from that adoration and love but perverted it and unknowingly for himself turned it into almost unanimous hate. the picture shows this contrast between the rise of vito and personal demise of michael very clearly with the help of its amazing cinematography. part ii has won six oscars, winning yet again the best picture, giving the much deserved statuette to francis ford coppola for his remarkable direction and to robert deniro for his phenomenal portrayal of vito - he certainly based his version of him on marlon brando's but gave him his own vibe and touch which made this character so extraordinary. i would also like to point out diane keaton and john cazale whose both characters have gotten more screen time in the sequel to fully blossom and shine and they did the job splendidly. al pacino was somewhat stale in his performance, and so was the whole story in general, in my opinion, but by the end of it his michael has grown into a more vivid person than ever which makes ""the godfather part ii"" so great as a standalone movie and a near perfection as a sequel.";29 January 2021;9;['whole', 'whole', 'complete', 'big', 'well', 'new', 'fresh', 'such', 'many', 'second', 'first', 'great', 'more', 'interesting', 'intriguing', 'unanimous', 'personal', 'amazing', 'good', 'much', 'deserved', 'remarkable', 'phenomenal', 'own', 'extraordinary', 'more', 'stale', 'whole', 'general', 'vivid', 'great', 'standalone', 'near'];0.3015412748171369

224;illbebackreviews;two years after the masterpiece that is the godfather, francis ford coppola decided it was time to direct and release part ii of what would become a trilogy. a movie like this is extremely difficult to review and to have expectations for, especially when it is considered by most to be much better than the original and perhaps the greatest sequel ever made. however, is this an over statement or not? quite simply said, yes and no! much like the godfather, everything works amazingly in this film. in my opinion, it isn't the greatest sequel ever made, to that i say the empire strikes back and i much prefer the original over it but that is by no means a way to say i dislike this film in the slightest. i love this film and that's certain and much like the godfather, it took two viewings before i truly loved it. *spoilers contained throughout this review* it has been a few years since the death of don vito corleone and michael has now become the head of the corleone crime family as his business stretches through nevada. an assassination attempt on his life leads him through a war with hyman roth whilst the story of a young vito corleone, the to be don of the family, is portrayed marvellously by an inexperienced actor at the time, robert de niro in an oscar winning performance the major issue i had with this film when its considered to be better than the original is how the absence of marlon brando's vito corleone really leaves a big and unfinished hole. that was my issue the first time as the word 'godfather' only brings one image into my mind. not de niro's vito but brando's. despite amazing and legendary performances by al pacino and robert de niro, the absence of marlon brando still leaves an impact. luckily this absence doesn't prove too costly for me this time around and most of it is well covered by the two. the strength to the film is a tough one to pick but the acting still stands out. apart from the acting, the storyline is extremely strong and powerful thanks to amazing de niro and al pacino performances. even that being said, the film is by no means more iconic or memorable than the first but a perfect continuation to what i believe, the greatest film of all time! the characters in this film are fantastic from a young vito and his friends to hyman roth, johnny ola and various other characters such as frank pentanjali. despite not having characters as memorable as luca brasi and sonny and an older vito, the godfather part ii is extremely strong in terms of good characters and a fantastic and yet again, an immersive story. despite containing only a few words of english, my favourite proportion of the film would have to be the story of vito corleone as it provides all necessary background story perfectly. contributing to a rough estimation of one third of the film's story, this is the stronger part of the film and thus, the more interesting part of it too! words from de niro such as 'i'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse!' may not be anywhere near as powerful coming from an inexperienced actor at the time but is nevertheless amazing. one of my favourite lines from de niro would have to be when he talks to a young michael stating that he loves him! this falls perfectly back in place with everything vito stood for in the original film when he stated that he never wanted michael mixed up in the family business. vito corleone was a flawless character in part i but part ii improves upon everything about his character, giving him necessary backstory that ultimately works superbly in such a film. the iconic soundtrack is yet again, amazing! the first few moments of the film when the soundtrack begins and the title fades in with a beautifully filmed shot of michael corleone as the don was utterly amazing! that has to be my favourite film introduction moment alongside the lord of the rings: the fellowship of the ring. the soundtrack is powerful and moving from moments where michael displays his love for his son to moments such as a young vito talking to his son. the soundtrack perfectly adds the necessary amount of emotion to each scene without ever attempting to out do itself. such perfected soundtrack works extremely powerfully in this film.;16 April 2013;10;['difficult', 'most', 'well', 'original', 'great', 'over', 'much', 'great', 'slight', 'certain', 'much', 'few', 'corleone', 'young', 'inexperienced', 'oscar', 'major', 'well', 'original', 'big', 'unfinished', 'first', 'amazing', 'legendary', 'costly', 'most', 'tough', 'strong', 'powerful', 'amazing', 'iconic', 'memorable', 'first', 'perfect', 'great', 'fantastic', 'young', 'various', 'other', 'such', 'memorable', 'sonny', 'old', 'strong', 'good', 'fantastic', 'immersive', 'few', 'favourite', 'necessary', 'rough', 'strong', 'interesting', 'such', 'powerful', 'inexperienced', 'amazing', 'favourite', 'young', 'original', 'flawless', 'necessary', 'iconic', 'amazing', 'first', 'few', 'amazing', 'favourite', 'powerful', 'such', 'young', 'necessary', 'such', 'perfected'];0.2740886467581383
225;carlos37andre;the movie is basically perfect in almost all the elements. acting (al pacino is once again destroying on the role, de niro is also great, well, everybody are great here), coppola's direction is fantastic. the movie itself is technically perfect. but, for me, some things make the movie not better as the first one. the first was (for me) straight to the point, it have one thing, and it moves the plot all along. well, this isn't a rule or something, the movie can make something diferent and also be great (and this movie is great), but, some things dont fit as much for me. the whole young don plot, at the end, i didn't saw that much that make this whole part of the movie all that relevant. it doesn't show really how vito grow up on the mafia thing, i don't know, the parts are good, the mix with some scene of the present are really great, but, at the end, if their aren't here, the movie will still works the same. another thing is the story of the movie itself, seems like they shows somethings, but not much as they should show, seems like that goal was to show 20 years of his life, and this is it. but dont get me wrong, the movie is fantastic, was the longest movie that i saw and i really was hopping for more at the end, doesn't look like it's more than 3 hours long, and this is fantastic. in the end of the movie is great to look how diferent mike has became from vito, when in the last scenes we see him almost completely alone, he lost all his family, and he has not became a better don that his ever was. well, in short, the godfather - part ii is a amazing film, but, for me, the masterpiece is the first one.;30 December 2017;9;['perfect', 'great', 'great', 'fantastic', 'perfect', 'well', 'first', 'first', 'diferent', 'great', 'great', 'much', 'whole', 'young', 'much', 'whole', 'relevant', 'good', 'great', 'same', 'wrong', 'fantastic', 'long', 'more', 'more', 'fantastic', 'great', 'diferent', 'last', 'well', 'short', 'amazing', 'first'];0.4222222222222222
226;dcldan;continuing with corleone's family, now michael corleone is the godfather. while his father was wise and thoughtful (though merciless) michael is brutal, impetuous and threatening. we are able to see how the power corrupts michael and he begins to become more lonely and desperate, like in a shakespeare writing facts makes the character to get close to his fatal destiny. meanwhile, the director show us, perfectly, how vito was able to become the first corleone's godfather. all the actors are just impressive, with enormous acting for great characters. all of them play their parts with a thrilling strenght and follow a so powerful history that makes it one of the best film ever and, by far, the best second part ever filmed. it is just a perfect masterpiece.;28 May 2007;10;['wise', 'thoughtful', 'merciless', 'brutal', 'impetuous', 'threatening', 'able', 'lonely', 'desperate', 'close', 'fatal', 'able', 'first', 'impressive', 'enormous', 'great', 'powerful', 'good', 'good', 'second', 'perfect'];0.2691176470588235

229;Sonatine97;"you have to hand it to coppola; he is without doubt one of the finest directors/screenwriters of the 20 the century. we know about his godfather contributions, but when you also consider patton, the conversation, apocalypse now & rumplefish, we have to appreciate what a superb writer he really is. but the godfather films will be his most-remembered for all the right reasons, and deservedly so, especially working in collaboration with mario puzo, one of best authors of the time. coppola is never a man who tries to cut us short with a dumbed-down version of any classic novel, especially puzo's that have a breadth & majestic intensity all of their own. coppola insists on giving us literally every element from book to film - boring, irrelevant bits as well. and yet those very same ""boring bits"" work so well in the hands of the master that it gives the movie (any of his movies in fact) a more intelligent & rounded gloss. i must admit to preferring g2 to the original because it offered so much richness & character-defining elements than the first. although brando was very good & suitably threatening in the first, he would also bring the pace of the film down to a stroll bringing the other characters down with him. however, with the ""unknown"" de niro playing the young vito in g2 we get to see a revolution in his character development, in fact all the main characters including pacino's, keaton's & duvell's are given greater scope to expand on their originals. special mention must go to robert duvell, probably one of the most outrageously under-rated stars of our time, who possesses more talent in one those ""mona lisa"" like smirks than a lot of so-called big a1 stars of today! i truly loved g2, more so in the cinema than on video because an epic ""italian opera"" such as this deserves room to breath and a 29"" tv screen just doesn't cut it. g2 is better than the first, although it is just as dependent on it in order to build on the original's foundation. g2 is more intelligent to look at, the script sparkles, the violence is choreographed & not overdone; the acting is memorable and coppola' talented hand at the tiller is there for all to see & aspire too. *****/*****";9 July 2000;9;['fine', 'right', 'good', 'short', 'classic', 'majestic', 'own', 'boring', 'irrelevant', 'same', 'boring', 'intelligent', 'rounded', 'original', 'much', 'first', 'good', 'first', 'other', 'unknown', 'young', 'main', 'great', 'special', 'more', 'big', 'epic', 'italian', 'such', 'well', 'first', 'dependent', 'original', 'intelligent', 'memorable', 'talented'];0.2086405529953917

232;HelloTexas11;"the first 'godfather' film was a beautifully rendered, violent and at times even warmhearted look inside a mafia crime family. it deserved all the accolades it received for direction, cinematography, art direction and of course those wonderful performances by brando, pacino, caan, duvall and the rest of the cast. i think it's fair to say no one expected the sequel to outshine the original, but to many peoples' minds, somehow it did. it is even more intricate and expansive, presenting two stories at great length, one taking place before the first film and the other, continuing the first's narrative. 'the godfather part ii' has been called both the greatest sequel of all time and the greatest american film, period. it was nominated for 11 oscars. the 'sequel' part of the film concerns michael corleone's attempts to hold his family and its 'business' together after the death of vito corleone. times are changing and he sees an opportunity to invest in havana's casinos with the help of hyman roth, a former associate of his father's, and the pre-castro, pro-business government in cuba. the plot of 'part ii' is difficult to follow at times; there are double-crosses, and perceived double-crosses that really aren't, and it's hard to know who is sincere about what. the only thing that is certain is that everyone looks after their own interests and there is no hesitation in using murder as a final negotiating tool. killings and attempted killings continue, but in this film, they are more methodical and cold-blooded. toward the end, tom hagen even asks michael corleone if he feels the need to kill everyone. no, michael says, just our enemies. but when one of those 'enemies' turns out to be his own brother, fredo, it is clear that things have changed in the corleone family, and not for the better. francis ford coppola spoke of the inevitable decline in the corleone family and it is very apparent, never more so than when michael gives the order to have fredo murdered. the 'prequel' segments are, by contrast, very simple and tell the story of how vito corleone arrived in america and began to build his empire. robert deniro does not so much replace marlon brando as offer an interpretation of corleone as a young man. there is wonderful period detail in these scenes; the tenement neighborhoods of the recently arrived italians, living in their own section of new york, bits of broken english beginning to find their way into the mother tongue. it's all filmed in sepia-tinted color, which creates the feeling of a time passed, like looking at old photographs. unlike the 1950's plot, the turn-of-the-century story is fairly cut-and-dried. vito corleone marries, starts a family, and begins a loose partnership with other young immigrants in what will eventually become the corleone crime family. he kills the neighborhood crime boss, the one who collected protection money from all the local businesses, and effectively replaces him and the old way, becoming a more benevolent, friendlier version of the black hand, if no less lethal when the need arises. he even finds time to travel back to sicily and visit revenge on the aged crime lord there who had murdered members of his family. 'the godfather part ii' is filled with memorable performances, all of the continuing characters portrayed by the same actors as the first film. it is an epic undertaking and rewards repeated viewings with new detail unnoticed previously, not to mention better understanding of the labyrinth plot intrigues. it is also ultimately depressing, in a way the first movie wasn't. in spite of everything, the audience was pulling for the corleone family to succeed and win out over its enemies in 'the godfather;' i don't think that's the case at the end of 'the godfather part ii.'";5 January 2008;9;['first', 'violent', 'wonderful', 'fair', 'original', 'many', 'intricate', 'expansive', 'great', 'first', 'other', 'great', 'great', 'american', 'former', 'pro', 'business', 'difficult', 'double', 'double', 'hard', 'sincere', 'only', 'certain', 'own', 'final', 'methodical', 'cold', 'blooded', 'own', 'clear', 'corleone', 'well', 'inevitable', 'corleone', 'apparent', 'prequel', 'simple', 'much', 'young', 'wonderful', 'own', 'broken', 'old', 'corleone', 'loose', 'other', 'young', 'corleone', 'local', 'old', 'benevolent', 'friendly', 'black', 'lethal', 'aged', 'memorable', 'same', 'first', 'epic', 'new', 'unnoticed', 'well', 'labyrinth', 'depressing', 'first', 'corleone'];0.1462325089876109

236;peeedeee-94281;i commend coppola for taking on pt 2 and filling in a bit of viteo corleone's history, and continuing michael's saga, with parallels between the two. it was a good sequel, but i didn't find it as engaging as the first one, which i've seen countless number of times. i just watched pt 2 recently after not having seen it for a number of years. i'm not sure why it doesn't have the same feeling as the first. i think the lack of direction (i.e. a clear plot line) didn't help. there was an attempt on michael's life, and there was talk here and there of doing some extra business, but a lot of it just seemed vague. much of the movie was spent on the strained relationship between michael and his family. another missed opportunity was explaining don vito corleone's rise to power. you see him assassinate the neighbourhood don at one point, but then we fast forward years later when he's grown a mustache and is doing favors for people, and vice versa. but we don't get any information on whether he's affiliated with the crime boss that was the boss of the guy he killed, or if he had formed a completely different family. i guess that would have been a 4.5hr movie. overall, a good, but not great sequel. not as quotable either, like the first movie. did it deserve the best oscar nom and win. i guess so. there were a lot of great movies that year. but i think the juggernaut of the godfather saga was too much to pass up giving it the win.;20 November 2019;7;['good', 'first', 'countless', 'sure', 'same', 'first', 'clear', 'extra', 'vague', 'much', 'strained', 'different', 'great', 'quotable', 'first', 'good', 'great', 'much'];0.265625
237;son_of_cheese_messiah;"at the time of its release, many claimed this to be a finer film than the original. however, the passage of time has been less kind to this than that iconic movie. much of the problem stems from the decision to make this both the sequel and prequel to the first film at the same time. so we have the back story of vito corleone and the ongoing adventures of his son michael inter-cut throughout. this adds to the films inordinate length, which would have been long enough if michael's story alone was told, but here is stretched to almost 4 hours. details in both stories fail to convince, the vito back story most of all. it is scarcely believable that a well meaning outsider could so easily take over the underworld in the manner portrayed. as played by de niro, he is a robin hood 'feared by the bad, loved by the good' but why he is so universally feared not plausible. he could have easily been taken out. the real vito corleone would have had to have been much nastier and been prepared to deal with his opponents brutally. his character is whitewashed for hollywood consumption. and there is some cack handed attempts at humour during, for instance, the slum landlord scene. there is, of course much fine acting from all, especially in michael's story arc. this differs from vito's since while vito's is very simple, michael's is very very complex. too complex perhap. various well known events from the 50s merely are stuck together to form the backdrop. the mafia involvement with pre-revolutionary cuba; congressional hearings; plus a few subtle hints at the kennedy assassination. the narrative is exceptionally loose and meandering. the writing is surprisingly unsubtle, with clinking plot points being underlined again and again. the female characters are under-used but make the most of their meagre parts. talia shire's impassioned plea to her brother sticks in the mind, but elsewhere she barely speaks a word. diane keen has a better role and sinks her teeth into it with gusto. the film belongs to al pacino who dominates this in the way that hamlet does in shakespeare's play. its an accomplished performance as would be expected. there is certainly enough here to make it worth watching, but it could have been much better.";12 June 2010;5;['many', 'fine', 'original', 'kind', 'iconic', 'much', 'prequel', 'first', 'same', 'back', 'ongoing', 'cut', 'inordinate', 'most', 'believable', 'bad', 'plausible', 'real', 'nasty', 'cack', 'handed', 'much', 'fine', 'simple', 'complex', 'complex', 'various', 'pre', 'revolutionary', 'congressional', 'few', 'subtle', 'loose', 'meandering', 'unsubtle', 'female', 'most', 'impassioned', 'well', 'accomplished', 'enough', 'worth', 'well'];0.1054843304843305
238;pinkliz41;this was not as good as the first, but still a really great film. with its ultra violent execution scenes and well deserved credited acting marks the second film in the ultimate gangster franchise. director francis ford coppola thought of the need to only make two films, this one and the first, but he didn't really intend to make a third but in the end did. truly though, the first two were the best, i think there was no apparent reason for making the third one, which is supposed to be the worst/not as good one, compared to the first two classics. number two follows michael corleones early life. it flash backs every now and then to his father don corleone played by robert de niro who does some dirty deals and some killings. so there are two parts to the story, these are: michael, in present form and don corleone, so you can see what don corleone did to become don. the acting is top quality, most probably one of al pacinos greatest moments to shine and robert de niro, who also ma not be leading actor but still acts like he is. diana keaton, who plays michael wife also demonstrates that she can bring to life the suffering and shocking conclusion of michael and her splitting up, as you will see in the third one. this film including the acting and direction all made this film worth wild, because of the extreme enthusiasm and dedication from both the cast and film crew.;25 March 2007;9;['good', 'first', 'great', 'ultra', 'violent', 'second', 'ultimate', 'first', 'third', 'first', 'good', 'apparent', 'third', 'bad', 'good', 'first', 'early', 'dirty', 'present', 'top', 'great', 'shocking', 'third', 'worth', 'wild', 'extreme'];0.1009999999999999

242;freaky_dave;both the godfather and the godfather part ii are really good films. both have excellent performances, and both films move at that same leisurely pace that never becomes boring. but the film i prefer is the first, even though the second is more detailed about what the corleone family does. i guess i prefer it because it was more original, and marlon brando, who doesn't appear in the second even though francis ford coppola tried getting him to reprise his role at the end of the movie, isn't there. with the godfather part ii we have two stories going on. and that is the other weakness of the second film. one involves michael corleone (pacino)as the new don maintaining his power and pushing to keep his control. the second involves the early life of vito corleone and how he became the godfather of the first film. robert deniro, in an exceptional performance, plays the part of the young vito corleone. both stories are played back and forth, and as big events happen in one the plot shifts to the other, which is a little distracting. i would've preferred that copolla stuck with one story instead because it would've worked a lot better. of course i can understand why he did it. he wanted to get two of the biggest stars of their generation together in one film, and both pacino and deniro were up to the challenge even though brando was still irreplaceable. deniro looks really young, and al pacino looks much older than in the first, even though both films were only separated by two years. i don't know if it was clever make-up or just pacino's phenomenal acting that made it so. the ending of the godfather part ii is incredibly strong though as it shifts back to a time when michael was certain he was never going to be part of the family business, only to shift back to the present as he sits by himself in his home after key events have happened. it was like a realization as pacino's character completely accepts what he has become. strong movie definitely, but the first film, in my opinion, is still better. however both films still should be seen. you can't just watch one and not the other. godfather part ii may not be the greatest sequel ever, but it is still one incredible experience.;14 April 2006;8;['good', 'excellent', 'same', 'leisurely', 'boring', 'first', 'second', 'detailed', 'corleone', 'original', 'second', 'other', 'second', 'new', 'second', 'early', 'first', 'exceptional', 'young', 'big', 'other', 'little', 'big', 'irreplaceable', 'young', 'old', 'first', 'clever', 'phenomenal', 'strong', 'certain', 'key', 'strong', 'first', 'well', 'other', 'great', 'incredible'];0.1930338044308632

255;michael_the_nermal;"warning! spoilers ahead! ""the godfather, part ii"" is another gem of a movie, worthy of a place alongside its revered predecessor. this movie's strengths lie in copolla's retention of the best actors from the first film mixed in with terrific new actors for the second. john cazale, lee strasberg, robert de niro and michael gazzo are given their moment to shine here, and play credible and unforgettable characters. al pacino, diane keaton, and robert duvall reprise their roles from the first movie, and put in an equal amount of effort to the first film, which means that the second is also very good. copolla had a lot more creative freedom with this picture, but it doesn't differ much from the first in terms of style and camera angles. still, the director does an admirable job crafting an interesting and wonderful film. pacino's michael corleone is, in the first, a quiet and understated character most of the time, only this time, whenever the character is riled by a tragic event, pacino lets out his infamous ""scream"" to emphasize that his character is like a dangerous time bomb with an unpredictable temper: one minute he's calm, the next he's in a rage. unfortunately, pacino is most remembered for his loud, bombastic performances rather than his understated quiet ones. keaton appears to have less screen time, but, like her husband michael, undergoes a credible transformation from the naive, submissive character we remember from part i into an assertive, strong woman who will not give in to her husband. she asserts control over her own body by aborting her baby rather than letting michael have another heir to his criminal empire. again, keaton's performance is usually cited as the weakest of the ""godfather"" saga, but this seems unfair, and she does well whenever she has screen time. robert duvall is back with another excellent turn as corelone family adviser tom hagen. the new faces do very well here, and again, copolla was blessed with an excellent cast. gazzo is simply delectable as mobster frank pentangeli, one of cinema's most memorable characters. one minute he's a lovable old man, sometimes seeming as dopey and sweet as your great-uncle, asking the band to play an italian ""tarantella""; the next he's viciously asking for the blood of the rosato borthers. he, ultimately, cows to michael's control during a senate hearing, just as he is about to rat him out.gazzo, a prolific playwright, showed he had the chops as an actor as well. another memorable performance is the italian actor who played the gangster don fanucci, a dandy tyrant who shakes down italian immigrants for protection money. he, like the guy who played ""the turk"" solozzo in part i, is a convincing actor who can make a slimy villain come to life. he seems to relish his role as the white coated mobster who confidently rules the neighborhood with an iron fist. less potent is lee strasberg's hyman roth, who, after don fanucci, is the film's main antagonist. roth's true evil is only revealed in other characters' dialogue and indirect screen action rather than anything we see roth do on the screen. i wasn't fully convinced that roth was a cunning double-crosser, as we don't actually see him engage in the double-cross. strasberg gives an understated performance as the kingpin of the pre-castro havana casinos (an obvious representation of real-life gangster meyer lansky). still, strasberg does have some memorable moments, such as the famous ""this is the business we've chosen"" speech he gives to michael. fresh performances from john cazale and robert de niro round out this movie. we don't see much of fredo in part i, but he's essential to part ii. cazale gives a memorable performance as the meek, weak, sweet, but ultimately treacherous middle brother of the corleone family. his flaws include his lack of intelligence and possible naivete, which ultimately result in his being a pawn in roth's scheme to kill michael. fredo wants the keys to the kingdom, but will settle for some power, and roth apparently offered him something special for his services. all fredo says is that ""there was something in it for me!"", but what this was is rather vague; still, fredo's ties with roth are enough for michael to commit the darkest murder he will commit in the saga: fratricide. we almost feel sorry for fredo as he sweetly tells his nephew how to catch a fish by reciting a ""hail mary,"" right before michael has one his goons shoot him from behind on a fishing trip. fredo may be the rather weak and dopey member of the corleone clan, but cazale also manages to humanize fredo and make a memorable performance as the ultimately tragic odd man out in the ""family business."" part ii carries with it a sadder tragedy than part i, as michael ""loses his family,"" in terms of his wife's abortion and departure, and fredo's treachery and his eventual murder. it is in part ii that we see the full scope of the perils of a life of crime in terms of keeping a family together. even don vito, while running a criminal empire, was able to somehow keep his family glued together. we see the sad irony when michael's mother tells him ""you will never lose your family."" this is an excellent movie, much like the first one. copolla does well here. (copolla's further career is debatable. radio host phil hendrie once gave a hilarious criticism of copolla's career: ""what do you mean 'charlie don't surf?!'"") he directs beautifully here, and the actors cooperate by giving excellent performances. this is a highly recommended movie.";16 July 2007;9;['worthy', 'revered', 'good', 'first', 'terrific', 'new', 'credible', 'unforgettable', 'first', 'equal', 'first', 'second', 'good', 'creative', 'first', 'admirable', 'interesting', 'wonderful', 'first', 'quiet', 'understated', 'most', 'tragic', 'infamous', 'dangerous', 'unpredictable', 'calm', 'next', 'loud', 'bombastic', 'quiet', 'less', 'credible', 'naive', 'submissive', 'assertive', 'strong', 'own', 'criminal', 'weak', 'unfair', 'excellent', 'new', 'excellent', 'delectable', 'memorable', 'lovable', 'old', 'dopey', 'sweet', 'great', 'italian', 'next', 'about', 'prolific', 'memorable', 'italian', 'dandy', 'italian', 'convincing', 'slimy', 'white', 'coated', 'potent', 'main', 'true', 'other', 'indirect', 'cunning', 'double', 'double', 'pre', 'obvious', 'real', 'memorable', 'such', 'famous', 'fresh', 'much', 'essential', 'memorable', 'weak', 'sweet', 'treacherous', 'middle', 'corleone', 'possible', 'special', 'vague', 'enough', 'dark', 'sorry', 'weak', 'dopey', 'corleone', 'memorable', 'tragic', 'odd', 'sad', 'eventual', 'full', 'criminal', 'able', 'sad', 'excellent', 'first', 'further', 'debatable', 'hilarious', 'excellent'];0.1587724536000398

261;mohit_sinsniwal;"coppola's masterpiece is rivaled only by ""the godfather, part ii"" in which the 1940s setting of the first movie is extended backwards and forwards to reveal the corrupting effect of power...the film, breathtaking in its scope and tragic grandeur, shows two parallel stories extending two different time periods: the early career of young vito corleone seen first around the turn of the 20th century in sicily, and then in 1917, building his criminal underworld in the italian ghettos of new york city, post world war i, plus that of his son, michael (al pacino) desperately trying to keep his family together... al pacino's performance is quiet and solemn... he is cold and ruthless, with a whole contrast from the idealistic innocent war hero we initially met at the beginning of the first film... here he's a calculating and frightening force, seeking to expand casinos into pre-revolutionary cuba and consolidating an empire surrounded by perfidy and treason, maintaining total confidence in his ability to control the situation whether testifying before enraging senators or trying to outface his worst enemies... the film's haunting final shot of a lonely, isolated paranoid michael in his empty compound, is an unforgettable movie scene, a tragic portrait of a lonely and fully damned person, emotionally empty and finished, far from a waspish wife, more distant from a faithful lawyer... de niro's rise, from an orphan child by a family feud back in italy to a hood in new york and his position as a respected don, provides a welcome break from pacino's relentless attitude... since the people he kills seem to deserve it, vito comes off better than michael does, and it was wise of coppola to shuffle the two stories together despite lengthy flashbacks and the disturbance of continuity... the entire cast contributes greatly to the success of the film: lee strasberg, a fascinating mixture of lust and ruthlessness; g. d. spradlin, absolutely right as the sinister and corrupt nevada senator; michael v. gazzo, unforgettable as the troubled gray-haired informer; gastone moschin, excellent as the blackmailer in white suit; john cazale, marvelously timid as the vague, confused, and hesitant fredo; diane keaton, clearly irrational as the long-suffering wife kay; talia shire, too extravagant as the lousy mother; troy donahue too ambitious as the fortune-hunting suitor; and robert duvall excels as the confidant, and retainer to the all-powerful corleone family... coppola's motion picture is not just a mere supply with new characters and events from the original, it's a far more complex and intimate movie than its predecessor... it is not really a sequel... it's just more... it cleverly shifts in time between two distinct narratives with extreme realistic violence and criminal mentality of gangsters...";26 May 2019;7;['first', 'corrupting', 'tragic', 'parallel', 'different', 'early', 'young', 'criminal', 'italian', 'quiet', 'solemn', 'cold', 'ruthless', 'whole', 'idealistic', 'innocent', 'first', 'frightening', 'pre', 'revolutionary', 'total', 'bad', 'final', 'lonely', 'paranoid', 'empty', 'unforgettable', 'tragic', 'lonely', 'empty', 'waspish', 'distant', 'faithful', 'respected', 'welcome', 'relentless', 'wise', 'lengthy', 'entire', 'fascinating', 'right', 'corrupt', 'unforgettable', 'troubled', 'gray', 'haired', 'excellent', 'white', 'timid', 'hesitant', 'irrational', 'extravagant', 'lousy', 'ambitious', 'powerful', 'corleone', 'mere', 'new', 'original', 'complex', 'intimate', 'more', 'cleverly', 'distinct', 'extreme', 'realistic', 'criminal'];0.0143488455988456

263;Jackblyth8;"spinning before and after the first instalment, 'the godfather part 2' provides us with the upbringing of authoritative mafia boss vito corleone, and how he built his success from a small town in sicily. the ensemble cast flourish in their roles for a second time, welcoming robert de niro into the script, who takes the place of marlon brando as a younger vito. the spectacle captures the dangerous life lived in the thick of bandits, and the consequences that face. al pacino doesn't fail to portray the role as the protagonist, encapsulating the remorseless figure who ultimately, doesn't know what he wants. in 1901, the family of nine-year-old vito andolini is killed in corleone, sicily after his father insults local mafia chieftain don ciccio. vito escapes on a ship destined for new york city, and is registered as ""vito corleone"" on ellis island. in 1958, during his son's first communion party at lake tahoe, michael has a series of meetings in his role as the don of the corleone crime family. frank pentangeli a corleone capo, is dismayed that michael refuses to help defend his territory against the rosato brothers, who work for michael's business partner hyman roth. that night, michael leaves nevada after surviving an assassination attempt at his home. cleverly, the opening phase of the film, following on from michael being named 'the godfather, replicates the same as part i. set at a crowded, colourful celebration, where similar to vito, michael is heavily related, but remains negotiating business in his office. this emphasises his resemblance with his father, and the fact that he has taken his role comfortably and seriously. in 1917, vito corleone lives in new york city with his wife and son sonny. he loses his job due to local don, fanucci, insisting that his nephew work there; clemenza invites vito to unwittingly take part in a burglary. michael suspects roth planned the assassination, but meets him in miami and feigns ignorance. in new york city, pentangeli attempts to maintain michael's facade by making peace with the rosato family but they attempt to kill him. roth, michael, and several of their partners travel to havana to discuss their future cuban business prospects under the cooperative government of fulgencio batista. michael becomes reluctant after reconsidering the viability of the ongoing cuban revolution. on new year's eve, fredo inadvertently reveals that he knows roth's right-hand man, johnny ola, having previously claimed that they had never met and michael realises that it was fredo who had betrayed him. that night, michael has his bodyguard kill ola, but before he can also kill roth, he is discovered by police and shot dead. batista abruptly abdicates due to rebel advances. during the ensuing chaos, michael, fredo, and roth separately escape to the united states. back home, michael learns that his wife kay has miscarried. the deterioration of his family that started to unravel in part i appears to be meeting a conclusion. kay is worried by michael's ambitions and intentions, feeling that another son would only expand michael's goals. along with the ongoing destruction of the corleone's illegitimate business, it is fitting to visualise the rise of vito corleone and his popularity in new york. moving in between adds the sense of uncertainty to the watch, we are made to believe that we are watching the start of the corleone's and also, the end. vito has fathered two more sons, fredo and michael. vito's criminal conduct attracts the attention of fanucci, who exorts him. vito's partners, clemenza and salvatore tessio, wish to avoid trouble by paying in full, but vito insists that he can convince fanucci to accept a smaller payment by making him ""an offer he won't refuse"". during a neighbourhood fiesta, he stalks fanucci to his apartment and shoots him dead. in washington, d.c., a senate committee on organised crime is investigating the corleone family. having survived the earlier attempt on his life, pentangeli agrees to testify against michael, who he believes had double-crossed him, and is placed under witness protection. now a respected figure in his community, vito is approached for help by a widow who is being evicted. after an unsuccessful negotiation with vito, the widow's landlord asks around, learns of vito's reputation, and hastily agrees to let the widow stay on terms very favourable to her. vito and his partners are becoming more and more successful with their business, ""genco pura olive oil company"". on returning to nevada, fredo tells michael that he has felt resentful for being disregarded; he had helped roth, expecting something in return. he claims to be ignorant of the plot on michael's life. he informs michael that the senate lawyer is on roth's payroll. michael responds by disowning fredo and tells his capo that nothing is to happen to fredo while their mother is alive. michael is unable to reach the heavily guarded pentangeli, so he sends for pentangeli's brother from sicily, resulting in pentangeli renouncing his previous statement; the hearing dissolves in an uproar. kay reveals to michael that she actually had an abortion, not a miscarriage and that she intends to remove their children from michael's criminal life. outraged, michael strikes kay, banishes her from the family, and takes custody of the children. vito, along with his family, visits sicily for the first time since emigrating. he and business partner tommasino are admitted to don ciccio's compound, ostensibly to ask for ciccio's blessing on their olive oil business. vito exacts his childhood vengeance by killing ciccio after revealing his former identity, but as they escape, tommasino is shot in the leg and suffers a permanent disability. supplying almost a cyclical enforcement, the significant beginning of vito corleone was not forgotten, going back to the man who destroyed his family many years ago. the brutal and ruthless nature of vito are there for all to see, de niro perfecting the art of his loyalty. morally relieving to viewers that it was vito who finishes the already weakened don ciccio. michael's mother dies. at the funeral, michael appears to forgive fredo. roth is refused asylum and denied entry to israel. he is forced to return to the united states. over the dissent of consigliere tom hagen, capo rocco lampone is ordered by michael to assassinate roth. lampone, posing as a journalist at miami international airport, shoots roth dead before federal agents kill him. at the witness protection compound, hagen reminds pentangeli that failed plotters against the roman emperor often committed suicide and assures him that his family will be cared for. pentangeli later slits his wrists in his bathtub. al neri, acting on michael's orders, kills fredo out on the lake. the corleone family gathers in their dining room to surprise vito for his birthday. michael announces that, in response to the attack on pearl harbour, he has left college and enlisted in the united states marine corps leaving sonny furious, tom incredulous, and fredo the only supportive brother. when vito is heard at the door, all but michael leave the room to greet him. michael sits alone by the lake at the family compound. again we are privileged to witness such a thrilling spectacle centred around the dark and dangerous corleone family. coppola manages to combine two films into one, with the story of vito corleone through the performance of a robert de niro, and, michael's ongoing journey as the newly-named 'godfather'. al pacino's consistency across the two films is applaudable and de niro's arrival into the business, as a dominant, stern don, is nothing short of excellent. michael's overall involvement in the family from part 1 to 2 is remarkable, subverting from an introverted marine who wanted no contribution to the family, to the authoritative representative. swooping 12 awards, half of which were academy, francis ford coppola nails the sequel, causing many people to believe it is superior to the first. again, well beyond its years, the vibrant colours and magnificent cinematography adds to the beauty of the watch, manifesting its iconic status. a film that will go down as one of the greatest to be presented on screen. the storyline carried by sensational acting.";8 February 2021;10;['first', 'authoritative', 'small', 'ensemble', 'second', 'young', 'dangerous', 'remorseless', 'old', 'local', 'first', 'corleone', 'corleone', 'same', 'colourful', 'similar', 'local', 'several', 'future', 'cuban', 'cooperative', 'reluctant', 'ongoing', 'cuban', 'new', 'right', 'dead', 'rebel', 'ongoing', 'illegitimate', 'fitting', 'more', 'criminal', 'salvatore', 'full', 'small', 'dead', 'corleone', 'early', 'respected', 'unsuccessful', 'favourable', 'successful', 'olive', 'resentful', 'ignorant', 'alive', 'unable', 'previous', 'criminal', 'outraged', 'first', 'olive', 'former', 'tommasino', 'permanent', 'cyclical', 'significant', 'many', 'brutal', 'ruthless', 'vito', 'consigliere', 'capo', 'dead', 'federal', 'roman', 'corleone', 'marine', 'furious', 'only', 'supportive', 'privileged', 'dark', 'dangerous', 'corleone', 'ongoing', 'applaudable', 'dominant', 'stern', 'short', 'excellent', 'overall', 'remarkable', 'introverted', 'authoritative', 'many', 'superior', 'first', 'vibrant', 'magnificent', 'iconic', 'great', 'sensational'];0.1088862652499016

267;Nate-48;as the years have gone by and amc plays the godfather on a constant loop, there has developed a sort of common wisdom that this film is as good or some even contend - better than the first. this is simply not the case on either count. there are come wonderful aspects to this film - namely the emergence of robert de niro, the 1910's new york city tenement scenes, the depictions of old rural italy and some great acting from al pacino, john cazale and robert duvall. this film was automatically at a disadvantage from the first with no marlon brando, james caan, richard conte and sterling hayden - four great actors, a fifth - richard castellano, is the greatest loss on the film because it is a self-inflicted wound due to a dispute over money and allegedly dialogue- so clemenza is sloppily erased from the story with some confusing tale which we won't go into. so this movie is at at a loss of five great actors to start with and picks up one monumental discovery in de niro who on his own nearly makes this great to warch. the bad guy of the film - italian actor gastone moschin essentially replaces the original bad guy al lettieri (who famously dies in the original) in a piece of good acting. hyman roth, a jewish mobster partly based around the story of meyer lansky (like most of the subjects in these movies these men are loose composites drawing from different characters). roth is played by lee strasberg - a great acting teacher who developed the method style of acting deployed by brando, pacino and de niro - but not the greatest actor. roth has some memorable lines and it is a good performance by strasberg but the character is really nothing like lansky's actual character and the film takes a lot of liberties with this storyline which is far from the truth and ends up really muddying the script in some nutty premise which is not believable. i won't give anything away, but lansky never did half of the things that are suggested here. but his greatest line is about moe greene (loosely based as a composite of bugsy siegel). apparently, director francis ford coppola wanted james cagney to play roth's part but perhaps cagney didn't like what coppola did with the character. fans of the show sopranos may be interested to know that roth's lieutenant johnny ola is played by dominic chianese who played tony's uncle junior. the dialogue is not up to par with the first. some of the scenes are more for show and effect and impression than substance. there are a number of holes in the storyline which are not properly resolved. there is a quick appearance by the late danny aiello. bruno kirby makes a good impression in one of his earliest roles. michael gazzo does an adequate job as essentially clemenza/richard castellano's replacement but it always feels like he is a replacement player. pacino's new (and old) bodyguard seems completely out of place the entire time. diane keaton and talia shire are good in returning roles. keaton has a memorable showdown with pacino. all in all this is a great movie, and it is darker than the first - in some ways much darker. most of its greatness lies in the back story that is told in the flashback scenes.;16 August 2020;9;['constant', 'common', 'good', 'well', 'first', 'wonderful', 'old', 'rural', 'great', 'first', 'great', 'fifth', 'great', 'clemenza', 'confusing', 'great', 'monumental', 'own', 'great', 'bad', 'italian', 'original', 'bad', 'original', 'good', 'jewish', 'most', 'loose', 'different', 'great', 'great', 'memorable', 'good', 'actual', 'nutty', 'believable', 'lansky', 'great', 'bugsy', 'interested', 'dominic', 'first', 'more', 'quick', 'late', 'good', 'early', 'adequate', 'new', 'old', 'entire', 'talia', 'good', 'memorable', 'great', 'dark', 'first', 'dark', 'most', 'back'];0.3083550436491613

271;C22Man;"it seems impossible to think that the first godfather could be topped, but its direct sequel may be even better. it effectively takes all the elements from the first and makes them bigger and more complex, as well as revolutionising the idea of flashbacks. the plot is possibly the greatest of all time, the characters are more diversely fascinating and everything feels even more epic than before. the plot is split in two, one following the corleone family in modern day and the other early life of vito. the first follows michael who is now don as he attempts to expand the family business into las vegas. he faces much dissatisfaction in his own family, from capo frank pentangeli and his own sister. he later survives an assassination attempt, and as he tries to learn who made the attempt he also faces a committee investigation that tears his family apart. this story is one of the best in film history, everything about it is incredibly set-up. the second charts the young life of vito corleone as he raises his family in new york and aims to build his own legacy. this sees him challenge the local don and gain friends to help him achieve his goal. this part gives us a true insight into how all of what we're seeing started and is a fantastic mirror image to the modern events. the huge cast is once again truly outstanding. al pacino gives an incredible performance as we see michael transform into a cold monster who has no feelings for his family. the way pacino shows the struggle as he edges closer to the abyss is astonishing. the other star is john cazale as fredo, he is outstanding as the timid fredo, the chemistry between himself and pacino sets their scenes alight. robert duvall is solid as a rock once again as the reserved tom, while diane keaton is great showing kay as confused and frightened of her situation. michael v. gazzo is superb as frank showing him as a genuinely troubled person. richard bright deserves praise as, despite few lines, he commands the screen as the loyal but brutal al neri. joe spinell is great as the doubtful cicci as is lee strasberg as the devious hyman roth. robert de niro made his name here, he plays vito with assured comfort and is just as good as brando, which is praise itself. the film looks stunning. it is lit similar to the first and carries the same gloomily authentic feel being very atmospheric. the scenes of early new york and of sicily are both excellent having a very natural look to them. the music from nino rota is once again marvellous. the script is full of classic lines, ""keep your friends close but keep your enemies closer"" and ""i don't want to kill everyone, just my enemies"" to name but two. it's great how the film focuses more on michael and it's reflected by the look at vito. michael grows increasingly paranoid and unstable as he places the family business above all else. we see the differences in how the family is set. vito's was built on loyalty and love, whereas michael's family is built on fear and violence. it is a fascinating contrast which the film itself is built on, the whole scope is formed from this showing the pleasant start of the family and then it's tragic fall. there are so many classic scenes, michael finding out the traitor, kay's pregnancy reveal, all of the conversations with fredo, the scenes at the hearing and the famous 'fishing trip' to name a few. the final shot of michael sitting alone is one of the most memorable of all time. the godfather part ii is a breath taking achievement in film and has possibly the greatest story ever put on screen.";29 October 2013;9;['impossible', 'first', 'direct', 'well', 'first', 'big', 'complex', 'great', 'fascinating', 'epic', 'corleone', 'modern', 'other', 'early', 'first', 'don', 'much', 'own', 'own', 'good', 'second', 'young', 'own', 'local', 'true', 'fantastic', 'modern', 'huge', 'outstanding', 'incredible', 'cold', 'astonishing', 'other', 'outstanding', 'timid', 'solid', 'reserved', 'great', 'confused', 'frightened', 'superb', 'frank', 'troubled', 'few', 'loyal', 'brutal', 'great', 'doubtful', 'devious', 'good', 'stunning', 'similar', 'first', 'same', 'authentic', 'atmospheric', 'early', 'excellent', 'natural', 'marvellous', 'full', 'classic', 'close', 'great', 'paranoid', 'unstable', 'fascinating', 'whole', 'pleasant', 'tragic', 'many', 'classic', 'famous', 'few', 'final', 'memorable', 'great'];0.2352864583333333
272;thinbeach;if you are going to watch unlikeable characters do unlikeable things, they ought to at least have some charisma. in the original this was provided by vito and sonny, whose presence here is sorely missed. exascerbating the issue is that michael has no further character development, with his transition from innocent son to murderous mafia overloard already complete, and nothing new added. there is not even any thematic progression - it ends on the exact same note as the original - that this is a bad life to live. the film attempts to make up for these shortcomings by increasing scope, and we travel all across the us, to sicily and cuba, looking for other crooked rich guys to murder - i mean - do business with. with flashbacks to the younger years of vito corleone, this film is really two films in one. the flashbacks do nothing to aid the modern story, nor seem very believable, but in location and character are far more interesting, and had the filmmakers focused their sole attention there, might have made a very good prequel. i do love the sets, costumes and colour - not unlike an old oil painting - but it feels truncated. they must have been looking everywhere for scenes to cut, given its run time.;5 February 2019;5;['unlikeable', 'unlikeable', 'least', 'original', 'sonny', 'further', 'innocent', 'murderous', 'thematic', 'exact', 'same', 'bad', 'other', 'crooked', 'rich', 'young', 'modern', 'believable', 'interesting', 'sole', 'good', 'prequel', 'old', 'run'];0.1375
273;Kakueke;"the godfather ii is not nearly as good as godfather i, even tho some intelligence and good acting went in. after the godfather i, and michael's evolution is complete, who needs a sequel about unsavory characters so much? the godfather i, led by vito and sonny, had elements that provided for great entertainment and made you less bothered by the evil and sleaze (temporarily). michael pales as an imposing figure next to vito, and altho al pacino is a good actor, i just get tired of watching michael too much--i was even getting a little tired of him at the end of godfather i. in other words, i think the disadvantage sequels have of becoming-tiresome subject matter are more present, not less, here. the end of godfather ii, with michael staring out morosely into the water from a chair, symbolizes the decadence of the story and the corrupt characters, especially michael himself. i think more toward a pathetic character than a tragic one, despite some of the events he had to endure. and what is the point of kay's back and forth moral concerns if she is staying with him? and wasn't that ""abortion"" blowup scene (natch, male child) so moving? not to me. the main story here is somewhat convoluted and disorganized, so when the flashbacks are inserted the confusion gets worse. we have sordid characters (hyman roth etc.) who do not particularly entertain me on a movie screen, and the depressing figures of fredo (geez, isn't he such a compelling character) and connie. this is a precursor to a lot of post mid-70s movies in which the plot is overcomplicated and not crisp and the characters sleazy and unappealing--in movies like this, i would like the characters to be less dwelled on and the action to rule. on the other hand, there is reason to be somewhat interested in the development of vito and the flashbacks of the family. robert deniro does a good job as vito, and the screenplay is thoughtful, but ultimately the main story dominates. yes, it is true, modern movies are less uplifting than ones preceding the mid-60s, but in spite of the many elements that some people complain about--violence, corruption, sex, pomposity, ridiculously overdone and confusing special effects--there are often some redeeming or uplifting features. certainly none here, and this film is depressing and sometimes boring, in spite of some good individual scenes and substance here and there to the story and characters. to each his own--i can see why some people like this movie more than i do, but i really do not think it belongs on a pedestal either.";22 September 2001;5;['good', 'good', 'complete', 'unsavory', 'sonny', 'great', 'good', 'tired', 'little', 'tired', 'other', 'tiresome', 'present', 'less', 'corrupt', 'pathetic', 'tragic', 'moral', 'blowup', 'male', 'main', 'convoluted', 'disorganized', 'bad', 'depressing', 'compelling', 'crisp', 'sleazy', 'unappealing', 'other', 'interested', 'good', 'thoughtful', 'main', 'true', 'modern', 'uplifting', 'many', 'overdone', 'confusing', 'special', 'uplifting', 'depressing', 'boring', 'good', 'individual', 'own', 'more', 'pedestal'];0.0175976800976801
274;diand_;with even the former director of the actors studio and proponent of method acting lee strasberg having one of the key roles this is one of the strongest acted movies ever. with brando not present there seems to be more space for others. especially de niro impresses here because he had to take brando's godfather into account (he mimics his eye, head movement, diction and hand gestures). both strasberg and de niro were nominated but de niro won from the godfather of method acting. part 2 is very well structured: not only is it a great idea to integrate a prequel and a sequel but they enhance each other creating more emotional intensity: death and birth of a child for example. but the greatest achievement in structuring the story comes in the end, when several story lines are intertwining more and more until the short but powerful climax. again we see that dark and light is used to separate the inner, godfather world from the outer, ordinary world. only in the beginning there are more lighter scenes in the godfather world to signify michael's failed efforts to go legitimate. once again very effective use of doors, mirrors and windows just as in part 1. where part 1 and the prequel are about the rise the sequel in part 2 is about the fall of the godfather family (not the empire). whereas vito stands for traditional, italian values, michael stands for modern, new world-values. the core of the story comes in the end, showing michael both in the prequel and the sequel as a lonely outsider. that's why his efforts as a family man fail so dramatically, and he's in fact only excellent in 'business'.;16 June 2005;9;['former', 'key', 'strong', 'present', 'more', 'great', 'prequel', 'other', 'emotional', 'great', 'several', 'short', 'powerful', 'inner', 'outer', 'ordinary', 'light', 'legitimate', 'effective', 'prequel', 'traditional', 'italian', 'modern', 'new', 'prequel', 'lonely', 'excellent'];0.2133953168044077
275;Kubris;imdb top 250: 3 the godfather part ii has a great distinction: it is the sequel to the greatest film ever. it has a lot to live up to. while the godfather impresses you before it even starts, with marlon brando's iconic face on the poster, part ii has to earn your respect. to most, it equals- and to a few, it betters- the godfather. but to me, it doesn't. part ii is an exceptional film that outclasses many films, but its predecessor is not one of them. the godfather showed the rise- or fall, however you look at it- of michael corleone, and part ii shows him at the height of his power, and his descent. the story is sprawling, like it should be. betrayal, family, and oranges, godfather staples, are seen throughout. but part ii doesn't have the charisma of part i. without vito and sonny, much of the famous italian factor is lost. like michael, the story is more heartless than before. also in part ii is the origin of vito corleone, starring the then small-time robert de niro, in one of his best performances. these scenes are so awesome, they steal the show. when we learn about vito, we don't want it to end, and when we watch michael, we wish he was vito instead. there's so much plot in this film, it could've been cut into 2 films, one a continuation and one an origin story, a la the metal gear solid quadrilogy. who knows the impact that could've had on the quality of part iii. while the film lacks sonny or vito, the characters present are very well played. these actors could be these characters in real life. and when oscar season came, it showed: 5 nominations. pacino is at his conflicted peak, shown no better than his confrontation with kay. he is the tent pole: all the other characters aren't on his level, another factor that makes me like part i more. others got the spotlight. but as i mentioned before, de niro is the best part of this film. he sounds like the don, looks, and charms the the don. the sets of the 20's scenes are breathtaking. it's a pity there isn't a whole film about him. together, godfathers i and ii are the best films ever made. but separate, i believe the first part stands alone at the top. mixing the 20's and late 50's, part ii has much to unravel, and in 3 hours and 20 minutes much is revealed. it's a great film, and one of the best sequels ever made. 9.2/10;17 August 2011;9;['top', 'great', 'great', 'iconic', 'most', 'few', 'exceptional', 'many', 'sonny', 'much', 'famous', 'italian', 'heartless', 'small', 'good', 'awesome', 'much', 'solid', 'sonny', 'vito', 'present', 'real', 'conflicted', 'well', 'tent', 'other', 'good', 'whole', 'good', 'separate', 'first', 'late', 'much', 'great', 'good'];0.3809027777777778

277;DanB-4;"the original godfather is a brilliant work. it is in a sense a voyeuristic delight, allowing us to see the mafia from the inside - we become part of the family. it single-handedly change the world's view of organized crime, and created a cast of sympathetic characters, none of whom have a shred of common morality. it was the highest grossing movie of its time and brando created a cultural icon whose influence resonates as strong today as it did in 1972. as extraordinary an achievement as this is, part ii is even better. it easily receives my nod as the best picture ever made. i have seen it at least 20 times, and each time its 200 minutes fly by. the movie uses flashbacks to brilliantly weave two tales. the main story is the reign of michael corleone as the world's most powerful criminal. now reaping the benefits of legalized gambling in las vegas, michael is an evident billionaire with an iron fist on a world of treachery. behind this, director francis ford coppola spins the tale of the rise of michael's father, vito, to the center of the new york mafia. it is these scenes that make the film a work of art. without spoiling, i will simply say the robert deniro as the young vito is the best acting performance of all time, a role for which he won a richly deserved oscar. the screenplay is full of delicious little underworld nuggets (""keep your friends close ....."", ""i don't want to kill everyone, just my enemies""), while it blows a dense, twisted plot past you at a dizzying and merciless pace. the cinematography is depressing and atmospheric. the score continues in the eerie role of its predecessor, foretelling death and evil. all of this makes the movie great and infinitely watchable. but it's what's deeper inside this film ... what it is really about ... that is its true genius. the godfather part ii is not really a movie about the mafia, it is a movie about a man's life long struggle. michael controls a vast empire that is constantly slipping out of his hands. he grows increasingly distrustful and paranoid, and even shows signs that he hates his own life. michael almost seems to resent the fact that he is a natural born crime lord, a man who puts the family business ahead of everything. the great don michael corleone can never come to terms with one simple fact.... his father's empire was built on love and respect, michael's empire is built on fear and violent treachery. see this movie. it's three-and-a-half hours very well spent.";7 May 1999;10;['original', 'brilliant', 'voyeuristic', 'organized', 'sympathetic', 'common', 'high', 'cultural', 'strong', 'extraordinary', 'well', 'good', 'main', 'powerful', 'legalized', 'evident', 'young', 'good', 'full', 'delicious', 'little', 'close', 'dense', 'twisted', 'dizzying', 'depressing', 'atmospheric', 'eerie', 'great', 'watchable', 'deep', 'true', 'long', 'vast', 'distrustful', 'paranoid', 'own', 'natural', 'simple', 'violent'];0.1760277777777777
278;murtaza_mma;the godfather part ii is a consummation of the saga of the corleone crime family. regarded by many as the best sequel ever, the godfather part ii is equally brilliant as its precursor and good enough to stand on its own. the movie juxtaposes, the early life of vito corleone (from his orphaned childhood to his rise in power in new york), with the life of his son, michael (after vito's death to michael becoming the most powerful mafia head). al pacino picks up from where he left in the first part, consummating michael's journey to the dark side and in the process, presenting him as the greatest anti-hero, the western cinema ever embodied. the movie gave pacino his third consecutive oscar nomination and a perpetual stardom that catapulted him above the ruck, laying the foundations of his illustrious career. just like in part i, his performance in this movie is absolutely worthy of an oscar, but the academy once again robbed him of the glory. robert de niro in his oscar winning portrayal of vito corleone, gives a great performance without uttering a single word in english. the synergy imparted by the brilliance of these two outstanding performers, makes the movie, a treat to watch. robert duvall reprises his role of tom hagen with a desired degree of subtlety and equanimity, reminding the viewer of brando's portrayal in godfather part i. the entire cast is brilliant with special mention of john cazole as fredo, lee strasberg as hyman roth and michael v.gazzo as frankie pentageli, who are outstanding, to say the least. cuppola's brilliant and innovative direction gives puzo's masterful story, an incredible impetus, which is well complemented by nino rota's poignant score and gordon willis' vivid cinematography. in a nutshell, the movie, though sanguinary and lengthy than its precursor, is an equally brilliant work of cinema, a profound and a deeply engrossing master piece. http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/;17 May 2009;10;['corleone', 'many', 'good', 'brilliant', 'good', 'own', 'early', 'orphaned', 'powerful', 'first', 'dark', 'great', 'anti', 'hero', 'western', 'third', 'consecutive', 'perpetual', 'illustrious', 'worthy', 'great', 'single', 'outstanding', 'entire', 'brilliant', 'special', 'outstanding', 'least', 'brilliant', 'innovative', 'masterful', 'incredible', 'poignant', 'vivid', 'sanguinary', 'lengthy', 'brilliant'];0.4301445578231292

280;adrongardner;"the godfather part ii has been called the greatest sequel of all time. i'm pretty sure the empire strikes back may have a thing or two to say on the topic, though, both films could probably have shared the same title. over the last 40 years, i have returned to watch godfather ii many times. there are cases where you get on in age and find new meaning in old art. sometimes you decide you were wrong about a book, movie or what have you. some things get better with age, some fond memories turn sour. i never liked godfather ii and nearly 50 years after it's release, i still don't like it. it's true to form really, because the biggest problem with godfather ii is nothing changes from the beginning to the end: michael is a crook at the start and he's the same crook at the end. the movie has nowhere to go and instead recycles themes better played in the original because there was money to be made from rehashing a better film - one with a story and one with a much, much deeper cast of characters. the 'plot' has some leftovers puzo and coppola mined from chapters in the original novel with deniro that aren't bad but my god the rest with havana and vegas is just drivel covering old territory. fredo screwing around in vegas is just the johnny fontaine story all over again. and the whole 'kiss of death' still feels silly. i think the freshman with broderick shows others got the joke too. the three and a half hour running time is coppola's ego at play from start to finish. the original godfather was a tough film on coppola, but sometimes that's how high art is made. the behind the scenes struggle on a median budget produced something that rose far above the source novel and even the producers aspirations. it cannot be over-sold how important marlon brando was to that film and film history at large. brando was at the height of his art, running point guard with a bunch of hungry kids in the championship game. the sequel feels like a foul-line finish with high school bench-warmers in comparison. and even with de niro on board, to repeat it, not much happens in godfather ii. every time i have had this conversation over the decades - people have always said the same thing to me ""but michael kills his brother!"". look, i love john cazale, but if you even saw the end of the first film, you watch as michael calmly escorts his brother-in-law to be murdered. the man is carted away kicking his last breath through a windshield - and so fredo's death is no surprise. we've been here already. less is more and we know by the end michael corleone will do literally anything . it's all right there in kay's face in the final frame of the original - and that's how less is more and indeed filmmaking work best: show, don't tell. there's sooooo much talking and grandiose pacino pronouncements in godfather ii by comparison, scenes carry no weight and i never cared who lived or died in the beginning or the end. godfather ii is also a case-in-point for the career-long problems with francis ford coppola not as a 'filmmaker' but more as a poor storyteller. as grand and highfalutin his films may reach in vision, the story is often nowhere to be found. he has occasionally rejected the common dramatic structures, but i've yet to see him do better. in recent years it seems that coppola came to this same realization and has pulled the george lucas special edition job on both apocalypse now and godfather iii. even if improvements could be made, i'm in the camp of ""what's done cannot be undone."" let the films be a product of their time and place. make new stories, don't rehash old loves. coppola has said that godfather iii was about regret. i would argue that covers a number of the films he has made. for me, godfather ii is the most specific example. just as macbeth says, ""told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.""";29 November 2021;6;['great', 'sure', 'same', 'last', 'many', 'new', 'old', 'wrong', 'well', 'fond', 'sour', 'true', 'big', 'same', 'original', 'well', 'much', 'deep', 'original', 'bad', 'old', 'johnny', 'fontaine', 'whole', 'silly', 'half', 'original', 'tough', 'high', 'median', 'important', 'large', 'hungry', 'foul', 'high', 'much', 'same', 'first', 'last', 'less', 'more', 'final', 'original', 'less', 'more', 'much', 'grandiose', 'long', 'more', 'poor', 'grand', 'common', 'dramatic', 'recent', 'same', 'new', 'old', 'specific', 'full'];0.0882248075998076
281;Blade_Le_Flambeur;two years after the original godfather was released, the godfather part ii came out. this time, it scored oscars for best picture, director, adapted screenplay, supporting actor, best original dramatic score, and art- set direction. it has been labeled by many fans of film and critics alike to be the only film that actually is superior to the original. it also remains in oscar history the only film sequel to win best picture as well as the original. i beg to differ with the critics and fans. the sheer beauty of the godfather is lost in this film. it plays upon images that have already been seen before instead of catching the eye of the viewer with better photography. the musical score is a stand out job, really adding to the effect of the film. al pacino is good here as the now corrupted micheal, but his acting seems a bit less focused then it should be and it doesn't seem as if he's really acting. in support is robert de niro, who took home his first oscar and didn't even speak a word of english in the movie. he shines in this role as his life leads onto from being a peasant to being a crime lord. the flashback sequences are frustratingly too organized, and instead of giving the viewer something to ponder about it rather just shows them the images. coppola's direction is arguably a lot more confident and realistic, another thing that adds to the effect. the script is rather good as well, focusing on each character as specifically as possible, but it's not quite as good as the original. the godfather part ii loses itself in time, making it over three hours and feeling a bit stretched with the entire cube sequence. unfortunately, roman polanski's chinatown was released the same year and lost a majority of it's oscars to this movie. in my opinion, chinatown should've taken best picture and best art- set direction. the godfather part ii packs in a lot more stuff then the first one, it tries hard to really knock the message in tight. it does, but the movie itself feels too overdone. good sequel, nowhere near the original however. 8.5/10;11 May 2003;8;['original', 'good', 'good', 'original', 'dramatic', 'many', 'only', 'superior', 'original', 'only', 'good', 'original', 'sheer', 'well', 'musical', 'good', 'focused', 'first', 'confident', 'realistic', 'good', 'possible', 'good', 'original', 'entire', 'roman', 'same', 'good', 'good', 'set', 'more', 'first', 'tight', 'overdone', 'good', 'original'];0.3485407066052227

283;blazesnakes9;"in 1972, francis ford coppola directed the film, the godfather. it told the story of a family that was involved with the mafia. the son that came home from the war was given a job to look after the family after his father died. in the end of that movie, his own son became the new godfather. now comes the godfather: part ii. but, before i start my review on the godfather; part ii, let me tell you about my rule of thumb on sequels. for many years, sequels have been trashed, criticized harshly and been disowned. audiences do go to see sequels, but they don't understand the concept of a great or good sequel. so, i will turn your attention to my review of the godfather: part ii. the movie tells us two story lines, one showing us how the original godfather, vito corleone, came to america in the beginning of the 20th century and one telling us the story of michael corleone, taking over his father's empire. corleone, in a younger age, is played by robert de niro, who won a best supporting actor in 1975 at the academy awards, and his journey in new york leads him into becoming the godfather of the original film. but even though this is a sequel, this movie is actually a prequel to the original film. corleone's story is one of the main points of the movie and how he rose to power over the years before 1958. the other main point involves his son, michael, played by al pacino, coming into play as being the godfather after his father dies in the original and in this movie, he takes on his father's job, where his relationship with his wife, played by diane keaton, takes a toll and he begins to experience the life of a matriarch, more specific, a hard-working matriarch. pacino in this movie give a memorable performance in this movie and also in the original. but, there's something different about michael corleone. he's more powerful than the original film. if you remember the first movie, you'll realizes that he didn't want to be with the family, or be involved with the family's business because he wanted to live his own life. but, when his father died, however, he accepts the role of being the new godfather. to me, this movie is ranked pretty much up to the original, but this sequel and some sequels are bad and some sequels are good. the godfather: part ii is a great sequel, more far-reaching than ever and much more in depth with the original. why is it that great of a sequel? well, first of all, the movie takes the characters to a new place and have them go on a different scenario in which they can drawback to the original. the business that michael gets involved with in cuba in 1958 is well-told. the drawbacks in this movie relies on flashbacks from don vito's early career in the early 1920's and 1930's. the movie features some of the other family members of the corleone's clan, like tom hagen, played by robert duvall and sonny corleone, one of the corleone sons, played by james caan. to me, those flashbacks builds up the supporting parts that made the godfather great. not only great, but also revolutionary. if you put all of the pieces together, than you got yourself an epic story of one man, who was poor as a little boy from italy, grow up and became inventive with his ideas and made himself an empire of his own people and his own family. his actions were direct and his journey was worth watching. it's amazing that audiences will buy a movie like this and see it and go to the movies to see this movie and not understand the supporting backdrop to the godfather. coppola directed this movie and amazingly, he won an oscar for best director and the movie itself won best picture. the godfather: part ii was the first sequel to every win an academy award. even though i am not a member of the academy, my opinion this movie is that it fully deserved the oscar and does make sense for its story-telling and its magnificent scope of don vito's life. the transformation is far more superior than other movie character every to be told or made. the enormous ground-braking history behind the two godfather movies brings out the american dream. the two other movies is not about living in the american dream, where you can pursue happiness and live life. the american dream in the two godfather movies is more different than what one's will say. the truth is that the american dream consists of hard work and dignity. anyone can pursue the american dream, but only one will succeed by pursuing their own journey and making the best out of something giant. giant like the empire vito build on. it's more than a mob story. the godfather: part ii is a great movie, with more in depth information amongst the characters and story-telling at its finest. 4 stars.";27 November 2013;10;['own', 'new', 'many', 'great', 'good', 'original', 'young', 'good', 'original', 'prequel', 'original', 'main', 'other', 'main', 'original', 'specific', 'memorable', 'original', 'different', 'powerful', 'original', 'first', 'own', 'new', 'original', 'bad', 'good', 'great', 'more', 'original', 'great', 'new', 'different', 'original', 'early', 'early', 'other', 'sonny', 'corleone', 'great', 'great', 'revolutionary', 'epic', 'poor', 'little', 'inventive', 'own', 'own', 'direct', 'worth', 'amazing', 'good', 'good', 'first', 'magnificent', 'superior', 'other', 'enormous', 'american', 'other', 'american', 'different', 'american', 'hard', 'american', 'own', 'good', 'giant', 'giant', 'more', 'great', 'more', 'fine'];0.3094916556873078

well, ""the godfather"" parts 1-2-3 are undoubtedly the answer to this question. separate the 3 movies and judge them separately is easy. of course the 1st is where we get marveled, and the other two we had already noted some mistakes, but that's why the three movies together are not only a masterpiece from francis ford coppola but also (perhaps) the best story ever told in a movie. while in the 1st part, we are introduced to the italian mob-family the corleone's facing various threats from rival mob-families. that forces don vito corleone (marlon brando) tries to push his youngest son michael (al pacino), to be his successor and be the next family's godfather; in part 2, we have the exact continuation of the story of michael in the power of the family trying to raise the family business to other countries but he ends up making mistakes along the way. and simultaneously, we have the story of the young vito corleone (robert de niro) showing how he came to america and started raising his family; and finally the 3rd and last part we see a older michael corleone, suffering from mistakes that he committed in the past. but now he tries to redeem himself before his children anthony (franc d' ambrosio) and mary (sofia coppola) and his family trying to finally legalize the family business going into business with the vatican and elect his nephew vincent mancini (andy garcia) as the new family godfather. but the dangers have always followed the corleone's closely. as i said, all parts form the masterpiece that mario puzo (screenwriter) and francis ford coppola (director and screenwriter) brought to the world with his vision of the italian mafia. many criticize the film by worshiping the italian mafia, which it technically does, but the way that both genius explore it is fantastic. throughout the history of the corleone's, coppola and puzo explore the life and business of the mafia and how it works, demonstrating the business and the wars between the mafia families that are shown realistically and terrifying. but, it is not just a story of violence and tragedy as many accuse (which is 60 % of it), because as the film progress it raises throughout the history various concepts of honor, justice and family, all revolving around the corleone. making the public really feel part of the family and start to worry about each family member in all parts of the story, at the same time with the family business and his honor. the writing from puzo and coppola help much in this regard. the script is extremely ""perfect"" in all parts. the narrative is so superb that it never gets boring or leave loose ends, and always raise the values of honor and family through the best dialogs ever put on film. but puzo and coppola can make these long dialogs in simple conversations between human beings facing their problems, putting ourselves in their situations and relating with them, leaving the film more exciting and engaging. but coppola not only explores the italian mafia and their families but also puts at various points in american history: the first part is right after the 2nd world war and michael is a war hero returning home, but he ends up becoming the godfather from his family; on the 2nd part in the history of young vito corleone we see him coming in america at the time of the great italian immigration meeting the ""american dream""; on the 3rd part with michael going into business with the vatican we see a huge line of corruption and murder within the church . both in writing and directing the film is excellent too but the performances are the highlights of the movie: al pacino is excellent in every detail with a penetrating gaze and frightening expressions (and still annoys me that in 3 films he didn't get a oscar for his role); robert de niro is a perfect young vito corleone in both voice and gestures reminding us of the badass and unforgettable old man from the first part with a simply perfect performance from marlon brando. many say that the 3rd part should never be connected to the first two for be to horrible. i think the film is still a masterpiece but obviously it has his inconveniences leaving loose ends like: what happened with tom (robert duvall), the family's lawyer, he died or he started his own family as he wanted in part 2? and also adds a lot of plots and little development, at least in the 1st hour of the film. but after a huge chopper scene everything settles superbly and concludes the trilogy or rather the film perfectly. simply putted is the best movie ever made, the drawbacks and inconveniences are almost invisible (except in the 3rd part). concepts of honor and family within the mafia; full of suspense and drama; criticizes america and the church. all this in a movie with excellent performances, direction and writing simply perfect. all that makes ""the godfather"", the strongest brand of cinema till today 10/10";7 October 2013;10;['good', 'wrong', 'close', 'easy', 'other', 'good', 'italian', 'various', 'rival', 'young', 'next', 'exact', 'other', 'young', 'last', 'old', 'new', 'italian', 'many', 'italian', 'fantastic', 'terrifying', 'many', 'various', 'same', 'much', 'perfect', 'superb', 'boring', 'loose', 'good', 'long', 'simple', 'human', 'exciting', 'engaging', 'italian', 'various', 'american', 'first', 'right', 'young', 'great', 'italian', 'american', 'huge', 'excellent', 'excellent', 'frightening', 'perfect', 'young', 'unforgettable', 'old', 'first', 'perfect', 'many', 'first', 'horrible', 'loose', 'own', 'little', 'least', 'huge', 'good', 'invisible', 'full', 'excellent', 'perfect', 'strong'];0.2261138220753605

311;alexkolokotronis;"to me and probably to many other people the godfather part ii is more of a continuation than sequel to the godfather. just look at the imdb rating and you'll see i'm not the only one who feels this way. to me it as good as the first. the acting may have been better than the acting in the original. robert de niro gave a perfect subtle performance as vito corleone. his portrayal was powerful and breathtaking. when i think de niro i definitely do not think subtle and smooth but that is exactly what he was in here. it is definitely one of his top three performances in his career. the depth in his portrayal was able to justify the vito corleone that marlon brando portrayed in the first. al pacino gave a very strong performance playing michael corleone. in here we get to see more of the tough decisions that have to be made and the consequences of certain actions. al pacino perfectly displayed the amount of thought and struggle that goes into and comes out of every action you make; the way it affects relationships, family, power and influence. diane keaton was not really given a lot of room to act in the first but in here she is very good. she did not play the stereotypical wife who always stands behind her husband but rather the woman with a mind of her own who is willing to go after what she feels she deserves. robert duvall again to me was the glue to the movie. just having him in there kind of makes you feel safe. john cazale also had more of an impact in here than in the first playing the half-witted brother always needing to be bailed out. a lot of these characters sound so familiar and stereotypical but in the godfather part ii every character is played out with such extraordinary depth. everyone from talia shire who gave a fine performance to lee strasberg all the way down to the kid who played young vito corleone were perfect. part ii seems to me to be more of a character study than the original. the directing once again is perfect. francis ford coppola know or at least knew how to make a movie. the first to godfather movie are done so precisely and perfectly that nothing really sticks out because they are so perfect throughout. coppola just lets his actors play everything out as he should with type of cast he has here. not to many movies can maintain such a consistent flow over 3 hours let alone even an hour and 45 minutes. the writing may not have been quite as good as the first in terms of quoting but the storyline was perfect. seeing the decisions made by new mob boss michael corleone was common sense but flashing back on vito corleone's life was genius. the storyline to me could not have been better and coppola and puzo do a great job with it all the way. like the first the cinematography was amazing but it had a slightly different tone to it. the first had more of a majestic, mythical look to it. in part ii you feel the modern times creeping in and the corleones having to adjust to it. part ii has more of a corrupt and evil twist to it but i guess the end signifies that. the music obviously the same as the first was perfect and just fit so greatly with the rest of the movie. the first to movies of the godfather series are really like the same movie. they are not the same though, they are actually very different but the greatness of them both and the continuation of the storyline from the first to the second really create a strong band between each other. to me it is only a sequel in that it was the second movie of a great series. no let downs, no disappointments just a continuation of of the greatness from the first one.";30 June 2008;10;['many', 'other', 'more', 'only', 'good', 'first', 'well', 'original', 'perfect', 'subtle', 'powerful', 'breathtaking', 'subtle', 'smooth', 'top', 'able', 'first', 'strong', 'more', 'tough', 'certain', 'first', 'good', 'stereotypical', 'own', 'willing', 'safe', 'more', 'first', 'half', 'familiar', 'stereotypical', 'such', 'extraordinary', 'fine', 'young', 'perfect', 'more', 'original', 'perfect', 'least', 'first', 'perfect', 'many', 'consistent', 'good', 'first', 'perfect', 'new', 'common', 'well', 'great', 'first', 'amazing', 'different', 'first', 'more', 'majestic', 'mythical', 'modern', 'more', 'corrupt', 'evil', 'same', 'first', 'perfect', 'fit', 'first', 'same', 'same', 'different', 'first', 'second', 'strong', 'other', 'second', 'great', 'first'];0.2813526188526188
312;tanelteder;it is by far the greatest sequel ever made to a movie. francis ford coppola has a hit jackpot yet again. the first film of the mario puzo's trilogy was a great one. some agree, some disagree, but in my opinion, part ii was even slightly better. the movie is full of same style and originality that the first film. it works for mafia film. there has been done tremendous job on set designing. especially on scenes which portray life of vito corleone at early 20's in new york. that's a wonderful piece of work. you could have no complaints at all. the screenplay is good. it shows how vito corleone started his family business, later called mafia. on the other hand, it follows life of his son michael who tries to enlarge family business to las vegas and havana. although there is no original godfather (marlon brando), his son michael (al pacino) shines. that's a statement act which became cornerstone in his career. so cool and fearless, like his father. al pacino is a deserved oscar-winner here. this is the top of the mafia films. it would be very hard to go higher here, presumably only down.;3 January 2011;8;['great', 'hit', 'first', 'great', 'well', 'full', 'same', 'first', 'tremendous', 'early', 'wonderful', 'good', 'other', 'original', 'cool', 'fearless', 'hard'];0.3494047619047619

316;Danimal-7;"i am one of the minority who like the godfather: part ii better than the original. in the first godfather, we saw michael give up his dream of an honest life to save his family and lead it back to greatness. here, we see he sacrifices everything for his family, and in the end loses even that. at the same time, we see how michael's father vito became the great don. starting out by doing his family and his fellow immigrants a great favor by eliminating the brutish, terroristic don fannucci, vito ends up merely replacing one tyrant with another in animal-farm-like style. as we see michael and vito maneuver for power against their enemies (including hyman roth, excellently played by lee strasberg), we begin to wonder how much worse the mafiosi are than the government officials who surround them. their dishonesty and their violence would hardly be out of place in many ""legitimate"" governments throughout history, and in some cases even today. as michael tells a corrupt senator played by g.d. spradlin, ""we're both part of the same hypocrisy."" (spoilers below). the ending of the godfather: part ii is one of the most poignant in history, as michael's memory flashes back to a party before he joined the military. the scene contains four men besides himself: santino, fredo, tessio, and carlo. all are dead now - three of them by michael's own order. as tessio mentions that thousands of young men are enlisting to fight the japanese after the attack on pearl harbor, santino comments, ""they're saps, because they risk their lives for strangers."" now michael, having risked his life for his family for years, finds they are strangers to him who fear and loathe him. the third part notwithstanding, the tragedy is complete. rating: **** out of ****.";2 September 1999;10;['well', 'original', 'first', 'honest', 'same', 'great', 'fellow', 'great', 'brutish', 'like', 'bad', 'many', 'legitimate', 'corrupt', 'same', 'poignant', 'dead', 'own', 'young', 'japanese', 'santino', 'third', 'complete'];0.1602941176470588
317;eddiez61;"i secretly read mario puzo's the godfather in 1974 when i was 12 after my mother prohibited me from seeing the movie. she was trying to shield me from the rough language and lurid violence. there sure was a lot of both but more so there were great characters. vivid, real, flesh and blood souls that acted on well drawn impulses and ambitions. consequences were openly inevitable but somehow jarring, devastating and poignant. historical elements were stunningly precise yet grandly broad and vast. i was entirely, absolutely overwhelmed by the visceral sensations and sprawling imagery. so this is what ""literature"" is all about. this is what ""reading"", i now understood, could be. i had been something of a sci-fi junkie previously, but from then on i was a converted disciple of the great american fable. the story was truly great and i never could have imagined a better one until i finally saw the movies. astoundingly, francis ford coppola's film adaptations surpass the novel in a few key details. the casting of al pacino as michael corleone is the single greatest improvement on the original story. where in the novel, michael is something of a strapping, virile, obviously competent man of action, coppola introduces a crucial element of doubt by way of pacino's diminutive stature. though we are told michael is a returning war hero, we are skeptical of his leadership abilities, especially in the company of such physically imposing figures as his father and oldest brother sonny. pacino's bodily disadvantage works to emphasize the complexities of his reluctance to join in the family enterprise, and makes his cerebral and emotional challenges that much more epic. the other notable improvement on the book, of course is marlon brando, who created one of the most indelible characters for the big screen. there wasn't then, nor is there now, any other person in the industry who could so monumentally fulfill the herculean task with which that character is charged. don vito corleone's function in the story is metaphorical, transcendent, mythological. he is the living embodiment of the ageless value of heritage. heritage which only endures through the tenuous bonds of family unity, but transported to a young, naive, unsympathetic land, is now being severely tested. but since godfather ii begins after the don is dead it is faced with the considerable challenge of how to maintain this crucial historical perspective. so, gf 2 immediately whisks us back into time with a vignette of vito's tragic childhood in turn-of-the-century sicily. later begins a series of flashbacks to his early manhood in new york city played by a sublimely low key robert deniro. oddly, he is not engaged in acts of wanton destruction, sociological delinquency or self indulgent pride. rather, we are casually informed of vito's entry into the underworld by way of seemingly reasonable acts. he is drawn as a man not just doing what is necessary to survive in the rough, often brutal new world, but driven by his familial responsibilities and a sense of duty to his community. the period from which we are ""flashing"" is the late 1950s and early 1960s. by butting the ""old"" up against the ""new"" we are offered a sparkling view of the clash of cultures, of just how much had changed in those few decades. this dichotomy introduces a two fold historical perspective. by way of the contrasts between early and mid century life we are being informed of our present day (1972 and after) cultural afflictions. it's a subtle, almost invisible point, but one that is, i believe, extremely profound, the central theme of the story, and even more relevant today. consider how, just one single decade after the time when the story ends to when the films were made, american life had so radically changed. now consider how much things have changed since then. while most fans of the film are impressed with the robust characters, compelling dialog and and terrific action produced with expert cinematic skill, i was even more fascinated by the film's more abstract qualities. coppola, much more so than puzo, is playing socrates here, posing a dialectic query - how is it that primal cultural tenets might survive in a climate of overwhelming opposition? francis is troubled, alarmed by the assault on vital culture that all humanity is experiencing today, and obviously very cynical that cherished and valuable, essential traditions can persist. this cynicism was a pervasive theme at the close of the sixties and it infused nearly all the great art of the time. remember, the year of the book's publication, 1969, also saw the release of ""easy rider."" not insignificantly, that too was a story of social outsiders, antiheroes colliding with an increasingly corrupt, immoral majority. this cynicism is the intellectual, psychological and emotional driving force of the the godfather i & ii, and it's the thing that kept me coming back to them, again and again. so, what for many is simply a superb, if not the greatest, gangster movie, is for me one of the finest critical views of the american way. it is, in fact, irrelevant that the corleones are mobsters, because ultimately what destroyed them is what is destroying all americans. the disintegration of the essential commitment to family and community - our succumbing to all the temptations that undermine our strengths - is our downfall. it's no coincidence that the tragedy ultimately concludes in las vegas, the spiritual center of america's true religion, the capitol city of temptation. our cultural decline has progressed to where it is now terminally incurable. great art in the service of a dying society. we have all become fredo.";18 March 2010;10;['rough', 'great', 'vivid', 'real', 'inevitable', 'jarring', 'devastating', 'poignant', 'historical', 'precise', 'broad', 'vast', 'overwhelmed', 'visceral', 'converted', 'great', 'american', 'great', 'well', 'few', 'key', 'single', 'great', 'original', 'strapping', 'virile', 'competent', 'crucial', 'diminutive', 'skeptical', 'such', 'old', 'bodily', 'cerebral', 'emotional', 'epic', 'other', 'notable', 'indelible', 'big', 'other', 'metaphorical', 'transcendent', 'mythological', 'ageless', 'tenuous', 'young', 'naive', 'unsympathetic', 'dead', 'considerable', 'crucial', 'historical', 'tragic', 'early', 'low', 'key', 'sociological', 'indulgent', 'reasonable', 'necessary', 'rough', 'brutal', 'new', 'familial', 'late', 'early', 'old', 'new', 'sparkling', 'much', 'few', 'fold', 'historical', 'early', 'mid', 'present', 'cultural', 'subtle', 'invisible', 'profound', 'central', 'relevant', 'single', 'american', 'much', 'most', 'impressed', 'robust', 'compelling', 'terrific', 'expert', 'cinematic', 'fascinated', 'abstract', 'primal', 'cultural', 'overwhelming', 'troubled', 'vital', 'cynical', 'cherished', 'valuable', 'essential', 'pervasive', 'great', 'easy', 'social', 'corrupt', 'immoral', 'intellectual', 'psychological', 'emotional', 'many', 'great', 'fine', 'critical', 'american', 'irrelevant', 'essential', 'spiritual', 'true', 'cultural', 'incurable', 'great'];0.0673989506869941

320;krumski;"as a huge fan of the original godfather, i have never understood all the hoopla about this film. a great continuation of the story? the only sequel to be better than the original? no way, on both counts - not by a long shot. first of all, the godfather is a movie that truly needs no sequel. when that door closes on kay at the end, that's it - an entire cycle has played out: power has been passed on, the new guard has superseded the old, evil has corrupted goodness and the sins of the father have come back to feast upon the sons. it is a perfect story, complete in itself and suggestive of all that is to come. anything you could add would only be elaboration, nothing genuinely new. as such, there's nothing - not one single thing - which happens in the godfather part ii that is not either already implied in the first movie or at least could be predicted by knowing the first movie. therefore, the story just doesn't feel fresh; it feels more like a ""standard"" sequel - that is, one done just for the money, to capitalize on the series while it was hot. (the true greatest sequel of all time, of course, is the empire strikes back - superceding the original in so many ways and on so many levels it's unbelievable.) now, i'll concede there's an awful lot of artistry on display in this movie - the acting is all great, the cinematography and production design, etc. it certainly doesn't have the *look* of a quickie re-hash. and you can tell that considerable time and effort has gone into the story and in the structuring of the movie. which makes its failure all the more troubling to watch. first of all, the cross-cutting between the two time periods (vito corleone in the early part of the century and michael in the late '50s) just does not work. i'll challenge anybody on this point; if you think it's a good idea, you're just wrong! i can half see what coppola had in mind here, but it's just annoying. first off, the two sequences are not equally weighted - we see far more of the ""modern day"" michael segment - and so the vito scenes come to feel more like an intrusion, a break up of the momentum of the real movie, rather than as a legitimate sequence in its own right. and frankly, it's not a legitimate sequence anyway - it's far too bathed in quaintness and romanticism, it never truly takes vito to task for the life he has chosen; in fact, it doesn't even give us a good sense of why he has chosen that life. except for the brief murder scenes, it mostly portrays vito as a hero - a robin hood of the people - and does not give a clear picture of the ruthlessness and cold-bloodedness he would have needed to build up his empire. (for a good portrait of this side of the young vito, read the chapter in the original godfather book by mario puzo which focuses upon his rise to power. compare this sequence to the movie's in order to see just how much coppola has omitted and how much he has romanticized what he's kept.) coppola wants to save all his rage and condemnation for michael, you see - almost as if the corleone crime family was kind of a mom and pop store started by the old man in the good old days, and was great and wonderful until the young whippersnapper came in with all of his newfangled ways and started screwing everything up. if michael's soul is shown as corroded by the end of the movie, why is vito not assessed in the same harsh way? after all, if not for him, his son would never have been put in this position in the first place. curiously, michael's attempts to ""go legitimate"" are portrayed as the real horror here, which is certainly an interesting idea, but i think this is a theme much better developed in the godfather part iii, where the agent of legitimacy becomes the church (the vatican), making for a much richer and headier mix. here, michael's mainly trying to buy into resorts and casinos in cuba. how interesting is that? finally, this picture moves sooooo slowly and takes so much time to tell its story (er, stories) that it becomes sleep-inducing. not enough of import happens here for the story to take as long as it does. in short, the godfather part ii is a film with an inflated sense of its own importance; the wonder is that it has suckered so many millions of people into buying into it. the godfather is a movie which truly needs no sequel, but if you feel compelled to see one, rent part iii and skip over this tired and pretentious mess.";5 February 2000;4;['huge', 'original', 'great', 'only', 'well', 'original', 'long', 'entire', 'new', 'old', 'perfect', 'complete', 'suggestive', 'new', 'such', 'single', 'first', 'least', 'first', 'fresh', 'standard', 'hot', 'true', 'great', 'many', 'many', 'unbelievable', 'awful', 'great', 'considerable', 'troubling', 'early', 'late', 'good', 'wrong', 'annoying', 'more', 'modern', 'real', 'legitimate', 'own', 'legitimate', 'good', 'brief', 'clear', 'ruthlessness', 'cold', 'good', 'young', 'original', 'much', 'much', 'corleone', 'old', 'good', 'old', 'great', 'wonderful', 'young', 'newfangled', 'same', 'harsh', 'first', 'legitimate', 'real', 'interesting', 'rich', 'headier', 'interesting', 'much', 'enough', 'short', 'inflated', 'own', 'many', 'tired', 'pretentious'];0.2063698206555349
321;krumski;"i have an earlier review of this movie posted somewhere on this site in which i pretty much deconstruct it and its status as a ""classic sequel"" and even ""a great movie."" a handful of great scenes populate it, to be sure, and a spate of fine performances (particularly a toweringly great one from pacino), but nothing that coheres into greatness - particularly as it's at the service of a turgid and convoluted plot. all of which i more or less stand by - at least as it befits my own taste and predilections. but i recently had some insight into why this sequel may be so well-respected: in its very dourness and lack of fire, it paints the unremittingly grim portrait of mafia life that many apparently felt was missing from the first godfather. i recently showed that movie to a group of my friends who had never seen it before (amazing in this day and age, no?) and they all enjoyed it - but, to a man, they felt that it definitely glorified and mythologized the violence it showed and the lifestyle it portrayed. personally, i have a hard time seeing this - and, pay attention, because i believe here lies the discrepancy between the people who love the sequel and those who don't. on the most simplistic level, if you feel the first film glorifies the mob - and feel at least slightly cheated because of it - you will most likely have an appreciation for the second film. if you feel, like i do, that the first movie sucks you into associating and sympathizing (hell, even *loving*!) these characters, but that the violence brings everything all back home and reminds you the evil and corruption which undergirds their way of life - then the second movie, though having perhaps some interesting elaborations upon this theme, offers nothing genuinely new. and is, therefore - despite all the evident care and superb craft involved - kind of a waste of time. but, since the violence and worldview depicted in the godfather is such a polarizing issue, i suppose it was a good idea that francis coppola decided to have another go at it, ramming down his point for all those who didn't get it the first time: ""the mob is bad, it corrupts your soul, and no good can come of it!"" these are good points to be made, and perhaps i shouldn't be so quick to dismiss them. i had just thought, previously, that . . . well, they're obvious (or should be, anyway - and anyone to whom they're not obvious is probably beyond all hope) and that the director had already made them once. clearly, not everyone feels the godfather makes those points cogently enough (as my friend says about the end of the first movie: ""sure, michael is cold, ruthless and lies to his wife - but damn, he's just the *man*!""). for those people, the godfather part ii exists, and that's fine. i'll never speak ill of the movie again. except for those flashback scenes - those are still terrible! either they should form a completely different movie unto themselves, or they should be cut out entirely (watching the second film as part of ""the godfather saga"", where these flashbacks have been excised, is infinitely more rewarding to me). i still don't know what function they serve - if anything, they seem a throwback to the preciousness and romanticism of the first film, except far worse, in my opinion. but no one seems to agree with me, so i'll stop beating the tune on that one . . . but as long as i'm here and have got this movie in my sights for a second time (and am inclined to dwell on its strengths rather than its faults), let me just expand upon what i said earlier about the acting: the film is a veritable master's class in great acting, coming in all shapes and varieties. the coiled intensity of pacino is complemented by an equally quiet yet forceful turn by robert duvall as tom hagen (whose work in both godfathers is some of the greatest, yet most unsung, in cinema history). lee strasberg does wonderful things with the hyman roth character, adding new layers and shadings in every scene, and his soliloquy to michael about moe greene is as dead-on perfect as anything can be in this world. similarly, michael gazzo takes a seemingly annoying and one-note character (pentangeli) and works in so much depth and humanity, that at the end he's one of your favorite people in the entire godfather story (doubly amazing, since he didn't have any automatic goodwill from the audience by being a carryover from the first film). the quiet scene between he and duvall near the end is, in some ways, the most shocking, cold-hearted and violent of the whole series - and not one weapon is drawn, the two speaking in pleasantries the entire time, barely above a murmur. this, folks, is great acting - as well as sophisticated writing, all topped off by a director who has total confidence in the audience to get it, without his having to exaggerate or accentuate a thing. this is, simply, peerless moviemaking. such peerlessness exists, for me, in doses rather than all the way through in the godfather part ii. but to extrapolate from this that the film is somehow worthless is a mistake - one i must apologize for. though i still stand by my assessment that, for me anyway, the second godfather is largely ""unnecessary"", i am more aware and sympathetic to the larger purpose it serves for a good deal of the audience. and, necessary or not, it still has on show some absolutely top-notch cinema acting, writing and directing. maybe it, unlike the first one, is an offer i *can* refuse, but having once accepted it, i'm there for the duration.";5 July 2002;4;['early', 'classic', 'great', 'great', 'sure', 'fine', 'great', 'turgid', 'convoluted', 'least', 'own', 'very', 'grim', 'many', 'first', 'amazing', 'hard', 'simplistic', 'first', 'second', 'first', 'second', 'interesting', 'new', 'evident', 'good', 'first', 'bad', 'good', 'quick', 'obvious', 'obvious', 'first', 'sure', 'cold', 'ruthless', 'fine', 'ill', 'terrible', 'different', 'second', 'rewarding', 'first', 'bad', 'second', 'inclined', 'veritable', 'great', 'quiet', 'forceful', 'great', 'unsung', 'wonderful', 'new', 'dead', 'perfect', 'annoying', 'much', 'favorite', 'entire', 'amazing', 'automatic', 'first', 'quiet', 'shocking', 'cold', 'hearted', 'violent', 'whole', 'entire', 'great', 'sophisticated', 'total', 'peerless', 'such', 'worthless', 'second', 'unnecessary', 'aware', 'sympathetic', 'large', 'good', 'necessary', 'top', 'first'];0.1166037791037791
322;g-96059;"compared with the godfather, the godfather ii is as beautiful as porcelain. this refinement is mainly reflected in the form. one of the forms is that the architecture of the story is larger, and the time and space that spans, especially the times, is more complicated than that described in the previous episodes,different from the coherent time in ""godfather"", ""godfather ii"" contains two different eras. this large span breaks through the limitations of the individual and the times, creating a sense of destiny that is endless and repeated, and the fate of the characters is placed. under the big times. it is the grand narrative necessary for the epic; in the narrative technique, the story develops from a single-line narrative to a two-line parallel narrative,the fate of the characters is placed under the great era, which is the essential grand narrative of the epic; in the narrative technique, the story from a single-line narrative into a two-line parallel narrative, telling the two generations of godfather ups and downs of the fate of the road, this approach has a formal sense of rigorous symmetry. make the story full of contrast, metaphor and symbolism.";23 March 2020;9;['beautiful', 'large', 'complicated', 'previous', 'different', 'coherent', 'different', 'large', 'endless', 'big', 'grand', 'necessary', 'narrative', 'single', 'parallel', 'great', 'essential', 'grand', 'narrative', 'single', 'parallel', 'formal', 'rigorous', 'full'];0.1497023809523809

324;Sanou_san;some bickered that godfather 2 was an insult to be called a sequel, but i don't mind them arguing such. admittedly i watched the film first before godfather 1 and was astounded with its beauty even after i watched godfather 1. i realized well after watching godfather 2 how the character of al pacino as michael corleone developed well throughout the film, and i quite grasped as well very well his character after i watched godfather 1. the film was double layered. viewers would understand in this film vito corleone's origin, how he grew and feared by many. on the other hand shows the present son of vito: michael, who is struggling to deal with his father's family business left to him. the characters and atmosphere were simply superb, and you could understand well how the story progresses. how michael got the similarity of the situation he is experiencing as contrast to his father during the early times. we see vito corleone 's life progresses during his early years, and we see michael, being the youngest of the family, adhere to his father's legacy and lived through defending his family and business. we can see how well the father and son got their similarity of managing their business and tried well not to mix family in it. i was so touched in godfather 1 concerning michael's affection to his family, most especially to his father. and i was moved with his affection towards his family now in godfather 2 after his father died how he held on what was dearly important to him. i got the bleak understanding how crime worlds works except since after i watched godfather 1. italian countrymen got their pride, their history, their nature, and mario puzo had brilliantly depicted a beautiful story out of it. funny though after i watched the film i didn't even realized that it was robert de niro who plays the part of the early vito corleone, how mesmerizing.;9 September 2009;10;['such', 'astounded', 'layered', 'many', 'other', 'present', 'superb', 'early', 'early', 'young', 'important', 'bleak', 'italian', 'beautiful', 'funny', 'early', 'mesmerizing'];0.1716666666666667

331;Magenta_Bob;"the godfather: part ii is perhaps the most famous example of a sequel generally held in as high regard as its predecessor and it's easy to see why; where part i was about michael's rise, this is about the fall which i think ceteris paribus makes for a better film. personally i think it's probably slightly weaker than part i due to the stories being a tad weaker and less focused. being 25 minutes longer, one might think that it's grander in scope or more elaborate but it really consists of two less elaborate stories; in present time, we get to follow michael corleone's aforementioned fall, while a flashback chronicles his father vito's rise to power during his formative years. that being said, the two stories are interwoven and juxtaposed quite elegantly. michael begins with getting his hand kissed as a newly appointed ""don"", and ends with him symbolically left alone at the kitchen table of a family dinner during a flashback. vito starts at rock bottom, having been made an orphan and forced to leave sicily for america, and ends up if not on the top, but then well on his way. as another contrast, we get to see shots of vito's family (including michael as a baby) flourishing right after michael's marriage is falling apart. furthermore, part ii does contain some of the best stuff of the trilogy, especially towards the last half hour or so when all story lines come together quite beautifully; the marital breakdown of michael and kay. the conversation between tom hagen and frankie pentangeli followed by the latter's suicide. the visceral and character building scene in which vito shoots fanucci. and maybe the most striking of them all the calamity of fredo's (john cazale outplaying everyone in the impeccable ensemble) death, happening off-screen as if it was too cruel to show the viewers. better or not, this is in all respects a fine continuation and expansion upon the previous film and unmissable for anyone who enjoyed part i.";27 July 2013;8;['famous', 'high', 'easy', 'well', 'weak', 'weak', 'focused', 'elaborate', 'elaborate', 'present', 'aforementioned', 'formative', 'interwoven', 'good', 'last', 'half', 'marital', 'visceral', 'striking', 'impeccable', 'cruel', 'fine', 'previous', 'unmissable'];0.1398039215686274
332;Batkid1;this movie succeeds in both quality and follow-up. the first one is, no doubt, a masterpiece that had literally no flaws, with the exception of being very one, but a lot of older films are like that so might as well get over it. this sequel is a couple of years after the original where young michael corleone just took over his late father's crime organization and, while, progressing, is also having some personal problems that interfere with his business. he has nearly been killed by a traitor within his organization, his wife is tired of living this way and ends up wanting a divorce, his sister wants to move back in, he is trying to take over a las vegas casino forcefully, etc. while some people might think this is all pointless killings and depressing tragedies, it's really all about michael and his actions which cause consequences around him. he had originally sworn not to be part of his father's illegal business and he ended up being like his dad anyway. what's also cool about this film is it also explains his late father's background, which is explained through flashbacks. it consists of vito coming to america, adopting henchmen and stopping another don from ruining his and his town's life. it's once again full of a full-star cast, excellent cinematography and scenery, courtroom drama, top-notch acting and good writing/directing.;28 October 2007;10;['first', 'old', 'original', 'young', 'late', 'personal', 'tired', 'pointless', 'depressing', 'illegal', 'cool', 'late', 'full', 'full', 'excellent', 'top', 'good'];0.1014705882352941

335;RichardKleiner;"ok. let's get real. the godfather is beyond excellent in every single way. i'm not giving comments on the godfather, because it would be almost blasphemy. nevertheless, i expected much more on part ii. personally, i didn't like it. here's the deal: the story was way too slow paced. nothing really happened. only the hit on michael's house, and the build up for young vito's story was what makes you interested. the rest is just anti-climatic and dull. the dialogs weren't as quotable or stand alone as in the first. i thought as a sad imitation of the real thing. al pacino's performance was absolutely superb. the problem wasn't that. the whole character was what failed. in the first, we get the glimpse of a warm man, but gets cold when is needed. a man who thinks before he talks. in this one, we see a man who is cold and heartless every single time you see him. he no longer has the eminence that vito corleone once had. the previous don was eminent and even though he could scare the hell out of you with his stare, you respected and looked up to him. now, his son is just pure evil. and that doesn't make sense. in the book, it's clear that michael is the living image of his father. so, what happened? him killing fredo was completely useless. even if he did betray him, there was no need to have him whacked. a don just doesn't kill anyone from his own family (not ""the family"", the real one). i know, michael did kill carlo, but let's remember he was not really family, just an in-law, and he did deserve what was coming. another thing i personally hated was what happened to connie. as you will see in the third, she radically changes from the naive don's daughter to... sorry, wrong movie. anyway, all the other aspects, (filmmaking, score, performances, photography)were indeed flawless. it's interesting. you can perfectly notice coppola's anatomy for each ""godfather"". you start with a prologue, then a religious ceremony and/or a party afterward, the plot then starts and a pivotal point is a hit on the don. the rest is a slow, yet properly thought vengeance that ends with a gigantic and operatic blood bath. however, for part ii, it wasn't's that operatic or with the same effect than part i. it was anti-climatic, and pretty disappointing. another flaw i found was that the story doesn't really stick to the book. one key aspect in the film didn't even appear in mario puzo's novel: vito corleone never returned to sicily. the name of the don who had his family killed doesn't even matter. still, the scene prominently explains don tomassino's condition from the first. now, don't get me wrong. i'm a die hard fan of ""the godfather"". i consider it to be the best movie ever (and the best novel ever, too). but part ii just doesn't do it for me.";17 November 2007;7;['real', 'excellent', 'single', 'more', 'slow', 'young', 'interested', 'anti', 'climatic', 'dull', 'quotable', 'alone', 'first', 'sad', 'real', 'superb', 'whole', 'first', 'warm', 'cold', 'cold', 'heartless', 'single', 'corleone', 'previous', 'eminent', 'pure', 'clear', 'useless', 'own', 'real', 'third', 'naive', 'sorry', 'wrong', 'other', 'flawless', 'interesting', 'religious', 'pivotal', 'slow', 'gigantic', 'operatic', 'operatic', 'same', 'anti', 'climatic', 'disappointing', 'key', 'first', 'wrong', 'die', 'hard', 'good', 'good'];0.064010989010989
336;BiiivAL;"the second part of the family crime saga about the mafia of the corleone clan was an event that was widely celebrated in the cinema. in particular, six oscar awards and a recommendation of prestigious cinematographic universities where our vgik enters, but the main thing is not this, but that after forty years this film is watched and is still being revised, and in terms of staging a frame and accents, many contemporaries have much to learn from the maestro the corypoles. as far as i heard, the director was not going to be engaged in the second film and the studio had to make concessions, in particular in the history of vittorio it was partly to address the source, and the story of michael's becoming as godfather had to be fully compiled. i finally looked at the second film and i want to share my impressions and thoughts on this matter. the second film was no less a legend than the original, not only having earned a well-deserved viewer's success and recognition of the members of the american film academy, but also entering the history of cinema as the best ""sequel"" of all time, in a number of polls - even bypassing the brilliant first picture. it was with the ""godfather, part ii"" began the general fashion of assigning continuations in the headings of serial numbers written in latin or arabic numerals. coppola and puzo deliberately sacrificed the dynamic development of the plot, placing a stake on ""epic breathing"", amazingly conveys the scale of personalities - a special kind of titans, from each decision whose lives depend. even the griffith principle of the ""cross"" installation comparison of the vicissitudes of the fate of the founder of a powerful family who fled from his native sicily and with great difficulty conquering authority in america, and his heir does not contribute to an increase, so to speak, the speed of rotation of the flywheel of history. the denouement is constructed in such a way that, inevitably recalling the final frames of the original, holds, rather, the opposite thought. the next cycle does not end, when you almost physically feel the change of the ""spiral coil"", which knocks everyone: from the exiled coroleone rivals to the last close person, eliminated for the committed treachery. on the contrary, everything returns to its own place, as if an unperformed prophecy is being fulfilled, or the fate enters into rights, allowing for the time being to be illusions about free will. the final turns into a start, the ghosts of the past briefly come to life at a festive family table, and michael's strong words sound even more dramatic and naive, outraged by his father's agreement with tom hagen: ""i have my own plans for my future."" further - silence ... at the same time, the first and second (as well as the third, released after a decade and a half) parts are not so much refuted as complement one another. the authors, as if expanding the initial socio-philosophical premises, are no longer limited to analyzing the actual functioning of the mechanism of the mafia ""family"", even significantly increasing the scale: forcing michael to defend honor at hearings in the senate and acquainting himself with the international interests of corleone, as if it is a full-fledged transnational corporation. the opening of the sources of the power of vito andolini, on the one hand, based on the centuries-old patriarchal traditions of sicily, proved to be stronger and more effective than modern state institutions, and on the other hand acting under pressure of circumstances, adapting to the brutal realities of the poor new york quarter. however, it can not be considered a coincidence that a memorable musical leitmotif permeates inexpressibly disturbing notes, accurately warning of the omnipotence of rock. from the interesting is also the concept of unfolding two plot layers, where in parallel with michael is shown also the history of the formation of witto, in order to better show us the father's features in the son, and the son could show the paternal character. the evolution of the mafia is visible in a huge conglomerate that has engulfed the whole of america and many infrastructures are in their hands, these people have a huge influence on politicians and other power-holders. from the philosophical point of view, this film is about how difficult it is to become an independent leader, how to show that you do not attach yourself to the glory of the father, but you yourself are able to make weighted and complicated decisions. in this respect, the drama of michael corleone, whose marital status at first was shaky, and the other clans conceived the evil, worked well ... actor's works leave no doubt that before you the screen life, when the human pain is reflected on the faces of the actors. al pacino is great in the role of michael, the warm heart gives way to the pragmatism inherent in the head of the mafia clan. young vittorio performed by robert de niro was able to show charm and become the future of don with him, too, there were many events that change character. all the actors here are in unity and show how it is necessary to plunge into the role, in all to see a lot of work for what each of the actors thank you very much. verifying: a great movie that is recommended to watch everyone as an example of clear, competent and well-coordinated work of the creators' team, the whole mechanism works like a clock and as a result of hard work we get no less legendary film, somewhere even ahead of the original. timing mastodon (202 minutes) does not interfere with perceiving history and imbued with the content of the saga. such films are not at once to understand their greatness and strength to be reviewed and analyzed, but this film (like the whole trilogy) should not pass you by. all good and pleasant viewing!";3 June 2018;8;['second', 'corleone', 'particular', 'oscar', 'prestigious', 'cinematographic', 'main', 'many', 'much', 'second', 'particular', 'second', 'second', 'less', 'original', 'deserved', 'good', 'brilliant', 'first', 'general', 'serial', 'arabic', 'dynamic', 'epic', 'special', 'griffith', 'cross', 'powerful', 'native', 'great', 'final', 'original', 'opposite', 'next', 'spiral', 'coroleone', 'last', 'close', 'committed', 'own', 'unperformed', 'free', 'final', 'festive', 'strong', 'dramatic', 'naive', 'own', 'same', 'first', 'second', 'third', 'initial', 'limited', 'actual', 'international', 'transnational', 'old', 'patriarchal', 'strong', 'effective', 'modern', 'other', 'brutal', 'poor', 'memorable', 'musical', 'interesting', 'paternal', 'visible', 'huge', 'many', 'huge', 'other', 'philosophical', 'difficult', 'independent', 'able', 'weighted', 'complicated', 'marital', 'shaky', 'other', 'human', 'great', 'warm', 'inherent', 'young', 'able', 'many', 'necessary', 'great', 'clear', 'competent', 'whole', 'hard', 'legendary', 'original', 'such', 'whole', 'good', 'pleasant'];0.1833634719710668

346;Diablo1616;when i watched this movie i was amazed how robert de niro nailed the role of don vito corleone. it could be a pressure for any actor to play a role which has previously played by a famous and good actor before and much problem to play younger vito was that it was played by the god of cinema: marlon brando but bob de niro didn't hesitate or felt under pressure for a single moment in the movie. and some times he was even better than brando himself. michael corleone's life story after being the godfather was brilliant written and well played by al pacino. a man who tried to protect his family and get in the line of work he despised most and some where he started to enjoy it. this was the fate of michael in this segment. from being a sad army veteran to a necerary devil but in this movie he was a satan who doesn't want to give up power and would do anything to protect his father's legacy and his crime empire. in this movie you would also like the match cut between vito's timeline and michael's timeline. a cameo from james caan as sonny in the end of movie was very soothing and robert duvall as tom hagen was brilliant again. francis ford coppola should be given all kind of accolades for making the godfather part one and two;20 April 2020;9;['amazed', 'famous', 'good', 'much', 'young', 'single', 'well', 'brilliant', 'most', 'sad', 'necerary', 'soothing', 'brilliant'];0.3785714285714285

348;canadude;*spoilers* i recently decided to give godfather part ii a second try (no pun intended) and i still must say that i like part i more. there are several reasons for this and normally i would avoid talking about a movie's predecessor in reviewing it, but it is a *sequel*, and it's called godfather part ii, not godfather ii. this, of course, implies a direct connection not only to the characters, but also to the story of the first one. so - the second part is both a prequel and a sequel merged into one movie. it's a great prequel in that it tells the story of the rise of vito carleone so naturally and realistically that the metamorphosis from boy to gangster is seamless. de niro is phenomenal as michael's father, a role performed almost entirely in italian (hardly a handicap for de niro whose first language [i believe] is english). he has the emotional range that al pacino had in the first godfather. from extreme benevolence, even grief (fredo gets sick vs. old don carleone in the first movie gets sick) he turns to cold-blooded, calculated murder. however, godfather part ii focuses primarily on michael, telling his story as both a continuation of the first part's tale and as an antithesis to vito carleone's rise to power. in that, godfather part ii is one of the best sequel's ever made, it fleshes out the original story and it adds more plot and character depth to the original. the movie doesn't serve at all as a money-making scheme, but rather a second part of a book that's already got you hooked. still, i belong to the group of the purists, those who enjoy the first part more than the second. while godfather part i portrays michael's almost unknowing (definitely subtle) takeover of the family, godfather part ii already finds him knowing his way around the family, capable of doing anything to his enemies. it's about michael's complete collapse - he murders or gets rid of virtually every person in the movie, including (most tragically) his own brother, ultimately alienating himself from the family he seeks to protect. the tragedy here, however, is in some sense less subtle and nuanced than the tragedy of godfather part i, which is about a deep and complex father-son relationship that foretells its own ending. there exists an element of love and responsibility that naturally leads to and cannot escape from michael's return to his family. godfather part ii re-examines these themes (which detracts from some of its originality - but that is hardly a complaint), but michael's character has somehow shed any notion of mercy or restraint. in fact, he does not change in any significant way, but merely continues down the path the first film set for him. the murder of his brother is simply yet another point of no return, much like the scene with the doors closing on diane keaton's character ending the first film. in any case, my point is that the michael carleone section of godfather part ii is mostly an entertainingly told story that expands on what was already introduced in the first film, which i believe is much stronger. the best part of godfather part ii is de niro's performance, and its contrasting role in michael's descent into continuing alienation and violence. (and of course it is remarkably directed by francis ford coppola, with a good performance by al pacino, but it remains in the shadow of the first godfather - inevitably so.);15 February 2004;10;['second', 'several', 'direct', 'first', 'second', 'prequel', 'great', 'prequel', 'carleone', 'seamless', 'phenomenal', 'italian', 'first', 'english', 'emotional', 'first', 'extreme', 'sick', 'old', 'first', 'sick', 'cold', 'blooded', 'first', 'good', 'original', 'more', 'original', 'second', 'hooked', 'first', 'more', 'second', 'unknowing', 'subtle', 'capable', 'complete', 'own', 'subtle', 'nuanced', 'deep', 'complex', 'own', 'significant', 'first', 'first', 'first', 'strong', 'good', 'contrasting', 'good', 'first'];0.1622294372294372

351;donuthaters12;"this film is a sequel to one of the most celebrated films of the 70's. a lot of people would give this full marks but i for one did not think this held up along with the first film. i think maybe chinatown or the conversation should have maybe won the academy award for best picture. this film is a continuation of michael corleone's position as the don and detailing on his goal to make the corleone family legitimate. at the same time, it also shows the beginnings of vito corleone. this is, for me, where the good and the bad side of the film is apparent. i'm going to start with the bad side. what made the film so great was that it was really a focus on family and the culture of the italian people. this film feels like it just focuses on michael and the consequences of his actions, the destruction of relationships and the creation of enemies. the business being focused on in this film, in michael's story, doesn't work a lot for me as i find it a little boring. hyman roth is so dull as a villain that i did not care whether or not he succeeds or fails. the good side of the film is the focus on vito corleone's rise in new york in the early 20th century. it's very fascinating on how he became who he is as it's supported with an interesting villain, fannuci. the crumbling of michael's soul is definitely an aspect that i liked, as we felt that he has definitely changed since the beginning of the first film; but i wish the story behind it was just stronger. coppola did not exactly screw this film up, it's definitely strong and the more you watch it the stronger it gets but i felt his work on the first was most definitely his best within the trilogy. it was brilliant on how he decided to have this film edited. juxtaposing the rise of both father and son and how different in the direction both of them go, gives it much more weight and effect. the man pretty much made a sequel and prequel at the same time and not be a disappointment. gordon willis, like in the first film, creates this feeling of an old photograph due to the image giving off this golden hue. the film really feels like a period film, and it helps us feel like we are watching a film created in that time. i guess willis didn't really get much from this film compared to the first because it's not something new. nevertheless the photography is still strong even today. the music here is a little different and at times a little darker but that's just because of michael's fall from grace. it still has that iconic music by nino nota from the first film and when it appears, you get this feeling of nostalgia. the acting was excellent as expected. pacino was able to make this character who was frightening without doing much. there are many moments where this guy feels really ruthless. the supporting cast was also great like the first film but there is a shift in focus on michael rather than the whole family. in the flashback sequences, robert de niro was the only one really focused on and the rest had very little to do. de niro may have gained more popularity in scorsese's mean streets but i think this is where he really shines and where everybody took notice of him. lee strasberg was fine in playing a villain who really doesn't do a lot, he doesn't even feel threatening but gaston moschin as fanuuci was fantastic. the man showed the he owns this side of town and everybody must respect him or else. overall they are all deserving of credit. i may be a minority who think this film is not a masterpiece but i just do not find it as strong as the first as michael's storyline felt flat. the flashback storyline and terrific acting and direction makes this film a must watch.";11 July 2013;8;['celebrated', 'full', 'first', 'good', 'corleone', 'legitimate', 'same', 'bad', 'apparent', 'bad', 'great', 'italian', 'little', 'boring', 'dull', 'good', 'early', 'fascinating', 'interesting', 'first', 'strong', 'strong', 'strong', 'first', 'good', 'brilliant', 'different', 'more', 'prequel', 'same', 'first', 'old', 'golden', 'much', 'first', 'new', 'strong', 'little', 'different', 'little', 'dark', 'iconic', 'first', 'excellent', 'able', 'frightening', 'much', 'many', 'ruthless', 'great', 'first', 'whole', 'only', 'little', 'more', 'mean', 'fine', 'fantastic', 'strong', 'first', 'flat', 'terrific'];0.1831671982987772

357;Surecure;it can easily be argued that the godfather part 2 is the greatest sequel ever crafted in the history of film, and possibly a better film than its predecessor. it is always a difficult task to better a film in its sequel, doubly so when the original film is a masterpiece of cinematic perfection such as the godfather was. however, francis ford coppola proved that it is possible to improve on perfection. the godfather part ii is brilliant in the counterpoint created between vito corleone's rise to power and michael corleone's tragic fall from grace. each character does what they must in order to strengthen the corleone family. but, michael's failures are made even more tragic when juxtaposed against vito's successes. whereas vito was able to strengthen his family's bonds, michael frays them to tragic ends. coppola yet again proves his understanding of the relationship between camera and performance. it is not enough to have a lush cinematic experience without engaging performances, and coppola is able to achieve this masterful balance. the performances by the entire cast are as picture perfect as is possible, and the interaction between even the smallest roles are pristine. noteworthy is the scene in the washington hotel where kaye (diane keaton) opens the eyes of michael (al pacino) to the depths their relationship has achieved. it remains one of the most powerfully performed scenes to ever have been captured on film. like it's predecessor, the godfather part ii is one of those rare moments of cinematic perfection, well deserving of its place of reverence in the history of film.;24 May 2005;10;['great', 'well', 'difficult', 'well', 'original', 'cinematic', 'such', 'possible', 'brilliant', 'tragic', 'corleone', 'tragic', 'able', 'tragic', 'enough', 'lush', 'cinematic', 'able', 'masterful', 'entire', 'perfect', 'possible', 'small', 'pristine', 'noteworthy', 'rare', 'cinematic', 'deserving'];0.133695652173913

359;dannyrovira-38154;"francis ford coppola's classic sprawling epic masterpiece of great artistic vision which is undeniably the finest sequel ever made. it is a brilliant continuation to what surely is the greatest gangster saga of all-time, it tells the tale of two generations of the corleone family; that of michael corleone, played brilliantly by al pacino in phenomenal oscar nominated performance, who has now consolidated the power handed down to him by his father the late don vito corleone, and that of the early life of young don vito, played magnificently by robert deniro in a breakout oscar winning performance of great dignity. this epic shows in flashbacks the on going story of the embattled family after don vito's death, and the way young vito struggles to make a living for his family in new york's little italy in 1917, where he meets and befriends a young neighborhood thief named peter clemenza, superbly played by the late bruno kirby, and together with a few associates they begin their criminal operations of petty thievery, but vito is always looking out and helping the people around their neighborhood. vito is forced to kill the local black hand boss, the brutal don fanucci, played solidly by the late gastone moschin, who wants a piece of the action from vito and his partners. don fanucci is also a snake that oppresses and victimizes his own people in the neighborhood, shaking them down for what little money they may have. with don fanucci's murder vito's communal stature grows as does his power, shift to 1958 where don michael corleone is now based in lake tahoe and rules his vast empire with an iron fist. he is increasing distrustful and paranoid, and has become cold, ruthless and unemotional. an attempted assassination makes michael realizes that hyman roth, played terrifically by the late lee strasberg in oscar nominated performance, who is an old ally that once worked for his father is now trying kill him. michael must also find the traitor in his family, as well as deal with a federal indictment, and his failing marriage to kay adams, played wonderfully by diane keaton. there are tremendous supporting performances by robert duvall, john cazale, talie shire, michael v. gazzo, g.d. spradlin, richard bright, marianna hill and dominic chianese. masterful oscar winning direction by coppola, with extraordinary cinematography by the late great gordon willis, a complex and vivid oscar winning screenplay by francis ford coppola and mario puzo, a lavish oscar winning production design by dean tavoulars, and a dynamic oscar winning original score by nino rota & carmine coppola. this american cinematic classic won 6 academy awards including best picture and best director: francis ford coppola.";13 January 2021;10;['classic', 'epic', 'great', 'artistic', 'fine', 'brilliant', 'great', 'corleone', 'phenomenal', 'late', 'early', 'great', 'young', 'little', 'young', 'late', 'few', 'criminal', 'petty', 'local', 'black', 'brutal', 'late', 'own', 'little', 'communal', 'vast', 'distrustful', 'paranoid', 'cold', 'ruthless', 'unemotional', 'late', 'old', 'federal', 'tremendous', 'dominic', 'masterful', 'extraordinary', 'late', 'great', 'complex', 'vivid', 'lavish', 'dynamic', 'original', 'good', 'good'];0.1222222222222222
360;Pierre_D;"the godfather part ii is a tale of two cities, new york at the turn of the 20th century and mid century lake tahoe where vito and michael corleone's stories unfold. much less violent than its predecessor, part ii focuses on michael's abandonment by family, friends and eventual retreat into himself. our feature starts in sicily them moves to new york, focusing on young vito corleone and his orphaned youth. he's said to be ""dumb"" because he never expresses himself, but you can see his furtive eyes observing everything and his open ears listening to every detail. vito leaves sicily orphaned and bereft of siblings, all of them dead at the hands of the local mob boss. he makes a new life for himself in new york, raising a family and overtaking a mob lord with quick wit and a quicker trigger finger. these scenes in 1910ish new york are superb, from the theatre to the grandiosity of the mob to the rigours of health in that area (fredo is born with pneumonia, for example) but our future godfather survives it all, to his credit. in present day michael tries to solidify his empire through backroom deals, treachery and the disintegration of his family unit and friends. with hyman roth (a florida mobster), he makes inroads into fertile cuba but he and his family almost perish in a hit at his own home. everyone turns on michael, from a jealous fredo (older brother given no responsibility) to an estranged kay (who aborts his second son as she doesn't want to contribute to the mob nightmare any longer) to his mob associates. the only one who comes close to ""redeeming"" himself is frank pentangeli , the key witness for a senate investigating committee into the corleone's business who recants on the stand when a long-lost brother appears at the tribunal. in the end, michael is alone with his son anthony while kay and their daughter is gone, fredo dead, the mob dispersed and the corleone clan expanding from vegas to cuba to tahoe to who knows where...this chapter is excellent, even surpassing the original in some spots in character development and analysis. recommend highly, but see the godfather first.";27 May 2012;9;['mid', 'violent', 'eventual', 'young', 'dumb', 'furtive', 'open', 'bereft', 'dead', 'local', 'new', 'quick', 'quick', 'superb', 'future', 'present', 'fertile', 'perish', 'own', 'jealous', 'old', 'estranged', 'second', 'only', 'frank', 'key', 'alone', 'dead', 'corleone', 'excellent'];0.0918109668109668
361;jbirks106;"the original ""godfather"" created the template for every mob movie thereafter. gangsters previously were either celebrated or loathed, but never well understood. then ""bonnie and clyde,"" released five years earlier, attempted to humanize criminals by showing not only the spectacular bank heists and subsequent car chases, but also the mundane, banal and tragic nature of such a lifestyle. but b&c weren't mafiosi. ""godfather"" portrayed the mafia as a unique and fascinating subset of society. along with the requisite violence, we see the gangsters with their families, at weddings and christenings, or planning a multiple murder over takeout chinese. most of all, it is a portrait of michael corleone, the war hero and prodigal son, who returns to the fold and ends up running the show. in ""godfather ii"" michael is running much more than a crime family. he's a big shot whose son's first communion is celebrated by senators and other luminaries. as hyman roth famously tells him, ""michael, we're bigger than us steel."" but his personal life is disintegrating. michael has promised kay, his wife, that he's ""going legitimate"" but it's clearly not working, and we wonder about the sincerity of the promise. the family narrowly escapes a hit following the communion ceremony, initiating a series of retributions that we know will not stop. meanwhile, a series of flashbacks to sicily show vito, the paterfamilias, as a young boy who himself survives an assassination attempt (his mother is not so lucky), sails to america and sets himself up as a street hood who through guile and guts takes over the neighborhood rackets. he is respected and feared, but he's not without compassion. when his wife tells him of a friend who's having trouble keeping her apartment, vito intervenes on her behalf. he didn't have to do it, and there's really nothing in it for him. this is the central contrast in the film. vito is undoubtedly a criminal who'll kill anyone in his way, but there's a humanity behind his calculations. michael, who disdains his criminal family at the beginning of ""godfather i"" and shows a naive, even playful side, has lost his humanity by the end of that picture, and that hardness only deepens in ""godfather ii"". the only glimpse we see of that earlier man occurs in a scene with his mother, in which he asks how his father kept the family together. it's a rare example of self-doubt in an otherwise scheming, manipulative and deeply cynical personality. when he learns that his weak older brother, fredo, helped set up the botched lake tahoe hit, he permits him to live, but only while their mother lives. by the end of the movie michael has lost his family (his natural one), and any remnant of human feeling. the structure of ""godfather ii"" is problematic for me. the repeated flashbacks to the young vito, while engaging, interrupt the flow of the film. that this is a strategic error on coppolla's part was demonstrated when one of the networks aired a miniseries, ""the godfather saga"" a few years after the sequel. it took a strictly chronological approach: beginning with scenes of young vito in sicily from ""godfather ii"" and then continuing with ""godfather i"". (some scenes were edited or omitted entirely, in conformance with network tv standards, while others not appearing in the films were included.) this merging of narratives conveyed all the power of both movies without the distracting flashback device to form a much more coherent whole. what to say about the cast of ""godfather ii""? it is uniformly excellent. deniro's vito is pitch-perfect. keaton's performance as kay is striking in its nuanced disaffection as she grows to realize that her husband has no inclination to go straight. dominic chianese gives a strong performance as johnny ola, a quarter-century ahead of junior soprano. michael v. gazzo, as the harried, doomed frankie pentangeli, won a supporting-actor nod, and his might be the best performance of the film. talia shire, as sister connie, shines as the floozy who -- like michael in the first film -- finally returns to the fold. but it's pacino and cazale who really carry this picture. theirs is a complex, combustible relationship: the strong, ruthless younger brother and the skittish, increasingly resentful older brother share two memorable, but radically different, scenes. in the first, fredo has just arrived in havana with roth's $2 million. they repair to a street cafe for daiquiris as michael pretends to confide in fredo -- in fact everything he says is a lie. but fredo is appreciative of the confidence and regrets that the two never spoke so intimately before. later, after fredo stupidly reveals to michael his association with roth and ola, michael severs their relationship in the harshest terms. fredo is practically recumbent in his chair, even as he insists that ""i'm smart! not stupid like everybody says. i want respect!"" but he's not smart: he's a dead man, and everybody knows it but him. cazale plays the pathos for all it's worth. the film ends with yet another flashback. it's christmas, and the brothers have planned a welcome-home for the don (never seen). michael announces that he's joining the army, winning congratulations from fredo, bewilderment from tom, and scorn from sonny. this is evidently michael's reverie, perhaps driven by the guilt of killing fredo and his brutal treatment of kay. flash to present: michael is seated outside his tahoe estate, his only companions the fallen leaves whipping around his feet. it's a real tour de force, this movie. it is flawed in its conception but brilliant in its execution. i can see why many people think it's the best sequel ever, even better than the original. i just can't take it that far. it may be the best sequel, but it nonetheless suffers by comparison to its predecessor.";27 July 2014;9;['original', 'spectacular', 'subsequent', 'mundane', 'banal', 'tragic', 'unique', 'fascinating', 'requisite', 'multiple', 'chinese', 'most', 'prodigal', 'more', 'big', 'first', 'other', 'big', 'personal', 'legitimate', 'young', 'lucky', 'central', 'criminal', 'naive', 'playful', 'only', 'early', 'rare', 'scheming', 'manipulative', 'cynical', 'weak', 'old', 'botched', 'natural', 'human', 'problematic', 'young', 'strategic', 'few', 'chronological', 'young', 'coherent', 'excellent', 'perfect', 'nuanced', 'dominic', 'strong', 'junior', 'good', 'first', 'complex', 'combustible', 'strong', 'ruthless', 'young', 'skittish', 'resentful', 'old', 'memorable', 'different', 'first', 'appreciative', 'harsh', 'recumbent', 'smart', 'stupid', 'smart', 'dead', 'worth', 'welcome', 'brutal', 'present', 'only', 'real', 'flawed', 'brilliant', 'many', 'good', 'well', 'original', 'good'];0.1282106782106782

367;YellowManReanimated;"how do you follow up a film as accomplished as the godfather? how can you progress a narrative which already seems so complete? well, the answer, it turned out, was to tell a story which presented both a new beginning and a new ending to the godfather story by drawing on the events of the first film whilst combining and connecting the events of the second in subtle, poetic ways. the story of the first film was about the passing of the torch, the second juxtaposes the lives of the torch passer and torch receiver as it focuses on both the young vito corleone: an immigrant forced into exile who, in order to survive and live a life of dignity, takes the pragmatic and courageous decision to turn to organised crime, and his son, michael corleone, a man who, tiring of his and his family's precarious life in new york, has decided to reinvent the rules of mob warfare. via rivers of blood and ruthless violence he has carved out a new path in a new part of america: a place where the traditions and customs of little italy have been left behind forever: a place where he now finds himself a stranger, exiled from the old world, grimly tolerated by the new. we see vito's rise as a product of his connection to his sicilian roots, we see michael's fall as a result of his inability to meaningfully exist in either new or old america. he is neither sicilian nor american, he is something in-between, an outsider, an exception, a lone-wolf who has been charged with leading the pack. his determination, calcuation and intelligence sees that he survives, but his growing sense of dislocation leads to the antipathy and bitterness which means that each step along his path there is less to be gained by his survival. live, he might, but he shall never prosper. the film succeeds so well because, once again, it is a brilliant character study of both don vito and don michael, played superlatively by robert de niro and al pacino, which this time dresses itself in the garb of a morality tale. on a superficial level, vito's rise is represented as heroic and wholesome, while michael's schemes seem bitter and destructive. if vito is the hero and michael is the villain, michael must have lost his way somewhere. yes, but it's deeper than that. michael is necessary to his father's legacy. had michael not taken action, his father and his family would have been destroyed many years ago. the true consequences of don vito's life do not fall on his own head, he retired and then died before that could happen; it was michael who had to pay his father's true debts, his father's life and everything his father had built becomes his responsibility once he becomes the agent of its continuation. this isn't cinema's greatest tragedy simply because of michael's nature but because of the nature of the wider story in which michael finds himself a key and essentially always reluctant player. both vito and michael do the same thing, they both do what they perceive to be their duty: vito does his duty and spends his life surrounded by his family before dying as a figure of reverance. michael does his duty and his reward is isolation and suffering. a family is gained only to be lost, it's the son who must bear witness and continue to realise the sins of the father.";17 August 2021;10;['complete', 'new', 'new', 'first', 'second', 'subtle', 'poetic', 'first', 'second', 'passer', 'young', 'pragmatic', 'courageous', 'precarious', 'ruthless', 'new', 'new', 'little', 'old', 'new', 'sicilian', 'new', 'old', 'antipathy', 'less', 'brilliant', 'superficial', 'heroic', 'wholesome', 'bitter', 'destructive', 'deep', 'necessary', 'many', 'true', 'own', 'true', 'great', 'wide', 'key', 'reluctant', 'same'];0.1153236914600551

382;Teyss;"many reviews have been written about ""the godfather: part ii"" (g2) so i will only focus on two items: links with <a href=""/title/tt0068646/"">the godfather (1972)</a> (g1) and structure of the movie. a degraded ""godfather part i"" there are many correspondences between g2 and g1: g2 references to various elements from the previous movie, yet in a degraded and sombre mode, illustrating the contrast between vito's social ascension and michael's moral downfall. here are just key examples. <ul><li>g1 opens on an exterior wedding party; inside vito's office, people ask for his help and present their respects. / g2 (after the prologue in sicily) opens on an exterior communion party; inside michael's office, the latter is insulted by the senator.-</li><li>g1: the horse is decapitated and his head put into the producer's bed to scare him. / g2: a prostitute is massacred, her bleeding body lying in bed, to frame the senator. despite being less graphic, this scene is more shocking than the previous one.-</li><li>g1: the corleones receives two fishes indicating luca brasi ""sleeps with the fishes"". / g2: fredo's body will be thrown into the lake amongst the fishes he used to take.-</li><li>g1: at vito's funeral attendance is high; everyone including other mafia families is united and acts in a friendly way (although this hides a plot to assassinate michael). / g2: at carmella's funeral attendance is lower; michael first refuses to see fredo, then agrees, however the truce will be short.-</li><li>g1 ends with parallel editing alternating between michael's godson's baptism and the murders of five mafia heads. this is only partly shocking since they are criminals and intended to kill michael anyhow. / g2 ends on parallel editing alternating between three pathetic murders while fredo says the prayer ""hail mary"": a terminally ill old man (roth), an old man by proxy (pentangeli's suicide), michael's own brother (fredo).-</li><li>at the very end of g1, michael is in the house surrounded by his family and his men; the scene is bright. / in the last shot of g2, michael is alone outside only surrounded by dead leaves; the scene is dark.-</li><li>g1: the final shot shows michael's hitman closing the door on kay. / g2: michael himself closes the door on kay, preventing her from kissing her children goodbye.-</li><li>overall, g1 chronology is linear. / g2 presents a fragmented timeline with many flashbacks and sequences of variable lengths (see below).-</li><li>g1 includes dark scenes (vito's office, the restaurant at night, etc.) but actually more bright ones, notably the entire part in sicily. some bright scenes even depict a bleak story: paulie's murder, sonny's shooting, vito's death, vito's funeral, carlo's murder. / g2 opens on a very dark scene, albeit short (michael in his office) and has many more dark ones, to the point we sometimes do not see the actors' eyes.-</li><li>in g1, the weather is frequently sunny and warm. / g2 shows snowy exteriors and ends in autumn with dead leaves covering the immense garden.-</li><li>regarding soundtrack, the famed and beautiful ""love theme"" played at length in g1 is only briefly played once in g2 (appropriately when vito returns to sicily).</li></ul> remarkable structure below is the organisation of the movie with the rounded lengths. it alternates 7 ""present"" sequences and 6 flashbacks: <ul><li>a - 1958: michael in his office (1')</li><li>b - 1901: vito in sicily then ellis island (10')</li><li>c - 1958: michael in tahoe (32')</li><li>d - 1917: vito in new york (16')</li><li>e - 1958-59: michael in usa then cuba (51')</li><li>f - 1917: vito in new york (16')</li><li>g - 1959: senate hearings (7')</li><li>h - 1920: vito in new york (7')</li><li>i - 1959: senate hearings (23')</li><li>j - 1925: vito in sicily (7')</li><li>k - 1959: carmella's funeral, final murders (21')</li><li>l - 1941: vito's surprise party (4')</li><li>m - 1959: michael alone in his garden (1')</li></ul>then closing credits (5') for a total of 3h22. flashbacks represent a cumulated length of just one hour but cover a long period of time (1901 to 1941). by contrast, present sequences last for two hours and a quarter yet only span a year and a half (mid-1958 to end-1959): we feel there is a progression in vito's story while michael's is stagnating, and in some ways regressing. indeed, the last scene loops with the first one: both are short, dark and silent showing a close-up of michael's face on the right; yet while in the first michael was respected and protected by his house, in the last he is alone and exposed to the outside world. also, all flashbacks involving the young vito (b, d, f, h, j) have a comparable length: from 7 to 16 minutes. some are even equal: 7 minutes (h, j), 16 minutes (d, f). this creates a sense of stability as we follow vito's evolution. by contrast, present sequences have very different lengths: from less than one minute (a, m) to 51 (e). this generates uncertainty and instability on line with michael's dangerous and immoral evolution. of course we don't watch a movie looking at a timer but we intuitively feel its rhythm. last, the same way part ii is a degraded version of ""the godfather"" as we saw, contemporary parts are a degraded version of flashbacks. this is notably illustrated by transitions between sequences, highlighting contrasts between present and past. (the only exception is the transition between parts b and c which highlights continuity: insert indicating ""vito corleone (...)"" -&gt; insert indicating ""his grandson anthony vito corleone (...)"".) <ul><li>c: father and son (michael and anthony) are together, yet in a difficult situation since their house was assaulted -&gt; d: father and son (vito and sonny) as well as carmella are together in a happy mood.-</li><li>d: vito and his family are again together -&gt; e: michael has to go away from his family.-</li><li>e: michael learns kay had a miscarriage, hence they lost a child -&gt; f: baby fredo has pneumonia but will survive.-</li><li>f: vito is with his family, michael in his arms; it is a happy scene -&gt; g: michael is alone in the snow then has to face the senate hearings where the word ""family"" is used pejoratively to designate the mafia.-</li><li>g: michael talks to his mother, he is scared about losing his family -&gt; h: vito's power is growing, he is building a family both as a father and as a mafia head.-</li><li>h: vito sets up genco company which will make him powerful -&gt; i: michael could lose everything at the senate hearings.-</li><li>i: kay tells michael she aborted; they will separate -&gt; j: vito surrounded by his family goes back to his roots in sicily.-</li><li>j: vito kills don ciccio avenging his family and leaves sicily; for him it is an appropriate end of an era -&gt; k: michael's mother is dead; it is a sad end of an era.-</li><li>k: there are three murders, of which fredo's -&gt; l: the family is gathered around the table, including fredo.-</li><li>l: the gathered family happily sings for vito; then there is a shot of baby michael in vito's arms waving goodbye from the noisy train (same as end of j) -&gt; m: michael is alone and silent in his garden.</li></ul> pivotal ending the penultimate scene depicting vito's birthday (l) is especially compelling. at the end of k, michael is alone in his house after fredo's assassination; he remembers with nostalgia that party were the family was gathered: it is the only flashback based on michael's memory since the other ones illustrate vito's life. it started joyfully, however gradually became grim. for starters, michael had an argument with sonny and tom about joining the army. ironically, fredo was the only one supporting him, precisely that brother he just killed. and out of the nine persons present, we realise six are now dead, either naturally (vito, carmella) or murdered (sonny), including by michael himself (tessio, carlo, fredo). the table then progressively became empty: a metaphor of the plot where characters are eliminated one after the other. at the end michael remained alone while the family sung ""for he's a jolly good fellow"" off-screen, a perfect counterpoint to his past and present situations. the flashback hence only makes complete sense at the end: it does not come to michael's mind because he is trying to revive a family feeling as we think at the beginning, but because he associates his present solitude with what he then experienced. this scene is pivotal not only to the movie but to the entire trilogy: we better understand michael. first, he remembers it during a key moment of his life: he is as powerful as ever, having diversified his empire, dodged the senate hearings and eliminated his enemies, yet also as lonely as ever, divorced, with a reduced family and children who cannot be completely happy. second, it was a key moment in itself: michael for the first and last time diverged from his family, just before going to war. when he returns four years later, he progressively embraces their business. so michael is now wondering: was i right to try another way, only to come back later on? or should have i permanently diverged at the risk of losing my family? throughout the trilogy michael is obsessed with being part of a family, yet by taking over the business to avoid being lonely as he was at the party, he eventually failed: he endangered relatives; he couldn't save apollonia and sonny; he murdered his brother-in-law and his sister became an enemy; kay aborted and divorced because of his crimes; he murdered fredo; he killed some of his friends and allies. what could he have done differently? where did he go astray? could he have chosen the same path and avoided this tragic vacuum? the trilogy is about the mafia, america and capitalism as coppola said, but also about a man's destiny and decisions. the last short flashback showing michael as a baby waving goodbye represents an adieu to his happy past before he made the wrong choices. in the following ultimate shot, michael at the height of his reign and isolation cannot do anything else than meditate on the missed opportunities. the autumn surrounding him is his own autumn: part iii will be his winter.";19 November 2021;9;['many', 'degraded', 'many', 'various', 'previous', 'degraded', 'sombre', 'social', 'moral', 'key', 'exterior', 'exterior', 'latter', 'graphic', 'shocking', 'previous', 'high', 'other', 'united', 'friendly', 'low', 'parallel', 'shocking', 'parallel', 'pathetic', 'ill', 'old', 'old', 'own', 'very', 'bright', 'last', 'alone', 'dead', 'final', 'linear', 'fragmented', 'many', 'variable', 'dark', 'bright', 'entire', 'bright', 'bleak', 'dark', 'short', 'many', 'more', 'dark', 'sunny', 'warm', 'snowy', 'dead', 'immense', 'famed', 'beautiful', 'remarkable', 'rounded', 'present', 'final', 'cumulated', 'long', 'present', 'last', 'last', 'first', 'short', 'dark', 'silent', 'first', 'last', 'alone', 'outside', 'young', 'comparable', 'equal', 'present', 'different', 'less', 'dangerous', 'immoral', 'last', 'same', 'degraded', 'contemporary', 'degraded', 'only', 'difficult', 'sonny', 'happy', 'happy', 'alone', 'scared', 'powerful', 'appropriate', 'dead', 'sad', 'noisy', 'same', 'alone', 'silent', 'pivotal', 'penultimate', 'compelling', 'alone', 'only', 'other', 'grim', 'sonny', 'only', 'present', 'dead', 'empty', 'other', 'alone', 'good', 'perfect', 'past', 'present', 'complete', 'present', 'pivotal', 'entire', 'key', 'powerful', 'lonely', 'happy', 'key', 'first', 'last', 'right', 'lonely', 'sonny', 'aborted', 'divorced', 'same', 'tragic', 'last', 'short', 'adieu', 'happy', 'wrong', 'ultimate', 'own'];0.0586883116883116

386;mukherjeesubham93;the godfather part 2 which acts as both a sequel as well as prequel to the 1972 classic, had the same men who had helped that motion picture become what it was....to say the least. but easier said than done, this time the job was tougher, because a sequel or prequel or succeeding film in this case, comes with a certain baggage of expectations, but coppola had ended the godfather pretty cleverly, now we can't obviously assume that he was planning a sequel because sequels were not a common thing back then....but still mario puzo and coppola pack in enough punch to make this 1974 film not only the best follow up ever made but also arguably make one of the most ambitious, innovative and risky film ever undertaken a classic....just like the first one. this film continues right from where the first one ended, right from there, you just don't feel you have ever left the corleones, not for once, it was that effortless....but the masterstroke in this one was the prequel track where we see how don vito became don vito in 1930s new york....so the film actually beautifully highlights how michael and vito expanded the corleone empire.... coppola once again manages to make some scenes memorable, which haunt you long after you've left the movie and the cinematography and musical score is also very good. al pacino plays michael corleone with outstanding aplomb and maturity. the first movie not only gifted him super stardom overnight but also matured him as an actor. i personally consider this to be the best performance not to get an oscar. another time he let's his eyes do the talking and silences speak. just watch out for a few scenes towards the end...it will surely send a shiver down your spine and give you goosebumps. robert de niro plays the young don vito corleone in the parallel track of the movie, almost all his dialouges being in italian. he had large shoes to fill because a certain marlon brando played the same character in the previous one and got an oscar. but de niro, an icon now but relatively unknown that time, completely nailed the role. right from the way he speaks to the way he walks and his mannerisms, he is excellent. not for once you feel he is not vito's younger self and that is quite a task. the academy jury also thought so, making don vito the only character in movie history to be awarded oscar twice. talia share, diane keaton, robert duvall are all excellent.the only probable issue which people have with this movie is the fact it is three and a half hours long and also some of the scenes could well have been left out. but if you loved the first one, there is no reason you won't love this one. it is not only godfather part 2, it is excellence part 2 also.;24 May 2015;10;['prequel', 'same', 'least', 'easy', 'tough', 'prequel', 'certain', 'common', 'enough', 'good', 'ambitious', 'innovative', 'risky', 'first', 'first', 'prequel', 'memorable', 'musical', 'good', 'outstanding', 'first', 'super', 'good', 'few', 'young', 'parallel', 'large', 'certain', 'same', 'previous', 'unknown', 'excellent', 'vito', 'young', 'only', 'only', 'probable', 'long', 'first'];0.1804232804232804

388;yellowtail_tuna;after we had the unforgettable first film, the second film is not just combination of the sequel and prequel, but it is also storytelling by contrasting the two, the rise and decline of corleone. vito's part is not just a personal story, but also the history of the united states. even not as an american, i am very moved to see the immigrants at the harbor staring at the statue of liberty at the beggining of the twentieth century, and nine-year-old vito is just one of them. i can imagine there would be many vitos in that period, hungry, oppressed young men with dim future, and some of them went for criminal paths. everything in vito's era is simple, and limited in the small neighborhood. and everyone is young, probably so is america itself. on the other hand, in michael's time things have become far more complicated. he has to deal with a governor, negotiating on gambling license. the family has now a bunch of associates running businesses around the country, and among them michael is not sure who he can trust. after an attempted assassination of michael in his bedroom, he has to find out not only who is the plotter, but also who is the mole inside. his search leads him to miami and then havana. havana gives the film many beautiful and memorable scenes, and they have also interesting historical background, set in the culmination of the cuban revolution. michael is a cold man. i don't like him. but probably he doesn't like himself more than anyone else. i just feel pity for him. i also feel pity for key, fredo, pentangeli, and anyone else in michael's era. i wonder what is wrong with corleone family, when remembering how exhlarating things were in vito's era. when you are watching the film, probably in your head there is the image of vito corleone played by maron brando from the first film. even though the two actors don't look like each other, robert de niro's vito, with the hoarce voice and the elegant hand gesture, makes us believe he is the same vito as played by brando. of course al pacino is excellent too, playing the loneliest man, who finds himself in the miserable life that he cannot remember when he chose to go through.;29 May 2020;10;['unforgettable', 'first', 'second', 'prequel', 'personal', 'moved', 'twentieth', 'old', 'many', 'hungry', 'young', 'dim', 'criminal', 'simple', 'small', 'young', 'other', 'complicated', 'sure', 'many', 'beautiful', 'memorable', 'interesting', 'historical', 'cold', 'more', 'key', 'wrong', 'corleone', 'first', 'other', 'elegant', 'same', 'excellent', 'lonely', 'miserable'];0.1112903225806452
389;brainofj72;"warning: contains major spoilers for parts i and ii. when ""the godfather"" was released in 1972, it instantly became a classic, and has now gone on to become a cinematic legend. i find it rather surprising that ""the godfather part ii"" was made at all, as ""the godfather"" is not exactly a franchise film, but what is more surprising is just how good this sequel is. ""the godfather"" was the story of the corleone crime family: vito (brando), the don of the family; michael (pacino), his youngest son; sonny (caan), his hot-tempered first-born; tom hagen (duvall), his adopted son and legal adviser; fredo (cazale), his middle child; connie (shire), his daughter; and kay adams (keaton), michael's girlfriend. over the course of the film, vito is seriously injured, causing sonny to become don, but due to his temper, he is promptly shot dead, thus causing michael to take over duties as don, and he and kay are married. ""the godfather part ii"" begins right where ""the godfather"" left off and continues chronicling the struggles of the corleone family as they attempt to become a legitimate organization amidst the corruption they are tied to. but the film also switches back and forth between this storyline and that of young vito (baldini, de niro), showing us how he rose to power. ""the godfather part ii"" has about the same pace as the first film, the same beautiful gold-tinted cinematography, the same operatic approach to the subject matter, and i think it is almost on par as far as quality. but the thing that really makes ""part ii"" amazing is pacino's mesmerizing performance as michael. he was spellbinding in part i, as well, but this film really gives him a lot more opportunity to develop his character. the most compelling moments in the film are not the scenes of confrontation or violence, but the scenes of pacino's intense brooding. no other actor has ever so effectively developed their character without uttering so much as a single solitary syllable. a perfect example of this is the scene where michael and fredo embrace after michael had told him he never wanted to see him again. the look in pacino's eyes is just out of this world. actually, cazale's performance is notable, as well. francis ford coppola's direction skill is at its pinnacle with this brilliant piece of celluloid, and this, unfortunately, was to be his second to last great film (his last being ""apocalypse now""). another thing that majorly contributes to not just part ii, but the entire trilogy's greatness is nino rota's absolutely beautiful and undeniably memorable score. not since 1944's ""laura"" has a composer utilized a repeated theme so well. unfortunately, the ""godfather"" series failed to become a trilogy of masterpieces when the bland part iii put a blemish on its greatness, but the sheer power and remarkable film-making of the first two chapters will be forever remembered as two of the very finest films ever made, and rightfully so. 9/10";19 September 2005;9;['major', 'cinematic', 'surprising', 'surprising', 'good', 'corleone', 'young', 'sonny', 'legal', 'middle', 'dead', 'corleone', 'legitimate', 'young', 'same', 'first', 'same', 'beautiful', 'same', 'operatic', 'subject', 'amazing', 'mesmerizing', 'more', 'compelling', 'intense', 'other', 'single', 'solitary', 'perfect', 'notable', 'brilliant', 'second', 'great', 'last', 'entire', 'beautiful', 'memorable', 'bland', 'sheer', 'remarkable', 'first', 'fine'];0.2918758043758044
390;JoshuaMLosapio;"the first ""godfather"" is one of my favorite movies. so is ""the godfather part ii,"" which is not only superior to the original but has a serious claim to being my favorite movie of all time. while marlon brando's presence is sorely missed, ""part ii"" does everything the original did and does it better. its story is deeper, richer, and ultimately more thought provoking. while ""part i"" was a tale of good and evil, ""part ii"" explores the mafia as the ultimate perversion of the american dream - something that took the innocence of the immigrant ideal and warped it into a criminal monstrosity. ""part i"" showed how a good man can become evil. ""part ii"" continues that story and demonstrates how an amoral but complicated man can lose his own soul in doing what he thinks is right. like ""part i,"" ""part ii"" is endlessly entertaining but it's also more emotionally involving and satisfying. i love how the filmmakers show the parallel stories of vito and michael corleone, who're both played brilliantly by robert de niro and al pacino. the fact that al pacino didn't win the oscar for ""part ii"" is unbelievable; it's easily the best performance of his career. in fact everyone in ""part ii"" is great, from robert duvall to diane keaton to john cazale. like ""part i"" the writing, directing, and music of ""part ii"" are flawless and make for some of the greatest scenes in movie history.

405;DaveDiggler;"the sequel to ""the godfather,"" at times, was just as impressive, and sometimes even more impressive than the original. overall, though the film struggles with it's flashbacks to an early new york as we watch a young vito corleone (robert de niro), rise to power. ""the godfather ii,"" wants to be both a prequel and sequel at the same time. when we're in the present time watching michael corleone (al pacino) fight off senators that are trying to squeeze him, or when we're watching his house get shot up on an assassination attempt that involved someone very close to the family we always find our self in amazement. when we jump back in time, you get a feeling of intrusion. the script is to blame because its too bloated, and wants to accomplish so much in it's near three hour run time. when we're in the early 1920s we see things that are entertaining and gratifying, but ultimately not even close to being on par with the present day status of the corleone family. its good to know and see how the godfather started out, but there's too much to say and not enough time to say it. the bloated section of the film becomes underwritten. we don't really learn anything about vito corleone that we didn't already know. we don't really see how he gains his power. he kills ""the black hand,"" and one day, through rumors, he becomes the don of the city. just like that. just like that? really? then we come back and he's all of a sudden in the olive oil business. we don't know how he got there or anything, he's just there. de niro gives it his best, but he's just not working with anything to give any kind of performance that's remotely on the same level as brando did in the previous film. i found it painful to watch de niro try to imitate brando. when we see the city, it does have a good look to it, and its convincing as the set and costumes designs, along with the art direction, are very good. we never see big wide shots of the city block. we see a lot of people and grocery stores go by the quickly moving camera. coppola does an excellent job of not pulling back too far (probably didn't have the budget to make a huge set of the city), but we get a claustrophobic sensation. the kind of claustrophobic sensation where a guy right next door, in the next building, is close enough to stick his head out the window, call for you, and hand you a sack full of guns. coppola encapsulates the city, and the time very well. there are some great moments in the flashbacks, but i could have lived without it entirely, and probably would have watched a much better film (possibly better than the original). when michael finds that his own brother, fredo (john cazel), knew about the assassination attempt on his life, and that he was involved and that he never told michael about his connection with hymen roth and johnny ola, it infuriates michael to the point of no return. he feels as though he loses his family. when he confronts fredo, he doesn't say much; he's sick of him; fredo's too stupid to have around, and he can't even look at him. coppola' direction here is magnificent. even though its dark and you can't see the reactions of both of the men, they're both in the picture with the light shinning through the windows creating silhouettes of the men that were, and we see their body language, and the body language tells us everything we need to know. cazel gives a great performance throughout the entire film, and we wish we got to see more from his character. he's so good in this one scene that it stands as one of the best scenes in film history, and a huge part of that is due to him. the words that come out of his mouth are on par with marlon brando' speech in, ""on the waterfront."" all this frustration, years of it, just boil over to point of pity. he's pleading with his brother. we watch him spill his guts on the table, and admit that he's well aware of being stupid and feeding into that stereotype as he watches his younger brother give him orders we feel his pain and frustration for not living up to the coldness and callousness of his family. he feels like an outsider, a coward, and a loser. all the while, michael sits in front of the window looking at the boathouse. he doesn't care what fredo has to say, which makes it all that more painful to watch for the both of them. michael wants information from him, and that's it. one feels like an outsider, and one is an outsider. neither of them fit in this lifestyle, but it ruins both of their lives. fredo wants respect and power. michael has the power, but no respect, and finds out that he loses everything that he ever cared about: his family. its one of the most powerful scenes in cinematic history.";16 August 2008;10;['impressive', 'impressive', 'original', 'early', 'young', 'prequel', 'same', 'present', 'close', 'bloated', 'early', 'entertaining', 'gratifying', 'close', 'present', 'corleone', 'much', 'enough', 'bloated', 'underwritten', 'corleone', 'black', 'sudden', 'olive', 'good', 'same', 'previous', 'painful', 'good', 'good', 'big', 'wide', 'excellent', 'huge', 'claustrophobic', 'claustrophobic', 'next', 'next', 'close', 'full', 'great', 'well', 'well', 'original', 'own', 'much', 'sick', 'stupid', 'magnificent', 'great', 'entire', 'more', 'good', 'good', 'huge', 'due', 'aware', 'stupid', 'young', 'painful', 'fit', 'powerful', 'cinematic'];0.1703621031746031

411;newfiesailor;sequel to the original godfather is slower moving than the original but maybe better. the first was fresh material and brando's presence was a huge plus. but this one digs into the blood and guts of the two main characters, provoking more thought, as well as introducing us to one of the most prolific actors today. michael's descent into darkness is terrible to behold. tragedy surrounds him as he struggles to maintain his empire but alienates himself in the process. hey, it's not easy holding a crime empire together. i think this film sets out to make michael a tragic figure but how do you feel sympathy for a guy who murders family members? it's a cold world obviously, and takes a strong man to stay on top. very interesting final scene, grim and stark, as michael sits contemplating on a chair watching the dead leaves blow around him. pacino's performance is magnificent. some great scenes, especially when michael realizes fredo betrayed him. that simple movement of covering his forehead in shock and despair conveys so much. michael becomes a three dimensional character in this film as opposed to the first. pacino just nails the part. the secondary story is the rise of michael's father, vito corleone and we watch the birth of a star. deniro even surpasses pacino in his part, if that is possible. the calculating vito as he calmly stalks don fanucci from the rooftops is classic film. deniro plays the role of death himself: knife thin, pale yet slick and immaculate in appearance. how many other hit men in the movies borrowed deniro's look? what the godfather does, unlike so many other films of it's generation is convey thought in simple movements. watch deniro as he pales visibly, staring at an old italian remedy of his sick baby. we know right then that vito corleone will do whatever it takes to protect and save his family. watch him as don fanucci boards his car and leans on him. by deniro's expression, we know fanucci is already a dead man. that's unsurpassed acting. the sets are beautiful to behold and this is probably the best cinematography i have seen in any movie. early 1900's new york, in the italian neighborhood is unreal. watch the pedestrians and background movement while the focus of the scene is occurring. that's sheer magic. once again, watch hyman roth in cuba lie on the couch, shirtless and a gentle wind moving the drapes. we can practically feel the heat and hear and smell the city of havana. it made me think how much care and calculation was put into this movie. some weak points: lee strasberg as hyman roth was not on par with the other actors. gazzo as pentangeli just grated on my nerves, especially in the first hour. i was hoping he would get whacked so he would not appear in the rest of the film. the rest of the cast is great as usual, especially duvall and kirby. not much to complain about. the second godfather, tries to do what the first does, a study of vito vs. michael. they both have different motivations for ruling their empire. whereas vito tries to do whatever it takes to rise from poverty and provide for his family out of love, michael rules out of ruthlessness and a need to succeed to maintain his empire. you can see where the results have taken both. one of the greatest films of all time.;27 April 2006;9;['original', 'original', 'first', 'fresh', 'huge', 'main', 'more', 'prolific', 'terrible', 'easy', 'tragic', 'cold', 'strong', 'interesting', 'final', 'grim', 'stark', 'dead', 'magnificent', 'great', 'simple', 'dimensional', 'first', 'secondary', 'possible', 'classic', 'thin', 'pale', 'slick', 'many', 'other', 'many', 'other', 'simple', 'old', 'italian', 'sick', 'dead', 'unsurpassed', 'beautiful', 'good', 'early', 'italian', 'unreal', 'sheer', 'gentle', 'much', 'weak', 'other', 'first', 'great', 'usual', 'much', 'second', 'first', 'different', 'great'];0.0818767507002801

427;Sonic_Ocean;in ways, i guess i could say that the first godfather changed my outlook on film, in that you can enjoy movies for their artistic aspects, and that you don't necessarily have to understand the film inside out, in that you can enjoy for what it offers, and that is basically the experience of it. when i watch a gangster movie, i felt that the element of brutality was something that was lacking in the first godfather, in that it came off too pretty and sophisticated, but i actually came to appreciate its dynamics in that the brutal scenes come as the plot escalates in that it serves as a contrast to the more sombre, melancholic elements of the film. i have to say that it brought forth something unique with that concept and gave the film a sense of grandeur that made it stick out in the crime genre. and the things the godfather did in setting the bar, part ii further expands on its ideas and opts for a darker, malevolent approach that greatly differs from the first film that has more of a sense of warmth. to see michael's transformation was astounding in the first film, but to see what he has become is gutwrenchingly heavy. what don vito corleone created was a foundation for his family, and to see michael become corrupted to the point, he would do anything to stay at the top is horrifyingly disturbing. what makes this performance so intense is the lack of any human emotion or empathy coming from michael, that makes him just pure evil. what is brought to this role is the stuff of legends and i cannot give enough credit to al pacino. he deserves every amount praise bestowed upon him, but who i think shines just as much as al in the film is robert de niro and his portrayal of a young vito corleone during his rise to power. i would have never thought it would feel natural to have someone other than marlon brando portray the original don, but robert de niro actually exceeded my expectations. from his accent to his mannerisms, he got the character down to a hair. and not only with great performances, we are offered a great character study contrasting a father and son, and what drives these men to kill. we know how michael came into his position, but as the film progresses we begin to see how vito and michael handle their business, as we see both their stories reach a conclusion that is downright brutal. the godfather part ii shows what is set forth by michael's rise to power and the movie retains its ambition, but becomes its own film that is gripping and memorable in its own unique character. i originally preferred the first one, but then i realized how much the second one is dependent on the first film. while the second one is more gripping, the first one is grandiose in that it was the first to bring out these great ideas and execute them in a way that is incomparable, but i like to see the first and the second as one long epic story in that it depicts the rise and fall of an empire and while i prefer the first one, the sequel does something different, adding different angles to the story that are equally as compelling, dramatic and shocking as the first one. to make a sequel that does just that was no easy feat and this is the mark of francis ford coppola's talent as a director. even if the first godfather were to never have a sequel, it would still be awesome on its own, but to have a sequel that is this good is more than anyone could ask for from a great director. the godfather part ii is a film that you should definitely not miss out on.;30 May 2013;10;['first', 'artistic', 'first', 'sophisticated', 'brutal', 'sombre', 'melancholic', 'unique', 'further', 'dark', 'malevolent', 'first', 'more', 'astounding', 'first', 'heavy', 'disturbing', 'intense', 'human', 'pure', 'enough', 'young', 'natural', 'other', 'original', 'great', 'great', 'brutal', 'own', 'memorable', 'own', 'unique', 'first', 'much', 'second', 'dependent', 'first', 'second', 'gripping', 'first', 'grandiose', 'first', 'great', 'incomparable', 'first', 'second', 'long', 'epic', 'first', 'different', 'different', 'compelling', 'dramatic', 'shocking', 'first', 'easy', 'first', 'awesome', 'own', 'good', 'more', 'great'];0.1946950710108604

434;DhavalVyas;"'the godfather, part ii' is often considered the best sequel ever made. although it is a powerful and moving story, the film has deep flaws that are not revealed upon initial viewings. first of all, the movie has many of the fine qualities that made the original movie a classic. all the performances are incredible and emotional; al pacino give one of the best performances i've ever seen. the complex story is slowly and subtly developed by coopola's nearly unmatched talent as a director. certain moments are so haunting and unforgettable, they have become classic moments in the history of film-making. i don't need to tell which sequences these are because so many people are already familiar with them. with all the great things the movie has going for it, 'part ii' has a lot of flaws that reveal themselves after careful viewings. the flashbacks nearly ruin the movie. although they explain the beginnings of the corleone family, they greatly deter the on - going struggle of michael with his enemies and his own family. the flashbacks also make the movie way too long. the failed murder attempt of frankie pentangeli is so confusing i couldn't figure out who was doing what. the film should have done a better job of explaining the pre-castro cubian situation to the viewer; the actions of the rebels and the rioting are also confusing. kay (michael's wife) and fredo (michael's brother) has sudden bursts of anger that come out of nowhere. the film does a poor job of showing beforehand why the two characters were so mad at michael. nonetheless, 'the godfather, part ii' has many positives that outweigh the negatives. if anything, one should just see the movie for the performance given by al pacino. al pacino commands the movie by stealing every scene he is in. his character is frightening, untouchable, cold, calculating, and invincible. it is one of the most awesome displays of acting ever put on film.";13 November 2005;8;['good', 'powerful', 'deep', 'initial', 'many', 'fine', 'original', 'incredible', 'emotional', 'good', 'complex', 'unmatched', 'certain', 'unforgettable', 'classic', 'many', 'familiar', 'great', 'careful', 'corleone', 'own', 'confusing', 'well', 'pre', 'cubian', 'confusing', 'sudden', 'poor', 'mad', 'many', 'frightening', 'untouchable', 'cold', 'invincible', 'awesome'];0.2043792517006803
435;MaxHaydon1994;with the perfection of the first godfather film it would seem impossible that the sequel could match up. but such is the genius of francis ford coppolla that it is considered by many as the greatest sequel of all time and many of those same people even consider it to be better than the first. i for one do not agree, at least not about it being better then the original, however i find it difficult to dispute the claim that it's the best sequel of all time. the impossible job of proceeding marlon brando as the godfather fell on the shoulders of robert de niro. he later went on to win best supporting actor, proving the impossible to be quite possible for someone of de niro's talents. brando and de niro became the first actors to win oscars for performances of the same character. de niro's performance as a young vito corleone was the highlight of the sequel and it was genius from copolla to move the story backwards as a pose to moving in a linear fashion. another masterstroke from copolla was the rise of michael who becomes the don of the family. we see michael become a man and bypass all his brothers straight to the top of the family. it's almost a romantic twist in an otherwise pretty gritty and dark story. i would put the first and second godfather films right up there with the best of all time, perhaps even in first and second place. you simply can't call yourself a film buff and not watch these films. 10/10;17 November 2016;10;['first', 'impossible', 'such', 'many', 'great', 'many', 'same', 'well', 'first', 'least', 'well', 'original', 'difficult', 'good', 'impossible', 'good', 'impossible', 'possible', 'first', 'same', 'young', 'linear', 'romantic', 'gritty', 'dark', 'first', 'second', 'good', 'first', 'second'];0.099074074074074

452;DemonKiki;different personalities determine different fate, and the contrast of fate is the core technique of the godfather series to build the story. like the older brother paul of victor jr. mentioned at the beginning of godfather 2, it should be a young boy with strong blood. he vowed to avenge his father, but the result was the same as his father. on the contrary, victor, who spoke little, was able to escape from danger and miraculously escaped into life. this is like the contrast between the second generation sonny and mike. a strong but too impulsive, and a calm and low-key yet bold. the fate of the two brothers is also surprisingly similar. this is a direct portrayal of character determining fate. similar examples abound in this series. the most obvious contrast is that the hot side of widow's character corresponds to the cold side of mike's character, which makes the two generations of godfathers dominate the road differently. the same is true for the supporting actors. the two chiefs, clemenza and tessio, one is a little bit reckless, and the other shows a shrewdness in calmness. this different character leads them to make different judgments at critical moments. by mistake. also has some more marginal supporting characters. their character and fate are also closely linked, which makes the godfather series of movies show a true to cruel atmosphere. like moglin mentioned when hemingros sent his power to mike, he knew that mo's temperament would easily offend people, so he was not surprised when he learned that mo died in a bad life. and frank pantancurie said when he mentioned his brother, he could have been king here, but he stayed in the small village with two donkeys in his hometown. the group image created by the response between these personalities and fate makes me care about my personality and fate, and calls for correspondence in my heart. this is a deep and excellent way for godfather 2 to impress the audience.;10 April 2020;10;['different', 'different', 'core', 'old', 'young', 'strong', 'same', 'contrary', 'little', 'able', 'second', 'sonny', 'strong', 'impulsive', 'calm', 'low', 'key', 'bold', 'similar', 'direct', 'similar', 'obvious', 'hot', 'cold', 'same', 'true', 'little', 'reckless', 'other', 'different', 'different', 'critical', 'marginal', 'true', 'cruel', 'surprised', 'bad', 'small', 'deep', 'excellent'];0.038235294117647

463;exterminator_99;"it's hard to imagine how 1972's ""the godfather"" could have been bettered. a massive commercial and critical success, the first chapter of the corleone saga was a breathtaking piece of film. when work began on a sequel, few could have thought that it could be a more accomplished film than its predecessor. it is. granted, ""the godfather: part ii"" cannot be viewed to full effect without viewing the first film. the complex nature of its storyline requires previous knowledge of characters and events. but this is something director francis ford coppola took as a given. in fact most people that went to see this film had probably already seen the first more than once! coppola's biggest trump card was the retention of the majority of the cast of ""the godfather"". only marlon brando and richard castellano declined to return. interestingly it is castellano's clemenza that is missed more sorely than brando's vito corleone (clemenza's character is replaced by frankie pentangeli, played by michael v. gazzo). this film does not document the latter years of vito's life, as in the first film, but continues the story of son michael (al pacino), whilst also foretelling how vito andolini, an orphan from the town of corelone in sicily, ended up becoming one of the most powerful men in the united states. pacino returns as the forlorn michael. even more distant than at the conclusion of the original, pacino's lack of emotion is utterly draining, yet brilliantly portrayed. other key characters such as kaye (diane keaton), tom hagen (robert duvall), connie (talia shire) and fredo (john cazale) also return. cazale is brilliant as fredo and his character, which was only a brief mention in the first film, is one of the pivotal elements of this sequel. method acting guru lee strasberg appears as hyman roth, michael's cunning business partner and former associate of his father. the role of a 20-something vito corleone went to robert de niro. in a 95% italian speaking role, de niro launched his career here. the similarities between himself and brando are superbly executed and we are convinced that they are one and the same. the film opens in early 1900's sicily. in the town of corleone the male population is slowly being decimated by a mafia lord. fearing her son's life, vito andolini's mother sends her youngest son away to leave the violent shores of sicily for the opportunity of america. alone, stricken with smallpox and malnourished, young vito takes the name of corleone after his home village. with the statue of liberty visible from his ellis island window, the world awaits him. the film then jumps forward to the late 1950's. now relocated in nevada, the corleone family has made inroads into the casino business. michael's pursuits of power continue to grow. along the way his path is blocked by numerous naysayers, but the power of the corleone family often ensures these obstacles are removed or altered without much effort. doggedly pursuing the goal of absolute power, michael's single mindedness becomes his undoing. a business partnership with aging criminal hyman roth (lee strasberg) is centred on hotels and casinos funded by us money in havana. before the business deal gets off the ground michael's intuition works to his advantage as he uncovers a double-cross. he also finds a traitor inside the family and has to make a decision on how to deal with it. we share michael's despair as the slow deterioration of the corleone empire unfolds. it is an utterly engrossing yet bitter tragedy. watching the young vito in tandem with michael's decline is initially unsettling, yet once we get used to seeing de niro as vito we settle into 1900's new york easily enough. coppola's depiction of corleone as a man simply striving to make a better world for his family smacks of dewy eyed reverence as little too much, but as an audience we take pride in vito's code of honour. like a 20th century robin hood, vito corleone is a criminal we can be proud of. de niro's performance as vito is excellent and he is supported by a stellar bruno kirby, who plays the young peter clemenza. the early associations that vito makes stay with him for life unlike michael's continuously deteriorating ties with the new york old school capo's. one thing that we notice with michael's story is how much it represents the american dream gone wrong. at one stage roth says to michael 'we're bigger than us steel.' the mafia, which once operated as a community, now runs like a business. as in big business, allegiances are easily made and broken and michael finds that it is no longer about code and honour, but wealth and power. this is clearly illustrated to the audience by the paralleled stories of vito and michael. the end of ""the godfather: part ii"" leaves the audience exhausted, but in a subliminal way. it's a shakespearian tragedy in the best sense. it would have been best to end the story there, with an audience that etched out its own idea of where the corleone family ended up. but coppola couldn't resist the temptation from paramount to round the story off in the good but not great ""the godfather: part iii"". however, viewed in tandem with the original and the second sequel, it is this chapter of the saga that stands out. cinematic genius is not a term i throw around, but this film encapsulates it. a timeless classic.";26 March 2002;10;['hard', 'massive', 'commercial', 'critical', 'first', 'corleone', 'breathtaking', 'few', 'accomplished', 'full', 'first', 'complex', 'previous', 'most',

465;theonewithallthecontacts;"in many ways, ""the godfather part ii"" was the sequel that either matched or topped the original! it had twice the budget, it got nominated for 11 oscars like the original and it won twice the oscars with 6 wins: best supporting actor (robert de niro), best art direction - set decoration (dean travoularis, angelo p. graham), best music, original dramatic score (nino rota and carmine coppola), best adapted screenplay (francis ford coppola and mario puzo), best director (francis ford coppola) and best picture (francis ford coppola, gray frederickson and fred roos). the movie didn't bring in as much money as the original, though. many people see this as better than the original, and even the best movie of all time. for the time being, i actually prefer this movie over the original. al pacino, robert duvall, john gazale and diane keaton returned to star, and new actors were brought in, including michael v. gazzo and lee strassberg. the godfather part 2 would carry on the legacy of perfection that the godfather presented to the world. one of the reasons being is the second spectacular screenplay by coppola and puzo! the movie is straightforward, and even though it's a more complicated plot than the first, it's not that hard to follow. many iconic lines are introduced once again, and the idea of making this movie a prequel as well of a follow-up seems unique. al pacino delivers an even more complex and disturbed performance as the now chilling and psychotic michael corleone. the michael corleone in the original movie was relaxed and could act human, whereas he (in this movie) coldly kills anyone, and i repeat, anyone who stands in his way. pacinos performance is believable all the way, and the relaxed attitude he expresses on-screen, echoes back to the permanently relaxed michael we saw in the original. he can talk almost robotic and give a cold stare to a man, and explode with rage in the next second, and pacino sells it. pacino delivered one of the greatest, if not the greatest villainous performance of all time, and possibly the greatest performance of all time. robert de niro is one of the other stars in the movie! he plays the part of the young vito corleone with finesse and a nice calmness, all the while maintaining the virtues that made brandos's first performance so special. his performance stands as one of the best supporting ones, and he isn't even my favorite supporting character in the movie. michael v. gazzo's aging and hot-headed frankie pentangeli is a joy to watch on-screen, although his performance is significantly weaker when compared to some of the other performances in this movie. lee strassberg delivers yet another spectacular and moving performance as the long-time gangster hyman roth. but the one supporting performance that really shined for me (more than in the original), john gazale as the brother fredo corleone. his performance was delicately layered and moving all the way, and by the end of the film i felt such pity for the guy. shoulda' been nominated for an oscar. the musical score in this movie is very much the same, and therefore as brilliant and as memorable as the first. the cinematography, the sound and the set decoration are spectacular, and makes the movie feel more epic. i prefer this movie to the original for a number of reasons: for what seemed to be an impossible goal to make the movie better than the first for some, for the stronger characters, the stronger performances, the epic feel to it, the perfection carried on, the more complex plot and the magnificent ending. this movie must never be deemed a sequel! it carries on the perfection of the first already perfect movie. a must-watch for everyone! 10/10";25 March 2013;10;['many', 'original', 'original', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'original', 'dramatic', 'nino', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'much', 'original', 'many', 'original', 'good', 'original', 'new', 'second', 'spectacular', 'straightforward', 'complicated', 'first', 'hard', 'many', 'iconic', 'prequel', 'unique', 'complex', 'disturbed', 'chilling', 'psychotic', 'original', 'relaxed', 'human', 'believable', 'relaxed', 'relaxed', 'original', 'robotic', 'cold', 'next', 'great', 'villainous', 'great', 'other', 'young', 'nice', 'first', 'special', 'supporting', 'favorite', 'hot', 'headed', 'weak', 'other', 'spectacular', 'long', 'more', 'original', 'layered', 'such', 'musical', 'same', 'brilliant', 'memorable', 'first', 'set', 'spectacular', 'epic', 'impossible', 'well', 'first', 'strong', 'strong', 'epic', 'complex', 'magnificent', 'first', 'perfect'];0.2676595143986449

471;jamesforeman-87634;"only 8 out of 10 because of the violence. as a believer, i want more positive films. however, it's a classic nonetheless. particular aspects i enjoy in this film are the flashbacks to don vito corleone as a child immigrating to new york city after social problems in his homeland, sicily. i like the intertwining of michael corleone (al pacino), his son, in present day, dealing with his crime inheritance, and vito (robert de niro), his father, years ago. i like how, as michael comes to terms with his family legacy, the film shows us vito coming to terms with his future. the day he shoots that man in a gritty apartment complex is a turning point in his life. every actor is in top form here. al pacino has gradually made the move from a man who denies his future to a man who is accepting it. his character is the spotlight of this film, much more so than in the first film (though both center around his decisions). robert de niro is particularly wonderful and convincing as a young vito corleone, who was of course played by the constantly-spoofed marlon brando in the original. de niro takes an iron grip on his character and completely engulfs himself; this was, in 1974, the sign of an actor who would go places. indeed, he did. coppola's magical sense of direction is at work here, as is the script by coppola and mario puzo (whose novels the series is based upon). the original was a wonderful film, but the sequel presents more of a challenge. flashbacks are often intercut in the middle of other films are awkward times, but in ""the godfather part ii,"" coppola uses them at precisely the right moments, managing to careen in and out of scenes and time periods with free abandon.";18 January 2022;8;['positive', 'classic', 'particular', 'social', 'present', 'gritty', 'top', 'first', 'wonderful', 'convincing', 'young', 'original', 'magical', 'wonderful', 'more', 'other', 'awkward', 'right', 'free'];0.2778765094554568
472;urema-1;"""sequels are never as good as the original"" is something that can be thrown out the window here. the fire that puzo and coppola started for the godfather (1972) did not burn out, and only got stronger. both writer and director were on form for these years. once again we are presented with an impeccably well crafted story, sophisticated and well developed characters, and a multifaceted romance of betrayal, violence , revenge and honour. michael (al pacino), now established as the head of the corleone family, struggles with mounting pressures of betrayal from those closest to him, of conflicts from his old territories in new york, and of unsteady new deals in new territories. we see michael growing into the very man his father never wanted him to be - a ruthless, cold hearted overlord, who holds revenge as the most important part of his position. in the godfather (1972) al pacino played a subtle, quiet and observant michael corleone - here we see this clean and sophisticated facade fade and break under the growing pressures and in his inability to control everything. all of this is interwoven with flashbacks to how his father vito corleone (robert deniro) came into power and set the foundation for michael and his family. vito, a man who used murder as a means to an end - always siding with and fighting for the small guy - grows ever more respected because of his acts of kindness and helping free people from the clutches of parasites and the corrupt. michael on the other hand has grown into justifying his brutal actions with weak end goals, and delusions of controlling everyone with fear. a few reasons i would class this as the better of the two films is because here we get more glimpses into the lives of other people - some of the locals in the 1910s and 1920s in the flashbacks, and of hyman roth and associates in miami. the score is once again beautifully romantic and seductive. and the locations and sets are almost flawless. the film is replete with iconic and sophisticated scenes - the empty chair at the beginning behind michael, implying ""can he fill the chair his father made?""; johnny ola garrotting scene; the kiss of death between michael and fredo (john cazale); vito shooting don fanucci and gutting don ciccio; michael striking kay when she tells him of the abortion; fredos death - outstanding and dramatic scenes. the godfather part 2 won 6 oscars - best picture; best supporting actor, robert deniro; best director; best writing (adaptation); best art direction-set design; and best music. all thoroughly deserved. at the time it was the only character played by two separate actors to win oscars (marlon brando and robert deniro playing vito corleone). this is possibly robert deniros finest performance sandwiched between two other performances that made his career (mean streets and taxi driver). arguably one of the best sequels to ever be made, and arguably one of the best films ever to be made.";14 March 2022;9;['good', 'original', 'strong', 'sophisticated', 'multifaceted', 'corleone', 'close', 'old', 'unsteady', 'new', 'new', 'very', 'ruthless', 'cold', 'hearted', 'important', 'subtle', 'quiet', 'observant', 'clean', 'sophisticated', 'small', 'respected', 'free', 'corrupt', 'other', 'brutal', 'weak', 'few', 'well', 'more', 'other', 'romantic', 'seductive', 'flawless', 'replete', 'iconic', 'sophisticated', 'empty', 'ola', 'outstanding', 'dramatic', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'only', 'separate', 'fine', 'other', 'mean', 'good', 'good'];0.1835768398268398

511;cameron-burn;"the godfather is a more important film, of course it is. but the godfather part 2 is a better film. it's more ambitious, it's more elegiac, it delves deeper into the soil of italian-american myth, plus... what were they thinking of, trying to match the critical and commercial dynamite of the first film? the godfather part 2 was, from conception upwards, an insane project. but it worked. when the godfather premiered in new york on 14 march 1972, co-screenwriter and novelist mario puzo had already started work on the sequel. that's how sure paramount were that they had a monster hit on their hands, despite some exhibitors turning up their noses at a preview screening: too little action, too much talking, and too long - proof that in no way are exhibitors a bunch of popcorn-selling philistines. after two days of release, cinema managers were being offered bribes by punters desperate to get to the front of the queues which busted the proverbial block. there was something of the mafia about the way in which paramount doubled ticket prices for weekend shows to squeeze extra revenue from their new cash cow. the sequel, announced on 16 april and working titled don-michael, was a commercial inevitability (""when you've got a licence to make coca-cola, make coca-cola! said charlie bluhdorn, head of gulf and western, who owned paramount). the godfather grossed $101 million in its first 18 weeks, and nobody was going to stop the studio having another cake and eating it. but francis ford coppola, the young director whom the studio had almost fired from the godfather but who was now feted by hollywood and the world, wasn't that interested. so they offered him a million dollars plus a huge 13% of the profits and total artistic control. altogether now: it was an offer he couldn't refuse. thus, out of this sticky climate of money-grabbing corporate opportunism did cinemas greatest part2 emerge. pub debates about the diminishing returns of the sequel usually collapse at the mention of it's name. so why does it work? why isn't it police academy2:their first assignment? much of it has to do with the unique power of it's own part one, which established it's family of characters so vividly. audiences were gagging for more of michael, tom, kay, fredo and connie. bit the coppola-puzo masterstroke was to develop the saga in two directions, forwards through the faustian ascendance of don michael, and backwards into the early 1900s, tracing vito andolini's first steps into mafia hood (he earns the surname corleone-the name of his home village-through a mix-up at ellis island's immigration control). as with all of coppola's best work, the casting was inspired.(and as with the godfather, fans can while away hours mulling over who might have been cast. try this one: dying miami mobster hyman roth, played with precision by acting coach lee strasberg in the film-could have been laurence olivier, ella kazan, or blacklisted screenwriter dalton trumbo!) robert de niro, plucked from the rising star racks after mean streets, seems born to play the young marlon brando, pacino, coppolas wildcard in casting the godfather, grows into the central role of michael in perfect parallel with his character, and diane keaton proves the quiet lynchpin( which is no mean feat in this male-dominated film). everything that was majestic and mythic about the first film is more so in part2,its scenes deliberately matching the original. author of the essential godfather book, peter cowie, describes the two-part saga in musical terms, as ""coppolas suite"", with bass lines , motifs and rhyming patterns. (""as a whole, coppola said, the first film ought to haunt the second like a spectre."") so instead of constantly reminding us that the first film is better, part 2 builds on it's operatic sweep and cranks up the drama, both narratively and visually. cinematographer gordon willis goes into sublime sepia overdrive for the flashbacks. production designer dean tavoularis tops his own evocative 1940s new york streets with a living, breathing italian immigrant community circa 1912(actually the ukranian quarter). the epic 26 minute wedding scene that opened part one is echoed in part2 by the altogether tackier confirmation party at the new corleone compound in lake tahoe(the lake itself claiming the life of one of the family in part2s chilling climax.) actually, claiming that the second is better than the first is like saying lennon's better than mcartney. one cannot exist in isolation from the other ; they must be watched by anyone who loves american film consecutively. apparently, they made a part3 too. 10/10";9 August 2007;10;['important', 'well', 'ambitious', 'italian', 'critical', 'commercial', 'first', 'insane', 'sure', 'little', 'much', 'desperate', 'proverbial', 'extra', 'new', 'commercial', 'western', 'first', 'young', 'interested', 'huge', 'total', 'artistic', 'sticky', 'corporate', 'great', 'first', 'much', 'unique', 'own', 'more', 'faustian', 'early', 'first', 'good', 'olivi', 'mean', 'young', 'central', 'perfect', 'quiet', 'mean', 'majestic', 'mythic', 'first', 'original', 'essential', 'musical', 'first', 'second', 'first', 'well', 'operatic', 'sublime', 'own', 'evocative', 'italian', 'ukranian', 'epic', 'tacky', 'new', 'chilling', 'second', 'well', 'first', 'well', 'other', 'american'];0.1317364824717765

516;wrcong;"francis ford coppola came perilously close in this film to accomplishing something rarely, if ever, done: he nearly made the second movie revolving around a particular set of characters and themes better than the first. in the truest sense of the word, godfather ii is not a sequel, nor was it intended to be. what part ii does is fill in details about don vito corleone's arrival in america and rise to underworld power. that story was told by mario puzo in the novel, but involved too lengthy a story to include in the 1972 film. coppola and puzo did the next best thing: they told the prequel, the rise to power of don vito corleone (robert deniro) and then appended to the prequel the story of the corleone family subsequent to michael's gangland triumph at the close of the first film. ""appended"" should not be taken to have a pejorative connotation. there is certainly nothing slapdash about the tale of the corleone family's fortunes following the obliteration of the rival gang leaders at the end of the first film. al pacino is stunningly believable as the still-reluctant don michael corleone. he wants to move the family business toward legitimacy, but in the end events compel him to ""be strong for everyone"" by taking down all of the family's enemies, even when one of them is his older brother fredo (john cazale, again brilliant). unlike the first film, coppola does not pull off the same level of audience empathy for the corleone family in the second film. clearly the life of the crime boss is costing michael everything while he gains all the power in the world. the first film is more equivocal on that point and also remarkably draws the viewer into a world where the corleones can be viewed with some empathy. in part ii, michael is far more cold-blooded and consequently a less sympathetic character. he seems less drawn into the vortex of organized crime by unexpected events, as was the case in the first film, and more the ruthless manipulator. this is really two great films in one. vito corleone's rise to power is portrayed with subtle intensity by deniro, always observant and always absorbing important information from his observations. those scenes really capture remarkably the story of don vito's early years woven by puzo in the novel. wrapped around that prequel is a marvelous continuation of the original story with remarkable twists and turns and deft uses of historical circumstances (congressional racketeering hearings and the castro revolution in cuba). this is another magnificent film, and fitting second step in the godfather story. don't end the story with the first godfather movie. see them both. as for godfather 3, well, if you really want to go ahead, but be prepared for a let down.";10 February 2005;10;['second', 'particular', 'first', 'true', 'lengthy', 'next', 'good', 'prequel', 'prequel', 'corleone', 'subsequent', 'first', 'pejorative', 'corleone', 'rival', 'first', 'believable', 'reluctant', 'strong', 'old', 'brilliant', 'first', 'same', 'corleone', 'second', 'first', 'equivocal', 'cold', 'blooded', 'sympathetic', 'unexpected', 'first', 'more', 'ruthless', 'great', 'subtle', 'observant', 'important', 'early', 'prequel', 'marvelous', 'original', 'remarkable', 'deft', 'historical', 'congressional', 'magnificent', 'fitting', 'second', 'first'];0.2664351851851851

518;igm;"i have just watched <the godfather: part ii> again. it is an ambitious story, spanning more than fifty years. it is a story of the first half of the twentieth century in america, as the country coped with waves of immigration, prohibition, war in europe, the post-war boom, and rebellion in cuba. the first part of the godfather trilogy offers only a foretaste of the heart of the godfather story arc: the genesis of the corleone family business with young vito corleone, played with easy confidence by robert de niro; and the hardening of michael corleone, played with mesmerizing intensity by al pacino. * spoilers from here onward * the movie is peppered with iconic and powerful images: a young vito corleone (andolini) singing hymns while quarantined at ellis island, vito executing his first hit with a towel-wrapped pistol, michael bestowing a kiss of death on his brother fredo, michael gazing out his boathouse window as he awaits the fate of his brother, hyman roth's lee-harvey-oswald-style assassination in a scrum of press and security. the movie is shot artfully, though at times is lit a bit dimly. the location selection and set decoration are attentively and evocatively rendered as we follow vito's rise. it is easy to forget that the segements showing michael's fall are also period shots, set about twenty-five years prior to filming, as they are unforced and ring true. the vengeful, unforgiving sicilian code depicted in the film undoes all that is good in vito and michael. they are devoted family men, loyal to their sympathizers, supportive of their community, and admired for their wisdom. but they kill to win their independence from authority, to secure their power, to eliminate dissenters, and to settle decades-old vendettas. michael's obsession with securing his power causes him to imprison then estrange his wife, order the death of his own brother, betray his old friends, and embrace his rivals. he is left with an empire and no one to share it with: his parents and brothers are dead, wife gone, children afraid, and so on. his only solace is the brow-beaten sister who returns to live with him in the family compound, and his similarly brow-beaten adoptive brother, tim hagen. the supporting cast is excellent, particularly diane keaton and robert duvall, as well as talia shire, lee strasberg, and bruno kirby. i had previously recorded my vote for this movie as an eight, but have now revised it to a nine of ten. igm";5 March 2004;9;['ambitious', 'more', 'first', 'twentieth', 'post', 'war', 'first', 'corleone', 'young', 'easy', 'mesmerizing', 'iconic', 'powerful', 'young', 'first', 'easy', 'unforced', 'true', 'vengeful', 'unforgiving', 'good', 'devoted', 'loyal', 'supportive', 'old', 'own', 'old', 'dead', 'afraid', 'only', 'adoptive', 'excellent'];0.2847826086956521

523;ochoamanuel21;how do you follow the greatest mobster movie of all time? by contrasting the uprising of vito along with the fall of michael at the same time. the scenes at first are subtle, yet powerful. take for instance, the beginning where you have the humble don singing in italian at ellis island as a kid and the scene changes to antony's first communion in reno which is just a front for the senator to do business with michael about the acquaintance of new hotels for double the price of the arranged price in order to milk the family as much as possible. there is hatred for the current family that michael controls from outsiders such as senator geary. the vito plot flows smoothly of how vito gains power by meeting clemenza and killing the current powers in little italy in new york and later getting revenge on don ciccio in corleone. he starts by stealing and then running molasses with several partners while doing favors for certain people. michael's story is about roth trying to take over michael's control over the hotels he owns by having a partnership with cuba, michael's investment in some new hotels in cuba, all while trying to overthrow him by having fredo betray him unintentionally since he knew that everyone in the family stepped over him because he is weak minded. while vito is becoming the new don in the 20s, michael does the unforgivable and orders the hit on his own brother since he never forgave him for his betrayal and the ending is truly the end of this franchise with the haunting comparison of a young michael with his dad waving goodbye and then it goes back to a cold michael pondering his brother's death. the irony also is that when michael joins the navy and everyone on the table questions his decision, fredo is the only one who embraces his decision.;7 February 2011;10;['great', 'same', 'subtle', 'powerful', 'humble', 'first', 'new', 'possible', 'current', 'such', 'current', 'little', 'several', 'certain', 'new', 'weak', 'minded', 'new', 'unforgivable', 'own', 'young', 'cold', 'only'];0.0465496804782519
524;linnet100;i'm not sure that i agree with some people that this film is even better than the first, but that is rather like saying is beethoven 'better' than mozart: both are geniuses. there are two towering, brilliant, outstanding performances from al pacino and robert de niro. i cannot think of two greater performances on screen - and ironically they didn't meet! they seemed to make movies differently once: this is about 'atmosphere'. and the atmosphere generated is truly astonishing. it's such a contrast to today's cinematography which has to ladle on the obvious because, one assumes, people are too stupid to follow. one can only laugh at the notion that jackson's rings trilogy could find its way into a comparative top 10 with the godfather. the latter belongs to a universe of brilliance and sophistication that jackson's work won't achieve even if he goes through 100 successive re-incarnations trying to get there. (spoiler alert) i love the contrasting way in which vito builds friends out of nothing, but by careful and adept people-working, whereas michael starts out with a clan, and ends up staring in loneliness across the lake. pacino develops this aspect quite superbly, as de niro does the converse. it's outstanding stuff. and the two taken together may never be matched.;3 May 2004;10;['sure', 'well', 'first', 'well', 'brilliant', 'outstanding', 'great', 'astonishing', 'obvious', 'stupid', 'comparative', 'latter', 'successive', 'contrasting', 'careful', 'adept', 'outstanding'];0.3041666666666667

564;jansen-aui;"given complete control over the directorial proceedings by paramount, and a much larger budget to boot, you would be forgiven to think francis ford coppola had it good when, two years after the release of the godfather, the studio convinced him to direct the godfather: part ii. despite this free reign, coppola still faced challenges most important being the daunting task of matching the first picture, creatively and financially. there are many critics who regard the second part of the corleone saga as not only equal, but superior than the first, and while i don't think part ii is as ""classic"" as it's original, i can concede without hesitation that this is the more ambitious and grand in scope, and certainly more powerful as an exercise in tragedy. the godfather: part ii continues the story of michael corleone (al pacino), established in the end of part one as the new don of the corleone crime family, who has moved all their interests out to nevada. michael looks to expand his empire and invest in businesses in havana and miami, where hyman roth (one of his father's aging ex-partners) resides. when betrayal comes from where he least expects, michael must make decisions and sacrifices, however difficult, to save his family, and in doing so will perpetually change who he is as a person. throughout michael's ordeal, coppola flashes back to the turn of the century, where a young vito corleone (then vito andolini) must flee sicily when he becomes hunted by the local mafioso at the age of only nine. as an immigrant, we are shown the rise of vito (robert de niro from young adulthood onwards) as a man of respect, loyalty, enormous generosity and ever growing authority on the streets of new york. coppola must be given due for the transitions between the two parallel story lines, which are absolutely seamless. they come at natural breaks so as to not take away from the pacing of either narrative, and the episodic approach to covering thirty-odd years in the young vito storyline is perfect for keeping the audience on the edge of their seats for the developments in the michael story. with the interconnectedness of the narrative, coppola encourages a contrast of the way michael and vito take control of their respective families what decisions they make, what they value and this helps to further punctuate and underline the film's harrowing final scenes. in keeping with the tone of the first picture, part ii sees the return of gordon willis' dark, under lit photography, and nino rota's memorable, distinctive score (largely utilising the same cues as the first, with the addition of a few new themes including the magnificent ""the immigrant""). the acting across the board is quality just as it was in the original. john cazale has a larger role here as fredo, whose outburst at being stepped over as the family don is as forceful and potent as any in his regrettably short career. newcomers to the picture give excellent supporting turns, michael gazzo as caporegime frank pentangeli and robert de niro as vito corleone, preserving brando's famous gesture and manner, but it's al pacino's picture through and through his michael is so intense, but yet is an empty shadow of his former self. by the end of the picture, pacino's beady black eyes are cold: completely stripped of life, and reflect upon the tragedy of the loss of the family he committed all his power to trying to protect. it's a haunting, powerful, parting frame that lasts.";26 June 2006;10;['complete', 'directorial', 'large', 'good', 'free', 'important', 'daunting', 'first', 'many', 'second', 'corleone', 'equal', 'superior', 'first', 'classic', 'original', 'ambitious', 'grand', 'powerful', 'new', 'corleone', 'least', 'difficult', 'young', 'local', 'only', 'young', 'enormous', 'due', 'parallel', 'seamless', 'natural', 'episodic', 'odd', 'young', 'perfect', 'respective', 'harrowing', 'final', 'first', 'memorable', 'distinctive', 'same', 'first', 'few', 'new', 'magnificent', 'original', 'large', 'forceful', 'potent', 'short', 'excellent', 'frank', 'famous', 'intense', 'empty', 'former', 'black', 'cold', 'powerful'];0.1886467698967698

578;k-08062;"there is a chapter in godfather trilogy analysis called ""major character analysis"", which makes some comparisons between the two godfathers. some of these comparisons seem superficial, so here's a personal comparison between vito and michael godfathers. the differences on the surface of vito and michael, i have always believed, must not be analyzed solely by the differences in the character of two people, but i prefer to analyze the way these two people behave from the times and experiences they live in. one notable difference in careers is that vito have a good grasp of the godfather role (ease), while michael have been making great achievements but always seem laborious; another notable difference, for example, is that vito maintain the family fairly well, and michael is much worse. the authors of godfather trilogy analysis tend to interpret both as vito is a very enthusiastic person, but michael is a cold-blooded.. the analysis is simple, however, because one obvious thing is that michael have different personalities before and after becoming a godfather, that is to say, many of michael personalities have evolved after becoming godfathers. for three reasons vito have a good grasp of the role: experience, interest, and historical background. vito is from a poor boy who has nothing step by step to the godfather's throne, from childhood to adulthood along the way with a variety of people, including his close friends as brothers, but also his opponents. he was also closest to and tortured by two different-style gang bosses (both italian style and american style). from the experience, it vito clear how to be a gangster who is feared by the enemy, trusted by his godson and loved by his loved ones. and do michael have such experiences? too bad. he may have never thought of inheriting a profession like his father since childhood. he wants to live like the average american, he has an american name, he has an american sense of honor (joining the navy), he looks for 100% of american women as girlfriends. so santino death, fredo incompetence led to the arrival of the godfather position is too sudden for michael, how can we expect such an inexperienced man to be able to make the godfather as handy as his father in the short term? vito used to help people solve the trivial things of rent. michael? to represent huge family affairs and mass killings of real guns. vito got clemenza such a capable arm along the way, adopted and cultivated tom hagen such a perfect-minded family lawyer; and";29 March 2020;9;['major', 'superficial', 'personal', 'notable', 'good', 'great', 'laborious', 'notable', 'bad', 'enthusiastic', 'cold', 'blooded', 'simple', 'obvious', 'different', 'many', 'good', 'historical', 'poor', 'close', 'close', 'different', 'italian', 'american', 'clear', 'loved', 'such', 'bad', 'average', 'american', 'american', 'american', 'santino', 'sudden', 'inexperienced', 'able', 'handy', 'short', 'trivial', 'huge', 'mass', 'real', 'clemenza', 'capable', 'perfect', 'minded'];0.1503472222222222

589;joshuawood2012;"what is there to be said about the sequel to what many consider to be the greatest film of all time? ""the godfather: part ii"" is a film unlike any other. from the seedy casinos of nevada, to the revolution in cuba, ""the godfather: part ii"" chronicles the reign of michael corleone, acted to perfection by al pacino, over a massive criminal empire. corleone's dealings with the manipulative and ruthless, but ailing, hyman roth, depicted by the masterful lee strasberg, are some of the best scenes captured on cinema. roth is a weary, weathered old man, but he more than holds his own against the young, ambitious michael corleone. and how does one describe the character of michael corleone? is he an evil killer that cares only about power, and will do anything to achieve it? or is he a reluctant son, trying desperately to get out from under the enormous shadow of his father, but assailed on all fronts by enemies old and new? perhaps both. the story of michael corleone in this film is a tragic one, without doubt. but his is not the only tale told in this masterpiece of cinema. the story of vito corleone, portrayed entirely in sicilian by robert de niro, is interwoven with that of his son, and it is arguably as potent. a young sicilian lad, orphaned by a violent mafioso, vito is smuggled off the island and to america. there, vito is met with oppositions and struggles, and he overcomes them all to become the original godfather. it is truly a journey, and shows the adversity that crafted a giant of a man.

610;jamie-rowlands1;"a good sequel should do two things: continue the story of the original, but also be a story in its own right. most sequels try this and fail - sometimes it's made because of the financial success of the first film, and the studio wants to cash in; sometimes it's because the first film said everything that needed to be said and the original idea's been thinly exploited. often, it's a mixture of both. the godfather: part ii is a rare example of a sequel having the same power as the first, expanding the world we already know, adding context to things we've already seen, but also telling us a story (well, two actually) that can, proudly and confidently, stand on its own. in fact, it's almost unfair to label this film a sequel given the slightly negative connotations of the word, because it scarcely gets done this well. it's another work of art from francis ford coppola. the debate rages on amongst film fans - which godfather film is the best? well, it's not the third, although there are moments of brilliance in it, and it could well be the second (filmically, it might just clinch it), but for my money it's the first. that's not to detract from the achievement of this film, it's just personal preference, and i've rated it a ten so it's clear how highly i admire it. there's really not a lot in it. the cinematography in part ii is stunning, some of the very best i've seen in a film, and possibly the academy's greatest failure (in its entire history) is the lack of nomination here for gordon willis. fredo, underused in the first, is also given more to do in the second film - he becomes an integral part of the story and we also get to understand what makes him tick. the scene, my favourite in the film, where he finally lets rip at michael, following his discovery that fredo's the family traitor, is staggeringly good - years of resentment comes pouring out of him after being passed over for his younger brother. another academy award failure - where was john cazale's nomination? diane keaton, too, as kay, for me a character so integral to the whole saga, when she tells michael the miscarriage she suffered wasn't that at all, it was an abortion. the fear and sadness in her eyes, knowing he'd hate her for it (spoiler: he does), but the absolute conviction in her decision, makes it another hugely underrated performance in the film, and in her career. de niro as the young vito, lee strasberg as hyman roth, pacino again as michael - all great work. the music too, again, is haunting and operatic, adding so much. there really is so much to love about this film. but, for me, the thing that puts the second just slightly below the first is the journey of michael as a character. the first film took him from being the vulnerable war hero who had shunned the family business, by all accounts a good man, all the way to mafia kingpin who ordered the deaths of those who tried to destroy his family. in part ii, he does the unthinkable (poor fredo), but he starts off as a man warped by his own importance and hell bent on protecting his family, and he ends the film that way too - even though, as it turns out, the thing his family might need protection from is michael himself (poor fredo!). it's a small thing, and the character does subtly change in the second film, but the journey of michael in the first is what made it so fascinating and captivating to watch. it's also, the second film, just a tad too long and the story's slightly harder to follow. it's a work of art, though. no doubt. and it delivers a gut punch in the final few minutes that's become one of the greatest and most shocking endings in film history. poor, poor fredo...";19 July 2020;10;['good', 'original', 'own', 'most', 'financial', 'first', 'first', 'original', 'rare', 'same', 'first', 'own', 'unfair', 'negative', 'good', 'third', 'second', 'first', 'personal', 'clear', 'stunning', 'good', 'great', 'entire', 'first', 'more', 'second', 'integral', 'favourite', 'good', 'young', 'integral', 'whole', 'absolute', 'underrated', 'young', 'great', 'operatic', 'much', 'second', 'first', 'first', 'vulnerable', 'good', 'unthinkable', 'poor', 'own', 'poor', 'small', 'second', 'first', 'fascinating', 'second', 'hard', 'final', 'few', 'great', 'shocking', 'poor', 'poor'];0.165895061728395

620;clouds88;"as stated in my review of godfather 1 , there are some movies which cannot be reviewed. we can all have our opinions, but we cannot rate them. these are the movies which go beyond the ratings and awards. the godfather (1 and 2) is one such movie(s). to give a rating to these two movies would be an insult to its creators and i am not making any attempt to do so. these are two legendary movies, each an epic, a magnum opus for all other 'don' movies. thus, i present here some of my views and scenes from the two movies that touched my heart. the first scene of the movie, the traditional kissing of the hand of the don, shows michael taking over his father's place. subsequent scenes show you that though he has taken over his father's seat, he is nothing like the old don. the charismatic supremo is replaced by an angry, impatient man. the movie touches upon the life of immigrants to the new blooming world america wherein begins our former godfather's story. the story of young vito corleone runs parallel to the present day don. the story of the great man is unfolded beautifully and entwined well with the present. in one scene, the relationship with present don and his kid is intercepted by the young vito corleone, a young and handsome r. de niro, playing with his little son, which enhances the contrast lifestyle of the two leading men. attention to detail has been given the utmost importance and the scene in which the lead actor watches a play, which though irrelevant to the story is heart touching, is a proof for this. there are times when you just can't take your eyes off the well chiseled face of robert de niro and long for him to come back on screen. as the movie unfolds, we see how the don junior tries hard to keep his personal life & business in place, something which the senior had done with ease. in one scene, the new don's anger at his wife for having aborted their to be boy child vis-a-vis the distress troubled look on old don's face while seeing his young son treated by a nurse shows the disparity in the way the two men handled their families. while don vito was as much a family man as he was a godfather, his son, michael fails to keep his family together. like the icy cold winter snow, the relationship between the husband and wife is harsh and dry. true to his words, the ""times were changing "". as the movie progresses, we see how the once well built, tightly held family by de niro is slowly losing its strength and grip under his son. the love for his wife and kids in niro's eyes in contrast to the anger in michael's eyes for his wife underlines the entire movie. the story ends similar to the first movie, where all the don's enemies are killed, whether they are part of family or not. climax of movie sums up the life of michael and the drastic changes over the years about his views and relationship he had with his father.";20 December 2014;9;['such', 'legendary', 'magnum', 'other', 'first', 'traditional', 'subsequent', 'old', 'charismatic', 'angry', 'impatient', 'new', 'former', 'young', 'parallel', 'present', 'great', 'present', 'young', 'young', 'handsome', 'little', 'utmost', 'irrelevant', 'touching', 'personal', 'senior', 'old', 'young', 'much', 'icy', 'cold', 'harsh', 'dry', 'true', 'entire', 'similar', 'first', 'drastic'];0.0707999108734403
621;chunga95;"this post is probably gonna tick you off. but i don't want to flame on your tastes. i'm not gonna trash what anyone thinks is the best movie. this is just a very long-winded argument about why the godfathers stand as milestones in cinema. spoilers throughout. i've read a number of posts who think the characters are hollow. there are long scenes when the characters seems to be doing nothing, or just *thinking*. that's one of the great parts of the film. there are deep threads of loyalty and family and duty throughout the trilogy, and the original godfather (and ptii) is one of the few films that does these moments justice. the cast assembled does what few ever have: you can ""see"" them thinking. brando, pacino, deniro, strasberg (of course), duvall - all masters of what is probably the most difficult talent to achieve on film. pacino is especially great at this in gpartii when you watch him agonize over what to do with (if you've seen it) *you-know-who*. there is a subdued intensity to each character, living a life where death is always around the corner of one bad mistake. they're thoughtful, intelligent, and conflicted. the gift of these movies is they don't telegraph these undercurrents or make it painfully obvious. if you let yourself, the characters draw you in to these processes. much of our current standards for cinema are based on flair and fast-action-packed-editing. not to sound cheesy, but the godfathers unfold like a rare flower, slow and with purpose. keep in mind, there are no accidents in movies. that is to say, what you see in the frame is completely planned (as much as can be in cinema). watch the scene where brando is advising pacino on the particulars of the business. there is real heartbreak between them, two men doing the family's business. vito corleone never wanted it to be michael, and neither did michael want it for himself, but both esteem the family more than themselves, and so they discuss this ugly business. if this movie were made today, the scene would only be a few snappy lines, some quick wit dialogue, and cut to the big explosion. this is a gem of a scene because you watch the actors put these emotions away to do what's brutal and necessary, and in a sense, say goodbye. watch brando in the car after the meeting with the five families. he comes to a chilling realization about who is behind the war, but how? watch this scene and then re-watch the meeting with the five families for the moment this realization hits him. it happens and is gone in a second, but in that second you see him decide what to do. he tucks away his anger and waits. he waits until michael takes over, and passes this knowledge on to him without ever telling him what to do. this is where the art of direction makes this possible. without a word ever being spoken about what's coming, michael takes over the family business and sets the table to take control over all the families. of course, when the hits are actually being done, and splicing them into the scene where michael's niece is being christened, is the best form of ironic cinematic poetry. what makes the gparti and gpartii connection is you see the same process in deniro/young vito. after he's shaken down for the last time by don fanucci, he decides what and how to do it in a second - and deniro shows that, without a word ever being spoken. of course, there are the iconic moments of the movie. the horsehead in the bed, (in the restaurant with solozzo and mccluskey) pacino coming to a boil as the train gets louder in the background, the opening scene with the undertaker (a great homily to italian-americans), brando moving around the room and brushing his cheek, fredo on the lake reciting the hail mary, pacino kissing fredo in cuba, sonny on the causeway, etc... these are just a few of examples of what make these movies great. i've read where people can't identify to the characters. how many of us really can identify with the people we see on film? the godfathers paint a portrait of a life unknown to just about everybody. the real gangsters liked it so much, they emulated the fictional parts (like the hand-kissing). the films are poetry, but there's nothing poetic about the events in it. the characters are sublime, but there's nothing sublime about their character. the movies don't give anything away (who saw the fredo thing coming?), but are transparent at the same time. i know this is high minded and stuffy, but hopefully, even if you're not a fan, you can understand why the films are so highly regarded. but, for the haters, i'll give you gpartiii - what in the h*ll was he thinking letting sofia coppola act?

634;kevhol2000;"*attention spoilers* there are two scenes in ""the godfather part ii"" that completely describe the mastery and eloquence of this wonderful film. one scene is at the very beginning. i am referring to the party celebrating michael's son's first communion. the music and atmosphere play in strict contrast to the beginning of the first film. in ""the godfather"", the corleone family was fully emersed into the italian life. they were completely outside the american ideal, basing their lives on values learned through sicilian experience and heiritage. the music during the wedding was italian, even the food was italian. during michael's party in the second film, the music played is distinctly american, so much so that the pure blooded italian, frank pantangali become upset and insulted by the whole presidings. he tries to get the band to play italian music, and they rebel. he accuses michael of ignoring his heiritage by moving to las vegas and drinking champaign (instead of the wine that italians usually drink). the irony, is that michael probably thought that ignoring his ancestory would help the family eventually become legitimate. instead, by vacating everything thing that defines him, michael becomes a castle among himself, a powerful man who is as hollow as he is evil. the theme here, is that the american capitalist system is in many ways more corrupting than anything ever seen previously. for example, in the first film, the villains (including vito), although evil and corrupt, are still men of honor and take action based on this honor, no matter how misguided. there may be backstabbing, but it is, as many would say, strictly business. michael in this film, by contrast, seems to have forgone any resemblence of these honorable traits. he kills men without any basis other than for the acquisition of complete power. he commits fratracide because he wants to destroy all those who have wronged him, even though he has done more harm to his family then fredo would ever think of doing (especially to all those close to him: kay, tom hagen, his children, and of course fredo). but again, he's only working under the system he's entered into. this is clear when he negotiates with a corrupt senator at the beginning of the film. this senator clearly has no guidelines or values to follow, he only wants what many people in his position want, money and more power. but michael is smarter, and understands that having such a man as an ally is better than killing him. vito, by contrast, probably would have had luca brasi put a bullet through his head for a man of his power treating others of similar status with such disrespect. thus, there is no longer a showing of decorum in the american system, only crass ""directness"" and dishonesty. i think, the corruption in the american system is part of the reason why ""the sopranos"" is so popular today. with all the scandals like enron, many criminals in white collar society can screw people over, even their friends and get a mere slap on the wrist. in ""the sopranos"", if you go against the family you get wacked. plain and simple. the vito scenes in ""the godfather part ii"" are used to contrast those of michael. yet, even though vito's actions seem more honorable, he is slowly getting corrupted as well. it is clear, that killing the town boss was not a selfless act of a caring man. it was a power play, a way for vito to acquire power himself, because just as he hated that boss, he strangely admired him as well. in a way, vito loses his innocence the moment he witnesses the bosses power at the play, and continues on a dark path that michael embarks and completes by the end of the film. my favorite scene in all ""the godfather"" films is the scene at the end, where we see all our favorite characters (except vito), some dead, at the table and michael announces that he is going into the army. this scene is one of great sadness, because michael was such an intelligent man that he knew what the ""life"" would mean to his soul. he knew that he would lose everything if he went on that dark path, and that is the tragedy... 9/10 grade: a";20 September 2002;9;['wonderful', 'very', 'first', 'strict', 'first', 'corleone', 'italian', 'sicilian', 'italian', 'italian', 'second', 'american', 'pure', 'blooded', 'italian', 'upset', 'whole', 'italian', 'legitimate', 'powerful', 'hollow', 'evil', 'american', 'many', 'corrupting', 'first', 'evil', 'corrupt', 'misguided', 'many', 'honorable', 'other', 'complete', 'more', 'close', 'clear', 'corrupt', 'many', 'more', 'smart', 'well', 'similar', 'such', 'american', 'crass', 'american', 'popular', 'many', 'white', 'mere', 'plain', 'simple', 'honorable', 'clear', 'selfless', 'caring', 'dark', 'favorite', 'favorite', 'dead', 'great', 'intelligent', 'dark'];0.1024316109422492
635;thl2k1;francis ford coppola was in his prime as a director in the 1970s with gfi and ii, the conversation and apocalypse now. this is probably one of the best sequels ever made because like all good sequels (empire strikes back, rocky ii, etc.) it borrows from the original but has its own unique story that is more than the recycling of former themes, structures and philosophies. spoiler warning. gfii tells parallel stories of the young vito corleone and of his son michael. coppola does a good job of knowing when to flash back and flash foward. we see vito as an orphan coming to america, establishing his influence by killing the local don, building up his business and getting his revenge on the don who ordered the death of his father, brother and mother. michael tries to legitimize the family business by buying casinos, creating ties to political figures and investing in the cuban government which will become communist at the beginning of 1959. we see his personal life deteriorating as there is an assassination attempt that his brother, fredo, was somewhat responsible for. the lighting and music is great in this film. i liked the acting by al pacino, robert de niro and especially lee strasburg as hyman roth. it's a movie that could stand on its own. most memorable scenes: the images of the statue of liberty, the young vito stalking don fanucci before killing him, pacino's reaction to finding out fredo is the traitor and later finding out his wife had an abortion, and the sequence that sees the death of pentangeli, roth and fredo leading to a flashback that features men who have been murdered or alienated by michael, except for sonny. michael talked about not becoming a man like his father and years later we see he has become a much worser being. he sits on a lawn chair and reflects upon the decisions and their consequences as the film fades darkly to the credits.;18 November 2003;10;['good', 'good', 'original', 'own', 'unique', 'more', 'former', 'parallel', 'young', 'good', 'local', 'political', 'cuban', 'communist', 'personal', 'responsible', 'great', 'own', 'memorable', 'young', 'sonny', 'worse'];0.3078947368421052

657;NicelyPutMovies;the godfather, superman, evil dead. there are textbook answers to the question of sequels that are better than the original. the sequel of the godfather, though, is a very different project to the first, engaging in something so unfathomably far-reaching and ambitious, a story of such epic proportions, that if it had gone wrong, it would have gone wrong. instead, we have a rolling, multi-dimensional, poly-era masterpiece. we must not compare the two as it does not make the prequel any less formidable (as is often the case with a successful sequel) but it is worthy of standing alone but also being recognised as part of the saga. a rare position and a lucky one but it seems to rather deserve it. in the first review, tribute was paid to those who claim to not like the first film. tribute in the form of contemptuous scorn and disrespectful suspicion. here it will be the same. once again if someone says it is too much for them, or they like simpler films, or have a problem with the violence, etc and do not like it for those reasons, this is perfectly fine. however, any folk saying it is just not any good are not being honest with themselves. it is a spellbinding triumph of incalculable dimensions with timeless honourable merit and standard-bearing assumed by its creators. so, if this is you, get some therapy, and another film review. you do not belong here. for the rest of you, let us begin. very differently we begin in corleone, sicily. we learn of the brutal instances that cause vito to leave, alone and orphaned on a strange vessel, marked for death by a mafia chieftain, headed for the new world. as he lands on what would become ellis island, we see an understated but vital scene. young vito, a mute and barely eight years old walks in front of a crowd of fellow immigrants all staring at the statue of liberty. vito also looks, but unlike his fellow boat-people, he is walking forward while looking up to the symbol of america while everyone around him stands still. the analogy does not take much figuring out. smallpox quarantined, alone, and scared, for the first time, in his small single room with a table and a bed, we hear his voice as he sings to himself. time leaps to his grandson, anthony, many years later in tahoe, nevada, at the same age. the rise of the family under michael (al pacino) has moved into politics, a naive senator tries to strong-arm. an entertaining piece. a series of events leads to a violent head, michael leaves to find out who betrayed them and nearly cost him his life. temporarily the illegitimate german-irish lawyer and michaels assumed brother, tom hagen is at the helm after being stepped-over in the first movie's climax. things take hold in cuba, in a story meant to mirror that of a true mafia event, the character of hyman roth, played by acting legend lee strasberg is painfully obvious in its basis upon famous jewish mobster meyer lansky. a capable but mute bodyguard accompanies michael everywhere as he weaves around finding out who betrayed them, who paid them too, and how to come out on top in both the long term and in the cuban deal as happened in real life, history decides the latter as cuba collapses under bautista as fidel castro takes power and throws the mafia out., the traitor is revealed and michael must act, but how he acts will be determined by actions he must control. back home a wronged subordinate, manipulated by michael's enemies, turns government witness to a senate committee (once again drawing from an event of recent history). michael must also outwit the us senate, treachery is everywhere and duplicity is lurking. michael uses his wit and cunning with typical aplomb to outwit and crush his enemies at a cost of maybe losing his family. his main betrayal coming from a source that troubles him for the rest of is life. he remains at the top and yet it is at a terrible cost. as all this happens, the second unit story evolves. young vito played in breathless mystery by a spellbinding pre-embarrassment robert deniro in post-wwi new york. for you young-'uns who see bad grandpa, meet the fockers, and joker, you may wonder why he is so revered, and it is a good question. the answer, is probably more than anywhere else, evident here. a young vito, a grocery boy, is made unemployed by a black-hand (a particularly ferocious offshoot of the mafia) operatives and thus christened into the crime world by that often-occurring phenom in these movies, the life-changing chance encounter. this time is with a jolly but lethal neighbourhood tough called clemenza. from here he rises, using his quiet viper-like strength and ability to listen and not react. he rises to the top of new york and returns to his home of sicily to repay those who forced him out. if anyone has not seen it, they should check the deleted scenes on youtube for a more detailed explanation. the two parallels play together perfectly. the rolling camerawork of following young vito across the rooftops of little italy as he pursues his quarry, interspersed with pyrotechnics and scenery from the saint genarro festival is something to behold. it shows that panoramic shots do not need to have half of montana in the background and can even be poorly lit. all of the scenes of this section are dim and rather dusky and shot at close quarters. this is to express the claustrophobic nature of railway cold-water flats and tenement rows in early 20th-century new york. somehow though, it has an epic feel too. in fairness, the cinematography of part ii is way superior to the first installment, but that is possibly the way it is meant to be. the way a young colt of an experienced stud racehorse will have speed and strength its parents didn't, but all are remembered as fondly. a lot more happens in this installment. as mentioned, cuba falls. then the act of betrayal at michael's home is far beyond anything seen before, and the brutal slaying of an innocent prostitute simply to aid a blackmail case by the fearsome al neri (richard bright) is an act far beyond the romanticised broad-brooklynese movie-star, ferret-faced behatted mobsters of the first film. one of the moral criticisms is that it glorified the mafia (a word never uttered in the film) and it led to a backlash against this romanticised image of mobsters only killing other killers and raining gold on the innocent. you certainly do not feel this way at the end of part 2 it is full of crescendo-like scenes. the music of nino rota is used to explain for those looking away. the camerawork is ambitious, for example, a scene in a courtroom where michael uses a defendant's brother to silence him, is often praised, but i have always found it clunky and out of pace. i think trying for too many cuts and bustling tension is a bridge too far in a movie that is all about subtlety. for example, connie wants the children to leave the room, they ignore her, although they are so very young, just a glance from michael shows his power among all who he rules. paradoxically, we are shown that vito does it differently, he gives people a chance to not fear him take for instance, a quirky little comedy involving a reactionary landlord of a friend of vito's wife is another testament to nino rota and his score. with a different tune it could have been terrifying, yet here it has a flutey italian jig playing, so it is taken lightly. michael never has such a frivolous sound accompaniment. his interactions have the whistling background of deep piano foreboding and in one of the most depressing scenes i have ever encountered, he returns to his wife, who is sewing and there is no love left. he gives no one a chance and is cruel, particularly to his step-brother, tom, who is loyal beyond question. a very complicated movie that no-one could fully comprehend in one sitting. for the most part, there is no book to refer to (except for vito's segment being part of the original novel). it deserves multiple watching, it is a towering achievement in modern motion-picture artistry that will provide food for all thoughts. at once it is both a soap-opera and a mystery. it remains never-bettered by imitators. this is mostly due to it has been, aside from the hilariously inferior once upon a time in america, largely unattempted. not being one to romanticise the past, it is daft to say it could never happen i truly hope it does as it would be some kind of film to watch. until that day 9.5/10;22 April 2020;9;['evil', 'dead', 'well', 'original', 'different', 'first',

668;guster-1;i love this movie not only because i'm half italian, but also because i liked the history of the corleone family and how the film flips from michael's story to his father's story. the cinematography in the film is fantastic, especially the scenes in sicily, but that should not take anything away from the stirring and very moving sound track as well. the reason why i think this is better than the first godfather film is the fact that we get to learn more about why vito, michael's father, came to america, and how difficult it was to scrape a living in the era, especially for southern italians who thought they would escape the mafia and poverty by emmigrating to america, only to find they had both already got there before them. every time i see the scene when the ship arrives in new york, with the fantastic and very emotive score accompanying it, i can't help but cry my heart out, it just struck a chord. please, don't just watch this film because of it's mafia content, because it has so much more to offer, not only with it's fantastic performances(de niro particularly, as it's hard to speak sicilian dialect at the best of times), but also because it gives us an insight in to why a group of people would want to leave their homeland.;28 April 2006;9;['italian', 'corleone', 'fantastic', 'stirring', 'sound', 'well', 'first', 'more', 'difficult', 'southern', 'fantastic', 'emotive', 'more', 'fantastic', 'hard', 'good'];0.2298611111111111

(don) michael corleone has changed vastly from when we first saw him at his sisters wedding in the original godfather. he no longer has the will to make a name for himself without having to rely on his background. he is still calm and calculating but with a more sinister feel and the feel of a man so powerful and brutal that he is feared by most people up to the point were his own family are frightened by his potential and he is left alone in his life which the ending symbolises. with the scenes of his father's past to give us an insight into the rise of the corleone family and a further insight into the character of the original godfather vito corleone. michael makes wise investments in pre revolutionary havana whilst continuing with his business in the u.s some may argue the movie is giving a almost propaganda style view at communist cuba. but if that was the case the american senators would be portrayed as straight politicians and not corrupt businessmen. so the movie ends with michael delving into a brutal but yet cunning mindset up until the point were he kills his brother. there is no secret that he loves his family but the lengths he would go for them are terrifying. michael ends the movie with his wife having left him taking his children. the ending shows how a young innocent men has turned to a point where he has alienated his wife and killed his brother. fantastic film.;24 December 2007;10;['original', 'infamous', 'huge', 'original', 'calm', 'sinister', 'powerful', 'brutal', 'most', 'own', 'alone', 'corleone', 'further', 'original', 'wise', 'communist', 'american', 'straight', 'corrupt', 'brutal', 'cunning', 'young', 'innocent', 'fantastic'];0.0892857142857142

673;ShFo10;"**spoilers**the opening scene is of michael corleone sitting in his chair in his office recieving respects from his advisors. the scripts states this as michael being ""in profile"". he looks glumm and slightly stares down at them. then the title reveals the that chair he was sitting in. an aspect of his life we have seen and preview. at the beginning of the film, we get a view of the mafia that we didn't get in the first one. of actual sicilians in sicily. this is probably the most brutal part and area of the hepacracy that is witnessed in the film. don ciccio is an evil mafia cheftain, asumed to be into all sorts of corruption including inteferring with civilain lives (such as ""protection""). when antonio andolini is killed for an insult made to the don, he is of course killed. his son paulo, probably one to have give spiritual inheritence to santino, swears revenge and of course is killed in turn. antonio's wife makes a reverent pleed to the don to spare her last son, vito. he refuses with a simple and cold ""no."" vito escapes as his mother is killed. when he arrives in ellis island, he is given his name ""vito corleone"". in lake tahoe, navada, the corleones have achieved wealth and are making their way. a great celebration is made for michael and kay's son anthony. michael meets with a recsenting senator, who even made a nice a comment in a speech ""anthony vyeto corleone."" he refuses to submit a gsambling licsense to michael at a reasonable and fair price. when the meeting ends, michael finally leads up to put ""my offer is this. nothing."" kay is preagnant with a child. connie has had at least one other failing marriage. her next choice is mostly a complete stranger and anyone can see that the relationship will be useless. michael even puts in to his sister like he does in battle talk ""connie, if don't listen to me, and marry this man, you'll disapoint me."" michael truly is in the business he never wanted. michael's intentions are to make a deal to own hotels in vegas with long family friends hyman roth and johnny olah. roth coneects with the rosato brothers who another long family friend frank pantangili despises. so, he aks for the murder which is refuse. before michael knows it, his bedroom is shattered by bullets from hitmen. thus brings us into the battle hyme. **spoilers** vito lives in new york city in a ""minature italy"" area with his wife and infant son. he is finally brought into something when clamenza asks him to hide revolvers for him. there is a local mafia family known as the black hand. one of the main men and collectors is don funnucci, an evil ""protector"". because of him, vito loses his job at a baker, but kin heartedly reponds to his boss with ""you've always been good to me and watched over me like a father, and i won't forget it."" when he arrives home, he is in fact enjoyed. when he meets clamenza, he rewards him by going into ""a friends"" house and taking a carpet for the apartment. when vito and his friends' business in corrupted by funnucci, vito dfecides to make a go at it. we get his line of ealier age ""i make him an offer he don't refuse."" some of the best directing is put in when vito goes into an apartment from the rooftop. he has a revolver and a dinner cloth. vito unscrews the lightbulb and funnucci taps it to get it back then soon discovers vito. vito fires through the cloth. funnucci does't pay sattention to his attacker he wrather examines the wound as vito fires more ans soon the cloth is on fire. he finally gives him a mout shot and escapes to the roof where he throw the cloth aout and destroys the pistol by breakng it into pieces and throwing them into chimneys and pipes. an absolutely genious scene. when michael discovers that his brother fredo is the traitor adn gies him the kiss of death, we must be skcocked at the emotion. the script, of course, is real tight and spreads a lot. they finally pull themselves out of tight spot with a senate comittee by intemadating thei key witness pantangeli with his brother from sicily. i've seen the film five times and there's there's still a lot i could probably pick up on. kay leaves michael and informs him that she delaberertly termanated their coming child. vito takes his family on a trip to sicily where he can expand hs olive oil business and take care of some certain matters. when he makkes the visit to don ciccio, he show the respect of kissing his hand and respecting him verbally. then there's his line ""my father's name was vito andolini and this is for you!"" he slices him accross the stomach. brilliant cene, of course. then there's that train trip back where he holds michaells hand out to wave good-bye. at the funeral of mama corleone, connie says she'll stay closer to the family and convinces michael to fordive fredo who has been eliminated from the family as far as michael is concerened. there's the intensity of holding him and looking up at neri who knows what's to be done. michael is determined to have roth killed. when tom abjects he puts ""tom, ya know you surprise me. if one thing's certain. if history has taught us anything, it's that you kill anyone."" also there's ""i don't feel i have to wipe everybody out, tom. just my enemies. that's all."" tom makes a visit to pantangialli. they talk about reference of the corleone family being the roman empire. tom assures him ""don't you worry about anything franky five angles."" in tahoe, kay make a goodbye to the children. connie rushes her on account of miachael who does show up and, like before, shuts her out at a doorway, now from her own family. fredo intends to take anthony out on a boat ride to fish. anthony is called in to go to reno, so fredo goes alone with al neri. then there's the seguence like the one in the original with killings, only, of course, shorter. roth is to be handed over to protection at a miami airport and he give interviews. rocco, as a reporter impersonator gets close up and shoots him in the stomach. michael, being so nice and consederate, didn't bother at all tog ive rocco protection and he was killed as well. the fbi break open the bathroom door to find pantangiali in the tub, filled with blood, dead. michael watches from the boat house as fredo says his procedure for catching fish, a hail marry. when he finishes, we are closes on michael and hear a shot ring. then we see neri get up in the boat. michael then sits down. ""hey everyone, pay attention this is my friend carlo rizzi."" the flashback is exactly what is needed for emotion. it's the godfather's birthday and the day or a few days after pearl harbor. sonny, looking for someone for his sister, introduces carlo to connie. then sal tessio comes in with a cake. he referes to the men who have inlisted as ""a bunch of saps."" michael questions him and says that he quit school to join the marines. an innocent and patriotic man who had recentment for his family who put him in an infirmary. sonny and the others are shcocked and unpleased with this news. as their father comes in they go to sing ""for he's a jolly good fellow"" while michael sits alone at the table. then there's the scene of michael eing held by vito, waving good-bye to sicily. finally, there's the incredibly pignant scene on him in his side yard being closed in on. miserable and completely alone. he will now not be forgiven (at least by a good part of the audience) and is truly more evil then ever. the score, of course, is very emotional and filled with good compasition. coppola got the oscar for directing he deserved this time. everything about the film is great. the acting by pacino and de niro. cinemotagraphy everything. there's the great powerful paralax of a man arising to hope and being a hero to his people and there's the crookid,villainess successor who destroys what the whole matter of the particular orginazation was and was to protect. family. this is an encrddible film and an abolute great sequel about a serious subject.";29 August 2001;10;['first', 'actual', 'brutal', 'evil', 'civilain', 'such', 'spiritual', 'reverent', 'last', 'simple', 'cold', 'great', 'nice', 'reasonable', 'fair', 'preagnant', 'other', 'next', 'complete', 'useless', 'long', 'long', 'refuse', 'local', 'black', 'main', 'evil', 'good', 'eali', 'good', 'more', 'genious', 'tight', 'tight', 'key', 'olive', 'certain', 'brilliant', 'good', 'fordive', 'determined', 'certain', 'corleone', 'roman', 'franky', 'own', 'reno', 'alone', 'original', 'short', 'nice', 'consederate', 'open', 'pantangiali', 'dead', 'few', 'sonny', 'carlo', 'innocent', 'patriotic', 'sonny', 'good', 'good', 'pignant', 'miserable', 'least', 'good', 'emotional', 'good', 'great', 'great', 'powerful', 'villainess', 'whole', 'particular', 'encrddible', 'abolute', 'great', 'serious'];0.1441774891774891

675;blackmorzic;"in its ten years of existence the ""monsters on vacation"" franchise managed to become a national hit, and its characters could be remembered not only by children, but also by parents. the cartoon series broke the classic notions about the characters of famous monsters and was a kind of satire on our troubled world. the famous animator gennady tartakovsky imagined the lifestyles of every monster as strongly reminiscent of human life, and so the situations of monsters and humans were similar: the head of a large family, wolfych, was tired of work, and murray the mummy could not figure out the intricacies of romantic relationships. the main storyline was a family conflict between the vampire daughter who fell in love with an ordinary man, and her father, count dracula, who seemed too strange beloved. raising topical themes made the first monster cartoon a success, which led to the release of several sequels. and if the second part held the bar of quality of the first film, the third became a failed sequel, which has lost the spirit of the first parts. the news that not only a fourth film would follow, but also a short film about pets, was hardly accompanied by hope for resurrection: it became clear that nothing good awaited this series anymore. ""transformation"" was a kind of finale of the whole series, summing up the results of the previous parts. the plot centers again on a dispute between dracula and his son-in-law johnny, this time concerning the inheritance of the hotel transylvania itself, which drac wants to leave to his children and retire. johnny's succession is questionable: a popular place among monsters could be ruined in an instant. to gain the hotel owner's trust, johnny decides to take the bold step of transforming himself into a monster with van helsing's magic beam. however, something goes wrong, and not only does johnny become a monster, but drac also becomes a human. to find an antidote, they must travel around the world together and finally find common ground. ""monsters on vacation: transformation"" is a film that is unlucky in almost every way. first of all, it is worth noting that the film was supposed to be released last summer, but it was postponed for several months, and then it went straight to the online services. another sony animated film, mitchells vs. machines, had a similar fate, which only played to the cartoon's advantage. the problem of the impact of technology on human life was reflected in the real world, because many people watched the film on their gadgets. here the situation is almost the opposite: ""monsters on vacation: transformation"" is an adventure cartoon for viewing in cinemas during the hot summer vacations. it was also unlucky that the creator of the first parts, gennady tartakovsky, did not find the time to fully approach work on the final franchise. in ""transformation"", he acted only as a screenwriter, and the duo of derek drimon and jennifer klusky (the authors of the short film about the pets who live in the hotel ""transylvania"") were appointed as directors. therefore, and jokes built on the visual uniqueness of the world, in the new part disappeared. and in general ""monsters on vacation: transformation"" can hardly be called funny: the satire on the modern world is gone, and instead there are scenes about how the strong personality of dracula is trying to break the conditions of the human world. the new part also lacked the charm of the main characters. almost the entire old cast of monsters turned into pathetic caricatures: the mummy took the image of an old man falling asleep on the move, and frank became a brutal narcissist who brags about his muscles. there are also problems with the script itself, which simply brings nothing new to the table. the conflict between dracula and johnny from the first parts made its way into the fourth with little change: the differences between the characters were again an occasion for family arguments that only mavvis is able to resolve. the lack of a field for new solutions became a tugboat for the development of old lines, so the transformation itself had no effect on the characters: johnny is still a choleric, and drac is a grouch who wants to find idyll in everything. the finale seems to bring the characters to the point where the picture began. trusting johnny, drac gives the young couple the opportunity to rebuild the ruined hotel transylvania, but the youngsters create the same building, only changing the decor inside. perhaps in this there are similarities with the cartoon itself, which remained a copy of the first parts, never becoming a logical finale for the entire franchise.";19 January 2022;10;['national', 'classic', 'famous', 'troubled', 'famous', 'reminiscent', 'human', 'similar', 'large', 'tired', 'romantic', 'main', 'vampire', 'ordinary', 'strange', 'topical', 'first', 'several', 'second', 'first', 'third', 'first', 'fourth', 'short', 'clear', 'good', 'whole', 'previous', 'questionable', 'popular', 'bold', 'magic', 'wrong', 'common', 'unlucky', 'worth', 'last', 'several', 'online', 'similar', 'human', 'real', 'many', 'hot', 'unlucky', 'first', 'final', 'short', 'visual', 'new', 'general', 'funny', 'modern', 'strong', 'human', 'new', 'main', 'entire', 'old', 'pathetic', 'old', 'asleep', 'brutal', 'new', 'johnny', 'first', 'fourth', 'little', 'able', 'new', 'old', 'choleric', 'young', 'same', 'first', 'logical', 'entire'];0.0712829449961802

680;salesgab;the second part of francis ford coppola's masterpiece managed to be at least as powerful and moving as the original. all the elements that made the first godfather great, like the dark filmography and the beautiful music, are present in this film. coppola, who now had more confidence and therefore, more control, managed to make a more somber film, a very successful approach. as for the cast, al pacino is back in his role as michael corleone, now head of the family. marlon brando gave place to another film legend: robert de niro, who gave a performance almost as good as brando's in the first film. robert duvall is back as tom hagen, diane keaton reprises her role as kay, and, thanks to coppola, john cazale (who had a regretfully short career) and talia shire had more screen time and gave brilliant performances. as if all that wasn't enough, master lee strasberg came back from retirement as hyman roth. the godfather part ii is a delight to every lover of the first film, but also appeal to everyone else.;18 May 2012;10;['second', 'least', 'powerful', 'original', 'first', 'great', 'dark', 'beautiful', 'present', 'more', 'more', 'somber', 'successful', 'good', 'first', 'short', 'more', 'brilliant', 'enough', 'first'];0.3407894736842105
681;awesomesteinberg;"normally, movie sequels aren't very good. they are usually just rushed cash-grabs to make money off of a successful property, but occasionally they can be just as good, if not better, than the original film, as rare as this is. (""the empire strikes back,"" ""terminator 2,"" ""aliens,"" ""the dark knight,"" and ""spider-man 2"" are examples of these.) prequels are not so different, and are even harder to pull off. so, normally, the 1974 follow-up to francis ford coppola's 1972 masterpiece ""the godfather"" would have a lot to do in order to top the original. but, despite this, ""the godfather part ii,"" is, in my opinion, not only better than the original, but also the best movie of all time. (i take back what i said in my review of the original about it being the best ever made, i hadn't seen this one yet.) ""the godfather part ii"" is actually two films in one. expertly presenting two story lines, one sequel and one prequel to the original, half of the film follows late-1950s michael corleone, now as the head of the corleone crime family, expanding his power and picking off his enemies, becoming less and less like the man at the beginning of the previous film. the other half follows his father, vito, in 1920s new york as he creates the empire that later gets passed down to michael. both stand out on their own, but the two story lines, brilliantly put together, create a masterpiece that is yet to be matched. like the first movie, the best element of this movie is the acting. al pacino returns as michael, in what is undoubtedly his best performance of the two films. (i can't say the best of his career, because these two are the only movies of his i have seen. sorry, ""scarface"" fans.) he is perfect as a man who, through gaining power, loses his humanity. if you have read my review for ""lawrence of arabia,"" you'll remember i named some performances that would be on a list of the top 10 best movie performances. i have no doubts that pacino in this film would be right on there. before watching this, i had doubts as to how the movie would make do without screen legend marlon brando, as his character is twenty-five years younger, and so played by robert de niro. (i haven't yet seen ""taxi driver"" or ""raging bull."") but after watching it, i feel that he is just as good, and he really deserved his oscar win for best supporting actor. he is so good that i can't decide who did a better job, him or brando. good thing he wasn't cast in the first film, otherwise the world wouldn't have this terrific performance. although pacino and de niro are the highlights in this movie's cast, the others are excellent as well. robert duvall as michael's stepbrother, tom hagen, really sells his conflicted loyalty/fear of his changing stepbrother. lee strasberg as hyman roth, a man who michael is trying to kill, is excellent. diane keaton as kay, michael's wife, really shows how she is frightened at what he has now become. and, of course, there is john cazale as michael's brother fredo, the weakling who tries to be stronger than everyone says,but things don't go according to plan. (i won't go into specifics.) just like the first film, another great aspect is the script. doing one story line would be hard enough, but the fact that the movie does both so well, so flawlessly, is just amazing. it reintroduces the characters we already know, and take them to further places and develop them more, and also introduces more. it features parallels to the first movie, with similar scenes that show how things have changed. this installment also feels more epic than the first one, as things get bigger and darker. the film is also marvelous in its technical aspects as well. the score by nino rota, once again, is beautifully haunting, and even better than in the previous film. the cinematography by gordon willis continues to shine. (even though, ironically, he himself has regretted some scenes that he felt were too dark.) the production design is fantastic, and it helps with the epic scope i mentioned previously. the violence is more realistic, and somewhat more graphic, which gives it a better impact. the editing is also good, as the two story lines are connected beautifully. if i have one problem with the movie, it is that it is slower than the previous film, as it's longer by twenty-five minutes, and 3.3 hours makes for a pretty long movie. but, taking into account how brilliant the rest of the movie is, that can be forgiven. this film is so amazing, it astonishes on every level. i may have been disappointed that the first film only won three oscars, but fortunately this one managed to get six, including a second best picture, which were all well deserved. (i have no idea how pacino didn't get best actor, but, according to ""some like it hot,"" ""nobody's perfect."") clearly topping the original, ""the godfather part ii"" is the best film of all time, so of course, i have to give it a 10/10 rating.";13 August 2014;10;['good', 'successful', 'good', 'well', 'original', 'rare', 'dark', 'different', 'hard', 'original', 'well', 'original', 'good', 'good', 'prequel', 'original', 'corleone', 'previous', 'other', 'own', 'first', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'only', 'sorry', 'perfect', 'top', 'good', 'young', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'well', 'good', 'first', 'terrific', 'excellent', 'conflicted', 'excellent', 'frightened', 'strong', 'first', 'great', 'hard', 'amazing', 'further', 'more', 'more', 'first', 'similar', 'epic', 'first', 'big', 'dark', 'marvelous', 'technical', 'well', 'previous', 'dark', 'fantastic', 'epic', 'realistic', 'graphic', 'well', 'good', 'slow', 'previous', 'long', 'long', 'brilliant', 'amazing', 'first', 'second', 'good', 'deserved', 'good', 'hot', 'perfect', 'original', 'good'];0.3467136150234741

700;slybacon75;"i'm a decade or so too young to remember the cinematic days of the first two godfather movies, but i bet that when rumours of a sequel first began to circulate, many moviegoers would have doubted the need for it and would have had serious doubts over whether it could possibly do justice to the masterpiece that was the first film. such sequel let-downs as jurassic park ii and die hard ii had sadly all become part-and-parcel of my 1990s moviegoing experience. the only rule of sequels which i was familiar with as i grew up was that they'd almost certainly get progressively worse from movie to movie. so, after loading the cassette for godfather part ii, can you blame me for hitting the play button on my vcr with some trepidation? yes you can! i should have known better. the godfather part ii is such an outstanding movie that, in fact, to call it a sequel to the first movie does it little justice. call me cliched, but 'companion piece' is indeed the best way to describe it in relation to the first. in terms of scope and magnitude of its vision, i don't think it has a rival, anywhere. it is also one of those movies in which every little department is so perfect, that without even one of them, you can imagine the whole thing collapsing. nothing needs to be said that hasn't already been uttered innumerable times regarding the casting and their respective performances. pacino and de niro are simply mesmerising with duvall, cazale and strasberg providing the rock-solid support. coppola and puzo's script charts michael's moral demise so graphically, it almost pains you to think back to the squeaky-clean war hero presented in the godfather's opening. as for the bold move to write flashbacks, they serve a hugely meaningful purpose throughout the movie and without them, the main storyline wouldn't impact half as much as it does. nino rota's music captures in just one theme (that which first appears as the young vito approaches ellis island with fellow asylum-seekers) the grandness and sinking tragedy of this movie, and his incidental music is magnificent without being intrusive. perhaps the greatest individual plaudit should be reserved for gordon willis's cinematography; it captures the mood of the film perfectly and he betters even his work on the original. in itself it could be labelled a cinematographer's bible. and anyone who has borne witness to that final shot of the movie will know exactly what i'm talking about, but for now, that's for my fellow sequel-doubters out there to discover. an unparallelled masterpiece.";10 September 2001;10;['young', 'cinematic', 'first', 'many', 'serious', 'first', 'such', 'hard', 'only', 'familiar', 'bad', 'outstanding', 'first', 'little', 'good', 'first', 'little', 'perfect', 'whole', 'innumerable', 'respective', 'solid', 'moral', 'squeaky', 'clean', 'bold', 'meaningful', 'main', 'young', 'fellow', 'incidental', 'magnificent', 'intrusive', 'great', 'individual', 'original', 'final', 'fellow', 'unparallelled'];0.1973958333333333

713;a15haddad;"the godfather: part ii came out in 1974 with incredible hype, but when it first was released it was labeled a disappointment. only a few months later, however, it could be heard among many a debate that this movie was superior to the original. the plot is arguably even more intense and chilling and, unlike its predecessor, it tells two tales: one of how michael corleone tightens his grip on the criminal underworld in the late 1950s and another of the beginnings of his father, vito, this time played by robert de niro to outstanding effect, and his business empire. it is this near-seamless change that propels the godfather: part ii into the discussion of the greatest movies ever, where it belongs right there with the first. al pacino returns as michael corleone and this time plays him even better. on top of that, de niro, in the role that made him famous, is sublime as vito. while de niro's performance is not as memorable as marlon brando's and his character not quite as endearing, it is still one of the highlights in the history of acting in the cinema. it's sad that when most people today think of de niro it is for his performances in taxi driver, raging bull and goodfellas, or, god forbid, 21st century comedies like showtime or analyze this. it's simply amazing that the holy trinity of modern american actors- brando, pacino, and de niro, in that order- all were stars in the first two godfather pictures, and the first two's careers are still highlighted by it. however, i do not find this film to be on the exact same level as the original for a variety of reasons. make no mistake, this is an outstanding film in its own right, the best sequel ever, and the praise i could give it is very similar to the praise i give the godfather for it's consistent brilliance and masterful direction. never before have i seen a pair of films that are so beautifully orchestrated. but unlike its predecessor this movie has a couple flaws. the biggest one is with the vito corleone section. in the book, this part is detailed from vito's birth right up to the events in the godfather. however, here it only goes to about a roosevelt administration away from the start of the events detailed in the godfather. for someone who has only watched the movies this is a huge chunk of backstory that is missing. while coppola chose to focus on the don fanucci part of vito's epic tale, there is so much more of this brilliant story that is left untold. if an entire movie was centered around this, then the pace this story takes would be perfect. but this is but a part of the godfather: part ii. you cannot tell two epics in one movie, and there is simply not enough time at this pace to cap off the story satisfyingly. the current model speaks nothing of the war that brought don corleone to power. not only that, but literally every single person in this tale is italian and speaks italian. i understand how large little italy was at this time but are you telling me that vito in his time does not meet one pure american? is his life that secluded? once again, i understand the message that coppola is getting across just fine, the sense of unity and family the italians have, much like the first one, but it's done less believably here. it's also a bit harder to relate to italian dialect. the majority of my complaints lie on the vito tale. the tale involving michael corleone is absolutely compelling. emphasize that as much as possible. it's arguably more thought-provoking than its predecessor, and i would say it is more chilling, with a few parts that will absolutely make your jaw drop. that's one thing about the original, it did not have too many of those moments, but this movie has them in abundance. and not to mention al pacino makes these scenes come alive, he is just so fearsome and intimidating when provoked. however, surprisingly, many important plot mechanics of this movie are things you might not pick up your first time through. the major plot dynamic of the original was the transition between vito corleone as the don of the corleone family to michael corleone. in this movie the major mechanic is michael's relationship with fredo. it is this that represents the film's greatest intellectual stimulation and chill. especially the ending, which is among the most haunting and memorable scenes you shall ever see, up there with the original's baptism. it has a bit more closure than that of its predecessor. still, when i think of the godfather, i think of marlon brando rasping out memorable lines, of don barzini falling down the steps, of michael corleone shooting virgil solozzo in a restaurant. it is only after this that i remember the famous aspects of the godfather: part ii. the most likely reason for this is that it is a sequel, and we always remember what we saw first. still, something about this movie is not quite as memorable. it lacks that extra something that made the godfather so unique. don't get me wrong, i love this movie. it certainly has better cinematography than the original, some of the best i've seen. but it is less than it's original: just barely, but still less. somehow the plot is just not as large or alive, the scenes not as enjoyable. don't take this out of context: this movie still has the magic. it has moral considerations and character depth just like the original, this time mostly about the damnation of michael. do not let comparisons distract you from the spectacle. 9.4.

748;shoot_the_martini;the godfather ii is regarded as the only sequel to be as good as its predecessor. my opinion is that it is far better. the story focuses on michael corleone, the new godfather, and flashes back to tell the tale of his father vito as a young man. these two characters are portrayed brilliantly by al pacino and robert de niro. the performances are great on all accounts, as is the direction. with this film i found i couldn't take my eyes off the screen. the story seems overly complicated at face value, but i found i understood more than i thought i did. and it was great. i thought i'd not enjoy the film a second time round, but no i still loved it. this chapter in the corleone saga is better than its predecessor and part iii because of so many reasons. part i i feel was not as interesting, and that marlon brando's vito (many will disagree) was not as intriguing a character as michael, or even de niro's vito. part iii was a decline in the trilogy while still a worthy end (in other words it fell short of return of the jedi as 'best final episode of a trilogy'. so much had happened between ii and iii that wasn't explained in detail and seems that it may have been pivotal - even robert duvall's excellent tom hagen character was just implied as dead, and no more so. where's the 'closure' you us folk are on about (no offence)? anyway i think the three films are all amazing, but ii stands proud among them all as the best of the lot, and the best film of all time.;9 September 2001;10;['only', 'good', 'well', 'new', 'young', 'great', 'complicated', 'more', 'great', 'second', 'corleone', 'well', 'many', 'interesting', 'many', 'worthy', 'other', 'good', 'final', 'pivotal', 'excellent', 'dead', 'amazing', 'proud', 'good', 'good'];0.3932476943346508

752;Cody2310;i cannot begin to explain the brilliance of this film. it is without a doubt my favorite film and arguably one of the greatest of all time. in my opinion, al pacino gives the best performance of his career, alongside godfather part i, scarface, serpico, dog day afternoon and scent of a woman. pacino shows us the dark, ruthless and powerful side of michael corleone that was only shown for a brief time in the godfather and delivers it to perfection. the loss of marlon brando has absolutely no effect on the film because he is still there in spirit and pacino more than makes up for the absence. we are also given a glimpse of vito corleones early career as a mafia figure. robert deniro gives an amazing performance. through this we are able to make the connection between vito and michael. we learn that michael has, in fact, great reluctance compared to vito in the process of living and accepting the mafia way of life, although their motives are exactly the same: family. this film is more than good acting and plot, it is epic story telling at its best. although very different in many ways from godfather part i, which chronicles family, part ii we realize the entire godfather saga is more about the epic tragedy that is michaels life rather than the corleones. i have watched this film dozens and dozens of times and i never get bored. it is dramatic, suspenseful, emotional and clever. the script is phenomenal, the story is capturing and engaging and the acting is mind-blowing. if you have not seen this, or any of the godfathers, watch them!

753;Azzurrim17;maybe the greatest difficulty may have been to follow up a movie like the godfather, possibly the greatest movie ever, and francis ford coppola did an excellent job, most pretty good originals have a poor sequel, but how do you make a sequel to an almost perfect original. without marlon brando, al pacino fills the big shoes as the don in this movie, along with robert duvall, and flashbacks to a young vito played none other than by robert de niro. this movie shows the rise of vito and how he became so powerful, and gives you background on his upbringing and family. it also shows you how much different times are and how michael handles current situations. i read somewhere that they asked marlon brando to come back for the second even though he passed in the first he probably would have done some flashbacks and it upsets me that he didn't do that, but then again who knows how it would have turned out, if that happened maybe they wouldn't have cast de niro and would never have had the career hes had. so i guess everything happens for a reason. the godfather pt ii is a great film and falls so close to the original.;13 August 2008;10;['great', 'great', 'excellent', 'good', 'poor', 'perfect', 'original', 'big', 'young', 'other', 'powerful', 'much', 'different', 'current', 'second', 'first', 'great', 'original'];0.3514705882352941

793;joelsaxton;to those who say the godfather glorifies the mob, i say watch both part i and ii in tandem. observe where michael corleone begins and where he ends: he begins as the idealistic war hero, refusing to get involved in the family business, but he is quickly engulfed by circumstance and slowly transforms into a cold and ruthless underworld boss. the recurring theme of solitude is persistent throughout the film. michael trusts nobody, and his instinct is ultimately proved correct when he learns fredo has betrayed him. in the end, he is completely alone. he has destroyed his marriage, he has alienated his consiglierie, and he has murdered his brother. from this perspective, the story of the godfather is a classic tragedy. the final shot solidifies this notion, showing michael sitting alone, reflecting on his life. by trying to protect his family, michael has destroyed it.;14 February 2005;10;['idealistic', 'cold', 'ruthless', 'persistent', 'correct', 'alone', 'classic', 'final'];-0.3583333333333333
794;itszach94;"the godfather part two opens right where the the godfather left off. nino rota's masterful and romantic score whispers off in the distance. the screen fades in from total darkness, pure emptiness. we see a focused man sitting stoically in a leather bound armchair. darkness expands around him on all sides. this man is al pacino as michael corleone. around him his associates kneel, showing their utmost respect. michael is being crowned the new don of his family. in the last film, his father, a powerful new york mob boss, had passed away, requiring michael to now lead his family. with this action, michael is closing the door on his old life and returning fans are quickly reacquainted with this epic tale. the godfather part two was left with the task of filling an extremely large pair of shoes, as its predecessor is considered one of, if not the greatest, film of all time. the second film does surprisingly well in accomplishing this enormous undertaking. with its stellar combination of all elements that make a film great, the godfather part two easily works its way into the discussion of the greatest movies of all time. this film effectively flips back and forth between two different plots in two separate time periods. after being reintroduced to michael, we are immediately transported to the beautifully recreated island of sicily at the turn of the century. we are then shown a young vito corleone (andolini), michael's father. we are also told that vito's father was recently murdered and that his brother has fled to seek retribution, leaving only young and timid vito and his mother. vito's innocence is exemplified by the quietness and minimal dialogue in this opening scene. quickly after, we are informed that his brother has also been killed by the same man and he and his mother go speak to the mob boss that has committed these acts. in attempting to plead with the local boss, his mother is murdered and vito flees to new york. once in new york, the plot documents vito's exciting rise from a poor italian peasant into one of new york's most powerful mob bosses. he overthrows the current boss, and he along with his friends, put themselves into power. during this portion of the film we are introduced to younger versions of characters from the first film, such as peter clemenza and mama corleone, vito's wife. throughout this tale, vito also seeks retribution for the murders of his family. the final words he utters to his families killer are, ""my father's name was antonio andolini and this is for you"" this event show vito's rise to power coming full circle. interwoven between this story is also the tale of michael corleone's personal struggle. he struggles in keeping control of his family and also trying to legitimize his business ventures, involving such groups as the us senate. in this plot we see the development of michael from the timid young man he was in the first movie to the true face of evil he becomes. al pacino's beautiful performance, such as his soulless glare and heartlessly delivered dialogue, accent the corruptness in his character. we also see his life slipping away from him in many different ways because of his terrible actions, most specifically the act he commits towards the end of the film. this final scene shows the completion of michaels's transformation into pure evil. the plot ends with one of the greatest climaxes in modern cinema. even without the legendary marlon brando at the helm, this film still contains one of the greatest ensemble casts of all time. al pacino, now at the fore-front, is supported by the likes of robert deniro as vito corleone, diane keaton as kay corelone and robert duval as tom hagen, to mention a few. every character has an added depth due to these talented actors' ranges. this phenomenal cast makes the viewer care about family aspect of the film and believe that all of these actors could truly be related. though a long film, totaling over three hours in length, excellent pacing keeps the viewer interested at all times. there is never a truly dull moment in the plot. the expanded run time allows for a more complete tale to be told. also, exceptional editing mixes both plots together. i disagree with roger ebert when he says the two plots, ""provides for itself a structural weakness from which the film never recovers"" i think the two plots strengthen the movie as a whole. over the course of the movie, the viewer is never confused and the plots never seem to run over into each other. francis ford coppola and gordon willis continue their partnership as director and cinematographer to create one the most visually compelling films of all time. in discussing willis's cinematography, vincent canby of the new york times said, ""the photography by gordon willis, so effective originally, is now comically fancy the exteriors are too bright and glowy while the interiors are so dark"" he is discussing willis common use of darkness in his shots. i feel that willis's continued use of his dark and shadowy style adds a deeper emotion to every scene. coppola's dynamic choices on shots contribute to the sensation in scenes, even ones with very little dialogue. together they beautifully recreate settings such as sicily, las vegas, miami and cuba. the godfather part two surpasses all goals that it set out to achieve. its stellar cast highlights one of the best written tales of family and honor in the history of cinema. it is hard to define the godfather part two as purely just a gangster movie. it is much more easily defined as a masterpiece. combining all of the elements that produce a great film, the team behind the godfather part two created one of the greatest movies of all time.";15 December 2011;9;['masterful',

804;zaeem751;"if you asked me 1 year ago about the godfather or the godfather part ii , i would say the godfather 1. but, after my 5th watch to the godfather part ii, it's my favorite for many reasons. in my opinion the godfather ii , i think it's a difficult movie when compare to the first one, as the movie follows 2 time lines, the younger vito and michael. usually most of movies that follows this kind of structure (2 time lines ) might not be successful, but in this movie it was brilliant as we can see how vito trying to build his empire and the most important thing for him is his family. on the other hand, the film shifts to michael and how his leadership is different from his father , which it main goal is power without taking care of his family. in addition, there are some cultural differences between the two movies, especially in the wedding scenes, in the godfather 1 we can see how the italian culture still exists, such as the music. on the other hand, in part 2 this thing slowly dying when frank pentangeli asked the band to sing an italian song but the band didn't know what's the song (which shows the cultural differences between michael's era and vito's era). the second point is that , there are a lot of scenes that doesn't have a dialogue but it explains a lot of things. for example, some people wondering how michael knew it was fredo who betrayed him ( we all know it's fredo when he received a phone call to help them again after the assassination of michael failed, but fredo refused ), it was obvious, ( look to michael's face when they setting together in cuba ) he had some suspicions, and his suspicions was confirmed when fredo said that johny ola ( hayman roth assistant) told him about this place. the third point, the cinematography was amazing, how coppola showed us in the 1920s and cuba in the 1950s. the final point is the casting in both movies was amazing, and the music especially ""the immigrant"" theme ( you must listen to it), and ""in cuba"" song when michael arrived in cuba (it's not available in the music album of the movie). in conclusion, i hope my review is helpful to you. thanks.";3 July 2021;10;['many', 'difficult', 'first', 'young', 'most', 'successful', 'brilliant', 'important', 'other', 'different', 'main', 'cultural', 'italian', 'such', 'other', 'frank', 'italian', 'cultural', 'second', 'obvious', 'third', 'amazing', 'final', 'amazing', 'available', 'helpful'];0.1923611111111111

(i like to focus on one thing at a time) michael showed a very dark side of him in this movie, i.e hitting kay, i like that. that's one of the things i liked about the movie, i like seeing a dark side of a character and how well the actor can play that part and al pacino portrayed him excellently . but they didn't go deep enough into michael's emotions, you really didn't get a chance to understand him as well as in the godfather iii. in all honesty i think that the godfather and the godfather iii are the best in the series and are a major contribution to the cinema, i just hope they won't make a forth one. that'll ruin the series for sure.;20 June 2005;8;['good', 'favorite', 'other', 'dark', 'dark', 'good', 'major', 'forth', 'sure'];0.2546874999999999

810;leperish;"as a huge fan of the godfather series, (yes i even like part three) i have to say that part two is my personal favorite. part one shows us the title of godfather being passed from vito corleone (marlon brando) to his son michael (al pacino). the second film begins with vito as a young boy being smuggled out of sicily after his entire family was murdered by the local mafia. then the story re-joins michael in his now powerful position as mafia don, and head of the corleone family. the film is divided into sections of the present-day story of michael trying to gear the family to bigger deals in cuba with his fathers old partner hyman roth (lee strasberg) while also dealing with the uprising of the cuban rebels; and the betrayal of his brother fredo (john cazale). one of the great scenes is when he gives fredo the ""kiss of death"" at the new year's party. the other section of the film is comprised of a young vito (as played by robert de niro) making his way in old town new york. it shows his way up the organized crime ladder, making friends and connections that would later (and earlier) carry the story. francis ford coppola delivers masterful genius in this epic reprisal of a gangster classic. he uses soft, brown textures and dull sepia tones to perfection. the lighting has yet to be duplicated in any film. the way some of these shots are framed have been studied in film schools the world over. in short, if your looking for the epitamy of cinematic enjoyment mixed with that good ole' classic gangster violence, this is the movie for you. i would recommend it to anyone.";10 August 2005;10;['huge', 'personal', 'second', 'young', 'entire', 'local', 'powerful', 'corleone', 'present', 'big', 'old', 'cuban', 'great', 'new', 'other', 'young', 'old', 'masterful', 'epic', 'soft', 'brown', 'dull', 'short', 'epitamy', 'cinematic', 'good', 'classic'];0.1602766798418972

815;mitsubishiwarrior;part ii of the godfather trilogy banks lavishly on inherent yet subtle tension - a maneuvering sense of distrust and deceit envelops each frame, compromising for the lack of numbing action that was laden throughout the first installment of the trilogy. michael corleone, helmed impeccably by al pacino, now has a face creased by a mask of implacable hatred his character arc now much more refined and polished as francis ford coppola explores his newly formed salivation for power. once again, coppola encompasses the sizzling world of italian mafia perfectly, but now with much more stunning narrative flourish as the audience delves deeper into the roots of the corleone family. the transitions into vito's early life are sublimely entertaining and masterfully executed, especially the opening scene of vito's mother's death which immaculately sets the tone for a controlled and layered film. not only this, but the explicitly violent vengeance by vito towards the end of the film is directorial genius as coppola presents a complete, impactful and invigorating tale of vito in the most astute form imaginable. however, it would be wrong not to mention the contrast in exhilaration between the subplots of vito compared to michael, with al pacino's story arc being far less entertaining or interesting (although it does have its fair share of enthrallment, including his tantalizing riff with fredo). the absence of defining action or hard-hitting set pieces in the third act of part ii, with coppola refraining from grandeur, and focusing more on the characters, is what sets the film apart from perfection, but it would be criminal to deny the brilliance of this film;4 April 2017;9;['inherent', 'subtle', 'laden', 'first', 'implacable', 'refined', 'polished', 'italian', 'stunning', 'flourish', 'corleone', 'early', 'entertaining', 'layered', 'violent', 'directorial', 'complete', 'impactful', 'astute', 'imaginable', 'wrong', 'entertaining', 'interesting', 'fair', 'set', 'third', 'criminal'];0.1111111111111111

874;pukh-86716;"you know, in my opinion, in order to write a decent review for a film of the scale of the godfather: part ii, you need to lie on the mattress for at least a day or two and draw on all your inner writer's reserves. but what to do if, against the background of the difficult modern life, which is in full swing, there is no time to conduct any fundamental research, and god has deprived god of literary talent? and there is nothing but naked enthusiasm, mixed with movie fanaticism, available. and the film is hooked, but to pay tribute to him, oh how i want to! this is where amateur reviews like mine are born. so do not judge strictly, dear friends, for what will be written below. right away, i think it's worth shooting in the direction of honorary, more deserved than ever, but at the same time too stamped (by the way, about stamps: the title of this review is my little whim) and template titles: ""kinoclassika"", ""masterpiece world cinema"" and ""reference crime drama"". all of them are quite reasonably used by several generations of viewers and critics, so activating these levers of influence on the reader now is a rather pointless exercise. we (most of us) already know that this is a great movie, therefore, we can do without intrusive accents. i happened to read a wonderful novel by mario puzo and, one might say, firsthand, i am familiar with the fact that fragments of the book, which were not included in the previous film, were used, dedicated to the formation of vito corleone (andolini at birth) in inhospitable new york in the first quarter of the twentieth century. they added the original script to the adapted script and got something from the ""two in one"" category. at the same time, flashbacks from the life of vito corleone are extremely organically woven into the narrative around michael corleone in the late 50s of the twentieth century. father and son, the rise and preservation of the corleone empire. probably, it was possible to give two screenwriting oscars at once. everyone knows that before the amazing ""heat"" and obscure ""right to kill"" was ""the godfather 2"". two inhabitants of the actor's olympus in one film (even if in the first of them they are separated by several dozen plot years, and there is no need to talk about the appearance in one frame) - it's worth a lot. they can sing praises endlessly, but for real moviegoers, this song is no longer a novelty, and a jammed record, you know, tends to bother. i will limit myself to a couple of theses. al pacino acts as a constant, undoubtedly the key to the success of the dilogy. the role of the godfather in the second generation is performed by him with filigree accuracy and the necessary intonations. the whole genius of pacino is especially clearly realized in the pre-final scene of a family dinner, when we see young michael smiling and strikingly different from michael ""after twenty years"". brando, who had already played his best roles, was replaced by the young de niro, who had yet to show his remarkable talent. for the role of the same character, both actors received an oscar. symbolically. fair. so, what can the viewer remember (probably still having a shorter time than the main one) about the young vito corleone, the future godfather of the italian mafia in new york? i think it's true drama, a wonderful performance by the spectacular de niro, especially heartfelt music from nino rota, and moments that refer to the first part of the saga and make you exclaim something like ""oh, yes, this is the same clemenza!"". there are several iconic scenes in this part of the film. here are just a couple of phrases from the lips of vito corleone describing them: i make him an offer he don't refuse. do me this favor. i won't forget it. ask your friends in the neighborhood about me. they'll tell you i know how to return a favor. the main part, which tells about vito's son michael corleone, or rather the state of affairs at the time of its initial scenes, can be described by dialogue: kay: it made me think of what you once told me: ""in five years the corleone family will be completely legitimate."" that was seven years ago. michael corleone: i know. i'm trying, darling. yes, hard times have come for the corleone family. we draw a picture executed in rather gloomy colors and interiors (despite the abundance of sunny locations, such as miami or cuba), suggesting unoriginal thoughts that membership in the italian mafia is not a job that you can quit of your own free will, but the status of the head of the family imposes huge obligations on its bearer. michael's relationship with kay is going through a severe test that could lead to the door being slammed in the face of the mother of their children. michael's relationship with his brother fredo and sister connie is also far from ideal. especially with fredo, the one who became the culprit of such a catchphrase: michael corleone: i know it was you fredo. you broke my heart. you broke my heart! the root cause of the family drama is obvious: michael: i've always taken care of you, fredo. fredo corleone i'm your older brother, mike, and you're taking care of me? did you ever think about that? in the outside world, there is frankie ""five angels"" pentangeli, who still remembers the good old days: those were the great old days, you know... and we was like the roman empire... the corleone family was like the roman empire... and also hyman roth (whose prototype was the mobster meyer lansky), the author of the golden words ""this is the business we chose"", the one about which michael says that ""hyman roth has been dying from the same heart attack for the last twenty years"", and frankie gives him this characterization ""your father did business with hyman roth, he respected hyman roth... but he never trusted hyman roth!"" and now michael has to build his relationships with these people, wading through the thick of criminal intrigues, often threatening his life and the lives of loved ones. the response will not keep you waiting: michael corleone: i don't feel i have to wipe everybody out, tom. just my enemies. tom hagen: it would be like trying to kill the president; there's no way we can get to him. michael corleone: tom, you know you surprise me. if anything in this life is certain - if history has taught us anything - it's that you can kill anybody. well, as a result of all these events, the viewer will receive several more cult scenes, the crown of which will be an unforgettable dimming of the image of such a powerful and at the same time such a lonely michael corleone. icons of world cinema. eternal godfather.";19 January 2022;9;['decent', 'least', 'inner', 'difficult', 'modern', 'full', 'fundamental', 'literary', 'naked', 'available', 'amateur', 'dear', 'worth', 'honorary', 'deserved', 'same', 'stamped', 'little', 'several', 'pointless', 'most', 'great', 'intrusive', 'wonderful', 'familiar', 'previous', 'inhospitable', 'first', 'twentieth', 'original', 'same', 'late', 'twentieth', 'possible', 'amazing', 'obscure', 'right', 'first', 'several', 'worth', 'real', 'jammed', 'constant', 'second', 'filigree', 'necessary', 'whole', 'pre', 'final', 'young', 'different', 'good', 'remarkable', 'same', 'fair', 'short', 'main', 'young', 'future', 'italian', 'true', 'wonderful', 'spectacular', 'heartfelt', 'first', 'same', 'several', 'iconic', 'main', 'initial', 'corleone', 'legitimate', 'hard', 'corleone', 'gloomy', 'sunny', 'such', 'unoriginal', 'italian', 'own', 'free', 'huge', 'severe', 'ideal', 'obvious', 'old', 'outside', 'good', 'old', 'great', 'old', 'corleone', 'golden', 'same', 'last', 'criminal', 'loved', 'certain', 'several', 'more', 'cult', 'unforgettable', 'powerful', 'same', 'lonely', 'eternal'];0.186359126984127

898;JimBallard;it's hard to give an objective review when you are dealing with favourite movies. having just watched this for the first time in years i was delighted to see it was as magnificent as i remembered it. francis ford coppola would have been sensible to be wary of doing a sequel when he'd just made a film as acclaimed as the godfather. how do you follow that? amazingly he managed to broaden the themes of the original, producing a study of power and corruption that may be unequalled in hollywood history. and whereas some critics found the first film questionable in its moral compass (is michael supposed to be a hero?) the sequel leaves us in no doubt that he has passed on into something else and as his wife kay shrewdly notices, there is no coming back. judge the film on its own merits and ignore the continuation of the saga in part iii. this is the final michael as we should always remember him. the scope of part ii is extraordinary (as if the first film wasn't bold enough!) with the story of father vito in 1920s new york cross- cut with son michael's rivalry with ageing mobster hymen roth, a respected, though never trusted, business partner of his father. these later sequences may not make sense on first viewing but there are some remarkable set pieces from revolutionary cuba to a senate committee in washington. this is a no holds barred portrait of american society corrupt and hypocritical from top to bottom. how often has hollywood been so daring the film invites a contrast between father and son, with young family man vito embracing criminality out of necessity and using his status to become a 'godfather' in the italian american community. meanwhile in his middle age michael has become a don hooked on vengeance with all business now personal. the inevitable conclusion of which is a violent crescendo with him not just wiping out his enemies (again) but committing the far worse sin of betraying his own family. few films can have gathered such a fine cast. al pacino's michael is the symbol of idealism turned sour in extremis. more than anything this is what elevates the godfather over so many other gangster films. he's not just some goodfella or ordinary guy, he once aspired to be a great man but somewhere something went wrong. robert duvall as tom hagen is the great constant across the two films, always at the side, never changing, but in his reaction to the transformation of michael we get confirmation of his moral decline. diane keaton as kay has a meatier role this time and as the voice of 'respectable' america shows the futility of michael's actions. if he can't keep his family together, what's it all for? john cazale's fredo is a tragedy of his own. secretly resentful of his younger brother, their mutual betrayal becomes one of the emotional cores of the saga. replacing the character of clemenza proved relatively easy as even if the story loses something, michael v. gazzo was memorable whilst the legendary lee strasborg is a suitably cast as rival/partner and pretend uncle to michael hymen roth, delivering one of the movies' great speeches. so often artists seem burdened by great achievements, but not here. one can only assume that the young coppola was so exulted by the critical and commercial phenomenon of the godfather, he felt capable of anything and judging by this, he near enough was. one only wonders why he's largely struggled to reach similar heights ever since.;16 January 2015;10;['hard', 'objective', 'favourite', 'first', 'delighted', 'magnificent', 'sensible', 'wary', 'original', 'first', 'questionable', 'moral', 'own', 'final', 'extraordinary', 'first', 'bold', 'respected', 'later', 'first', 'remarkable', 'revolutionary', 'american', 'corrupt', 'hypocritical', 'young', 'italian', 'american', 'middle', 'personal', 'inevitable', 'violent', 'bad', 'own', 'few', 'fine', 'sour', 'more', 'many', 'other', 'ordinary', 'great', 'wrong', 'great', 'moral', 'meaty', 'respectable', 'own', 'resentful', 'young', 'mutual', 'emotional', 'easy', 'memorable', 'legendary', 'rival', 'great', 'great', 'young', 'critical', 'commercial', 'capable', 'similar'];0.1726851851851851

914;Frosst;"having written a review for the godfather it feels, when thinking about it, like a travesty not to write a review for the sequel; the godfather part ii. especially after having written my first review such a long time ago, however i have to say that i'm not that much into writing reviews hence the reason i've only written one. but i've decided i will give it a fair shot although i'm wondering how many people will even read it. it should of course go without saying that this isn't as much of a sequel as it is a continuation of the first film, calling it a sequel is to underestimate the importance of this film. as masterfully done as the first one it's for me extremely difficult to actually pick one over the other, the only reason i have the godfather higher than part ii is not because it's better but because of it being the beginning of the journey, the very introduction to this world, if you'll call it that. (brando's magnificent performance may also have something to do with this) in the godfather part 2 michael corleone has, as we all know, become the new don and the film which takes place in the 50's sees michael becoming corrupt with greed and power. he pretty much becomes just like his father, it's a transformation so interestingly compelling and grandeur that one can't stop but feel sorry for him in some ways. meanwhile the story of vito corleone from childhood to adulthood is chronicled through the use of flashbacks. we see him arrive to america from sicily, only a child, and how he creates his mafia empire. the actor portraying him is of course robert de niro whose performance is electrifying. these flashbacks are spoken in italian which i found to be interesting. but while de niro captures the mannerisms of don vito corleone it's al pacino who gives the best performance as michael corleone. he's even better here than in the first film, of course this time marlon brando wasn't around who could overshadow everyone, and it's only because of his fantastic performance that you're able to feel sorry for him. al pacino was very good in the first film but here he's even greater. the supporting cast is great too; the ever wonderful robert duvall, diane keaton and of course the late john cazale. the acting is just as great as in the first film. francis ford coppolas directing is amazing as is the cinematography. there is really nothing more to be said about this masterpiece. i know i'm late with this review, but being someone who never really wrote reviews this is my second but not last one. and fitting that it should be about my second favorite film and the second greatest in cinema...";23 January 2017;10;['first', 'long', 'much', 'fair', 'many', 'much', 'first', 'first', 'difficult', 'other', 'only', 'high', 'well', 'very', 'magnificent', 'new', 'corrupt', 'compelling', 'sorry', 'italian', 'interesting', 'good', 'first', 'fantastic', 'able', 'sorry', 'good', 'first', 'great', 'great', 'wonderful', 'late', 'great', 'first', 'amazing', 'more', 'late', 'second', 'last', 'fitting', 'second', 'favorite', 'second', 'great'];0.2655340909090908

916;phillipfawcett-92318;phillip fawcett says it is hard to choose which single godfather movie should go into the top 10 at the expense of the others. the saga really needs to be taken as a whole - even the 3rd installment, generally seen as the weakest, rounds the epic story off in poetic fashion - and as such would go into my personal top 10 of all-time movies as a trilogy. that said, i single out godfather ii if i must. this is the most self-contained in theme and form, tracking the origins of the corleone dynasty and the rise to crime of michael corleone. it is the ultimate portrayal of a man allowing himself to fall to the corruptions of power , and lose his morality to murderous evil. he is both victim of fate, of forces which seemed to compel him into this monstrous world, and a willful sinner. the final scene, as he sits alone in his spacious grounds reflecting on his life, encapsulates the true theme of this tale: not 'the mafia', not 'murder', not 'american-italian culture', but that of a human being losing his soul.;5 December 2016;10;['hard', 'single', 'top', 'weak', 'epic', 'poetic', 'such', 'personal', 'corleone', 'ultimate', 'murderous', 'monstrous', 'willful', 'final', 'spacious', 'true', 'american', 'italian'];0.0451465201465201

929;soxfan6978;"moving through the deep shadows and heavy glooms of his vast estate, michael corleone presides over the destruction of his own spirit in ""the godfather, part ii."" the character we recall from ""the godfather"" as the best and brightest of don vito's sons, the one who went to college and enlisted in the marines, grows into a cold and ruthless man, obsessed with power. the film's closing scenes give us first a memory of a long-ago family dinner, and then michael at mid-life, cruel, closed, and lonely. he's clearly intended as a tragic figure. the corleone saga, as painted by francis ford coppola and mario puzo in two films totaling nearly seven hours, has been a sort of success story in reverse. in a crazy way, ""the godfather"" and its sequel belong in the same category with those other epics of immigrant achievement in america, ""the emigrants"" and ""the new land."" the corleone family worked hard, was ambitious, remembered friends, never forgave disloyalty, and started from humble beginnings to become the most powerful mafia organization in the country. if it were not that the family business was crime, these films could be an inspiration for us all. coppola seems to hold a certain ambivalence toward his material. don vito corleone as portrayed by marlon brando in ""the godfather"" was a man of honor and dignity, and it was difficult not to sympathize with him, playing with his grandchild in the garden, at peace after a long lifetime of murder, extortion, and the rackets. what exactly were we supposed to think about him? how did coppola feel toward the godfather? ""the godfather, part ii"" moves both forward and backward in time from the events in ""the godfather,"" in an attempt to resolve our feelings about the corleones. in doing so, it provides for itself a structural weakness from which the film never recovers, but it does something even more disappointing: it reveals a certain simplicity in coppola's notions of motivation and characterization that wasn't there in the elegant masterpiece of his earlier film. he gives us, first of all, the opening chapters in don vito's life. his family is killed by a mafia don in sicily, he comes to america at the age of nine, he grows up (to be played by robert de niro), and edges into a career of crime, first as a penny-ante crook and then as a neighborhood arranger and power broker: a man, as the movie never tires of reminding us, of respect.";29 November 2005;10;['deep', 'heavy', 'vast', 'own', 'good', 'bright', 'cold', 'ruthless', 'long', 'ago', 'life', 'cruel', 'closed', 'lonely', 'tragic', 'corleone', 'crazy', 'same', 'other', 'immigrant', 'new', 'corleone', 'ambitious', 'humble', 'powerful', 'certain', 'difficult', 'long', 'backward', 'structural', 'disappointing', 'certain', 'elegant', 'early'];-0.080002405002405

971;d-24473;"exhilarating, intense, passionate. these are words often used to describe francis ford coppola's 1974 film, ""the godfather ii"". the film certainly delivers on all of those descriptions, and then some. it maintains the same themes of family, betrayal, and revenge as its preceding film, the godfather, while still keeping the experience fresh and invigorating to experience. the story is a continuation of the godfather, following michael corleone played brilliantly by al pacino. after his father's death he becomes the new don of the corleone family. due to the events that occurred in the previous installment, michael has pulled out of new york to consolidate his operation in nevada. while in his home, michael is the victim of an assasination attempt. he suspects betrayal within his own family, and leads his own investigation into the matter. meanwhile michael has ambitions to expand business into florida and cuba with his father's old business partner hyman roth (played by lee strasberg). throughout the movie it transitions using a flashback to michael's father, vito corleone played by robert de nero. it takes us through his life growing up in sicily, italy, and eventually immigrating to new york. we see how vito grew the corleone name into a respected and powerful symbol, and building his business from the ground up. coppola displays his creative skill in screenwriting by telling two compelling narratives in the same film. the way he uses lighting to change the mood and tone of the setting adds depth to each scene. it creates an eerie and intense feeling at just the right moments, striking emotion into the scenes. the only problem i found with the writing was if you don't have any historical context, you will find yourself somewhat confused about what is happening. though the use of history in the story is done perfectly, and adds another creative layer to the cuba arc of the story. if you aren't paying attention or miss details because of the laid back and casual way lines are delivered at some key moments, then the following scene might fly over your head. my first viewing of the film i found myself asking myself ""why are they doing that?"", or ""why did that happen?"". despite this, the story is still told in a mature and creative way that held my attention throughout the entire three and a half hour run time. all major themes found in the previous film family, betrayal, and revenge are built upon in this one. each theme plays an important role in each of the decisions that are made. coppola mixes themes that are like oil and water to make a shocking and compelling narrative. all themes in the film are ones that the majority of people watching can relate to, which allows the viewer to connect better with the characters and what they're feeling. the acting in the film mustn't go overlooked either. al pacino delivers his most notable performance in this film. i was able to feel the anger and passion through the screen during a major twist while he was arguing with his wife about their unborn child. all of the context built throughout the film and knowing how important family is for michael, tears at the viewer which wouldn't be possible without al pacino's incredible performance. robert de nero and robert duvall each play their roles very notably, they where each casted perfectly and couldn't imagine any other actor playing their roles. there are some moments where the acting could be improved, like how a dead body is clearly breathing if you look close enough which can break the immersion. it's a very insignificant gripe, but worth mentioning. the soundtrack in the film is beautifully produced, and at times coppola uses music being played in the scene to make the setting feel more natural. the godfather ii is truly a timeless masterpiece of a film. it is the perfect example of a sequel done right, building on the key themes and elements that defined the previous film. the use of history and the blending of themes that on the surface wouldn't mix creates a compelling, exhilarating, and intense story that will hook you deep the entire time. coppola is definitely a titan in the drama genre, which resulted in one of the most influential films of our time.";22 January 2020;10;['exhilarating', 'intense', 'passionate', 'same', 'fresh', 'new', 'corleone', 'previous', 'own', 'own', 'old', 'corleone', 'respected', 'powerful', 'creative', 'compelling', 'same', 'eerie', 'intense', 'right', 'only', 'historical', 'confused', 'creative', 'casual', 'key', 'following', 'first', 'mature', 'creative', 'entire', 'half', 'major', 'previous', 'important', 'shocking', 'compelling', 'notable', 'able', 'major', 'unborn', 'important', 'possible', 'incredible', 'other', 'dead', 'insignificant', 'worth', 'natural', 'timeless', 'perfect', 'key', 'previous', 'compelling', 'exhilarating', 'intense', 'entire', 'influential'];0.1540276716747305

977;finddietplan;winner of 3 academy awards, including best picture and best adapted screenplay, the godfather is one of the most revered movies of all time and its contribution to cinema is remarkable. this movie will make you intrigued by its astounding depiction of the mafia and immerse you into its world from the very start while being impressed by its technical and narrative aspects. based on the mario puzo novel of the same name, the godfather spans ten years and chronicles the history of the corleone family under its patriarch, vito corleone, a respected mafia don nicknamed the godfather. but when don corleone refuses to enter drug business, a series of events are set in motion resulting in the assassination attempt on the don and leading his youngest son to rise and take over his father's business. francis ford coppola's direction is nothing short of astounding. many of the creative decisions he made, such as the way he shoots the film, the casting, the screenplay, which he co-wrote with mario puzo, it's all done brilliantly. the technical aspects will also make you impressed. the cinematography is done beautifully and the use of technicolor provides a memorable look for the film. the editing is also done well and the soundtrack by nino rota is one of the most memorable scores in cinema history, as its almost funeral-themed opening track still remains iconic and fits the film's overall tone. the performances in the film are amazing, as it features an amazing cast of brilliant actors such as marlon brando, al pacino, diane keaton, james caan, richard duvall, john cazale, talia shire and many more. i love how the film handles michael corleone's character arc in this film and marlon brando's performance as vito corleone is one of the greatest performances in cinema history. honestly, there's really nothing to complain about this film, as it's highly agreed to be of the greatest films in history. the godfather brilliantly weaves an intriguing look into the world of organized crime along with innovative storytelling, focused direction and astounding performances.;27 March 2020;9;['good', 'good', 'revered', 'remarkable', 'astounding', 'technical', 'narrative', 'same', 'corleone', 'respected', 'young', 'short', 'astounding', 'many', 'creative', 'such', 'technical', 'impressed', 'memorable', 'memorable', 'themed', 'iconic', 'overall', 'amazing', 'amazing', 'brilliant', 'such', 'many', 'more', 'great', 'great', 'intriguing', 'innovative', 'astounding'];0.45

1022;citizen_manary;"after seeing ""the godfather"" for the first time, it instantly rose to the ranks of my favorite films. because i loved the film so much, i didn't think either of its sequels could surpass it. however, i was wrong. the godfather part ii contains some of the finest acting, direction, screenwriting and design that has ever been seen in film. to call this film spectacular is an understatement of near criminal proportions. this is a masterwork, and however varied coppola's career has been since, ""ii"" will always redeem him. enough people have described the plot, so i won't go into that. instead, i'll focus on the performances. de niro is wonderful as young vito corleone. de niro uses more facial communication than speech in the film, like brando in ""i"". in de niro, we see a hungry young man who comes the the u.s. with anger and a desire for vengeance, and watch him evolve into a man who obtains the power to achieve it. additionally, his character's arc provides the perfect contrast to michael's. young vito is a man who builds ties with others, has good professional and personal relationships, and would never lose his family. the last shot of his character is a tender moment between father and son. as good as de niro is, pacino outshines him (and everyone else) in his part as michael. in the last film, we saw a young man who gradually became caught in an undesired life. here, we see him grow into that life, and what he does with the power he's attained. pacino is brutal in this film. he commands the screen whenever on it, and his character's destruction of the family and enterprise his father worked hard to create is devastating. you feel for michael, a man who is despicable and has lost the honor he had at the beginning of the first film, but who has also been caught in a world that he never could have avoided, much as he might have tried. as michael becomes colder, harder and continues drawing his family's organization away from what it originally was, pacino's character continues to become more sympathetic. even his eyes communicate the change this character has gone through from the beginning of ""i"" to the end of ""ii"". it's a brilliantly played part, and it isn't surprising that pacino hasn't been able to surpass it. in fact, it could be argued that this is the greatest performance captured in cinema. the other performances are uniformly spectacular. keaton and duvall are standouts. however, john cazale, someone who deserved a career like pacino or de niro's (though the career he did have while he was alive was impeccable) is also brilliant. michael's destruction of his family has much to do with his relationship with fredo, and fredo's inadverdent betrayal. cazale is brilliant as a man who has always been viewed as a weakling and lived in the shadow of his brothers and tries to get out, only to bring about his own fall in the process. it's nearly as devastating a part as pacino's, and cazale plays it perfectly. in conclusion, i cannot recommend this film highly enough. it enhances ""i"", and surpasses it at the same time. while ""iii"" is a good film, it doesn't achieve the perfection that the first two have. if you haven't watched this series already, set aside a day and enjoy film perfection.";21 October 2001;10;['first', 'favorite', 'much', 'wrong', 'fine', 'spectacular', 'near', 'criminal', 'varied', 'enough', 'wonderful', 'young', 'more', 'facial', 'hungry', 'young', 'perfect', 'young', 'good', 'professional', 'personal', 'last', 'tender', 'good', 'last', 'young', 'undesired', 'brutal', 'devastating', 'despicable', 'first', 'cold', 'sympathetic', 'surprising', 'able', 'great', 'other', 'spectacular', 'alive', 'impeccable', 'brilliant', 'much', 'brilliant', 'own', 'same', 'good', 'first'];0.2579166666666666

1041;brandon_j_snider;i used to think this film was great, but then i grew up. greater sophistication means greater appreciation for the majestic perfection of the original. unfortunately, it also means the glaring faults of this flick are all the more obvious with each viewing. this film contrasts the rising nationwide fame and influence of michael corleone, a more cold-blooded version of his brilliant father don vito, with the early life of don vito and the beginnings of the corleone crime family. problem is, even though robert de niro's portrayal of vito is brilliant, to be honest, we don't care. the current situation in late 1950's las vegas is more interesting and faster paced, making the retro turn-of-the-century scenes anti-climactic and an unwelcome break in the real action. more flaws abound. an assassination attempt against michael is blamed on two different parties at once, and we are left wondering which one michael really thinks betrayed him. when michael finally tells fredo, we are left wondering if he's telling the truth, when i think we're supposed to be fully aware at that point. michael always knows a lot more than we do, and that's a problem. hyman roth could have been a great movie villain, but nothing he does or says in this movie makes any real sense. again, his motives are murky, and he knows more than we do. is he motivated by revenge for michael's killing of moe greene? or by greed? we're never sure. his health is so bad, we might believe he should retire, but why he doesn't is left unclear. there are several major choices made by characters in this movie that i didn't buy. one by michael, one by fredo, one by kay. of them all, i'm most inclined to buy fredo's, but even then, the flick doesn't explain it properly. at the end of this flick, as a result of michael's choice, connie should have a very emotional reaction, similar to her final scene in the first film, but coppola, inexplicably and unfairly, robs her of that. the film ends before we can see it. i think there was a constant tug-of-war between coppola and puzo that resulted in these issues. the first flick was a direct adaptation of the book, but there was no book this time around. the purpose of this flick, which it accomplishes to a certain degree, is to show don vito building a family and a life in america, and his cold-blooded heir michael destroying it. if the plot threads had made more sense, this could have been a great film.;12 July 2004;7;['great', 'great', 'great', 'majestic', 'original', 'obvious', 'nationwide', 'cold', 'blooded', 'brilliant', 'early', 'corleone', 'brilliant', 'honest', 'current', 'late', 'interesting', 'anti', 'climactic', 'unwelcome', 'real', 'more', 'different', 'aware', 'more', 'great', 'real', 'murky', 'more', 'sure', 'bad', 'unclear', 'several', 'major', 'inclined', 'emotional', 'similar', 'final', 'first', 'constant', 'first', 'direct', 'certain', 'cold', 'blooded', 'more', 'great'];0.2643367346938776

'the godfather"", the future head of the corleone crime family. he is in sicily at his father's funeral, who had been murdered by the local mafia. at the funeral vito's older brother is also killed, and the mafia chief is determined to murder vito too. his mother begs for his freedom, but the mafia chief knows that if he lets him go, vito will one day come back for revenge. vito's mother bravely picks up a knife and holds it to the chief's throat, allowing him to escape, but she is quickly gunned down. vito then immigrates to new york and arrives at ellis island. the movie then flashes forward through time and the darker story of his son, michael corleone, begins. the movie then starts to alternate between the stories of vito corleone as he rises in the new york mafia in the 1920's, and michael corleone as he struggles to maintain his father's empire in the late 50's. so it acts as both a prequel and a sequel. i thought that this was the most interesting part of the film, because you see how vito started with nothing and built an empire, while michael starts with this empire and has to keep it all from crumbling. another thing that you see throughout the film is the extreme transformation of the character of michael. in just a few years, he had become more brutal and ruthless than vito ever was. you see just how corrupted michael had become when he does something at the end that is horrifying and unforgivable. that's the point when his job and corruption from power had driven him to do something that destroys his family and himself. another strong part of the film is its performances. the movie dominated the academy awards nominations for best supporting actor/actress, with robert de niro (vito corleone), michael v. gazzo (frank pentangeli), talia shire (connie corleone), and lee strasberg (hyman roth) all nominated for that category, and al pacino (michael corleone) nominated for best actor in a leading role. robert de niro was the one awarded the oscar, one of the many awards that the film has been given. robert de niro was also awarded an oscar for his performance as the character). al pacino also did a great job of portraying the change of his character from the first film and throughout this one. he went from a young wwii veteran trying to break away from his family's ""business"" to being the country's most powerful mob bosses. all of these things are what make the movie a masterpiece. it won many awards, including best picture at the 1974 academy awards. the characters are great, which is helped by the award-winning performances of the actors. the two alternating stories are what made the movie so much more interesting than the first. it's currently number 32 on the american film institute's 100 years100 movies list, and number 3 on imdb's top 250 movies list. i agree with the reviews, and i think that it is one of the greatest films ever made.";27 February 2012;10;['dark', 'tragic', 'sicilian', 'amazing', 'superior', 'first', 'good', 'old', 'future', 'corleone', 'local', 'old', 'determined', 'dark', 'late', 'prequel', 'interesting', 'extreme', 'few', 'brutal', 'ruthless', 'corrupted', 'unforgivable', 'strong', 'good', 'frank', 'good', 'many', 'great', 'first', 'young', 'powerful', 'many', 'good', 'great', 'interesting', 'first', 'top', 'great'];0.2260416666666666

1080;MarcoMario;"the only remarkable thing about francis ford coppola's ""the godfather, part ii"" is the insistent manner in which it recalls how much better his original film was. among other things, one remembers ""the godfather's"" tremendous narrative drive and the dominating presence of marlon brando in the title role, which, though not large, unified the film and transformed a super-gangster movie into a unique family chronicle. ""part ii,"" also written by mr. coppola and mario puzo, is not a sequel in any engaging way. it's not really much of anything that can be easily defined. it's a second movie made largely out of the bits and pieces of mr. puzo's novel that didn't fit into the first. it's a frankenstein's monster stitched together from leftover parts. it talks. it moves in fits and starts but it has no mind of its own. occasionally it repeats a point made in ""the godfather"" (organized crime is just another kind of american business, say) but its insights are fairly lame at this point. ""the godfather, part ii,"" which opened yesterday at five theaters, is not very far along before one realizes that it hasn't anything more to say. everything of any interest was thoroughly covered in the original film, but like many people who have nothing to say, ""part ii"" won't shut up. not the least of its problems is its fractured form. ""part ii"" moves continually back and forth in time between two distinct narratives. it's the story of the young vito corleone (who grew up to be played by marlon brando in the first movie) seen first around the turn of the century in sicily and then in 1917 in new york, where he's played by robert de niro, and it's the story of vito's son, michael, played again by al pacino, the new mafia don who sets out to control las vegas in the late nineteen-fifties. one story doesn't necessarily illuminate the other, it's just additional data, like footnotes. i can't readily imagine what mr. coppola and mr. puzo were trying to do, except to turn their first film into a long parenthesis that would fit between the halves of the new movie. even if ""part ii"" were a lot more cohesive, revealing and exciting than it is, it probably would have run the risk of appearing to be the self- parody it now seems. looking very expensive but spiritually desperate, ""part ii"" has the air of a very long, very elaborate revue sketch. nothing is sacred. the photography by gordon willis, so effective originally, is now comically fancythe exteriors are too bright and glow while the interiors are so dark you wonder if these mafia chiefs can't afford to buy bigger light bulbs. nino rota's old score keeps thumping away like a heavenly juke box. the performers, especially those repeating their original roles, seem locked into waxy rigid attitudes. mr. pacino, so fine the first time out, goes through the film looking glum, sighing wearily as he orders the execution of an old associate or a brother, winding up very lonely and powerful, which is just about the way he wound up before. mr. de niro, one of our best young actors, is interesting as the young vito until, toward the end of his section of the film, he starts giving a nightclub imitation of mr. brando's elderly vito. there are a couple of notable exceptions. lee strasberg, the head of the actors studio, makes an extraordinarily effective screen debut as hyman roth, the powerful jewish mobster (reportedly modeled on meyer lansky) with whom michael attempts to take over the havana rackets under the battista regime. mr. strasberg's roth is a fascinating mixture of lust, ruthlessness and chicken soup. michael v. gazzo, the playwright (""a hatful of rain""), is also superb as a corleone captain who crosses the family. another more or less non pro, g. d. spradlin (a former politician, according to publicity sources) is absolutely right as a crooked, very waspish united states senator from nevada. the plot defies any rational synopsis, but it allows mr. coppola, in his role as director, to rework lots of scenes that were done far better the first time: family reunions, shoot-outs, ambushes and occasional dumb exchanges between don michael corleone and his square, long-suffering wife, kay (diane keaton).

1085;bailey33;"the godfather part ii is one of the top 5 greatest films ever created winning 26 awards and 16 other nominations. this timeless film is one of the best sequels, which equals, if not, surpasses the original film. part two continues the story of the mafia family, the corleone's. michael corleone played by al pacino has come into his own as the new godfather with the passing of his father vito corleone at the end of part one. marlon brando played vito corleone, in his older years, portrayed in part one. in this film robert de niro plays the younger version, shown through flashbacks, of vito. the beauty of this film is in the flashbacks. the flashbacks give the audience the full back-story of how young vito became the godfather and how the corleone family became one of the most influential and feared mafia families in america. unlike, the film goodfellas, also starring de niro, a great film in it's own right, this film shows how michael uses calculated decisions in ""business"" to handle conflict. in goodfellas the main characters tend to ""fly from the hip"" and the theme is based more on the friendship of the main characters and how corruption tears their friendship apart. part ii of the godfather's theme is about a young man that never wanted to be apart of the family ""business"" but out of necessity he was thrust into being the godfather. michael struggles in this film, because i think he's ultimate goal is to make the family legitimate. the character michael is very intelligent and sinister; he will do anything to keep his family safe. this makes michael very relatable to the audience, as most men have that same desire to provide and protect their family. pacino's portrayal of michael is nothing less than brilliant. throughout the film you have flashbacks of young vito that correspond with the same conflicts facing michael in current time that provide a highly specialized mood. coppola's genius becomes apparent, as the audience is privy to this cycle of corruption and danger that this lifestyle brings. what makes this so compelling is how the same conflicts arise, but are handled differently due to the changes in society. the way coppola cuts the scenes in to the flashbacks are flawless and makes the story flow in a very unique way. the film uses an objective camera placement throughout much of the film. the use of this technique, in my opinion, was used to make the audience feel as if they were watching the plot unfold as a spectator, because the audience isn't a member of the corleone family. the respect and secrecy of the family business requires michael to keep things within the family. the scene when michael tells his older brother fredo, to never speak outside the family again reinforces this key element to the plot. the cinematographer used an array of angles, but the most significant angles come from the mid-to extreme close-up shots of michal and vito. the audience can see and almost feel the emotion in the faces of these two characters. in fact, most of the flashback scenes end and begin with a mid-to extreme close-up of these two characters. wardrobe and music in this film must be mentioned as well, as both won oscars in their respective categories. the costume design used in this film was excellent and portrayed a very realistic sense of the time period being told. each character had a specific wardrobe that fit the year, scene, and the overall plot seamlessly. the music in the film is extraordinary as well, providing chilling and exciting effect in key moments throughout the film. the score of this film rates very high amongst other films. the theme of family, the need to provide and keep them safe, and the desire to elevate your status is relatable to a vast audience; this is why this film is timeless.";15 September 2014;10;['top', 'great', 'other', 'timeless', 'good', 'original', 'own', 'new', 'old', 'young', 'full', 'back', 'young', 'corleone', 'influential', 'great', 'own', 'main', 'main', 'young', 'ultimate', 'legitimate', 'intelligent', 'sinister', 'safe', 'relatable', 'most', 'same', 'less', 'brilliant', 'young', 'same', 'current', 'specialized', 'apparent', 'privy', 'compelling', 'same', 'flawless', 'unique', 'objective', 'much', 'corleone', 'old', 'key', 'significant', 'extreme', 'close', 'michal', 'most', 'extreme', 'respective', 'excellent', 'realistic', 'specific', 'overall', 'extraordinary', 'chilling', 'exciting', 'key', 'other', 'safe', 'relatable', 'vast'];0.2250571755288736

1107;josephtotah;"taking a best-selling novel of more drive than genius (mario puzo's the godfather), about a subject of something less than common experience (the mafia), involving an isolated portion of one very particular ethnic group (first-generation and second-generation italian-americans), francis ford coppola has made one of the most brutal and moving chronicles of american life ever designed within the limits of popular entertainment. the godfather, which opened at five theaters here yesterday, is a superb hollywood movie that was photographed mostly in new york (with locations in las vegas, sicily, and hollywood). it's the gangster melodrama come of age, truly sorrowful and truly exciting, without the false piety of the films that flourished forty years ago, scaring the delighted hell out of us while cautioning that crime doesn't (or, at least, shouldn't) pay. it still doesn't, but the punishments suffered by the members of the corleone family aren't limited to sudden ambushes on street corners or to the more elaborately choreographed assassinations on thruways. they also include lifelong sentences of ostracism in terrible, bourgeois confinement, of money and power, but of not much more glory than can be obtained by the ability to purchase expensive bedroom suites, the kind that include everything from the rug on the floor to the pictures on the wall with, perhaps, a horrible satin bedspread thrown in. yet the godfather is not quite that simple. it was mr. puzo's point, which has been made somehow more ambiguous and more interesting in the film, that the experience of the corleone family, as particular as it is, may be the mid-twentieth-century equivalent of the oil and lumber and railroad barons of nineteenth-century america. in the course of the ten years of intra-mafia gang wars (1945-1955) dramatized by the film, the corleones are, in fact, inching toward social and financial respectability. for the corleones, the land of opportunity is america the ugly, in which almost everyone who is not sicilian or, more narrowly, not a corleone, is a potential enemy. mr. coppola captures this feeling of remoteness through the physical look of place and period, and through the narrative's point of view. the godfather seems to take place entirely inside a huge, smoky, plastic dome, through which the corleones see our real world only dimly. thus, at the crucial meeting of mafia families, when the decision is made to take over the hard drug market, one old don argues in favor, saying he would keep the trade confined to blacks ""they are animals anyway."" this is all the more terrifying because, within their isolation, there is such a sense of love and honor, no matter how bizarre. the film is affecting for many reasons, including the return of marlon brando, who has been away only in spirit, as don vito corleone, the magnificent, shrewd old corleone patriarch. it's not a large role, but he is the key to the film, and to the contributions of all of the other performers, so many actors that it is impossible to give everyone his due. some, however, must be cited, especially al pacino, as the college-educated son who takes over the family business and becomes, in the process, an actor worthy to have brando as his father; as well as james caan, richard castellano, robert duvall, al lettieri, abe vigoda, gianni russo, al martino, and morgana king. mr. coppola has not denied the characters' italian heritage (as can be gathered by a quick reading of the cast), and by emphasizing it, he has made a movie that transcends its immediate milieu and genre. the godfather plays havoc with the emotions as the sweet things of lifemarriages, baptisms, family feastsbecome an inextricable part of the background for explicitly depicted murders by shotgun, garrote, machine gun, and booby-trapped automobile. the film is about an empire run from a dark, suburban tudor palace where people, in siege, eat out of cardboard containers while babies cry and get underfoot. it is also more than a little disturbing to realize that characters, who are so moving one minute, are likely, in the next scene, to be blowing out the brains of a competitor over a white tablecloth. it's nothing personal, just their way of doing business as usual. the godfather (movie) directed by francis ford coppola;

(when i was in sicily, a guide told me the word ""mafia"" was derived from the phrase ""non tocca ma figlia"", ""don't touch my daughter"" an interesting explanation that i have yet to see confirmed.) robert duvall is brilliant as put-upon consigliere tom, and diane keaton is memorable as michael's outsider wife kay, the sole unhappy voice of sanity and modernity";11 May 2016;9;['creased', 'implacable', 'young', 'capable', 'boyish', 'stunning', 'narrative', 'mysterious', 'wannabe', 'top', 'political', 'commonplace', 'shakespearean', 'young', 'susceptible', 'new', 'quasi', 'father', 'quiet', 'young', 'instinctive', 'strategic', 'operatic', 'local', 'non', 'interesting', 'brilliant', 'consigliere', 'memorable', 'sole', 'unhappy'];0.1835227272727272
1110;samnotsob-43670;i think godfather 2 was one of the greatest sequels hollywood ever made and i thought they could never top the original. there are no spoilers here because i'm not going to mention anything about what went on in the sequel, just that it was great, and the actor that played young vito was super, direction was like no other film i've ever seen, a lot of gangster movies were made but this was no ordinary gangster movie, absolutely the best mob movie ever made. in this film, there was no need for any suspension of disbelieve because it was so real, i really believe that's the way it actually happened.;4 March 2017;10;['great', 'original', 'great', 'young', 'super', 'other', 'ordinary', 'good', 'real'];0.3259259259259259
1111;maverick1987;as compelling sequel as you will ever see. al pacino and robert de niro delivers the best performances of their life. all the things are just miraculous including direction. coppola's best. but i was surprised to see that al pacino did not get the oscar for this. most unexpected piece came from robert duvall. the background score was perfect as were the performances by lee starsberg(hyman roth), michael gazzo(frank pentangli) who justified there best supporting actor nominations. the best sequence of the film was the court sequence. al pacino's cold stare as michael is the most significant part of the film which shows the domination of the don.;20 August 2005;10;['compelling', 'good', 'miraculous', 'good', 'surprised', 'unexpected', 'perfect', 'good', 'cold', 'significant'];0.375

1113;joeubrown;francis ford coppola's godfather ii starring al pacino is a movie that i would argue is a perfect movie. i do not think it has any mistakes. and, if one claimed they are going to try to find a mistake, i would doubt that you would. the movie makes you feel like what it would be like to be in the mafia, and it fully grasps how horrible that would be. the movie is very realistic, and what i mean by that is that it is not a movie where one knows that the protagonist is going to win before the movie begins. the movie takes you on a journey of culture, and makes one very glad that they are not living in this type of world of betrayal and deception.;19 September 2016;10;['perfect', 'horrible', 'realistic', 'glad'];0.1666666666666666

1118;im2cool4;the godfather part 2 is one of the best movies of all time. in gf1 we are introduced to most of the characters in this second film and gf2 builds on that massively. at this point we as the viewer see michael corleone almost as a villain now. al pacino really deserved a oscar for this film he was just brilliant and in my opinion this his best acting on film(big statement because he has many other great films) for example when kay adams tells michael that she got an abortion he flips out. also in another scene where he is picking up the kids from kay he gives this look to kay which such a vicious look without saying a word.these are just some of the examples of pacino's great acting in this. another aspect that i love about this movie is john cazales role as fredo corleone. we got a view of fredo in the first movie and it left us wanting more and we did get more in this second movie cazale plays his role to a t and he makes you feel sorry for his character during the latter of the film. i can go on and on about this movie and its fascinating characters. a;14 June 2013;9;['good', 'most', 'second', 'brilliant', 'good', 'many', 'other', 'great', 'vicious', 'great', 'first', 'more', 'more', 'second', 'sorry', 'fascinating'];0.3265625

1127;irkybirky;been years since i last seen these films and it was time to view them once again. this part 2 i found to be a very long, drawn out affair. reading the other numerous reviews on this site, one would think this is the movie of all movies. well, perhaps that may be the case for some. but for the average movie goer to which this movie was made for, it was totally lacking compared to the first, original godfather. there was not much for character development which made you feel distant to the characters. too many scenes of unnecessary standing around with poor dialog that really needed a brando type boost. i could not find that presence here at all. it was indeed a watchable movie with great cinematography and that classic look. overall this movie seemed to abandon the gangster/mob genre and become more daisy drama. i think in the first half of the movie there was one gun scene and a mild at that. it truly dragged along carrying only the die hard fans of this saga and leaving behind a trail of dissatisfaction for those whom watched the original movie and expected epic type, early mob style composition.;6 February 2018;6;['long', 'other', 'numerous', 'average', 'lacking', 'first', 'original', 'much', 'distant', 'many', 'unnecessary', 'poor', 'watchable', 'great', 'classic', 'more', 'first', 'die', 'hard', 'original', 'epic', 'early'];0.1055555555555555
