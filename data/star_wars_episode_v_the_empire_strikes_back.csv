0;TheLittleSongbird;the original trilogy of star wars contain three films, all of which are sophisticated, imaginative and enormous fun. i feared it wouldn't be my thing, but it was exactly that. i loved the original trilogy for all those reasons. empire strikes back maintains all the fun of its predecessor, while even darker and more mature. visually it's a marvel to look at, with the stunning special effects and highly imaginative-looking sets. john williams's score is just outstanding, epic and monumental in every way. the story is darker than that of new hope and perhaps more sophisticated, and i loved the fact the filmmakers made the romance between leia and han more developed. the battle sequences are mesmerising, the beginning is bound to have you on the edge of your seat, but the battle between luke and darth vader was simply out of this world. the script is still as affectionate as ever, the pace is fast and the acting is great. mark hamill is ever as likable as luke, and carrie fisher still has her spunk and vivacity. harrison ford is noticeably more subdued, but he is still terrific, and frank oz is a perfect yoda. chewabacca is hilarious, and darth vader is a fantastic villain, especially when voiced so magnificently by james earl jones. all in all, a perfect successor to an already brilliant first film. 10/10 bethany cox;29 November 2009;10;['original', 'sophisticated', 'imaginative', 'enormous', 'original', 'dark', 'mature', 'stunning', 'special', 'imaginative', 'outstanding', 'epic', 'monumental', 'dark', 'new', 'sophisticated', 'affectionate', 'fast', 'great', 'likable', 'luke', 'terrific', 'frank', 'perfect', 'hilarious', 'fantastic', 'perfect', 'brilliant', 'first'];0.3957402597402598

5;classicsoncall;"the summary line is one of my favorite movie quotes of all time because it embodies a philosophy and a discipline. whenever i hear someone say 'i'll try', i already know it's a cop out with no intention of getting involved with the task in question. had george lucas 'tried' to make the movie, it would never have gotten done. i guess that's why yoda is my favorite star wars character. yeah ok, he's a puppet, but the character of yoda is like the spock of the sw universe, a stabilizing force (force?) who helps luke remain grounded and in control of his emotions. i recall some disappointment the first time i saw this film during it's original theatrical release relative to the han solo cliffhanger, somehow i felt it took away from the structure i was looking for in the chapter following the original ""star wars"". viewing it today i don't feel the same way. it dealt a momentary reprieve to the han/leia romance and allowed for analysis of the darth/luke relationship. vader's attempt to shield his son from the emperor by promising a turn to the dark side was ingeniously turned on it's head with vader suggesting young skywalker use his power to defeat the emperor. the scene was cleverly done and luke's response hinted at things to come in ""return of the jedi"". my most recent viewing of this episode was only the third time since the original theatrical release, and i find that it hasn't lost any of it's impact, maintaining a vitality and excitement that time hasn't diminished. watching the remastered dvd version, particularly with the sub titles, offers an entirely new perspective when you can pause and rewind to understand better what certain characters said. perhaps that's why i found it a lot easier to keep track of the fine points of the story, place names like hoth, yavin and bespin, and secondary characters like governor tarkin. all those subtle points add a more defined structure to the story, and helps one appreciate much more the intricacy of the universe created by george lucas.";8 June 2007;10;['favorite', 'favorite', 'first', 'original', 'theatrical', 'relative', 'original', 'same', 'momentary', 'dark', 'young', 'recent', 'third', 'original', 'theatrical', 'remastered', 'new', 'well', 'certain', 'easy', 'fine', 'secondary', 'subtle', 'more'];0.1615388579674294

8;jboothmillard;"one of the best film sequels ever made (along with the godfather, part ii and terminator 2), this is the second part to great original trilogy, and saga, from writer/creator george lucas and director irvin kershner. ""a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away"" on the ice world of hoth, luke skywalker (mark hamill) is investigating possible empire activity, only to be attacked by a snow monster. he manages to escape with the help of the force and his light sabre, but he is still stuck in the blizzard, and before going unconscious and being rescued by han solo (harrison ford), he sees a vision of ben (obi-wan) kenobi (sir alec guinness) telling him to go to the degobah system and find jedi master yoda. so after a quick battle between the rebels and the empire, luke, with r2-d2 (kenny baker) heads to this planet, and eventually he finds yoda (a muppet style creature voiced and performed by muppet member frank oz, aka miss piggy and fozzie bear), and they start training. meanwhile, han, princess leia (carrie fisher), chewbacca (peter mayhew) and c-3po (anthony daniels) are in the millennium falcon, pursued by the empire (because of a tracking device), and hide for a while in what they thought was the inside of a near meteor, but it was in fact the belly of a giant worm alien. when they do get out, they head for their destination to fix the ship, the planet bespin, where they are greeted by han's old shifty gambler friend (and original millennium falcon owner), lando calrissian (billy dee williams). but what they didn't know is that darth vader (acted by david prowse, voiced by james earl jones) and the stormtroopers arrived before them, and they are the bait of vader's trap to get luke, who he has become obsessed with finding. as a prize for finding them, han solo is frozen in carbonate and (when confirmed he is alive) is give to bounty hunter boba fett (jeremy bulloch) to be delivered to crime lord jabba the hutt (who you saw in the first film). eventually, luke does land on the planet, and he and darth have a long and exciting light sabre fight, while leih's gang escape in the millennium falcon. the pinnacle twist and great quote of the film is, after cutting luke's hand off, darth vader revealing the truth about his father's death, he says ""i am your father!"" after this he is eventually rescued, has his hand replaced, and lando and chewbacca fly away in the millennium falcon, a more more obvious 'to be continued' moment. also starring julian glover as general veers. it won the oscar for best sound, and it was nominated for best art direction-set decoration, best music for john williams and a special achievement award (for visual effects), it won the bafta for best original film music for john williams, and it was nominated for best production design/art direction and best sound, and it was nominated the golden globe for best original score. star wars was number 24 on the 100 greatest pop culture icons, the film was number 67 on the ultimate film, and along with the episode iv: a new hope, both were number 1 on the 100 greatest films. outstanding!";4 March 2005;10;['good', 'second', 'great', 'original', 'long', 'possible', 'light', 'unconscious', 'degobah', 'quick', 'near', 'giant', 'old', 'shifty', 'original', 'obsessed', 'alive', 'first', 'long', 'exciting', 'light', 'great', 'obvious', 'general', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'special', 'visual', 'good', 'original', 'good', 'good', 'golden', 'good', 'original', 'great', 'ultimate', 'new', 'great', 'outstanding'];0.3428115743905218

19;Hey_Sweden;"story author and executive producer george lucas truly managed to outdo himself when it came to making a sequel to his landmark 1977 ""star wars"" film. it combines an appreciably high level of character development with some genuinely exciting and riveting scenes, and introduced the well loved character of diminutive jedi master yoda into the formula. villainous darth vader is brought to the forefront rather than being a lackey to somebody else. the relationship between cocky spaceship pilot han solo and serious minded rebel leader princess leia evolves to where romance can finally take place. and luke skywalker becomes more than just the naive and idealistic farm boy, letting his emotions get the better of him. with the directing chores being handed over to irvin kershner (""a fine madness"", ""up the sandbox"", ""eyes of laura mars""), ""the empire strikes back"" marks a maturation in terms of story quality, as well as a willingness to go to some dark places. after all, as it begins, it sees its hero in serious jeopardy. it's never treated as a given that good will prevail. the screenplay is credited to leigh brackett (""the big sleep"", ""rio bravo"", ""el dorado"") and lawrence kasdan (""raiders of the lost ark"", ""body heat"", ""the big chill""), and stars harrison ford, mark hamill, and carrie fisher make the most of the material. the endearing yoda is one of those examples of a puppet who truly does become a character rather than just a gimmick. the film is a little short on cool aliens, but it does feature a yeti-like monster called a wampa, and an enormous slug used in a funny ""worm in the apple"" sort of gag. the spectacle is fantastic, but it never overwhelms the story. the early battle scene on the ice fields of the planet hoth is incredibly well executed, and the final lightsaber duel between luke skywalker and darth vader (who of course has a revelation in store for the youngster) offers one thrill after another. the special effects are as impressive as ever, and it would be difficult to hear that memorable john williams score and not get into the spirit of the thing. you truly care about the characters and want to see what will happen with them. and it delivers an ending that perfectly captures a sense of uncertainty and a degree of despair, setting up the problems to be solved in the next film. this is definitely a milestone blockbuster that holds up well 33 years later. 10 out of 10.";1 July 2013;10;['executive', 'high', 'exciting', 'riveting', 'villainous', 'serious', 'minded', 'rebel', 'more', 'naive', 'idealistic', 'well', 'fine', 'dark', 'serious', 'big', 'big', 'most', 'little', 'short', 'cool', 'like', 'enormous', 'funny', 'fantastic', 'early', 'final', 'special', 'impressive', 'difficult', 'memorable', 'next'];0.1411857142857143

23;Boba_Fett1138;"widely this movie is known as perhaps the best sequel ever made. however calling this movie the best sequel ever made alone is not enough. it's so much more than just a sequel and it's overall one of the best movies ever made. everything you could wish for is in this movie. adventure, humor, romance, action, great characters. it's all told in a fast pace but never at the expense of the character development or story. ""star wars: episode v - the empire strikes back"" is known and regarded as the darkest movie out of the two star wars trilogies. it's dark not in terms of visual style, after all cloud city is one of the brightest cities you've ever seen in a movie, but more dark in terms of the story, characters and emotions. basically in this story it's the evil empire that prevails over the rebels. evil sides in movies are often the more interesting ones and this movie is perhaps the very best example of that. the ultimate movie villain darth vader is more evil than ever in this movie and doesn't even spare his own commanders. but it's not only the dark side that makes this movie different from any other star wars movie. also the storytelling is different. for instance there is no big battle at the ending and the ending is actually an open one. instead the biggest and most exciting battle is already in the beginning of the movie; the imperial ground attack on the rebel base, with giant walking tanks, at-at's. it still is one of the best and most memorable battle sequences out of movie history. also not in the least because it's not set in cold dark space but on the white snow planet hoth. it makes the battle unique and therefor all the more memorable. but don't worry the movie is not all dark and depressing, there also is room for entertainment. luckily all the things that made ""star wars: episode iv - a new hope"" such a great classic and entertaining movie are still present here. the movie brings back all of the main characters and chooses the develop them even further. especially the han/leia romance gets developed in a great non-formulaic way. luke's character gets more vulnerable (especially of course after the famous classic darth vader revaluation sequence). he's not a real hero but more a character that struggles with his own future and past. the c-3po and r2-d2 characters are yet again present as the comical relief of the movie. it works in a great non-distracting way, unlike perhaps was often the case in the new star wars trilogy. but the movie also leaves room to introduce some new big characters. yoda is the best example of this. it was a big gamble to let a puppet play a significant role in the movie. but the character works very well and is not a laughable one. this is also really thanks to his performer and voice frank oz, who makes it a real character, that over the years has grown out to be one of the best known and likable characters and also thanks to mark hamill who's acting with yoda also makes the character more believable and a life one, instead of simply a puppet. also lando calrissian who is energetically played by billy dee williams, is a new character in this movie and a welcome addition to the cast. but also of course lots of villains are introduced such as some cool imperial officers and also emperor palpatine makes his first small appearance in this movie. but the most welcome new addition is boba fett, who is one of the coolest characters out of movie history, even though he has hardly any lines or action to do in this movie. his presence alone is good and cool enough on its own, to make a lasting impression. but it are not only the characters that make the movie entertaining. the movie also features lots of fast paced spectacular action and some well written and placed comical dialog, that are all perfectly performed by the wonderful cast, who all share some great chemistry together. the movie is good looking with some highly convincing special effects, even by todays standards. it provides the movie with some spectacular and impressive memorable sequences. the cinematography by peter suschitzky sets up the perfect mood for this movie and suschitzky is perhaps one of the most underrated cinematographers in the business at the moment, with already movies like ""the man in the iron mask"", ""mars attacks!"", ""the vanishing"" and the david cronenberg movies ""existenz"", ""spider"" and ""a history of violence"" behind his name. also all of the characters and sets are highly convincing looking, something that was still lacking a bit at times in ""star wars: episode iv - a new hope"". the musical score by john williams is a true classic and perhaps the best or at least most memorable out of all the star wars soundtracks, mainly of course due to the imperial march that can first be heard in this movie. it all combined is the reason why this movie is such a classic perfect masterpiece, that is as good as flawless, which helps to make this movie one of the best ever made. not just the best star wars movie but also one of the best movies of all time. 10/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/";27 October 2006;10;['good', 'good', 'alone', 'enough', 'more', 'overall', 'good', 'great', 'fast', 'dark', 'dark', 'visual', 'bright', 'dark', 'evil', 'evil', 'interesting', 'good', 'ultimate', 'evil', 'own', 'dark', 'different', 'other', 'different', 'big', 'open', 'big', 'exciting', 'imperial', 'rebel', 'giant', 'good', 'memorable', 'least', 'cold', 'dark', 'unique', 'memorable', 'dark', 'depressing', 'new', 'great', 'classic', 'entertaining', 'present', 'main', 'great', 'non', 'formulaic', 'vulnerable', 'famous', 'classic', 'real', 'more', 'own', 'present', 'comical', 'great', 'non', 'new', 'new', 'big', 'good', 'big', 'significant', 'laughable', 'real', 'likable', 'believable', 'new', 'welcome', 'such', 'cool', 'imperial', 'first', 'small', 'welcome', 'new', 'cool', 'good', 'cool', 'own', 'lasting', 'entertaining', 'spectacular', 'comical', 'wonderful', 'great', 'good', 'convincing', 'special', 'spectacular', 'impressive', 'memorable', 'perfect', 'underrated', 'convincing', 'new', 'musical', 'true', 'good', 'least', 'memorable', 'imperial', 'classic', 'perfect', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'good'];0.2828414984355578

34;Mr-Fusion;"you've gotta admire george lucas' moxie. it was bold enough that he sought out to self-finance ""the empire strikes back"", but the movie has to be a downer on top of it. make matters worse, he ends on one humdinger of a cliffhanger that people had to wait 3 years for resolution. that's sheer balls. but what a terrific movie it is. for one, it surpasses the original, which is rare in the sequel department. but it also takes its time to let the story unfold, characters get fleshed out, and the whole thing's a stirring mix of humor, drama and action. yoda's scenes are some of my favorite of the trilogy. frank oz was able to lend that puppet such a personality that it simply becomes a wizened old jedi master and not a special effect. and darth vader's presence in this movie makes him one of the all0time great movie villains. he's unhinged, choking out underlings left and right, and pursuing luke with reckless abandon. badass seems kind of trite, but it fits here. ""the empires strikes back"" is a movie that just fires on every last cylinder. great dialogue, suspense, set pieces and production values. for my money, it's john williams' finest score, and the movie continues to be one of my absolute favorites (not to mention the best of the trilogy). 10/10";1 December 2013;10;['bold', 'bad', 'sheer', 'terrific', 'original', 'rare', 'sequel', 'whole', 'able', 'wizened', 'old', 'special', 'great', 'right', 'reckless', 'trite', 'last', 'great', 'fine', 'absolute', 'good'];0.2745798319327731
35;JamesHitchcock;"""the empire strikes back"" clearly has the feel of the middle episode of a trilogy. the beginning carries on from the original ""star wars"" film; although the death star has been destroyed, the empire remains strong and the evil darth vader continues to hunt down the rebels on their base on the icy planet of hoth. there is no really definite ending; the film might just as well have ended with the words, familiar from old saturday morning serials, ""to be continued""- which of course it was in ""return of the jedi"". in between, the mix is much the same as it was in the first ""star wars""- a science-fiction adventure incorporating elements of other film genres, notably the war film but also the western, the oriental martial arts film, sword-and-sorcery type fantasy and the robin hood type of mediaeval adventure, all topped off with a helping of mystical religion. all the major characters from the original film make a return in this one; obi-wan kenobi was killed off in a duel with darth vader, but returns here as a ghost. the main developments in the story are a growing romance between han solo and leia and a startling revelation about luke's origins. (i won't say what that is). in addition to luke, leia, han and the rest there are two new characters, lando calrissian, an old but not necessarily reliable friend of han solo, and yoda. yoda is a senior member of the jedi knights, the mysterious brotherhood to which obi-wan also belonged, and the jedi master to whom luke is sent to undertake training with a view to initiation into the order. the scenes between luke and yoda strengthen the semi-religious tone already apparent in the first film; the philosophy of the jedi, as expounded by yoda, seems to have much in common with far eastern religions such as zen buddhism. given the seriousness with which these scenes were obviously intended to be treated, it struck me as unfortunate that yoda was not a human being but rather a strange alien creature looking like a wizened garden gnome with outsize ears. it was difficult to take seriously anything said by such a bizarre-looking character, especially as yoda, despite his supposed immense wisdom, seemed incapable of mastering the rules of english syntax, coming up with odd sentences such as ""this one a long time have i watched"". there is some good acting, particularly from harrison ford as han solo, a character who undergoes considerable development from the cynic of the first film to a man prepared to take on responsibilities and take risks for what he believes in. it is perhaps a pity that alec guinness's role here is rather limited, as he was easily the best actor in the original film. i am not one of those who regard the original ""star wars"" trilogy as great cinematic masterpieces, but there is plenty to enjoy in them if you do not take them too seriously and regard them simply as entertaining science-fiction adventures. this is as true of ""the empire strikes back"" as it is of its predecessor. 7/10";17 October 2005;7;['middle', 'original', 'strong', 'evil', 'icy', 'definite', 'familiar', 'old', 'same', 'first', 'other', 'western', 'oriental', 'martial', 'mediaeval', 'mystical', 'major', 'original', 'main', 'startling', 'new', 'old', 'reliable', 'senior', 'mysterious', 'semi', 'religious', 'apparent', 'first', 'much', 'common', 'far', 'eastern', 'such', 'zen', 'unfortunate', 'human', 'strange', 'alien', 'difficult', 'bizarre', 'immense', 'incapable', 'english', 'odd', 'such', 'long', 'good', 'considerable', 'cynic', 'first', 'limited', 'good', 'original', 'original', 'great', 'cinematic', 'plenty', 'entertaining', 'true'];0.0773076749639249
36;blanbrn;"episode v ""the empire strikes back"" released in 1980 in my opinion was a great sequel to the 1977 original. as far as quality it closely ranks to the original, and in terms of character development, and plot and as far as the storytelling goes it's probably better than the 1977 original. directed this time around by irvin kershner he does just as good a job with the sets, characters, and special effects work as lucas did making it just as good as 1977's. here the saga now has a setting on the ice planet of hoth, a place that the rebels have hid from the evil empire in pursuit, with the real goal they have is to reach the fabulous city of bespin nicknamed cloud city for it's airy view. here's when this installment becomes a real coming of age sequel in which the central character luke skywalker comes of age both in terms of skill and mind, and that's when he makes a stop in the swamp of dagobah. it is in the swamps that hold an important part of the saga and the development of the skywalker character is found here by training with the appearance of the jedi master yoda(hey, nice little green puppet!) as luke's skill of mind and fighting ability is formed making one reason that episode v is so important. later a dark secret is revealed, by darth vader in the climax at cloud city, and it was just great to see the fierce battle between luke and vader to close out this installment. overall ""the empire strikes back"" might be the best of the saga in terms of the coming of age development of the central character(luke). also the plot finally reveals the hidden truth that's a very dark secret, and the introduction of a new and unique character(yoda) holds the saga together just great. this really is just as good as the 1977 original simply because more key elements are shown and discovered, the only rule of law is i usually don't rank sequels over the original.";27 May 2007;10;['great', 'original', 'original', 'well', 'original', 'good', 'special', 'good', 'evil', 'real', 'fabulous', 'airy', 'real', 'central', 'important', 'nice', 'little', 'green', 'important', 'dark', 'great', 'fierce', 'overall', 'good', 'central', 'hidden', 'dark', 'new', 'unique', 'great', 'good', 'more', 'key', 'only', 'original'];0.2738113275613275
37;StevePulaski;"""empire had the better ending; luke gets his hand cut off, finds out vader's his father, han gets frozen, and taken away by bobba fett, it ends on such a downnote. that's what life is, a series of down endings. all jedi had was a bunch of muppets."" - dante hicks, clerks. one of my other justifications for remaining ignorant to the star wars franchise was the fact that i felt i had already seen them before. after hearing the above lines in kevin smith's clerks, i had no ambition to seek out the series because of the fact that i already knew all, or most, of the major, visceral plot points in the second installment, the empire strikes back. but even knowing these details going in, i still emerged as enthralled and as taken as ever. it's one of the most awe-inspiring, gripping sequels i've ever seen. my love for the series of star wars, so far, has likely been because i don't try to understand it all. i allow myself to sink into the films, letting the film's imagination, and my own, take me on a cinematic odyssey. the less i look into the meaning of it all and the interworkings of the characters and series, the more, i feel, i see in terms of vision, writing, atmosphere, and style. thank goodness i took this approach to the empire strikes back, which employs all these elements with slick, constant entertainment. it abandons the cheery, free-spirited style of its predecessor in favor of a much dark enigma. never before have i seen a film go from comforting entertainment to sheer calamity within one sequel. perhaps much of this is thanks to irvin kershner, who takes over for lucas in the directing department. after achieving monstrous success with the original star wars, against all conceivable odds, lucas, who was perplexed at how to follow up the hit, sidelined himself to executive producer and hired kershner to lend his vision with the screen. new writers by the names of leigh brackett and lawrence kasdan were hired to continue the harrowing tales of luke skywalker (mark hamill), princess leia (carrie fisher), and han solo (harrison ford). i couldn't imagine the hesitation amongst fans when these creative decisions were made. they must've expected the absolute worst from a sequel to an explosive hit. could it be like the extreme hesitation the star wars fanbase currently has now with j.j abrams manning the camera and michael ardnt writing the script for the forthcoming star wars: episode vii in 2015, or should i not even mention that? the wonderful thing about these new faces being the driving forces behind this film is that we get a different spin on these characters and their lives that isn't drab, redundant, or contrived. had the empire strikes back adopted the same sort of easy-going charisma of its predecessor, this could've easily been a cheap rehash of previously successful material. instead, kerschner, brackett, and kasdan wisely choose to further develop these characters, making their problems more three-dimensional, their personalities more vivid, and their biographies more interesting. again, there are some terrific and grandiose special effects put to use here. the effects on the millennium falcon and the exterior shots of a galaxy far, far away is just marvelous and very appealing on the eyes. i'm always amazed at the naturalism of these effects, even for the late seventies/early eighties. despite being largely products of computers and other visual mediums, they still possess an authentic and wonderfully realistic look to them. one particular instance is when han, leia, and the rest of the gang fly their ship into the asteroid farm, which is exactly what it sounds like. dozens of asteroids hurl themselves at the ship at breakneck speeds, leaving han (the driver) with little time to react and dodge them. the animation and visual technique of the asteroids is astonishing, and every moving object adopts gorgeous fluency and technical precision. it's a visual wonder to say the very least. the empire strikes back beautifully carries the star wars franchise further than it might've even gone under the intense and uncompromising care of lucas himself. the new faces delightfully provide us with more entertaining adventures and more eccentric characters such as yoda (voiced by frank oz) and lando calrissian (billy dee williams), consistently keeping us in-tuned and intrigued with the limitless possibilities of this creative world. like before, hamill, fisher, and ford provide the most likable of chemistry, and the scenes of intensity and peril do not fall short of enthralling, even if one is aware of the outcome. there are many directions return of the jedi can take, but if it shows the gripping intensity of its predecessor and the truly mysterious nature of its original, then the possibilities are as endless as the galaxy the series inhabits. starring: mark hamill, carrie fisher, harrison ford, james earl jones, frank oz (voice), and billy dee williams. directed by: irvin kerschner.";25 March 2013;10;['well', 'frozen', 'down', 'other', 'ignorant', 'above', 'most', 'major', 'visceral', 'second', 'own', 'cinematic', 'more', 'slick', 'constant', 'cheery', 'free', 'spirited', 'dark', 'much', 'monstrous', 'original', 'conceivable', 'executive', 'new', 'leigh', 'harrowing', 'creative', 'absolute', 'bad', 'explosive', 'extreme', 'forthcoming', 'wonderful', 'new', 'different', 'drab', 'redundant', 'same', 'cheap', 'successful', 'dimensional', 'vivid', 'interesting', 'terrific', 'grandiose', 'special', 'exterior', 'marvelous', 'appealing', 'amazed', 'late', 'early', 'other', 'visual', 'authentic', 'realistic', 'particular', 'little', 'visual', 'astonishing', 'gorgeous', 'technical', 'visual', 'least', 'intense', 'new', 'entertaining', 'eccentric', 'such', 'limitless', 'creative', 'likable', 'aware', 'many', 'mysterious', 'original', 'endless'];0.1918388958711538

39;DKosty123;long ago, in a galaxy far away came a film which saved fox studios from bankruptcy. it was conceived by a 16 year old george lucas after he saw the 1959 film ben hur. this gave him the ideas which are now lynch pins of the entire series - an all powerful force, an evil empire, emperor, a purpose for our universe. this film was considered a weak link of these three when it was first released. as the years have gone by, it has grown in popularity. it is as solid as either 4 or 6. it has great acting, a good script, excellent action sequences, & introduces yoda. granted if you watch the series in number order, yoda pops up earlier, but this is the real introduction to him here, & it fits so well. luke skywalker completes a lot of jedi training with yoda, & one thing that was explained in episode 1 better is why yoda fears training luke so much. it was explained in episode 4 too with obie ones dialog about vadar. strange how this plot line runs together yet spreads apart. this film reveals that luke is the son of darth vadar, a man which he views an evil monster. it is a relationship which is almost similar to the relationship between mesala & ben hur in that in both cases- hur & luke, their relationships to the other character are shaken at their own souls foundation. the more one looks at this film, the better it looks.;23 February 2007;8;['old', 'lynch', 'entire', 'powerful', 'evil', 'weak', 'solid', 'great', 'good', 'excellent', 'real', 'strange', 'evil', 'similar', 'other', 'own', 'more', 'well'];0.0949999999999999
40;MovieAddict2016;"(note: this review contains some spoilers.) movie novelty quickly wears thin, which is why so many sequels pale in comparison to their originals. ""star wars: episode v: the empire strikes back"" is the best of the original ""star wars"" trilogy, darker and deeper and even more powerful than the first film. granted, the original pioneered an endless saga of imitators and somewhat imaginative knock-offs, and is still one of the greatest films ever made, but ""the empire strikes back"" is a tiny inch ahead in the race. it is the dark middle chapter in an almost perfect trilogy, crammed full with imagination and special effects. it is simply one of the most visionary movies of all time, which is rare for a sequel -- any sequel -- especially in the case of a sci-fi film. just take a look at ""predator 2"" for an example of an idea running out of steam, or a director who cannot cope with his script. the film generally picks up where the last left off: luke (mark hamill) saved the day by blowing up the death star, the heroes were awarded with medals by the princess (carrie fisher), and peace was temporarily restored. but darth vader (voice of james earl jones) is still alive, and the emperor's fury grows stronger as luke begins his jedi training under the help of yoda. meanwhile, han solo (harrison ford) and leia flee to cloud city to escape an attack from the empire, where they are taken under the wing of lando calrissian (billy dee williams), an old pal of han's who is secretly working for vader, somewhat against his own will. the movie is strong in its morals and biblical metaphors, just as the original. luke is the savior, calrissian could be considered the equivalent of judas, han solo is one of luke's good disciples and vader represents pure evil. and of course, there's the truly iconic line, ""i am your father,"" that is relevant to the devil, who -- according to the scriptures -- was an angel before being cast into the bowels of hell and becoming lucifer. lucas admittedly used these various metaphors to strike a nerve in the subconscious of his viewers. like all good fables, of fantasy or reality, ""star wars"" is a trilogy that relates to just about everyone, in one form or another, and is -- at its roots -- a story we are all very familiar with. it is the ever-familiar notion of good-vs. -evil at its core that helps propel these movies into the hearts of many. yes, ""star wars"" is the quintessential nerd's film, engulfed in an entirely different dimension, but the film's bad rap for this is undeserved -- it's still a wonderful story, and you don't have to be a die-hard fan to appreciate its fine points (and it has many). one of the most popular legends (and misconceptions) regarding the ""star wars"" phenomenon is that george lucas helmed the entire star wars trilogy, when in fact he only directed the first and wrote the screenplay for all three combined. ""the empire strikes back"" is directed by irvin kirshner, who also delivered us the disappointing ""robocop 2."" how could one sequel be so great, and the other so bad? simple: kirshner's darkness in ""the empire strikes back"" had a point, and a high value. in ""robocop 2,"" it was just excessive and silly, not to mention totally unnecessary. what paul verhoeven was able to do with the original ""robocop"" was something not many films can accomplish, and kirshner tried to add on to this with a darker narrative, which only ended in a frustratingly empty motion picture. ""the empire strikes back"" has a point amidst the action, and is the most important of all three ""star wars"" movies. it has the famous introduction of the creature yoda, who sits tucked away in his hut on a swamp planet, at first startling luke with his strange features, and then with his subtle wisdom. it is yoda who trains luke in the ways of the jedi, and eventually leads him towards his destination: the showdown with vader, when the infamous secret is finally revealed. the movie is expertly crafted, both in terms of a a narrative and literal context. from beginning to end it is darker, fiercer and more powerful than the original film, which is not an easy feat. all trilogies have their dark areas, and this is usually the middle chapter (""back to the future part ii"" is a good example), yet in ""the empire strikes back"" the darkness seems very appropriate given the material. it is a film that dwells long and hard on betrayal, murder, revenge, and unrecoverable mistakes. by the end of the movie, we know what luke is feeling: there is still much to be done, despite an overwhelming emotional downpour of attachment and confusion. for us, as an audience, we know everything must come to an end within the next installment. for luke, it could be an eternity of struggle. but we all know there will be an end to the epic saga, and we have always known this, ever since we first caught a glimpse of a younger, more innocent luke working for his uncle on that deserted planet, so many years ago, when he could only dream of having adventures in other galaxies far, far away... 5/5 stars. <ul><li>john ulmer</li></ul>";3 April 2004;10;['many', 'pale', 'good', 'original', 'deep', 'powerful', 'first', 'endless', 'imaginative', 'great', 'tiny', 'dark', 'middle', 'perfect', 'full', 'special', 'visionary', 'rare', 'last', 'alive', 'strong', 'jedi', 'old', 'own', 'strong', 'biblical', 'original', 'good', 'pure', 'iconic', 'relevant', 'lucifer', 'various', 'good', 'familiar', 'familiar', 'good', 'many', 'quintessential', 'different', 'bad', 'undeserved', 'wonderful', 'die', 'hard', 'fine', 'many', 'popular', 'entire', 'first', 'disappointing', 'great', 'other', 'bad', 'simple', 'high', 'excessive', 'silly', 'unnecessary', 'able', 'original', 'many', 'dark', 'empty', 'important', 'famous', 'swamp', 'first', 'strange', 'subtle', 'infamous', 'literal', 'dark', 'powerful', 'original', 'easy', 'dark', 'middle', 'future', 'good', 'appropriate', 'unrecoverable', 'much', 'overwhelming', 'emotional', 'next', 'epic', 'young', 'innocent', 'many', 'other'];0.2023221634332745

45;ElMaruecan82;"""the empire strikes back"" does its best to visually surpass the original ""star wars"" and the special effects or the creatures' designs are as convincing as the pioneering space epic, there's also a richness of landscapes, taking you from the snowy summits of a cold planet to the tropical jungle, but beyond the escapism, it's the excitement to see again that iconic gallery of characters, han solo, leia, c3po, r2-d2, luke, chewbacca (whose mourning and moaning sounds took a whole other resonance) and a few newcomers. in ""the empire strikes back"", the key word is ""back"". now, take the most hardcore ""star wars"" fan -i think there's a name for them, and i guess i would know if i were one- and take someone who doesn't care much about the series, now, ask the pair to list four or five classic ""star wars"" moments, i bet a good half of the scenes will belong to the glorious episode v ""the empire strikes back"", directed by irvin keshner (and george lucas as the executive producer). by the way, do you know the joke, why did lucas start ""star wars"" with the 4th, 5th and 6th episodes and then made the first three? because master yoda directed them (punch line drum sound). well, that's just to show you i didn't use the word 'sequel', and this is not because i don't want to offend sensitivities, but because i don't take the film as a sequel but as the real journey into the soul of ""star wars"", the dark side, literally. it is in this film that the relationship between han solo (harrison ford) and princess leia (carrie fisher) transcends the limits of the simple crush, the interactions between them are really catching and you can tell that harrison ford challenges his character, and has fun teasing the little princess who's not insensitive to his charm. a film where actors have fun playing their characters can't turn bad, and it is a credit to the directing for having made the romance efficient with no more than three or four scenes. and they all culminate with one of the most touching declarations of love, touching because of its laconic but sincere answer you know. ""the empire strikes back"" is also the film that pursues the coming-of-age of luke skywalker and features his initiation by jedi master yoda (frank oz). obi-wan was a great character but yoda has everything, the speech mannerism, the mimics and this little quality that makes him like the perfect crossover between mr. myagi and ""e.t."" except that he came the first. yoda is the heart of the story, and when he warns luke about the dark side of the force, he knows exactly where he's heading to, and i guess ever since ""star wars"" ended, the audience knew what the next film had to deliver. which leads to the one true reason-to-be of the film, the climactic light-saber battle between darth vader and luke skywalker right after having plunged us into the evil empire lord's psyche and revealed the shakespearian truth about his identity. now, is it really a spoiler to spoil it or is it a of prescription case? in a simpson episode from the third season, which means 1992, a gag consisted on homer leaving the theater and spoiling the ending to all the lining up moviegoers. so after one decade, ""the empire strikes back"" was already part of cinema's history. i guess you can't call yourself a movie lover but if you don't know vito corleone, scarlett o'hara or the father of luke skywalker, well it kind of shades off to ignorance. indeed, ""the empire strikes back"" is like the second tome of homer's odyssey, it is an inevitable and valuable portion of cinema's history regarding perhaps the one true myth that solely belongs to the silver screen. and it is for this achievement that it's impossible not to recognize the cinematic value of ""the empire strikes back"". say what you want about the creatures, the special effects, the little gimmick or childish moments, but when the film starts and you have in order, the 'fox' logo, the 'long time go' title card-and then the first pumping sound of the triumphant fanfare, something melts inside you and you're like a child who just sat on the roller- coaster. ""the empire strikes back"" was the most anticipated movie, the follow-up to the all time most popular film and it managed to become more popular by injecting novelty within the relationships and add new characters such as yoda or lando (billy dee williams). it even managed to equal the original by having its own score: ""the imperial march"", as if it had to have its own existence independently from the first, and it's fitting that the score is about the villain as darth vader seems more majestic and frightening in this opus, actually he was nominated #3 in the afi's top 50 villains but it was the darth vader from ""empire"", the one with the imperial march. even vader raises its iconic status with his (temporary) victory over the rebels. because that's also what characterizes the film, the bad guys have the upper hand. it concludes with a frozen han solo, an amputated luke with the painful knowledge about his origins, a disintegrated c3po and so on a cliffhanger so obvious it doesn't even need the obligatory ""to be continued"", we know the fight between evil and good isn't over. i guess at that moment, ""the return of the jedi"" immediately became the most anticipated cinematic project.";4 October 2016;9;['good', 'original', 'special', 'convincing', 'pioneering', 'snowy', 'cold', 'tropical', 'iconic', 'whole', 'other', 'few', 'key', 'back', 'hardcore', 'classic', 'good', 'glorious', 'executive', 'first', 'real', 'dark', 'simple', 'little', 'insensitive', 'bad', 'efficient', 'more', 'touching', 'laconic', 'sincere', 'great', 'little', 'perfect', 'first', 'dark', 'next', 'true', 'climactic', 'light', 'evil', 'shakespearian', 'third', 'second', 'inevitable', 'valuable', 'true', 'silver', 'impossible', 'cinematic', 'special', 'little', 'childish', 'long', 'first', 'triumphant', 'popular', 'popular', 'new', 'such', 'own', 'imperial', 'own', 'first', 'fitting', 'majestic', 'frightening', 'top', 'imperial', 'iconic', 'temporary', 'bad', 'upper', 'frozen', 'amputated', 'painful', 'disintegrated', 'obvious', 'obligatory', 'good', 'cinematic'];0.1312611957008508
46;wellthatswhatithinkanyway;star rating: ***** saturday night **** friday night *** friday morning ** sunday night * monday morning after george lucas's star wars had wowed the world in 1977, the same world eagerly waited the big sequel that followed three years later, that was loved just as much, in some cases slightly more so, than the first film. it no doubt took twice as much effort to make, and drew in a huger box office crowd, and in doing so the empire strikes back established itself as the film that rivalled the film it followed on from. all the main characters from the first film are back, including luke skywalker (mark hamill), han solo (harrison ford), princess leia (carrie fisher), obi-wan kenobi (alec guiness) and lovable non humans chewbacca, r2-d2 and c-3po, along with new addition lando (a charismatic turn by billy dee williams) a rogue pal of han's who's now the head of his own establishment, as well of course as yoda, the tiny green martian with wisdom who guides luke on his way. the story's a bit too lost in names of special planets, spaceships and character names that only the most ardent sci-fi nerd is going to follow intently, but once again, the sheer spectacle and grandeur of lucas's work over-shadows everything, a remarkable vision that still hasn't dated or staled over 25 years on. so sit back, relax and prepare to witness the sheer scale of escapist entertainment. *****;1 April 2007;10;['same', 'big', 'first', 'much', 'main', 'first', 'non', 'new', 'charismatic', 'rogue', 'own', 'tiny', 'green', 'special', 'ardent', 'sheer', 'remarkable', 'sheer'];0.2007266542980828
47;Robert_duder;"after the success of star wars i think i might have expected a slip if they took it to a sequel but apparently george lucas' love for this world trumped film making curses for bad sequels. the empire strikes back brings back the incredible original heroes, gives them even more depth and story and still finds time to bring in new timeless characters that become legends in their own right. even with a new director at the helm, irvin kershner, the story and the world that made the first star wars so incredible is in tact and even better. the only problem really with the first star wars is it felt like only the beginning. like there were layers of detail that we didn't get and the empire strikes back burst into those layers and put us deep into the world and the story never to turn back. on top of that the film delivers the first and most infamous twist in film history...family connections so to speak. i won't give it away if you have existed under a rock for the last three decades. the fights are epic, the new characters are amazing, and even hamill as skywalker starts to really shine and get some real depth to his character. i already reviewed the cast of the original film but their characters really do change a lot for the better in the sequel. mark hamill's performance matures and really comes full circle just like his character in the film. his naivety and boyish charm changes for the better as he trains to become a jedi and an adult. harrison ford's han solo is probably the character that changes the least and probably just a case of ""don't mess with a good thing."" solo is still a kick butt hero and his story is a focal point of the sequel. carrie fisher slips back into her role as the feisty princess flawlessly. this time the banter and romantic tension between fisher and ford heats up and really gives the story a timeless romance. anthony daniels, kenny baker, and peter mayhew return in full form as c3p0, r2d2 and chewbacca and they are better than ever. david prowse with james earl jones providing the voice continues to make darth vader the most evil, intensely bad villain in the history of films. vader's character really turns up the heat and gives a terrifying turn as the leader of the empire. billy dee williams is a newcomer to the cast and a welcome addition. he plays gambler, scoundrel lando calrissian. he doesn't get a lot of background or depth to his character and yet he is a great addition to the cast. and saving the best for last...the master of the star wars universe. frank oz brings master yoda to life. the entire sequence with luke and yoda meeting for the first time and training is brilliant. yoda is a timeless character, a pop culture phenomenon and yet his part in this is touching, funny, and brilliant. pretty good for a puppet. the empire strikes back is just simply non stop. the film picks up where the first left off and takes the viewer on a thrill ride that just never stops. this is ultimately all about the evil empire and vader getting his revenge and essentially succeeding. starting from the opening moment of the film on the brilliantly crafted ice world of hoth, and continuing on to a show down between skywalker and vader himself and the revealing of the infamous secret this film is just brilliant. the direction, the creation, the writing, the characters and the special effects are jaw droppingly amazing. there is simply no way you can watch just one star wars movie because the story is so important but after watching the first one and thinking...wow this is pretty incredible, the empire strikes back will floor you!! one of the greatest sequels of all time. 10/10";16 February 2009;10;['bad', 'incredible', 'original', 'new', 'timeless', 'own', 'new', 'first', 'incredible', 'only', 'first', 'burst', 'first', 'infamous', 'last', 'epic', 'new', 'amazing', 'real', 'original', 'well', 'full', 'boyish', 'well', 'least', 'good', 'focal', 'feisty', 'romantic', 'timeless', 'full', 'well', 'most', 'evil', 'bad', 'terrifying', 'welcome', 'great', 'good', 'last', 'entire', 'first', 'brilliant', 'timeless', 'touching', 'funny', 'brilliant', 'good', 'non', 'first', 'evil', 'infamous', 'brilliant', 'special', 'amazing', 'important', 'first', 'incredible', 'great'];0.2479517822602929

51;lesleyharris30;star wars: episode v- the empire strikes back is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast. it's an impressive sequel that manages to surpass the expectations of its predecessor, this is the standards that every film maker should aim towards when considering a sequel, the first one is fun and introduces the characters in a light hearted manner, but this one further develops them and their universe in a much darker tone. it's definitely the bleakest film in the series, showing the main characters succeed the least, and even the ending isn't particularly joyous, let's just say the title suits the overall tone of the movie perfectly. the cast are still in great form here, in fact several of them have improved between the three year gap of the first movie, mark hamill, harrison ford and carrie fisher have certainly improved as actors and, overall, they seem much more comfortable in their roles. we are also introduced to some great new characters in this film, such as lando and boba fett, but the one who stands out the most for me is yoda, one of my favourite characters of the franchise, frank oz perfectly portrays the wise and woeful personality of this master jedi. there are so many noteworthy moments here, whether it be the wise words from yoda, the battle between vader and luke or han's farewell to leia, every scene makes me smile, it's a piece of film history that will be remembered for years to come. terrific performances, a thrilling storyline and special effects that still hold up today, fans of star wars and sci-fi in general will not be disappointed by star wars: episode v- the empire strikes back, i would recommend it to all moviegoers. luke must complete his jedi training with master yoda while the empire has returned after the destruction of the death star, with vader's only intention now being to find luke. best performance: harrison ford;19 July 2013;10;['fantastic', 'outstanding', 'impressive', 'first', 'fun', 'light', 'hearted', 'dark', 'bleakest', 'main', 'least', 'joyous', 'overall', 'great', 'several', 'first', 'comfortable', 'great', 'new', 'such', 'most', 'favourite', 'wise', 'woeful', 'many', 'noteworthy', 'wise', 'terrific', 'special', 'general', 'jedi', 'only', 'good'];0.3253912753912754

56;ironhorse_iv;directed by irvin kershner, the empire strikes back, like the original movie came out with mixed reviews with a difficult production, it's since then became considered one of the greatest film ever made. the film is set three years after the events of star wars iv: a new hope where luke skywalker (mark hamill) has studying the force under exile jedi master yoda (frank oz). mid while, darth vader (voice by james earl jones), is in pursuit of him and the rest of the rebel alliance. when his friends are capture, luke skywalker must confront the man that kill his mentor, and save his comrades. this gritty movie was once criticize for its darker tone, and cliffhanger ending, but i love it, it really put all the characters to their limits both physically and emotionally, dealing with deceptive allies and make you want to watch the next movie. that's great filmmaking. like its predecessor, the empire strikes back draw from mythologist joseph campbell's book the hero with a thousand faces, directly in it's tales that is taken right off from several mythological like arthurian, classical greco-roman and others. there are similar motifs taken from other films and television shows like 1936's flash gordon, 1975's dersu uzala, and others worth noticing in the film. the movie even took influence from historic events like nazism, the wild west, and samurai culture. it even dig into world religions. some people might seeing the teaching of yoda as boring scenes, but i love them. the movie really makes good on explaining more about what the force is. the force remind me of a new age amalgam of various eastern religious and western philosophical sources. a sense of manichaeism, mixed with elements of ralph waldo emerson's romantic nature worship, pantheism and western-influenced buddhism. luke is not as annoying as the previous movie, as the film is mostly about his growth to maturation and self-discovery, but he does have some awful whining in this movie that makes you want to slap his face. yoda in this movie works with the puppetry. the way frank oz performed and voiced him, made this character stand out. not once, did i think it was a puppet. i would say, this was way better than the cgi yoda or the puppet from episode 1, big time! industrial light and magic really pull it off, the action scenes in this film. this movie really make the hoth battle look real and intense. another big prop to them is how great, cloud city looks. as the technology has improved, lucas has continued to tinker with the films, adding more creatures and more detail to the backgrounds and even reshooting certain scenes to get them closer to his ideal vision. in my opinion, this is one of the film that didn't get ruin by the 1997's special edition with pointless added scenes or badly done 1990's cgi. glad, they didn't add the bad delete wampa scenes. the special edition in my opinion, honestly, made it better. a good example of this is cloud city. you really see more of the city than the original. it's beautiful. the 2004 version hurt the film a bit, changing boba fett's voice, but at less they add the real emperor. the music by john williams is great. i love the imperial march introduced in the empire strikes back as the theme music for vader's pursuit of han and leia. the march's rhythm is driving and relentless, capturing vader's own relentless progress through the story. for action, it's not as epic as 1977's star wars, but the story is way better than that movie. the love story in this film seem more realistic than the fairy tale love affair in episode 2. han solo (harrison ford) and princess leia (carrie fischer) are just amazing in their roles, and give the movie, it's really needed humor. you know that they kinda dislike each other, but slowly they found caring for each other. that's realistic. the love affair had a shade of grey to it. one memorable exchange of dialogue was partially ad-libbed in which the character professed their love with han solo given a badass reply. that was amazing! without spoiling it, the whole cliffhanger about han solo was at least in part due to the fact that they were not sure that harrison ford would return for a third film. i glad he did. another thing, good about the writing is that there isn't a lot of dumb things that question logic in this film, like the other films. i did find a few. i don't like the whole leia kissing luke thing. it makes no sense even if episode vi wasn't made at the time. it's still gross. another one is how ben obi won kenobi (alec guinness) hide the truth from luke, throughout the film for no good reason. why!? you would have thought that information would help luke deeply before heading to cloud city! it doesn't make any sense. once again, without spoiling it. during production, there was great secrecy surrounded the truth about darth vader & luke skywalker's relationship, to the point that most of the crew didn't know about it. i like how george lucas fought for this movie. to preserve the dramatic opening sequences of his films, lucas put the screen credits in the end. even though this is more common now, this was a highly unusual choice at the time as the writers and directors guilds felt that the credits should be shown first. they fined him and attempted to pull the movie out of theaters. due to the controversy, he left the guilds, and the motion picture association. he also left 20th century fox over controversy when the president alan ladd jr. got fired for helping fund the sequel, which cause fox to lose raiders of the lost ark's film rights. overall: george lucas change movie history with this film and the world is better because of it.;4 April 2014;9;['original', 'mixed', 'difficult', 'great', 'new', 'mid', 'rebel', 'gritty', 'dark', 'deceptive', 'next', 'great', 'several', 'mythological', 'classical', 'similar', 'other', 'worth', 'historic', 'wild', 'boring', 'good', 'more', 'new', 'various', 'eastern', 'religious', 'western', 'philosophical', 'ralph', 'romantic', 'annoying', 'previous', 'awful', 'frank', 'well', 'big', 'industrial', 'hoth', 'real', 'intense', 'big', 'great', 'more', 'more', 'certain', 'ideal', 'special', 'pointless', 'glad', 'bad', 'delete', 'special', 'well', 'good', 'cloud', 'more', 'original', 'beautiful', 'less', 'real', 'great', 'imperial', 'relentless', 'own', 'relentless', 'epic', 'well', 'realistic', 'amazing', 'other', 'other', 'realistic', 'memorable', 'badass', 'amazing', 'whole', 'least', 'sure', 'third', 'glad', 'good', 'dumb', 'other', 'few', 'whole', 'gross', 'good', 'great', 'most', 'dramatic', 'common', 'unusual', 'lost', 'well'];0.1607157482157481

60;The-Sarkologist;honestly, i just absolutely adore this film, and the further i travel in life, the more that i discover that i'm not the only one. in fact it seems to pretty much be the favourite of all of the star wars films, probably because there is so much happening, and also because of the big reveal at the end. in fact, the big reveal was kept so secret that only mark hammil, james earl jones, and the creators knew about it, which was why it was such a shock. in a way this film pretty much feels like it is the middle part of the trilogy, particularly since the end isn't really all that conclusive. in fact, it sort of feels more like a phyrric victory, though the fact that han solo has been captured, the empire hasn't really suffered a defeat, and that the film closes with luke and leah simply standing on the deck looking out at the rebel fleet is a clear indication that there is more to come. yet, i felt that this was the best ending of any of the star wars films, though it is probably the only one that could get away with it. the first one had to have a fairly conclusive ending, namely because there wasn't really much indication that there would be any more after that, and of course return of the jedi had to be conclusive because there was no indication that there was going to be any more after that either (the latest trilogy came about after disney had purchased the franchise). i guess the thing that i loved about the film is that there is so much action, from the battle on the ice planet of hoth, to the asteroid chase. in fact, the asteroid chase is probably the best of any film that i have ever seen - there isn't many space opera's that i've seen that happen to have a full blown chase through an asteroid belt. yet there are some nice touches as well, particularly the commander that keels over and dies, and the holographic connection cuts out when his ship is hit by an asteroid. oh, and the emperor is also revealed in this film - in fact i'm not entirely sure whether he was even mentioned in the first film, though i probably should have paid a bit more attention when i watched it a couple of weeks previously. honestly, there is little that i can probably say that hasn't already been said, and since this film seriously has a huge cult following, or at least the series does, then no doubt this is one of the films that pretty much everybody has seen, or at least everybody who has wanted to see this film has basically seen this film. the other interesting thing is that it didn't seem to be as altered as the previous film was, but as i have indicated previously, these films really didn't need to be altered since they were good enough as is.;19 September 2021;9;['only', 'favourite', 'big', 'big', 'secret', 'middle', 'conclusive', 'phyrric', 'rebel', 'clear', 'more', 'good', 'only', 'first', 'conclusive', 'much', 'more', 'conclusive', 'more', 'late', 'much', 'good', 'many', 'full', 'blown', 'nice', 'holographic', 'sure', 'first', 'more', 'little', 'huge', 'least', 'least', 'other', 'interesting', 'previous', 'good'];0.2061011904761905

66;tomgillespie2002;as argued by dante and randal in kevin smith's slacker classic clerks, the question of whether a new hope or the empire strikes back is the better movie is one of cinema's most popular debates. episode iv's introduction to george lucas' world of aliens, droids and intergalactic war struck a chord with audiences back in 1977, and continues to do so today. it is a fun good vs. evil story that only touches upon the spiritual elements of the 'force' that we now know so well, and on the vastness of the universe it is set within. personally, i have to agree with dante's argument that empire offers a darker and richer experience, which not only develops the series' mythology even further, but paints its characters with far more layers than seen before. we no doubt have george lucas' lack of involvement in the film's development for that, as the witty script by leigh bracket and raiders of the lost ark scribe lawrence kasdan keeps the action both exciting and with consequence, as well as maintaining a firm grasp on the characters' complicated relationships and personal roles in the expanding story. director irvin kershner, who took over after lucas bailed following a troubled pre-production, also brings the best out of the actors. empire really transformed what was an interesting idea drawing inspiration from classic sci-fi serials and the samurai films of akira kurosawa into the billion-dollar beast it is today. these films are now so deeply rooted in our culture that it's almost difficult to classify the original trilogy as mere movies, they have now become something else entirely. after succeeding in blowing up the empire's planet-destroying death star, the rebels, led by luke skywalker (mark hamill), are hiding out on ice planet hoth while the evil darth vader sends out trackers throughout the galaxy in the hope of tracking them down. smuggler han solo (harrison ford) wants to repair his ship and get back to his old ways with trusted wookiee friend chewbacca (peter mayhew), but that doesn't prevent him from flirting with leia (carrie fisher). when they are eventually spotted and the planet is attacked, the film does what most sequels do nowadays and splits everybody up. han and leia must escape through an asteroid field with the empire in pursuit to seek refuge in cloud city with old friend lando calrissian (billy dee williams), while luke seeks out dagobah to learn the ways of the force from jedi master yoda (frank oz). even though i have seen this movie countless times, the arm hairs still stand up when john williams' fantastic score kicks in during the opening crawl. from the on, empire delivers a relentless assault of riveting set-pieces and iconic moments, from the attack on hoth which still stands up to most modern blockbusters, to the gob- smacking twist at the climax now so routinely, and lovingly, spoofed. it also takes darth vader to a new level of villainy, as the helmeted sith lord relentlessly pursues the young man he feels is strong in the ways of the force, and brutally takes out any of his own underlings who make the mistake of failing him. it's certainly dark, but it's easy to forget just how exciting and engrossing it is also. ending at an incredibly low point for most of the good guys involved with only a sliver of hope on the horizon, i can't imagine how much fans were left wanting more back in 1980 as the credits rolled. it will always be superior to a new hope in my book, but you can't have one without the other, and both are damn near perfect.;30 July 2017;10;['randal', 'new', 'well', 'popular', 'intergalactic', 'fun', 'good', 'evil', 'spiritual', 'dark', 'rich', 'more', 'witty', 'leigh', 'exciting', 'firm', 'complicated', 'personal', 'troubled', 'good', 'interesting', 'classic', 'rooted', 'difficult', 'original', 'mere', 'evil', 'old', 'most', 'old', 'countless', 'fantastic', 'relentless', 'iconic', 'most', 'modern', 'new', 'villainy', 'young', 'strong', 'own', 'dark', 'easy', 'exciting', 'low', 'most', 'good', 'much', 'superior', 'new', 'other', 'perfect'];0.1788050964187327

68;zkonedog;"in terms of action and adventure, ""empire strikes back"" is a rousing success. there are enough space flights, phaser blasts, and lightsaber wielding to satisfy the visual effects junkies. the only thing missing, however, is that ""sense of something epic"" inherent in its original predecessor. in ""episode v"", as it has come to be known, the rebels are still being pursued by the empire, this time on the ice planet hot. the first half of the film focuses on those battles, primarily featuring han solo (harrison ford) and princess leia (carrie fisher). a new character in lando calrissian (billy dee williams) is also introduced, though his loyalties are very much in question. the second half deals more with luke skywalker's (mark hamill) beginning steps to becoming a jedi. after the death (in part iv) of obi-wan kenobi, luke goes to continue his training with yoda, an enigmatic little green character seemingly older than time itself. the film's climax brings forth the long-awaited meeting of luke and darth vader (voice of james earl jones), as well as a startling (if now cliched) revelation that sets the stage for the final chapter. though a good movie in its own right, i always felt as if this one lagged behind the original in certain key areas. a recent watching confirmed this. i think the ""trouble"" stems from the fact that ""empire"" is much more of an action film than a drama. whereas ""new hope"" was so incredibly genre-diverse, ""empire"" takes that same cast of characters and instead relies a bit too much on laser blasts and space maneuvers. it doesn't help that certain scenes (inside the ""asteroid""; lando's scenes) just feel a little draggy...like filler. overall, though, this is still a very watchable film that keeps the main storyline pushing forward. for special effects or action/adventure buffs, this one will stand out. for others, it may fall just a tick behind the original.";11 March 2017;7;['rousing', 'enough', 'visual', 'only', 'epic', 'inherent', 'original', 'hot', 'first', 'new', 'second', 'more', 'enigmatic', 'little', 'green', 'old', 'final', 'good', 'own', 'original', 'certain', 'key', 'recent', 'more', 'new', 'diverse', 'same', 'certain', 'little', 'draggy', 'watchable', 'main', 'special', 'original'];0.1681071801761457

70;SAMTHEBESTEST;"star wars : the empire strikes back (1980) - brief review ;- star wars strikes back with an impossible classic sequel. star wars episode iv was a mega blockbuster and the one of the most acclaimed film at its time so people kept very high expectations from the sequel. logically, it was almost impossible to bring a sequel to such a high acclaimed film especially when you have to make it keeping in mind that you have to match the predecessor and also generate excitement for the next part. then, luacs films brought the empire strikes back and stunned the star wars fans again. a new hope had sort of slow start because it had to introduce the characters but episode v had an advantage that all the main characters were known so it begun on a blasting note. no further slow start, it begins directly with the explosions and does not stop it till the end. it was far more entertaining and less darker than the predecessor therefore enjoyment factors took over the show throughout the narrative. empire strikes introduced some interesting characters like lando and yoda yet it remained frontloaded. harrison ford looks so cute in this film, the additional humour in his character is lovable. i loved seeing him flirting with the princess. oh my god, how gorgeous carrie fisher was looking as leia but i didn't like the characterisation. she was supposed to have a solid sense of love but actually she was like you know fumbling, i mean she kissed luke to make han feel jealous then confessed her love to han and then she was fondly behaving with luke again. of course, we got the answers in the sequel (return of the jedi) but still it didn't make much sense here. overall, the empire strikes back delivered upto the expectations which is enough to call it, 'arguably, the best sequel ever made'. there was no lucas in director's chair but still episode v scored merits, unbelievable. rating - 8/10* by - #samthebestest";19 November 2020;8;['brief', 'impossible', 'classic', 'mega', 'high', 'impossible', 'high', 'acclaimed', 'next', 'new', 'slow', 'main', 'slow', 'entertaining', 'dark', 'interesting', 'cute', 'additional', 'lovable', 'gorgeous', 'solid', 'fumbling', 'jealous', 'much', 'enough', 'good', 'scored', 'unbelievable', 'samthebest'];0.0883982683982684

73;johnnyboyz;"good lord, what spell does george lucas have everyone under? this is one of the highest ranked films on the website; it's regarded as one of the greatest sequels of all time; it's on most lists entitled the 'greatest motions pictures' of the respective genre; it's a film nearly everyone likes - and yet it failed, for me, to do any of these things justice upon recently seeing it for the first time. perhaps you had to be there; to see it on opening night at a time when there was no such thing as the internet on which you could download and/or watch special teasers or trailers; at a time when the studio were not able to give you the first five minutes as an appetiser to get you to see it; at a time when the only manner in which you could discuss the up and coming franchise episodes were face-to-face and not on message boards. although it's too bad it isn't more like that nowadays. maybe it's futile criticising it now, but at the end of the day, it's still just a film. perhaps you really did have to be there on opening night with no knowledge of what awaited you, preparing yourself to be propelled into a world of monsters, space travel and aliens as you left your brain at the door. but i do think most people rate the film based on childhood experiences more than the film itself they don't ask themselves the question 'how good was the film?', they ask themselves 'how happy was i as a kid when i first saw this?'. for the record, i liked the previous episode. i thought it was good fun and relatively light-hearted with a sense of vision going for it throughout. you really believed lucas had an idea and desperately wanted to follow through on his vision. this twinned with the scope of ideas to do with space travel and the structuring of space stations, look of attire and general mise-en-scene enforces the evidence lucas loved an idea to the point it was an obsession, an obsession he let everyone else into and love in equal measure. alas, episode v entitled 'the empire strikes back' from 1980 is actually quite silly and removes any feeling or excitement the prior episode may have instilled into one. its overall idea is that the young and upcoming hero in luke skywalker (hamill) is to go off and train to take his skills to the next level and become a jedi whilst friends han solo (ford) and co. are chased down by the evil forces led by darth vader (prowse/jones). 'fine' you think, this may well be more interesting now that the introductions and general establishment of good versus evil has been dealt with; there also seems to be a self discovery journey going on. but if anything, the film is less interesting than the first one, particularly after about an hour after which it transcends into a bunch of slightly interesting scenes set on space ships and odd jungle infested planets. once all that has happened, vader gets some hired guns to find the rebels and more stuff happens that just has you passively sit there and watch it all unfold. maybe it's that i cannot just let myself go, but i had no problem with the 1st and 4th episodes in terms of narrative, which were actually quite interesting as this broad and quite epic setting was used to transfer good and evil across a galaxy. in this one, there doesn't feel like anything at stake. the film's protagonist luke is safe and sound on a jungle planet with yoda, being taught what he needs to know, so he's fine, whereas solo and co. are hopping around trying to dodge the forces of evil and the problem is you never feel any connection to them. why should you feel any towards an annoying, big, hairy creature; daft comic relief robots and an underdeveloped, expressionless and somewhat empty headed woman who goes by the name leia (fisher). but these things are the bigger picture. the film has all number of frustrations going on at spaced intervals. of course, solo and co. never get hit by any of the laser beams and they can hide in that meteor storm nice and easily but again, criticising it seems futile. one thing i noticed on several occasions was that everyone in the millennium falcon kept talking over each other, which also annoyed me and the heavy handed catalyst which pushes luke off into his training with yoda is a near death experience on ice planet hoth, during which he nearly freezes to death amongst being eaten. towards the end of the film, luke will be having a showdown with vader after which a famous line is uttered. all well and good but luke doesn't go down into the bowels to fight vader because it's the realistic choice, he goes down there because we want him to we want him to fight and the story demands he put his new jedi skills into practice so that all can see how much he's really learnt. this is after the film goes needlessly 'dark' for one scene involving the freezing/supposed death of a main character and no, the film is 'dark' for that one scene; not from the start and throughout, it's still that laser dodging, fast talking, monster eliminating 'fun' the prior film was. all in all, the empire strikes back is underwhelming and viewing it now makes it seems quite silly more than anything. perhaps proof 'event cinema' can and never will withstand the true test of time.";7 January 2009;6;['good', 'high', 'great', 'most', 'great', 'respective', 'first', 'such', 'special', 'able', 'first', 'only', 'up', 'bad', 'more', 'futile', 'most', 'more', 'good', 'happy', 'previous', 'good', 'hearted', 'general', 'en', 'equal', 'silly', 'prior', 'overall', 'young', 'upcoming', 'next', 'evil', 'fine', 'interesting', 'general', 'good', 'interesting', 'first', 'interesting', 'odd', 'more', 'interesting', 'broad', 'epic', 'good', 'evil', 'protagonist', 'safe', 'fine', 'annoying', 'big', 'hairy', 'comic', 'underdeveloped', 'empty', 'headed', 'big', 'spaced', 'nice', 'futile', 'several', 'other', 'heavy', 'handed', 'near', 'famous', 'good', 'realistic', 'new', 'much', 'learnt', 'dark', 'main', 'dark', 'prior', 'underwhelming', 'silly', 'more', 'proof', 'true'];0.1814293913157549
74;johnnyboyz;"in a 'post-classical' era, films are often quite simplistic - they are driven by high-concepts and childish premises; experiencing them is fragmented by tie-in merchandising and the like. they concentrate on action too much, substituting character psychology. or so the argument goes in bordwell & thompson's 2006 book ""film art"" - whether or not you agree with any of this, there is no questioning star wars' role in facilitating it. ""the empire strikes back"" was the first sequel to the hugely successful 1977 blockbuster ""a new hope"" - picking up where the other left off but, strangely, not really feeling like it does an awful lot to advance what we witnessed other than put its protagonist through a training regime and have his friends chased around space by some villains for 90 minutes. how far have things really been advanced by the time this 1980 effort has finished, beyond a quaint love story and a jarring familial revelation? the film's opening act takes place on a barren, wintry planet called hoth. following the destruction of the death star at the end of episode 4, a weapon capable of destroying a single planet in one foul strike, a military group known as 'the rebels' retreat in the wake of an empirical counter-attack, which involves despatching robotic probes to various parts of the galaxy to scout the potential positions. what everyone is fighting for, we still don't know. later on, during a conversation about mineral mining in a visually impressive city built into the sky, it is inferred the fighting is to do with control of natural resources. when we first see the series' hero, luke skywalker (mark hamill), on the surface of hoth in a blizzard, he looks a little like an alien in his arctic gear complete with goggles and mouth-scarf - you might say he bears a passing resemblance to the film's villain, darth vader, whose jet-black helmet covers his entire face and gives him a similar un-human quality. skywalker unfurls his coverings, looking far more grizzled than in the first film. we are then lulled into a false sense of security when ally han solo (harrison ford) confirms over a radio that the 'sensors' are in place. job done, we conclude - but luke is ambushed by a snow monster and dragged off to its cave. not returning, and with solo out there looking for him, the base takes the decision to close the main doors as the dark creeps in and the perishing cold become overwhelming. cleverly, director irvin kershner focuses on the pained expression of princes leia (carrie fisher) as they shut - whose fate does she fear for the most? luke's escape from the yeti provides us with a tantalising early look at the power of the lightsaber, which takes the monster's arm clean off - an important detail for a later duel... but why does luke then leave the safety of the cave as the storm rages? why did the film have him caught in the first place? half-dying in the snow, he has a vision of dead friend obi-wan (alec guinness) who tells him to seek ""yoda"" on another planet so that he may complete jedi training, but we know that obi-wan can appear at any time to tell him this - luke doesn't need to be on his last legs and think he's hallucinating. eventually, one of those enemy probes passes by the base, but the rebels mysteriously attack it when the plan was to maintain invisibility - why not just let it pass? cover blown, the empire attack - but are the rebels evacuating the base or defending it? we're not sure. irrespectively, the act ends when the hoth fight ends - solo; leia; chewbacca and a friendly robot named c3po leave on solo's ship whereas skywalker departs to find yoda with r2d2. from here, the film cuts into two halves: luke's strand is slow, methodical and contemplative as he spends time on a jungle planet with a small green alien learning how to perfect abilities in 'the force', whereas solo and the gang endure a more causality driven experience as vader's ship pursues them through asteroid belts; the stomachs of giant worms and cities built into the clouds. what becomes curious about the film at this stage is that the antagonist, vader, makes a conscious decision to pursue skywalker not to kill him, but capture him so that they may join together as villains. in addition to this, an entire passage of the film beds said protagonist down in one place so that he may learn about patience; concentration and being contemplative - hardly things associated with 'post-classical' cinema. by today's standards, this is positively blockbuster revisionism. but surely there is a hole in skywalker's training: is he not working towards wrecking a revenge on vader? isn't this contrary to the force's teachings? solo's strand is more simplistic, more familiar to this post-star wars era blockbuster school: the bad-guys are chasing the good-guys; there is a meagre romance between solo and leia - royalty mingling with common-folk. amusingly, kershner uses a recurring gag to do with solo's ship's power-thrust mechanic failing to roar into action when he needs it, and we grin at the metaphor. strikingly, very little of any real interest happens on this strand which seems present to keep people amused as the other stuff plays out. i read and hear of people remarking how much 'darker' the film's tone is, and so it is better than iv, but i would disagree. tonally, the films seem quite similar - certainly, the characters here are in hairier situations, but so what? it ends on more of a downbeat note, for skywalker; solo and even vader, but does so in order to tee up the next film, not because its ending is in line with any kind of thematic it's exploring. how is one to conclude now, almost 40 years on from the changing of the cinematic guard?

75;poe426;sequels are rarely as good as the films that spawned them- but the empire strikes back (thanks to the direction of irvin kershner) proves the exception to the rule. mature and thoughtful in a way the first film never was (though still chock full of the kinds of critters and fx that most fans of the original took to), this first sequel remains the best (by far) to date. for once in this series, the viewer feels s/he's in the hands of a genuine storyteller. while lucas himself may have written the script, it's kershner who gives empire life, whose taut direction lifts what might've been just another also-ran sequel to a much higher plane than the original ever attained.

77;Movie_Muse_Reviews;"""a new hope"" opened us up to a galaxy of possibilities. ""the empires strikes back"" begins to show us just how large that scope really is. not only that, but there is a definite sense that ""star wars"" has grown up a little bit in episode v, including taking a much darker tone. after the destruction of the death star, the war between the rebellion and the empire is on. ""empire"" takes us first to the icy tundra of hoth, then to the jungles of degobah and lastly the futuristic bespin aka cloud city. immediately our imaginations begin to expand. in terms of characters, we are introduced to yoda, the ancient jedi master who begins training luke. there is also boba fett, the cool-looking bounty hunter in the awesome ship and lando calrissian, the handsome new friend to the original gang. the film doesn't settle with what we are familiar with from episode 4 and keeps pushing our imagination further. most importantly, the characters that we fell in love with previously seem a lot more viable than they once were, not merely vessels for the exchange of brash remarks and one-liners. princess leia (now sporting a more femme fatal look as suits her true character) and han solo begin to carve out a relationship that is essential to the greatness of this film. luke's maturity is just as important. we're blown away by the famous ending scene with luke and vader because of how far luke has come since his days on a desert farm. he no longer sounds like an idiot every time he opens his mouth. last but far from least, even vader, the enigma, becomes more complicated in this film. the character development is really what makes this film considered the best of the entire saga by many, many fans. so many times, nearly all the time, do middle films in a trilogy fail in comparison to the films on either side of them, but ""empire"" doesn't. most of the time it can end up as just a bridge with no ability to stand on its own, but it stands on its own. it borrows just enough from ""hope"" and sets things in motion just enough that it does its job as a transitioning film, but the climax is kind of thrilling in its own way, not just as in we can't wait to see what happens next. it has plenty of its own, new elements to keep it fresh and like an expansion of the original as opposed to a mere continuation of it.";18 October 2008;9;['new', 'large', 'definite', 'little', 'dark', 'futuristic', 'ancient', 'boba', 'awesome', 'handsome', 'new', 'original', 'familiar', 'viable', 'femme', 'fatal', 'true', 'essential', 'important', 'famous', 'last', 'least', 'complicated', 'good', 'entire', 'many', 'many', 'many', 'middle', 'most', 'own', 'own', 'own', 'own', 'new', 'fresh', 'original', 'mere'];0.2581523944805194

80;funkyfry;"it's wonderful that lucasfilm has finally consented to release this film in its original format without new additions and alterations. now we can see the original matte work and effects, which are quite beautiful accomplishments and stand among the best of their era. the film is the best directed of the entire series, suffering from none of lucas' poor directing of actors and marquand's tentative camera handling. that said, kershner himself is not an exceptional director except insofar as how he works with actors and his light comic touch. this film relies heavily on storyboarding and sticking fairly closely to its script, which was penned by lucas himself from a draft by the great leigh brackett, with further refinement by lawrence kasdan. the story takes the characters from the original film, with the addition of the charming lando calrissian (billy dee williams), further along their personal and political quests. the film does a good job of developing these characters far beyond what their potential in the original film or their treatment in the disappointing subsequent ""jedi"" were able to suggest, and of tying in the development of the characters' relationships with each other parallel to the plot of the film. the only unfortunate aspect in terms of the film's pacing is that the most exciting battle sequences fall so early in the film, leaving us a bit let down by the film's dialog-heavy middle section until we get to the stirring (and somewhat dark) conclusion in cloud city. it's notable that this is almost the only star wars film that does not feature the desert planet tatooine. this can be seen as symbolic of the fact that this was the film that george lucas had the least to do with -- tatooine represents his hometown of modesto in the other films. i also do not consider it a coincidence that this, almost universally acknowledged by fans as the best in the series, was the one with which george lucas had the least involvement. i've always believed that a lot of the credit for the success of these first 2 films should belong to the producer gary kurtz, a fellow usc grad who cut his teeth working with roger corman (producing monte hellman's first films) and who developed these 2 films' concept of ""used space"" visual design which was later abandoned in favor of a glossy more standard ""new space"" look. these 2 productions are on a higher level overall than anything that lucas did after the partnership ended, which is particularly striking in that the excessively bright and shiny ""jedi"" followed only a few years later. kurtz went on to produce ""the dark crystal"" -- a superior production imho to any of lucas' solo (read: non spielberg/kurtz) efforts.";8 January 2007;9;['wonderful', 'original', 'new', 'original', 'beautiful', 'good', 'entire', 'poor', 'tentative', 'exceptional', 'light', 'comic', 'great', 'leigh', 'further', 'original', 'charming', 'personal', 'political', 'good', 'original', 'disappointing', 'subsequent', 'able', 'other', 'only', 'unfortunate', 'exciting', 'heavy', 'middle', 'dark', 'notable', 'only', 'symbolic', 'least', 'other', 'good', 'least', 'first', 'fellow', 'first', 'visual', 'glossy', 'standard', 'new', 'high', 'overall', 'bright', 'shiny', 'few', 'dark', 'superior', 'imho'];0.1923781291172595
81;Anonymous_Maxine;in a film like the empire strikes back, especially a few years on the heels of such a mind-bogglingly great film like the original star wars, there is something that comes immediately to mind that would at first seem to count against the film, but instead only winds up increasing the respect that it commands. in the 1977 star wars, there is a clear reliance on simplicity in some parts. obviously, it is much more than a simply made science fiction film, but like i said in my review of it, there was a lot of highly effective reliance on things that were not put on screen, such as obi wan's description of the force to luke. in the empire strike back, the first thing that we are treated to is the traditional scrolling text along a background of stars, depicting what has happened between the last film and this one, and reminding us of the things that were mentioned in the last film but never explained. at first, this would almost seem to be a way to save money to get more information across to the audience without having to actually put it on screen, but this is really an ingenious way of furthering the story. the very fact that we are so willing to read all this information and forgive our inability to actually see it is a testament to the quality of the series, even at this early stage in its presentation, and we know the story so well from the first film that we are glad to see such a large change in what's happening in the films, not for a second lamenting the fact that we have obviously missed so much action. and besides that, if and when george lucas runs out of new prequels to release, and maybe if he someday begins to run low on how many hundreds of millions of dollars he has, he could go right back and make these in-between scenes into full length films. what would he call these, if he did that? introquels? who cares! the names themselves would be interesting enough, and if you go back and read the stuff that introduces this film, it's obvious that there's an entire film there just waiting to be made. i guess the question of actors would be a formidable one, though. the empire strikes back is the film where we are first introduced to the great jedi master yoda ('away put your weapon!'), as well as some of the most thrilling battle sequences of the entire star wars series, and that includes the prequels. the battle scene where the rebels fight the imperial walkers on the ice planet is an incredibly well-made battle scene, not only in the way that it was put together so convincingly using models, but that the machines themselves are so creatively made. indeed, the imperial walkers are some of the most recognizable machines from the entire star wars saga, right up there with the millennium falcon and the death star. i have just watched this film again, having already seen episode i and episode ii, and not having seen any of the original star wars films for maybe 10 years (except for the original 1977 star wars, which i saw and reviewed a few days ago - and these aren't even the special edition versions!). when i first saw yoda when watching the empire strikes back again, i was really struck by how different he looked from in the newer movies. obviously, he's completely computer generated in the new films, but here in episode v he looks like a muppet! even so, i would like to express my opinion that yoda is more realistic and more interesting here as a puppet than in the newer films as a computer generated image. at least here in the older films you know that he's actually there, and that he's not just added into the film later. oh yeah, speaking of yoda, can i just complain for a minute? what the hell was up with the jedi training? yes, i realize that i'm just a lowly imdb reviewer, while the empire strikes back is a part of the greatest science fiction series of all time, but would it have killed george lucas to write in a little more creative training for luke? the thing that struck me first about the star wars films when i first started watching them was how incredibly imaginative they were, but then luke started his training. you know, when i was in high school i played football. i was a wide receiver/tight end and i hardly ever got to play because i was too tall and too skinny, but part of my workout was to carry the linemen up and down the stairs to the weight room. some of these guys weighed 100 pounds more than me, and i still almost never saw the field, and here's luke skywalker. he carries yoda around this boggy swamp and he gets to be a jedi! what the hell! there is also the addition of a surprisingly fitting love story. first of all, anyone who has ever read my review of a jerry bruckheimer movie will know that i am not the biggest fan of cramming a love story into a movie where it doesn't belong. i can't seem to write anything about bruckheimer movies without complaining about the idiot love story, and now it's even worse because here's this movie that was made so long before, from which bruckheimer could obviously have at least learned a little bit about how to do it right. han solo and princess leia maintain the personalities that they developed in the first star wars film and there is now a sort of love/hate relationship between the two of them, where neither one of them wants to admit their feelings for the other. this romantic subplot is characterized perfectly in the scene just before solo is carbon frozen, when leia risks approaching a cheesy romantic moment by saying 'i love you' just before han is lowered into the freezing chamber, and he saves the moment by responding, 'i know.' han solo. smart-ass to the last drop. before i end i would like to point out that the goofs that can be found on the imdb for this film are some of the most blatant that i've ever seen in a film. the scene where you can see someone giving a woman at the tactical maps a cue to deliver her lines is amazingly obvious, and some of the other ones, such as the stage hand swinging the light saber prop briefly into view as he switches it for an 'off' prop with luke just after he knocks darth vader over backwards, are just as much fun to look for. i have one question about the goofs, though. there's one where luke looks off into the fog just after r2-d2 is eaten by the sea monster, and you can clearly see a person running to the right a little ways off in the fog. is that meant to be luke? it seems that it's supposed to be him running in his search for r2, because you can even hear the footsteps of the person running. i can't even imagine how they could have missed that!! it is, however, a testament to the quality of a film when such tremendous oversights in editing do nothing to take away from the overall quality of the film. the empire strikes back remains an extremely powerful and well-made installment in the star wars series, not taking even a single step backwards in the sheer breathtaking adventure of the original film. it's not often that a film as good as star wars can be released and then followed up with a sequel that is just as great, as is clearly the case here. star wars was a gigantic film upon its release, and with the empire strikes back, lucas has begun the formation of one of the greatest film series' in cinematic history.;6 August 2002;10;['few', 'great', 'original', 'clear', 'more', 'effective', 'such', 'first', 'traditional', 'scrolling', 'last', 'last', 'more', 'ingenious', 'very', 'willing', 'early', 'first', 'glad', 'large', 'second', 'much', 'new', 'many', 'full', 'interesting', 'obvious', 'entire', 'formidable', 'thrilling', 'entire', 'imperial', 'imperial', 'recognizable', 'entire', 'original', 'original', 'few', 'special', 'different', 'new', 'new', 'realistic', 'interesting', 'new', 'least', 'old', 'lowly', 'great', 'little', 'creative', 'imaginative', 'high', 'wide', 'tight', 'tall', 'skinny', 'more', 'fitting', 'big', 'bruckheim', 'bad', 'least', 'little', 'right', 'first', 'other', 'romantic', 'romantic', 'freezing', 'smart', 'last', 'blatant', 'tactical', 'obvious', 'other', 'such', 'light', 'much', 'little', 'luke', 'such', 'tremendous', 'overall', 'powerful', 'single', 'sheer', 'original', 'good', 'great', 'gigantic', 'great', 'cinematic'];0.1722997835497836
82;hellraiser7;"conflict is never a one-sided affair, where there is great victory for one side comes great tragedy for another. this film is one of my favorite films of all time, it's my favorite ""star wars"" film of all time and my favorite sequel of all time. indeed, this truly is one of the not just the best sequels that really helped set the standard in how to continue a franchise but also just simply established ""star wars"" as a saga in general. let alone this is probably one of the darkest sequels ever as it's not the most cheerful which to me makes the film and story all the better because as an old saying goes sometimes when things are at their worst, is the time when people are at their best. the action is great, there are lots of memorable action pieces like one of my favorite battles of all time of course is the battle at hoth. i really love those imperial walkers i thought they were just awesome looking and at the same time really menacing as they look like giant dogs. i really love the model designs and stop motions effects by the late great phil tippit. there were also the first mechs i've ever seen, i really like how they move which is tank like which makes sense as they're by their nature giant tanks. personally, i don't mind in fact sometimes like that kind of movement in mechs the best, as opposed to the flighty movement you would see in anime like ""gundam"". let alone the fact that these walkers don't go down so easily, where in most anime despite how awesome looking the mecha is, they always seem to be built so flimsy as they go down in one hit or two. in a way this battle was sort of like a david vs. goliath battle as we see the rebels devise a clever tactic to taking down the walkers which is cool because it's simple. the space chase with han, leia, chewbacca, and c3po is also awesome as we see they are all just jumping though hoops and going though the motions, doing their best getting steps ahead of the imperial pursuers. like going through the asteroid field which really put my on the edge of my seat as we know one wrong move your dead. along with the cave they were all hiding in which to me is probably one of the biggest close calls ever, literally. along with the saber action, really liked seeing luke use the light saber a bit more in the film even the fight with darth vader which is one of my favorite one of one battles of all time. sure, there was the fight between obi wan and vader in the first film, but this fight i thought was a lot better because there was a lot more to the fight. from seeing not just luke and vader clash with he sabers but also utilizing and even using what's in their environment as their weapon. i even like in this battle it really feels like it could go either way, despite how skilled luke is it might not be enough as vader is more experienced. or even from how the fight goes there are moments when it seems luke might be able to turn the tables but there are times when it really looks like fate isn't smiling on luke. the story and what i love in the sequel is that the character is better than before where their a little more fleshed out, three dimensional and less archetypical which makes us care about them more. from han and leia, both are one of my favorite fictional couples of all time. it sort of fit with the 80's decade as there were lots of tv shows based on romantic couples like ""moonlighting"", ""macross"", etc. like with those shows both conflict and romance just go together and make a beautiful combo as both are somewhat the same, what is romance without conflict and love can really hurt and be scary sometimes. but most importantly in both this and those shows we already know these two belong together and are going to come together but it's a question of when. i really love the banter between both, which is funny but also endearing, both are somewhat opposites in many ways from class to just simply disagreement on just about anything to everything. but many both are in conflict because of how both feel for one another which is love. han is more forward with his feelings despite not outwardly confessing and leia is constantly in denial or confusion over hers which is why she is unable to admit her feelings to both him and she. as both spend more time together, we see just like any ship going out of light speed their feelings start emerging, which also makes what happens in the end even more tragic. luke as usual is being luke though here we see he's became a little more mature as he is now a rebel commander, so he's taken a little more responablity in both his career and life. however, that and time has not quilled a certain fire in his soul that is blazing out of control as luke has became a lot more impatient and reckless which unfortunately leads to some bad choices that not just yoda and obi wan are in disagreement with but us also. sure, in some of those choices he had good intentions and in one scene goes out to help, but as two old sayings go, ""good intentions are nothing if there is no follow though"" and ""good deeds don't go unpunished."" things like that just show luke still has a ways to go in the way of the jedi. darth vader as usual is himself but we see he's a little more ruthless and even angrier than before which is reflected from his relentless determination throughout the film down to even offing anyone that makes one error too many. but what i like about him in this film is you get a little character out of him. there is an actual sense of emotion in his pursuit for skywalker. this really deepens the mystery of the character more. really liked one scene where he is talking with his master ""the emperor"" whom we see for the first time, where it seems like in the conversation vader voice sounds like he cares about luke and what happens to him, but we're not sure why. of course there is the new edition yoda whom is voiced brilliantly by frank oz best known for his puppetry and vocal work in ""the muppet show"" and ""sesame street"", really like the look of the alien which is cute looking but also has a respectability about him. yoda is one of my favorite characters in the franchise, to me he's sort of an alien version of mr. myogi. just like myogi he has his comical side but when the comedy ends, he really gets down to business. from the tone of his voice you really buy him as a person with a heavy amount of wisdom as well as emotion which makes both luke and us take him seriously. the other thing is the story which i feel is both a rich sci-fi fantasy adventure but at the same time a rich personal character drama. the plotline we see the good guys are in a very bad place despite scoring a goal, the puck is now in the bad guys court and they are hitting them hard. really like in this film we see some really dire locations from the ice planet hoth, the swampy dank dagobah system, and even part of the lower levels of cloud city it really reflects the state and state of mind the good guys are in, all bad. but i like how despite this the good guys aren't going to sit there and take it; they might go down but their not doing it without a fight. the ensemble throughout the film are all split up, their barely together in the film except in a scene or two. but this actually turns out to be a good thing because it give each of the characters a chance to have their own story all interconnected into one big one; as well as us to become better acquainted with them and understand more of the universe they occupy. i really love some of the philosophy going on in the film which is mainly in the jedi training at dagobah; it's richly thoughtful and one of the first films that actually go me into philosophy. really love seeing the jedi training going on, which kind of makes the film ""the karate kid"" in space. you really see how just like in any walk of life it takes hard work to become a warrior or anything else you want to be in life. also the philosophy in the film really taught me about what fear really is and where it comes from, but also about the power of faith and what it really means. then of course there is the big reveal near the end of the film, which was a total shocker at the time, even i was one of the people shocked i remember thinking ""you've got to be fraking kidding me!"". it was something i couldn't see 30 to 40 miles away. and i love that, i felt it was an example of a twist when done the right way, there was never any hints throughout the movie and there were never any in the previous film. this made it even more effective but also all the more dramatic because it actually makes sense. as an old saying goes, ""the battle may be lost, but the war is far from over."" rating: 4

83;Vartiainen;unlike so many unplanned sequels to standalone movies that don't know what to do with themselves, star wars episode v pulls ahead like a champ. it does it by taking the existing universe, expanding it in a logical manner, staying with what worked in the previous film yet adding something new and original as well. you can definitely see that they hadn't planned for this film in advance because there's a lot of new stuff. suddenly we have the character of yoda, the reveal of luke's father, the romantic tension between han and leia (you can see pretty well in the first film that she was supposed to end up with luke) and the continuation of the war between the alliance and the empire. but, unlike in so many other sequels, in this case it works because the film makers hadn't painted themselves into a corner with the first film. there was still story left from the original to explore. the emperor hadn't been dealt with, it was possible that darth vader might have survived the destruction of the first death star and luke still had much to learn about the force. and thus we get a film that might be one of the best sequels ever made, if not one of the best movies in general. the film is also a significant leap forward in terms of technical quality. they had a much bigger budget with this film, plus more experience with the new effects the first film had pioneered, and it shows. from darth vader's improved armor and look to the explosions and the spaceships to the lightsaber battles. they all look fantastic and have held up remarkably well over the decades. furthermore, the story is just as good as in the first one. the battle of hoth that opens the film might very well be one of my favourite battle scenes in all of cinema and the lightsaber duel near the end of the film is easily the best one in all of the franchise. plus, we get a lot of new stuff, as stated, and they all work very well. yoda's puppetry effects have not aged as well as some other effects in the film, but they're still pretty impressive even by today's standards and the character itself is a lot of fun. kind of jar jar done right. you know, a crackpot local (i know he's not really from dagobah, shut up) alien who talks funny, messes around, but is still needed for the plot. except in yoda's case there's some actual wisdom beneath the initial goofiness. overall i think i prefer episode iv to this one, but it's by a very slight margin. this one has better battles, better effects and equally great story, but episode iv had better atmosphere and sense of mythos. nevertheless, they're both fantastic scifi epics and well worth a watch if you've been living under a rock for the last half a century.;29 November 2015;10;['many', 'unplanned', 'standalone', 'logical', 'previous', 'new', 'original', 'new', 'romantic', 'first', 'many', 'other', 'first', 'possible', 'first', 'much', 'good', 'good', 'general', 'significant', 'technical', 'big', 'more', 'new', 'first', 'improved', 'fantastic', 'good', 'first', 'favourite', 'good', 'new', 'other', 'impressive', 'local', 'funny', 'actual', 'initial', 'slight', 'well', 'well', 'great', 'well', 'fantastic', 'worth', 'last'];0.2555821371610846
84;jzappa;"empire opens with luke skywalker pushing back his return to base camp to investigate what he assumes is a meteor that has crashed nearby. we know that it's one of the probe droids vader has sent to track him down. what happens on his journey to investigate? is he confronted by imperial forces? does he realize just in time? actually he's knocked unconscious and taken captive by a horrifying yeti-like predator to be savagely devoured. immediately, the tone is set in stark opposition to the movie's predecessor. we're on hoth, a planet blanketed entirely by snow and ice, routinely pummeled by countless meteorites from a neighboring asteroid belt, but the craters are fleeting as the planet is in a perpetual snow drift. the only native creatures to our knowledge are the tauntaun, camel-like creatures, and the yeti-like ones. the latter eat the former. this is a clear indication of a film series that's going somewhere, not just playing variations on the same notes. and with confidence i say in my humble non-fanatic opinion that empire is the best of the original trilogy. after the buck rodgers/flash gordon merriment of the original film, this one marches into mortality and sorrow, and rightly acquiesces to the latent conundrums of the story. it's because of the real drama propelled in empire that the whole saga takes on a legendary value that hearkens back to the first and urges a continuation to the third. this is the core, not the continuing adventures of. but that doesn't mean it's the most thought-provoking; it just means i buy it the most. it isn't introspectively involved or even very concerned with personalities apart from barefaced character attributes. as a result, we have the trite push-pull flirtations between han and leia, who begin to discover their fondness for each other during, among other things, while zooming through an asteroid field to evade vader's goons. there is still forced, stilted dialogue aplenty, and there is also no development provided for chewbacca, who was thrown into the first film as ornament, was never fully contemplated, and consequently was burdened with one facial expression and one bereft gargle/bark/roar. much more could have been done. how can you be a space pilot and not be able to interact in any productive way? does han actually comprehend chewy's uniform babble? otherwise, how have they bonded? yoda, however, is introduced with real flavor and feeling, as well as an eastern-infused philosophical affectation. the seemingly unintentional hilarity of his voice and physicality don't seem like datedness but rather something audiences since 1980 have been too reverent or awe-struck to deride the way they do other '80s fantasy films. who are funny are c-3p0 and r2-d2, mostly because they are essentially woody allen and lassie as a comedy duo, in robotic form. but the heart of empire is the extent of darth vader's ruthlessness, and his legendary obsessive struggle with luke. indeed, he's such a powerful and controlling presence in this film, using the force to make lethal examples out of his own underlings as well as experimenting with putting people in chemical suspended animation freezing, that things do not go the way we'd like them to. the very bad news luke hears, the way han ends up paying back jabba the hut, the nature of han's friendship with lando calrissian. there are real scenes of tension and suspense that arise out of the soap opera and mawkish comic relief. nevertheless, the script is not only rooted in lucas' story basis and the penning of future director lawrence kasdan but also one leigh brackett, who'd previously written some of the best chandler adaptations as well as rio bravo. one can imagine the snarkiness of han and leia's dialogue and 3po's hi-jinks delivering more becomingly in a film of the 1940s or '50s. maybe since so much more deliberation and capital was concentrated on this fifth episode, the tipping point before the climax of a six-film saga, in the first place, not much was tampered with in the restored and sleek re-release. i never did recall the first film in precise detail, even when i saw this special edition in theaters in 1997, but now that my eye is more seasoned and conditioned, i can tell that the cloud city was adorned with some supplementary enrichment, and there is more of that terrifying ice creature than before. i have no distrust that there are many enhancements in sound design, but i'm not a dolphin so i can't be sure.";22 June 2010;8;['imperial', 'unconscious', 'captive', 'like', 'stark', 'countless', 'fleeting', 'perpetual', 'only', 'native', 'like', 'like', 'latter', 'former', 'clear', 'same', 'humble', 'non', 'fanatic', 'good', 'original', 'original', 'latent', 'real', 'whole', 'legendary', 'first', 'third', 'provoking', 'concerned', 'trite', 'other', 'other', 'first', 'facial', 'bereft', 'more', 'able', 'productive', 'babble', 'real', 'eastern', 'philosophical', 'unintentional', 'reverent', 'other', 'funny', 'woody', 'robotic', 'legendary', 'obsessive', 'powerful', 'controlling', 'lethal', 'own', 'bad', 'lando', 'real', 'comic', 'future', 'leigh', 'good', 'hi', 'more', 'fifth', 'first', 'much', 'sleek', 'first', 'precise', 'special', 'seasoned', 'supplementary', 'more', 'many', 'sure'];0.2179365079365079

86;FiendishDramaturgy;"is it possible that this is even better than star wars: episode iv? this chapter of the star wars saga is unique in that it is neither directed, nor written by luca$. irvin kershner directs and leigh brackett & lawrence kasdan are the credited writers of this screenplay. i consider that is why it is widely thought of as the best of the ot: luca$ neither directed, nor wrote it. this is perhaps one of the most successful sequels of all time. while it rates an 8.7/10 at the internet movie database, and iv rated an 8.8/10, there is a large school of thought whereby the idea is expressed that this installment of the luca$ money machine is superior to the original. i must say that i subscribe to this notion. the story featured is darker, while maintaining the same charm and enjoyability as episode iv. there is less action and more story, and that is fine by me. i was as enchanted by the plot as i was roused by the action. there are no obvious plot holes (at least, not yet. episode iii has not yet been released); no contrivances. everything fits nicely into its place and feels properly nestled within. there has been much speculation as to the meaning of yoda's words to obi-wan concerning ""the other."" ""that boy is our last hope."" obi-wan ""no. there is another."" yoda most casual fans of this franchise, affectionately known as the luca$ $tar war$ $aga or the luca$ money machine, tend to believe that yoda refers to leia in that statement, and indeed, obi-wan does confirm that it was leia about whom yoda spoke. but i have always had another thought about that. since there are further star wars stories, not to mention countless novels produced in the genre of ""fan fiction,"" and an enormous expanded universe, i am a bit timid to discuss my feelings here, but will force myself to expound upon my thoughts as a means of catharsis, if for no other reason. i believe yoda referred to han solo. i have two reasons. there are more, to be sure, but i will detail only two; the most poignant, in my opinion. first, to activate the light saber, one must possess the proper mindset; that of a jedi. whether it is because of metichlorine-filled blood, a state of heart, or a gods-given gift, that ability belongs to a jedi alone. joe-blow from down the road couldn't activate a light saber. but han did, in this episode, when cutting open the ton-ton to save captain solo's life in the frozen wastelands of hoth. second. han solo has the ability to navigate a rather large freighter through an asteroid belt, with the controls set to ""manual."" this type of ability was demonstrated in episode iv to effectively demonstrate luke's growing abilities as a jedi. han and leia's relationship deepens, chewy has a few pivotal scenes (his part is much more vocal and present in this chapter), and our favorite droids are given the full star treatment. as i mentioned earlier, the theme here is much darker than was episode iv. lord vader's copious presence goes a long way towards furthering that goal, as does the lighting, tone and mood of the musical score. the stormtroopers somehow seem more menacing, and carrie fisher's performance abilities seem to have doubled from her first star wars attempt. mark hamill's luke skywalker finally earns that battle scene with vader which was promised in the first installment (or fourth, whatever), and we see the return of obi-wan (kind of). it is amusing to see yoda play the part of a troublesome creature while testing skywalker's demeanor and potential. once he makes his determinations surrounding skywlaker's training, his changes in tone and behavior back to that of the jedi master he is, were obvious. it was quite endearing to see him that way: apparently made feral by the wild swampy jungle in which he dwells. and then to discover it was all just an act. beautifully done. while this chapter appears at first viewing to depend completely upon the fourth and sixth episodes for support, episode v does have a noticeable beginning, climax, and ending. the elements of that beginning, climax, and ending; however, do depend upon those other episodes to explain it and uplift it. you must subscribe to the mindset of the fourth chapter in order to comprehend the subtle meanings of what takes place. without knowledge of episode iv, this is just another popcorn movie. an incredibly done popcorn movie, but a popcorn movie, nonetheless. but with that knowledge, this movie is instantly elevated to that of the ""superior sequel"" in that the story is far richer, the execution feels much more natural, and the conclusion is an excellent cliffhanger even though there is an obvious end. while it is superior, it lacks the level of newness the original possessed. it receives a well-earned 9.8/10 from... the fiend :.";18 March 2007;10;['possible', 'well', 'unique', 'leigh', 'good', 'successful', 'large', 'superior', 'original', 'dark', 'same', 'less', 'more', 'fine', 'obvious', 'least', 'much', 'other', 'last', 'most', 'casual', 'further', 'countless', 'enormous', 'timid', 'other', 'more', 'sure', 'poignant', 'light', 'proper', 'light', 'open', 'frozen', 'second', 'large', 'few', 'pivotal', 'vocal', 'present', 'favorite', 'full', 'dark', 'copious', 'long', 'musical', 'menacing', 'first', 'first', 'fourth', 'amusing', 'troublesome', 'obvious', 'endearing', 'feral', 'wild', 'swampy', 'fourth', 'sixth', 'noticeable', 'other', 'fourth', 'subtle', 'superior', 'rich', 'natural', 'excellent', 'obvious', 'superior', 'original'];0.1658661740558292
87;snoozejonc;the story of the rebellion against the galactic empire continues with luke, leia, han, chewie, r2 and 3po on another blistering ride. the best praise i can give the empire strikes back is that it was the first star wars movie to hold my 3 year old daughter's attention for the entire duration, and it's easy to see why as virtually every scene is a new and interesting story. several great characters are introduced such as yoda, lando, boba fett, and the emperor, who add further interest to the overarching story, while the original movies favourites of han, chewie, leia, luke, darth vader, and the droids continue to entertain. there are countless cinematic moments such as the hoth planet scenes, the epic chemistry between han and leia, and virtually everything that happens on degaba and in the cloud city. the classic scene with luke and vader is so atmospheric and dramatic you will be hard pressed not to find yourself role-playing it with your own children one day. john williams is the true star of the show as his music fits the emotion of every scene perfectly. i still catch my daughter humming the imperial march to herself from time to time. visually it is one of the greatest movies of all time, with groundbreaking (for the time) effects, excellent cinematography, editing, action sequences, puppetry, sets, costumes and battles. likewise the sound effects are wonderful. the performances include memorable turns from james earl jones, frank oz, mark hamill, carrie fisher, harrison ford and anthony daniels. some consider it to be superior to the original star wars (a new hope) and they may well have a point. it is darker, more intriguing, delivers an excellent twist, and ends on the edge of a cliff. however, the spectacle didn't awe me on the same level as the original. this is not fault of the sequel, as it simply came second, and much like a junkie chasing their first high i never quite achieved the same feeling.

96;drqshadow-reviews;top of the line for a majority of star wars geeks, and for good reason. it's the ideal melting pot of george lucas's vast, quirky imagination, his influences' knack for dark, large-scale epics, and his key contributors' determined efforts to retain a central humanism amidst all the creatures, effects and operatic indulgences. a wildly ambitious picture, it's genuinely amazing just how much territory is covered over the course of two hours. lucas and company manage to leap from the hoth battle to yoda on dagobah, the asteroid field to lando and cloud city, before finally climaxing with the classic luke / vader showdown and revelation. that's an awful lot of set pieces, not to mention some seriously powerful plot points, but smooth talking and a few outstanding performances keep the film from feeling over-stuffed or under-explored. the cast, too, grows on an individual basis almost universally, with luke wrapping himself in the wisdom of the jedi, han and leia developing genuine chemistry and darth vader, in a surprise twist that should never have been so effective, actually showing some signs of humanity. although it can be hammy from time to time, those moments are balanced expertly by a wonderful series of mountains and valleys, to the point that they stop being seen as negatives and instead contribute to the picture's eccentricity. a legendary effort that's just as monumental, entrancing and electric thirty years later, it's damn near perfect.;5 December 2012;10;['good', 'ideal', 'vast', 'quirky', 'dark', 'large', 'key', 'central', 'operatic', 'ambitious', 'amazing', 'much', 'hoth', 'classic', 'awful', 'set', 'powerful', 'smooth', 'few', 'outstanding', 'individual', 'genuine', 'effective', 'hammy', 'wonderful', 'legendary', 'monumental', 'electric', 'perfect'];0.2991718426501035

98;MBunge;you know what the dirty little secret about the empire strikes back is? while many people would claim this is the best star wars movie, it really isn'tand it isn't even close. which doesn't mean empire isn't a great film. the last 25 minutes or so are as good as anything in star wars and there's plenty before that to keep you entertained. but i think folks get caught up in how much bigger, bolder and darker this sequel is compared to the first movie and don't notice the little cracks that run throughout the story. empire picks up the story of luke skywalker (mark hamill) and the rebellion against the empire at least a few years after the events of star wars. the rebels have just settled in to a new secret base when luke gets bushwacked by a snow monster and sees an image of ben kenobi (alec guinness) telling him to go to the dagobah system and be trained by jedi master yoda (frank oz). a probe droid leads the empire to the rebel base and after a big battle, luke sets off for dagobah while han solo (harrison ford), princess leia (carrie fisher) and company get trapped by the empire and eventually have to flee to cloud city, where han's old friend lando calrissian (billy dee williams) will help them repair the millennium falcon and hide from the empire. as luke trains, we learn that darth vader (david prowse and james earl jones) is desperate to find luke and considers his jedi potential to be extremely valuable or extremely dangerous to the empire. vader eventually lures luke to cloud city, where we get one of the all time great revelations in movie history, and witness our heroes battle to survive. empire is definitely a bigger film than star wars. there's far more action on a much grander scale with more speed and thrills. but a lot of the big effects in empire have not aged that well. watching empire, you can sort of understand how george lucas became obsessed with going back and fixing things in the original trilogy. this is also one of the boldest movie blockbusters ever. the story is basically about how our heroes fail over and over and over again and barely escape by the skin of their teeth. and these are real failures, where luke and han aren't smart enough or strong enough or good enough to succeed, not flukes or situations where winning is impossible. empire is very much about how the characters we loved from the first movie fall short and get beaten down. which is one of the things that make it much darker than star wars or any other sw movie, except perhaps revenge of the sith. but that's not all. star wars was largely the story of luke skywalker growing from a boy to a man, but in a triumphant, cheerful, fairy tale sort of way. it's a hero's story. empire is also about a boy becoming a man, but not in triumph. this is a story about luke becoming an adult and learning that the world doesn't work the way children think it does. this is a story of lost innocence. empire is a great movie and i don't want to overly criticize it, but you can see some basic problems compared to star wars. it doesn't really have a central plot propelling things along. for a big budget sci-fi spectacle, empire is rather like one of those art house films where stuff just happens to the characters. the story also breaks up the luke/leia/han triangle suggested in star wars and leaves leia with little to do in this film other than be the foil for han's amorous advances. and while the story is more adult in some ways, it's also simpler. there was a lot of stuff in star wars that suggested a wider universe in which that particular story was only a part. empire shrinks everything down and links everything together in a much less sophisticated way. darth vader also becomes almost cartoonishly evil in empire after having a core of believability in star wars. although, the story does do a good job of illustrating how being that evil is ultimately self-defeating. and there's a lot of little comedic bits crammed into the story, with most of it c-3po related. it's not as bad a jar jar binks, but it's a step down that road. one of the other striking things about empire is seeing puppet yoda again after getting used to cgi created characters. there's no denying that while puppet yoda looked great in 1980, now he really looks fake. but puppet yoda actually seems more alive than the cgi yoda of the prequels. puppet yoda looks fake but feels real, while cgi yoda looks real but feels fake. it think it must be because puppet yoda was mostly the creation of a single artist, allowing his talent and personality to shine through, while cgi yoda was a product that was sort of manufactured by a large team. a lot of people say empire was as good as it was because people other than george lucas played such a big role in making it. but noticing the weaknesses in empire really only emphasizes how great a job lucas did in star warswhich also emphasizes how poorly he did when it came to making the prequels.;17

100;MissSimonetta;"why is the empire strikes back (1980) such a beloved movie? star wars (1977) is more fun, but empire marks the point where the story gained more emotional depth and the matinee serial black-and-white morality of the original becomes less defined. howard hawks once said a great movie has a few great scenes and no bad ones. if that is the case, then empire is without doubt a great film, as one cannot find a bad scene in the bunch. as for great scenes, just take your pick: the battle on hoth, luke's training in dagobah, the x-wing rising from the swampy muck, lando's reluctant betrayal, han and leia's poignant farewell in the carbon chamber. undoubtedly, the most iconic moment in this film is the climactic confrontation between luke and darth vader, when our hero discovers his much-idealized father is a fallen jedi who has lost much of his conscience and humanity. though luke's reaction to this reveal is often mocked and even i cannot help but chuckle sometimes, i think it's entirely appropriate. hamill's big ""noooo"" is not forced or phony; the way his face contorts and his voice cracks makes it feel raw and heartbreaking. this is one of few films that gets better every time you watch it. it also makes me keenly aware how the series declined in quality afterward (return of the jedi is okay, but it feels a bit too derivative of the first and a bit too juvenile for an epic conclusion). out of all the sw films, this one is the closest to perfection.";7 August 2014;10;['beloved', 'fun', 'emotional', 'serial', 'black', 'white', 'original', 'great', 'few', 'great', 'bad', 'great', 'bad', 'great', 'wing', 'swampy', 'reluctant', 'poignant', 'iconic', 'climactic', 'much', 'appropriate', 'big', 'phony', 'raw', 'heartbreaking', 'few', 'well', 'aware', 'okay', 'derivative', 'first', 'juvenile', 'epic', 'close'];0.1761485042735042

107;davidmvining;"there are two main ways to follow up a genre film. the first was perfectly encapsulated by aliens in the ""bigger is better"" school. you expand the stakes, scale, and number of character to create a bigger, bolder experience. the second is to not go bigger, but to go deeper. the empire strikes back might be the best example of that way to go. the empire strikes back actually feels a good bit smaller in scale than the original star wars. the biggest battle happens at the beginning of the film, involving a patch of icy land, several large walking tanks, and about a dozen speeders. that is smaller than the couple of dozen fighters attacking a moon sized base that can destroy a planet. the movie never goes bigger than that. in fact, the scale of the conflict continuously gets smaller as the film goes on. at the beginning, the conflict is between the empire and the rebel alliance. it's got galactic consequences, that great battle on the planet of hoth. if the rebel alliance doesn't successfully get away, then the empire's return strike after the destruction of the death star will wipe out its last major adversary for control of the galaxy. the next major set piece is the chase of the millennium falcon through the asteroid field. it's now one ship versus a handful of fighters and a star destroyer and the uncaring nature of outer space. it's a chase in order to capture the handful of occupants on board so that darth vader can lure luke skywalker. the final conflict is between darth vader and luke skywalker. we're more than an hour since the rebel alliance has even been mentioned. the conflict involves only two people, not half a dozen. it's no longer about galactic consequences. instead it's about a father and son and a conflict of good versus evil. the fight of the film narrows, and the only reason it can pull that off is because of the characters. the original star wars utilized archetypes to tell its well-worn story. the empire strikes back moves beyond the familiar hero's journey, and in order to accomplish that it needs to move beyond archetypes. luke is no longer the farmboy hero. instead he's an arrogant war hero who thinks far too much of himself. han is no longer just the rogue, but a man with his own sense of right and wrong. leia is no longer just the princess in need of help, she can push back on han and control situations like she could only try to in the first. darth vader is no longer just the antagonist, he's now got a more complex goal of turning the hero to his side of the overall conflict. these characters are far more interesting in this second adventure than the first, and the story's structure of the second film is built to allow these characters to actually move through actions and change. the center and highlight really is luke. as i wrote a second ago, he's wildly arrogant at the start of this film. he goes out to check out a meteorite on his own and escapes from the clutches of a giant snow beast without help from anyone else. he also leads the successful feint against the incoming empire attack on the rebel base on hoth, providing enough time for the transports to get away free and destroying a few of the at-ats as well. when he's sent to dagobah to find obi-wan's former master, yoda, he thinks that he's beyond humility. he doesn't need it. he's awesome. but from the moment he lands on dagobah, he fails at everything he does through the rest of the film. the capstone of his training is when he walks into the cave and fails to use the force in the ways that yoda had dictated, fighting the phantom version of darth vader and revealing that he had only defeated himself in the fight. he fails to raise his x-wing from the swamp. he fails to maintain control of his emotions when visions of han and leia suffering come to him. he fails to listen to leia's explicit warnings of a trap. he fails in his fight against darth vader, only escaping through a desperate act of falling down a giant hole. his constant stream of failures, capped by his failed confrontation with darth vader, humbles luke. he no longer feels like he can face the evils of the universe alone. dangling from the underbelly of cloud city with only one hand, he calls out to leia, desperate for any help. even in the final moments of the film, he stands with his friends, not apart, and has become part of a plan to help the captured han instead of running out there alone. luke's journey in this film is fantastic all the more because it undermines the hero's journey he went through in the first. it goes against the idea of how we think hero's behave and succeed after their great victories. it's the character work that really makes the film work, but the movie continues the first film's proud tradition of great design. there are expansions of the world in things like the super star destroyer and the walking tanks the at-ats. yoda is a creature come alive with puppetry. the fighters, the planets, and creatures are all great. the special effects move the technology of the first film forward, and it's always in the service of the great story and character journeys at the heart of the film. acting takes another step up as well. moving directing duties from ""faster, more intense"" george lucas to irvin kershner was a surprisingly good choice overall, but it makes sense once you realize that the empire strike back is more character film than science fiction adventure. the empire strikes back is a magnificent sequel that takes the characters from the preceding adventure seriously and gives them space to grow, propelling them through an adventure that truly tests them. it very rightly stands atop the world of genre fiction as one of the its greatest accomplishments.";12 December 2019;10;['main', 'first', 'big', 'well', 'big', 'bolder', 'second', 'big', 'good', 'good', 'small', 'original', 'big', 'icy', 'several', 'large', 'small',

""empire strikes back"" is thus a richer film than ""star wars"" emotionally, and in other ways, too. instead of confining most of the action to the desert planet tatoonie, the action bounces around from an ice planet to a swamp planet to the most marvelous creation of all, a city hovering high in the clouds of a gas giant, where the action culminates. lucas adds some interesting new characters, particularly yoda, the swamp creature luke goes to for help, who articulates much of the philosophy and provides much of the fun in this film as voiced by frank oz, the guy behind (or under) miss piggy and later, a talented director in his own right. there's also billy dee williams as lando calrissian, the operator of cloud city who provides much of the needed moral shading in the film as the stars from the previous movie are all full-blown heroes now. williams has fun schmoozing up leia and trying to find his feet as his slick machinations leave him in ever-hotter water. the best performance in this film is mark hamill's as luke. hamill had to work harder here than he did in ""star wars,"" sharing all his big scenes with a muppet and a guy with a bucket on his head. but hamill finds the essence of a character more interesting than the naive farmboy we saw in the first film, playing luke as confused, fearful, impetuous, and flawed in a way that makes him more likable, rather than less so. how hamill never hit it big after his great work here is an injustice on par with cleavon little's lack of work after ""blazing saddles."" what else about this is great? the score by john williams, introducing the recognizable ""imperial march"" theme music as well as some rousing material during the final confrontation between luke and darth. the interaction between vader and his subordinates is chokingly funny, in a way that only adds to the suspense and dread. the opening battle around the ice planet is marvelously intense, especially as witnessed from the cockpits of rebel fighters taking on thickly-armored imperial walkers. the returning cast except for hamill doesn't seem as sharp this time, especially carrie fisher's princess leia, so charming in ""star wars,"" gaunt and miserable here. much of the whole middle section of the film is draggy and woolly, like the various silly ways the millennium falcon escapes imperial pursuit and the scene in the ""cave"" that goes on much longer than it should. even luke's scenes with yoda become slow and tedious with multiple viewings. the enthusiasm that makes ""empire strikes back"" so beloved today is understandable. it turned ""star wars"" from a great film into an enjoyable franchise. but it doesn't really have the same stand-alone quality ""star wars"" has, needing both that earlier film and the later ""return of the jedi"" to make it as great as it is.";23 August 2005;8;['young', 'rebel', 'responsible', 'imperial', 'desolate', 'faultfinding', 'green', 'only', 'middle', 'discordant', 'previous', 'joyous', 'dark', 'original', 'only', 'first', 'safe', 'major', 'first', 'happy', 'emotional', 'rich', 'other', 'most', 'swamp', 'marvelous', 'interesting', 'new', 'swamp', 'much', 'much', 'talented', 'own', 'much', 'moral', 'previous', 'slick', 'good', 'big', 'interesting', 'naive', 'first', 'confused', 'fearful', 'impetuous', 'likable', 'big', 'great', 'little', 'great', 'recognizable', 'imperial', 'final', 'funny', 'intense', 'rebel', 'armored', 'imperial', 'sharp', 'charming', 'miserable', 'much', 'whole', 'middle', 'draggy', 'various', 'silly', 'imperial', 'long', 'slow', 'tedious', 'multiple', 'beloved', 'understandable', 'great', 'enjoyable', 'same', 'early', 'later', 'great'];0.151300505050505
110;dworldeater;empire strikes back has long been my favorite in the original trilogy. i remember going to see this when this was released theatrically as a little kid with my grandma. empire is one of the rare cases where the sequel blows away the original. creator george lucas got some very good help in making this with writer lawrence kasdan and hiring a director that actually knows what he was doing, irvin kershner. with outsourcing some good help, this collaboration turned out to being a winning team to bring (and improve upon) george lucas's vision. the film looks incredible to this day and the groundbreaking special effects from the 1st film are improved upon and look better here. the story in this installment is darker(and better suited to my tastes), but is also stronger and better as a whole. the characters are better fleshed out then the original film, the chemistry between the actors and performance are also much better. not only is empire strikes back the best in the series, but i also would argue that it's the foundation on which the franchise continued to explode and why it holds up today.;11 December 2020;9;['favorite', 'original', 'little', 'rare', 'original', 'good', 'good', 'incredible', 'groundbreaking', 'special', 'suited', 'strong', 'well', 'original', 'well', 'good'];0.4606646825396825
111;gcd70;"episode v in the ""star wars"" trilogy will always be remembered as the film that introduced a serious plot line to proceedings. after the rebels' success in episode iv, the empire chased them throughout the galaxy, finally confronting them on the ice world of hoth. the group escapes and luke goes to train as a jedi under yoda. lando calrissian betrays them to lord vader, and the evil master of the dark side has a startling revelation for luke. captain solo is sold to boba fett who takes him to jabba the hutt. all of this leaves us hanging for episode vi. though thick on storyline, and revered by critics, it was probably the least entertaining for the kiddies with its meandering middle and sparse action. the at-at imperial walkers and the millennium falcon's flight through the asteroid field are the definite highlights. again the technical wizardry of lucas team shines, with the digitally improved sound and visual effects being a must. stop-motion animation, used during the 'walker' scenes, is particularly impressive. john wiliams has again provided a masterful score. in truth all ""the empire strikes back"" really does is provide the link between the first and final battles involving the alliance and the empire, but it does so admirably, and it must be said that the second of the three ""star wars"" films is probably the best. saturday, april 27, 1997 - hoyts cinema centre";6 June 2008;7;['serious', 'evil', 'dark', 'startling', 'thick', 'entertaining', 'sparse', 'imperial', 'definite', 'technical', 'lucas', 'visual', 'impressive', 'masterful', 'first', 'final', 'good'];0.0833333333333333
112;Agent10;until episode ii comes out, this will rank as the best in the series. not only are we introduced to yoda, we're introduced to a darker side of the series, a film that doesn't feel like it is a part of the group collective. i think this is why so many fans regard this as the better film. this movie also gave us one of the best sword fights in the history of cinema, culminating in a climax that seemed improbable at first, but quickly made a lot of sense. this was easily lucas' most witty edition to the series, and it tends to stand up better than most would think.;30 April 2002;10;['good', 'dark', 'many', 'well', 'good', 'improbable', 'witty', 'most'];0.4583333333333333

114;ShootingShark;"the star wars saga continues as the rebel heroes are forced to flee their new base on the ice planet of hoth; luke skywalker travels to the swamp world of dagobah to learn from jedi master yoda, whilst han solo and princess leia flee from imperial pursuers to the cloud city of bespin. the three are ultimately reunited, but with terrible consequences ... the sequel to george lucas' star wars is that extremely rare thing - a sequel that is better than the original movie. having created the fantastic universe and the cast of comic-book heroes in the first film, this movie is free to develop the characters, drama, humour and wildly imaginative worlds. it has a truly fantastic script (by lawrence kasdan and veteran screenwriter leigh brackett, from a story by lucas) with an almost unique structure - there's no beginning, no ending and the story splits in two at the end of the third reel and then reunifies for the last two reels. it also redefines the use of special effects again, expanding on the eye-popping visuals of star wars with a breathtaking variety of dazzling shots. the opening battle sequence on hoth (shot in finse in norway) is fabulous, with walking robot monsters pounding across glaciers to the strains of john williams cracking score (his imperial march theme is perhaps the most memorable of all his star wars music). the intimate scenes of luke's jedi training are just wonderful - yoda is perfectly realised by puppeteer oz - and the quasi-philosophy of the force, brilliantly captured in a scene where yoda rescues luke's ship from the swamps, is profoundly moving. equally stunning is the characterisation of darth vader, arguably the greatest screen villain of all time (and with the biggest, baddest killer spaceship ever); there is a fantastic moment where he uses his mind-control powers to invisibly throttle an incompetent general whilst simultaneously barking orders to another !! his unforgettable voice, supplied by the incomparable (and shockingly uncredited) jones is one of the movie's great assets. the cast are uniformly terrific, throwing themselves into character with abandon - i particularly like hamill's anguished heroism, williams as the suave but slippery lando calrissian, and colley as the twitchy captain/admiral piett. the movie features brilliant production design by norman reynolds and photography by peter suschitzsky, but is simply top-notch in every aspect. an astonishingly brilliant sequel to one of the greatest movies ever made. this review is of the 1997 re-release, featuring some new effects shots (most notably in the scenes on bespin) and a re-recorded version of a crucial scene with the emperor, here played by an uncredited ian mcdiarmid (he was originally played by clive revill).";22 May 2005;8;['rebel', 'new', 'swamp', 'imperial', 'terrible', 'rare', 'well', 'original', 'fantastic', 'comic', 'first', 'free', 'imaginative', 'fantastic', 'leigh', 'unique', 'third', 'last', 'special', 'breathtaking', 'fabulous', 'imperial', 'memorable', 'intimate', 'wonderful', 'stunning', 'great', 'big', 'badd', 'fantastic', 'incompetent', 'unforgettable', 'incomparable', 'uncredited', 'great', 'terrific', 'anguished', 'slippery', 'twitchy', 'brilliant', 'top', 'brilliant', 'great', 'new', 're', 'recorded', 'crucial', 'uncredited', 'clive'];0.3685255920550039

119;Spleen;"'it avoids having the standard shoot-'em-up ending,' says a friend of mine, 'by not having an ending.' i suppose this is what most people think, but all the same the film manages to form a satisfying whole; or at least, a whole that satisfies me. i'm therefore inclined to think it does have an ending. obviously, i can't discuss this without giving things away to those few who don't know what happens. if you're one of those few, then believe me: your ignorance is precious enough to be worth guarding until you see the film. stop reading now. after the surprise attack on the rebel base, luke skywalker splits with han, leia, et al. han's party gets away first (is it just me, or is the shot of luke watching the falcon flying off while he stands stranded on the ground, a poignant one?), but thereafter they face one narrow escape after another, while luke slinks off quietly and safely to train with yoda. the training scenes are many and yoda talks a great deal of rubbish. but somehow it doesn't matter. the film is ambivalent in its attitude towards yoda, anyway. our sympathy clearly lies with the entirely non-spiritual concerns of han, leia and the adolescent luke. the main story concerns the understanding that builds between han and leia. in the end they are honest with one another; and if han's being frozen and shipped back to tatooine is the price to pay for this, well, it's the price to pay. it was very important not to end with the dashing rescue that opens 'return of the jedi', which would be dramatically beside the point. instead we end with the promise that the rescue will some day occur. that's enough. as for luke: he abandons yoda to rescue han and leia, and achieves nothing whatever. this was my favourite touch. all five jedis - luke, obi-wan, yoda, vader, and the emperor - find that their conflicting instincts are all entirely wrong. the film is really about the temporary triumph of human impulses over the mystical force. luke's human idealism is vindicated, but his supernatural powers, just this once, are not. when george lucas gave his star wars trilogy a fresh coat of varnish in 1997 he felt he had to justify the expense by making needless changes. you'll notice he made precious few changes to episode v. there just wasn't room. he added a few extra shots of the ice monster, which of course weakened that one scene; but even with those changes in place the special edition is virtually identical to the original edition. since lucas was so keen on making changes wherever he could this is obviously a tribute to the tightness of the story and the direction. it's also a tribute to the perfection of the original special effects, more innovative than the effects in the first star wars movie and better than the effects in any subsequent one.";26 October 1999;10;['standard', 'most', 'same', 'least', 'inclined', 'few', 'few', 'precious', 'worth', 'rebel', 'poignant', 'narrow', 'many', 'great', 'ambivalent', 'non', 'spiritual', 'adolescent', 'main', 'honest', 'frozen', 'important', 'enough', 'favourite', 'conflicting', 'wrong', 'temporary', 'human', 'mystical', 'human', 'supernatural', 'fresh', 'needless', 'precious', 'few', 'few', 'extra', 'special', 'identical', 'original', 'keen', 'original', 'special', 'innovative', 'first', 'well', 'subsequent'];0.1366946778711484

129;Lady_Targaryen;''star wars: episode v - the empire strikes back '' is my favorite one from all the star war series. things are getting more and more complicated for the rebels.spite of the fact that the death star was destroyed, the imperial troops had success expelling the rebels from their secret base, and now they are being hunted in all galaxy. the new secret base is localized in hoth, a very cold world even for the native animals. darth vader wants to find luke at any cost, and now he sent many remote probes to find him in all space. luke is attacked by a big animal and almost dies, by stays lost in the ice. he sees the ghost of obi wan kenobi talking with him, and he says that luke needs to go to a system called dangoba, where yoda will teach and explain to him all the steps to become a jedi. han solo goes after luke and they both are saved by their rebel team. the system hoth is discovered by the empire(since it should not have any human form living in there) and consequently the rebel base. darth vader decides to attack the rebels by the surface,and the rebels really stay in disadvantage. han,leia,c3po and chewbacca escapes from hoth,but after many attacks from the imperial troops and even asteroids fields, they arrive in the cloud city that lando,an old friend of han,rules. luke goes with r2 to dangoba,and there he finds yoda. the problem is, yoda does not want to teach him how to become a jedi,since he finds luke extremely impatient, old to be trained and also with many anger inside of him,like his father anakin. obi wan tries to change yoda's mind, but only when luke promises to really gives his best that yoda accepts the challenge. the emperor talks to vader about a disturbance in the force that comes from luke skywalker. he finally says that luke is son of anakin and that luke should never be trained as a jedi,because of the risk in destroying the siths,that are very high. but vader has other plans: he always imagined that his offspring died when padme died, and now he thinks about making luke a sith,to they both rule the galaxy together and also kill the emperor. in the city of the clouds, lando betrays han and gives them all to vader.it's all a trap to take luke that vader did, and while he tortures han, lukes see the vision of his friends suffering,and gave up his training. yoda alerts him that the risk of turning to the dark side is high, and that he should not stop his training, but luke is so worried with his friends that he cannot think about anything else. vader call the award hunters and boba fett(the clone of jango fett,remember?)is the one who takes han solo to jabba,to win a big prize. we are now in a risky situation, where lukes needs to confront his dad without be tainted to the dark side, and someone needs to help han,chewbacca,leia and c3po. ps: *in this movie we can see the first demonstrations that leia and han likes each other,and when leia wants to let han with jealous and kisses luke is kind of a funny moment. another nice moment with leia, is when we see the connection between her and luke, when he has his hand cut and is in a dangerous situation after fighting with vader. *i really like the big imperial robots called 'walkers': i think they are one of the most impressive artilleries the empire has.;2 February 2006;10;['favorite', 'more', 'complicated', 'imperial', 'secret', 'new', 'secret', 'cold', 'native', 'many', 'remote', 'big', 'rebel', 'human', 'rebel', 'many', 'imperial', 'old', 'impatient', 'old', 'many', 'good', 'high', 'other', 'dark', 'high', 'worried', 'big', 'risky', 'dark', 'first', 'other', 'jealous', 'funny', 'nice', 'dangerous', 'big', 'imperial', 'impressive'];0.0868787878787878

135;Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187;"***spoiler warning*** the empire strikes back came out three years after the original star wars and six years after the godfather: part ii, the sequel that changed movie sequels forever; and empire was a follow-up for the ages. this film showed that the star wars universe was a cinematic world that had real grit and 'teeth' to it: even after the triumphant ending in the previous movie this one is defined by the empire relentlessly pursuing the rebellion in the wake of the death star's destruction during the battle of yavin 4, and it shows that 'fairy-tale endings' always have a deeper aftermath to them than you think and that hard-won battles need to keep going if the enemy is to falter. the empire strikes back is the sequel that came to be the golden standard for movie sequels; without it there'd be no necessary sequels that are thought out for narratively creative reasons as opposed to monetary reasons. this film also proved to be quite the shocker when it came out in 1980: we finally found out what happened to luke's father, and he wasn't killed by darth vader; he became darth vader himself. this soon became the greatest cinematic plot-twist of all-time, and forty years on it's still a hard one to top (if not outright impossible). it was star wars' equivalent of citizen kane's 'rosebud' moment and both those twists are still great narrative pillars for filmmakers to get inspiration from today. star wars is inseparable from cinema itself: it's become a legacy of a franchise that came from george lucas' desire to pay homage to the flash gordon serials from the 30s, and just like cinema itself people still actively discuss the series and medium to this day in ways that people dissect philosophy and religion to their heart's content. it's fun to look deeper into the things we love, and it's life-changing when you find newfound wisdom to make your mind and will stronger in life. cinema may not be the same as it was decades ago (neither is star wars), but there's still plenty of new changes that show old and new techniques can become harmonious with one another: technology is not substitute for hard-earned storytelling or wisdom, but progress can help expand one's understanding of what they couldn't comprehend before. the empire strikes back is one of cinema's all-time titans, and this is what sequels dream to become: an immortal experience that's set a bar so high it takes something truly incredible to surpass it (whoever may dare try to do so that is). 5/5 stars.";4 January 2020;10;['original', 'cinematic', 'real', 'previous', 'deep', 'golden', 'necessary', 'creative', 'monetary', 'great', 'cinematic', 'hard', 'outright', 'impossible', 'great', 'narrative', 'inseparable', 'deep', 'newfound', 'strong', 'same', 'new', 'old', 'new', 'harmonious', 'substitute', 'immortal', 'incredible'];0.1722488038277511

138;dunmore_ego;"a better movie than its predecessor (and successors) in every way acting, story, direction, set design, writing, and a vastly more mature interrelationship between the love triangle of luke skywalker, han solo and c-3po (i know what you're thinking, what about the triangle of princess leia organa, han solo and chewbacca?) funnier (solo is a scream), flirtier (sexual tension between leia and solo is almost as strong as that between luke and yoda), flamier (uh, c-3po), *the empire strikes back* is the most ""complete"" of any *star wars* effort, even though it is the only movie in the series with a beginning and a middle but no end! full credit to the film-makers for the decision to complete the third act *in the next movie!* (i don't perfunctorily credit hack director-writer george lucas with this decision; about the most credit i'd give him after his atrocious track record of dumb-movies-that-look-slick is creating forward momentum for projects, ensuring they get green lighted, and creating alien names which would be stupid if they weren't so funny.) *episode v* finds the rebel alliance on the ice planet hoth, for no reason other than to flex efx muscle in the form of stop-motion imperial ""at-at walkers"" probably the most poorly designed attack vehicles in the history of warfare. supposedly ""all terrain armored transport"" vehicles, yet resembling sick indricotheriums, these lumbering behemoths move at the pace of a man running through snow an attack speed of about 5 mph - with 4 guns covering only their anterior plane, leaving everywhere else completely exposed to assault from any enemy craft that can travel faster than the average tortoise; a strategic aspect which the rebels either ignore or are too dumb to exploit, as they fly in hell-tilt from the front, instead of attacking from the rear, where the at-at union wouldn't pay to put gunners probably due to new worker compensation laws pertaining to getting what you deserve if you ride in a horse's ass. george's smart move in ""empire"" was to hire a real director - irvin kershner (one of lucas' teachers in film school). so even while the strategic lunacy of the at-at walkers reeks of george's padawan paw prints, the film's other opening sequences compellingly show off the emotional ties between the love-hexagon of han, luke, leia, chewbacca and the 'droids, c-3po and r2-d2. luke has flown to dagobah where he is accosted by yoda: jedi master of 900 years and fozzy bear for the last four (a small green muppet that frank oz operates and voices), who teaches luke handstands so that if he fails jedi school, he could fall back on cirque du soleil. yoda's presence in this film counterpoints the frantic situations of the other characters. amidst the furor of star wars, here was the jesus character endorsing peace, tranquility, balance; a far cry from the scrapping avenger that yoda would be turned into in the prequel trilogy, becoming more unbalanced with every episode and by *episode iii*, light-sabering the emperor with nary a thought about peaceable options, let alone knocking over kajillion dollar lamps and quinzullion dollar opera boxes. in creating the prequel trilogy, poor little yoda was lost forever... yet maybe the seeds of yoda's (and by association, humanity's) downfall are sown in this episode: why study to be a jedi knight, a keeper of ""peace,"" by learning how to *battle*? if the force informs all things and if the jedi have tapped into that force with their mind powers, why wield light-sabers at all? approach anyone with a light saber dangling from your belt and that sends a pretty clear message in the *opposite* direction. as yoda tells it, he has been pimping jedi knights into the galaxy under the pretense of religious harmony for nearly a millennium. any wonder the empire is so fubar? the grand encounter between luke skywalker and darth vader in *empire* is arguably the crux of the *star wars* saga. it doesn't get more pertinent, more urgent, more compelling. it is not so much the fencing we've seen better; it is about coming-of-age, ready or not; it is the eternal struggle between fathers and sons, mentors and menials; it is the passing of the torch; it is facing up to facing down fear; it is the dark warring with the light in each of us and realizing that sometimes dark is better; a thematic juggernaut that spans eons and topples kingdoms. *star wars* is crystallized in these moments, featuring one of the greatest revelations in motion picture history, and also probably one of the most misquoted lines since, ""play it again, sam."" vader does *not* say, ""luke, i am your father,"" but rather, in answer to luke screaming, ""you killed my father!,"" vader thooms, ""no! *i* am your father!"" it still sends chills up my spine. but let's face it we were glad it was vader, weren't we? better than that killjoy, kenobi, or that self-righteous prig, yoda. we all wish vader were *our* father yes, take me to rule the galaxy, collecting tithes and tributes and slave girls; teach me the ways of big, black, smooth and cool like your bad self! there is such magnetic resonance in the figure of vader beseeching his son, that even though he had already been elevated to the pantheon of great screen villains, yet we are caressed by his sincerity in being a sympathetic ruler and longing to reunite his family or is that just the dark side drawing us in? the series would never again scale these lofty heights of grand dramatic slam. *the empire strikes back*, brimming with hilarity, humanity and paternity, is the best of the *star wars* series. and that's not just our imagination.

""the empire strikes back"" take place after the destruction of the death star. the galactic empire's command is now mainly controlled by the tremendously fearsome darth vader, who is vigorously hunting young luke skywalker (mark hamill) who is one of the leaders of the rebellion. after a battle with the empire, luke and his friends are separated. while han solo and the others try to dodge vader's pursuit, luke lands on a mysterious planet where a little creature named yoda (voiced by frank oz) teaches him the ways of the jedi. there is not a single weak element to ""the empire strikes back."" but i think so many people miss out on what makes the picture so enthralling and wonderful. everybody mentions the special effects and yes they are revolutionary and spectacular, but the skill and persuasiveness of the special effects is just two dimensions of their success. the third and most powerful dimension is the fact that they are used with imagination. special effects are just a package order in hollywood. but using imagination behind them cannot be bought and paid for, it takes the genius that these filmmakers possess. and the special effects are used to create a world. just for example, the ice world of hoth where the beginning takes place. it's not just that we see a big icy world that looks like a frozen planet, but that we see creatures and ecosystems. this is a world. not a set. the costumes used for chewbacca and c-3po and the comical r2-d2 are effective as the models for spaceships, but the most astonishing effect is yoda, who is nothing more than an animatronic creature controlled and voiced by frank oz, who expresses every emotion that a human actor can through his face and eyes and this puppet yoda has more emotion than the cgi one that was found in the prequel trilogy. but what i admire most about this picture is the dark, moody atmosphere, which is quite rare for a science-fiction picture. typically, the atmosphere is cheery or lighthearted, as in the first movie, but ""the empire strikes back"" is darker, most nihilistic, mysterious, and somber. it's a violent picture. kills and betrayals are not felt as moves in a chess game. the characters are three-dimensional, especially han solo and darth vader, who before was just a strong supporting presence, but here has evolved into one of the screen's most chilling villains. before he mostly just stood around and hissed through his voice machine, now he really dominates the screen and drops our jaws. comparing the theatrical version to george lucas's updated version, which includes an extended scene of the yeti-like monster that attacks luke early in the picture, both are equal in their majesty. which is better? hard to say, but it's close. so if a person came up to me and asked me ""which version should i see?"" i'd answer, ""take your pick. you'll have the time of your life.""";10 February 2010;10;['theatrical', 'first', 'same', 'mixed', 'ultimate', 'marginal', 'theatrical', 'second', 'unanimous', 'good', 'bold', 'imaginative', 'daring', 'young', 'special', 'first', 'superb', 'memorable', 'smart', 'true', 'mysterious', 'alien', 'cheerful', 'like', 'first', 'fearsome', 'young', 'mysterious', 'little', 'single', 'weak', 'many', 'enthralling', 'wonderful', 'special', 'revolutionary', 'spectacular', 'special', 'third', 'powerful', 'special', 'special', 'big', 'icy', 'frozen', 'comical', 'effective', 'astonishing', 'more', 'animatronic', 'human', 'more', 'prequel', 'dark', 'moody', 'rare', 'cheery', 'first', 'dark', 'nihilistic', 'mysterious', 'somber', 'violent', 'dimensional', 'strong', 'chilling', 'theatrical', 'extended', 'like', 'equal', 'well', 'close'];0.2024581128747794
142;baumer;"empire is a soap opera. it is a season finale that leaves you hanging for three years until the next one comes out ( fortunately for us that was 19 years ago and they are all out on video now ). and it is one of those movies that does something wonderful, it makes you feel something. it grabs a hold of your emotions and twists your insides like a pretzel. i rented this movie last night because just recently my own copy of it was stolen. and let me tell you, the film still left me exhilarated, exhausted, full of hope, excited and yearning to watch return of the jedi so i can see how han gets rescued and i so badly wanted to see luke and darth square off in that final battle. but the one thing that this movie does perhaps like no movie has ever done is makes your heart stop.

144;fernandoschiavi;"after the resounding success of a new hope, george lucas became one of the most admired filmmakers and most successful film industry. as the director got the profits from the previous film, he was brave and put much of the money earned in the 1977 film, the production of the empire strikes back. and here he was able to make an even better job. amplifying all we had shown earlier and presenting new facts of great importance for the entire series of films in cinema, the empire strikes back, even without a beginning and an end, is regarded by most fans as the best of all movies. being the second film released and the fifth in chronological order, as george lucas was the executive producer to focus better and have full control of the plot, and gave the synopsis for the screenwriters leigh brackett and lawrence kasdan could develop the plot. to not get overwhelmed, as before, lucas entrusted the direction of the long irvin kershner, who happily held a job and raised even more irreproachable quality of the saga, confirming its success. it is a critical period for the rebel forces. the adventure continues in this ""star wars"" sequel. luke skywalker (mark hamill), han solo (harrison ford), princess leia (carrie fisher) and chewbacca (peter mayhew) face attack by the imperial forces and its at-at walkers on the ice planet hoth. while han and leia escape in the millennium falcon, luke travels to dagobah in search of yoda. only with the jedi master's help will luke survive when the dark side of the force beckons him into the ultimate duel with darth vader (david prowse). mark hamill returns to play luke skywalker and continues to play well the hero challenging, courageous and with enormous potential for the ""force"". the actor shows the determination of the young man trying to become a jedi, and seeks to defend his friends from the evil forces at any cost. curious fact is that due to a serious accident of the actor just before the start of filming, which meant that he spent several surgeries and his face stayed a little different, george lucas had to modify the beginning of the story, making luke was attacked by a monster and had his face disfigured and rebuilt plastically. harrison ford back as han solo. between the first and this second film, ford has also been involved in classic praised apocalypse now (1979) master francis ford coppola. carrie fisher also back as princess leia organa and earns a highlight even greater following. she empathizes with ford, despite not knowing if you really want to be with han or luke. the cast is so mingled that the chemistry of the actress works well with both. peter mayhew as chewbacca, anthony daniels as c-3po, kenny baker as r2-d2 also return. who appears well is billy dee williams as lando calrissian. your participation and where you live is fundamental to the conduct of the climax of the plot. the merchant of gas that can be seen at first glance, as a traitor to our protagonists, shows the course of the plot, that their participation is much more thorough. david prowse with the body and james earl jones as darth vader voice still leaving threatening. his cruelty appears, for example, when you kill without hesitation a commander who failed a mission. we also see the emperor cos palpatine (voiced by clive revill), which dictates the rules for darth vader and clarifies its importance only because the villain fear him. no wonder that this is regarded as the main movie of the saga. is it that important and memorable events that generate consequences in this and the other films occur. without ""the empire strikes back"", we can say that the series would not have the same impact today in the minds of moviegoers. among the main events is the fact that it was here that we hear so famous and world renowned imperial march, darth vader is also seen as the authentic ruthless villain and not just as the commander of the imperial troops, the dear master yoda first appears emerging in more depth in philosophy jedi when he starts training luke to have mastery of the ""force"" and not be susceptible to its ""dark side."" appointed as an extremely powerful in the previous film, we were surprised to see an old, softly speaking in funny rhymes and appears harmless but hides within itself a fascinating inner peace. seeing him not imagine how powerful it is, but anyone who has seen the scanned version of yoda in ""attack of the clones"" and ""revenge of the sith"" knows what he is capable; see the progress of the relationship and solo read, which at first was full of taunts with not wanting to reveal what they felt for each other and then at a crucial moment for him, end up revealing their feelings for one another, a kiss in the next episode would be revealed as ""incestuous""; see the tanks at-at. also arise boba fett and lando calrissian, is the first lightsaber showdown between luke and darth vader, and still have the bombshell revelation that would shake the foundations of science fiction, narrowing the list of enemies and then would have a decisive role in the final episode vi. george lucas and his creative team, do not fall into temptation to sin by exaggeration and knew dosing masterfully adventure, action, romance, and science fiction. in the scenarios, the art direction of the trio leslie dilley, harry lange and alan tomkins, nominated for an oscar for the work along with photography peter suschitzky worked precisely with a much wider variation of environments. if at first were introduced to the desert climate and abandonment of tatooine, beyond the city, here george lucas presents us with glaciers on the planet hoth, meteor shower, the huge and well developed where lando calrissian and his people live in the city the clouds, and swampy and gloomy planet dagobah where yoda. without doubt, the new scenarios and photography from white snow to the darker tones of the final climax in cloud city and vader's ship, beyond the synopsis of the story itself that keeps the bad guys winning almost all the time, made this the darkest film of the series. here, as the title suggests, nothing was easy for the rebels. the special effects are even better than the first film. at the battle of hoth, for example, when the at-at appears, leave the audience puzzled. animated in stop-motion with false (which never sounds fake) leave early in the film the feeling that we were facing a great movie. following the persecution of the millennium by the rain among asteroid, is very well done. the sequences in cloud city, including the final climax, are tense, exciting and full of adrenaline. there are still scenes in the nave of darth vader and exciting and revealing fight between the villain and luke. the battles are well choreographed and more realistic than before. the issue remains the same language for the entire series. paul hirsch and marcia lucas work giving an impressive agility and speed to chase scenes and the ships and the fight scenes especially. the transitions that give an atmosphere fades over tv series remains. john williams returns once again in the composition of the soundtrack, so keeping track of signs and worshiped still presenting the imperial march with several clever variations during the long. again the track is in perfect harmony with the sound, every sound working independently without ever seeming contrived. no wonder that the sound along with the special effects have taken the oscar deserved. the direction of irvin keshner takes us inside asteroids and planets around with incredible realism. besides these scenes are worthy of applause battle on hoth with at-ats and all sequences of intense action of this battle, the escape of the millenium by asteroids, and the fight scenes and character development. specially the scene of the great revelation of darth vader to luke is highly valued by management. after an intense lightsaber duel, the two characters on the edge of an abyss, discuss until vader, filmed from the ground up to enhance the feeling of power, says the famous phrase, leaving luke and all the spectators in shock. the close in the face of luke is also striking. it is curious to see, looking at all the movies, the perfect symmetry created by george lucas from ""the empire strikes back"" and ""attack of the clones,"" in the two secondary reinforces the narrative construction of the personality of the main hero (luke in training ""empire"", and the dating of anakin in ""clones""), and a fantastic scene including a dueling saber light-end. not to mention the most important: a hand severed works representing the change in the two films. darker, more creative and more balanced than the previous, irvin keshner george lucas and surprise the viewer and further expands the saga idolatry, leaving everyone looking forward to the last episode of the saga, concluding all the points raised. a major landmark of science fiction, which only increased the number of followers of luke skywalker and his warring parties. it is, along with ""revenge of the sith"", a milestone in the franchise.";16 May 2020;9;['resounding', 'new',

145;film-critic;"hoth. yoda. cloud city. that moment when you realize family really does matter priceless. individually these words represent small facets of pop culture, making whatever the question is in trivial pursuit obviously ""star wars"", but when you put them together, in this order, the words ""empire strikes back"" will inevitably fall from your mouth. the second chapter (or fifth, however you count them) in lucas' grandiose space opera involves a frozen planet, a little green man, the force, family, and eventually a good old fashioned hand losing. (should i have put billy dee williams somewhere in there?) a personal favorite among the original three, i grapple with words because what can be said about this film that hasn't already been said dozens, even hundreds of times. this is a staple to my youth, a film series that i have seen over and over in no particular order. for this viewing, i went with the classic laserdisc edition which reminded me that no amount of special effect could change the heart of the story. what can be said? what should be said? in skywalker's famous words to yoda, ""i can give it a try"" we all know, by heart, what will follow next. ""the empire strikes back"" is the strongest chapter in the original trilogy for three reasons. the first is that we have three subsequent chapters, each dealing with a different world, in a different galaxy far, far away. lucas, in my eyes, has expanded his opera into more than just a desert planet, or a wooded terrain, or on a star that causes death; he grew and blossomed with this film. as audience members, we believe in each of the settings, we understand how cold it is on hoth, we can feel the moisture on degoba planet, and our fear of heights is prevalent in cloud city. lucas defines, travels, and leaves out no detail as he escapes with us through this expanding universe. moving onto a second note, this is a darker chapter. without repeating what so many others have said before, lucas challenges us to escape from scene after scene of battle (albeit he does put a small dusting in) and listen to the words that his characters are telling us. he places small easter eggs throughout that still gives us goose bumps as we watch (and understand), he hints towards the final chapter, but without really giving us the entire sandwich, just a sample. this smattering of the unknown, the final scenes where vader reveals his journal's secret to luke, the iconic nature of the slicing of the hand, all of this matches against any battle scene any science fiction director could create. lucas has always been criticized for his lack of character development in his six-part series, and with jar-jar i can understand, but he had hit his stride with what he wanted from his leads. i could see the spark between leia and han, the love between chewie and c3po, and yoda's oz like abilities when he explains to luke that the force lives in nature. lucas is telling us, giving us the chance to see that the final battle will be a line up between nature and machine get ready ewoks. finally, this film is the strongest because it is a victorious battle for the dark side of the force. very rarely do movie audiences walk out of a theater and feel as if hope has been crushed on the curb. each time i view this film, i get this child-like sensation that maybe, just maybe, vader and the emperor will crush this little rebel alliance in the final chapter and reign supreme forever. ""empire strikes back"" gives you that sense of possible dark side victory, with the call of the bounty hunters, the frozen carbonate, and the loss of skywalker's ambidextrous abilities. think of it this way, was the dark side really that evil, or did they just wear black and pursue those that were unwilling to follow the law? goth british police officers? in all honesty, ""empire strikes back"" could be re-watched at this moment. there are less big fight sequences than in ""return of the jedi"", and there are less moments of confusion and droid humor, ""empire"" stands on its own because it remains an elusive, dark chapter. our leads, those that we have given our hopes, hearts, and dreams to, have all been fooled, tricked, or captured, and it feels confined (like it is only the millennium falcon vs. an entire armada of star destroyers) in this middle chapter. you leave the theater wondering about that infamous ""who shot j.r.?"" moment, and a desire to see the force be victorious. to me, this middle chapter gave the dark side of the force an equal opportunity to make a case for itself; ""star wars"" is an equal opportunity employer. obviously, i loved this film. it has been a staple, like so many others, in my youth for years and further into my adulthood. i love these characters, these worlds, the unknown, and especially lucas' vision. despite the criticism of the ""new"" chapters, we will always have the original to go back to in any shape or form. without sounding repetitive, watch this series. introduce your children to this world(s), and allow them to grow up with the largest space opera created. spark their imagination, and you will not be disappointed. grade: ***** out of *****";18 March 2008;10;['priceless', 'small', 'trivial', 'second', 'grandiose', 'frozen', 'little', 'green', 'good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'personal', 'original', 'particular', 'special', 'famous', 'strong', 'original', 'first', 'subsequent', 'different', 'different', 'more', 'cold', 'prevalent', 'second', 'dark', 'many', 'small', 'small', 'easter', 'final', 'entire', 'unknown', 'final', 'iconic', 'final', 'ready', 'strong', 'victorious', 'dark', 'like', 'little', 'rebel', 'final', 'possible', 'dark', 'frozen', 'ambidextrous', 'dark', 'black', 'unwilling', 'goth', 'british', 'big', 'less', 'droid', 'own', 'elusive', 'dark', 'entire', 'middle', 'infamous', 'victorious', 'middle', 'dark', 'equal', 'equal', 'many', 'unknown', 'lucas', 'new', 'original', 'repetitive', 'large'];0.0708240035826242
146;gizmomogwai;"the empire strikes back is the first sequel to star wars (1977), a thrilling and lively action/adventure movie, but empire is actually a different kind of movie. it's darker, more thoughtful and slower. there's less action. at the end of the first one, which is confusingly called episode iv, luke had joined the rebellion against the evil galactic empire and had destroyed its most powerful weapon, the death star. with empire (aka episode v), the imperial forces pursue the rebels through space, and luke travels to a swampy world to learn from a jedi master named yoda. he receives visions from the future that his friends will get into trouble, and leaves his training, against the advice of yoda and the ghost of obi wan, to rescue them. luke confronts darth vader, who informs him that he is luke's father. for a movie about a war, this is pretty low on violence, with little action happening between the fight on the ice world and the climax where luke faces vader. that's because the empire strikes back tries to be a different kind of movie. it is not so much light entertainment. it instead features thoughts on the force, in scenes where yoda instructs luke, which basically means a discussion of the nature of good and evil. evil is strong and tempting, and anger leads to it; but goodness is stronger. the empire strikes back is thus a heavier work, though it's not exactly high art. still, one should not get the wrong impression from the afi lists counting episode iv but not episode v as one of the 100 greatest american movies. episode v is as good (or better!)- much of it, including yoda who is not in episode iv, is iconic. by the way, yoda is, from a special effects point of view, passable puppetry. what else can be said about this movie that hasn't already been said? it's got a score that has become legendary in its own right. the plot twist of vader being luke's father is also famous and weighty. altogether, an effective portrait of the struggle between good and evil.";21 October 2008;10;['first', 'thrilling', 'lively', 'different', 'dark', 'thoughtful', 'slow', 'less', 'first', 'evil', 'galactic', 'powerful', 'imperial', 'swampy', 'low', 'little', 'different', 'much', 'light', 'good', 'strong', 'tempting', 'strong', 'heavy', 'high', 'wrong', 'great', 'american', 'good', 'much', 'iconic', 'special', 'passable', 'legendary', 'own', 'famous', 'weighty', 'effective', 'good'];0.2276547619047619

148;gab-14712;"in 1977, a cultural revolution began with the little-known science-fiction film called star wars created by visionary director george lucas. it ended up being the highest-grossing film of all-time and it still ranks very high in the midst of today's blockbusters. it was a very enjoyable movie and it created memorable characters that will live on for eternity. so of course we would get a sequel. in fact, lucas created a whole world around his baby -an ambition that was not normal in 1980. with the sequel-the empire strikes back, lucas handed the directorial duties to his former college film professor irvin kershner because of his duties with his rising visual effects company industrial light and magic, but of course he was very involved with this film. but enough of the background, let's talk about this film. this sequel is much darker in tone, more mysterious, and quite frankly the best film in the franchise. our favorite characters like luke and leia skywalker and han solo are back and we are introduced to more characters that are stored away in our hearts forever such as yoda and lando calrissian. this is also the movie where we have the famous battle and reveal between luke and darth vaderor shall i say between father and son, but more on that later. after the rebels blow up the death star at the end of a new hope, they hide away in the icy planet of hoth. but the rebel base is soon discovered by darth vader (james earl jones and david prowse) and the empire. from the battle that ensues, our characters are separated. han solo (harrison ford), princess leia (carrie fisher), chewbacca (peter mayhew), and c-3po (anthony daniels) flee across the galaxy from the empire. they end up going into cloud city where they come across an old friend of han's- lando calrissian (billy dee williams). meanwhile, luke (mark hamill) and r2-d2 (kenny baker) are sent to the abandoned planet of dagobath where he continues his jedi training with an old jedi master named yoda (frank oz). but will they stay forgotten for long with darth vader relentlessly pursuing luke across the galaxy? one of the biggest improvements over the original film is the visuals. while the visuals in the 1977 film were good for its time period, george luca's new production company really improved upon the visuals. along with the visuals, the film has strong production design and character design. i loved the look of yoda, which was a puppet of course. you can tell the visuals were strong for a variety of reasons. there were the sights of the majestic imperial walkers during the battle of hoth, the hairy sloth creature that attacks luke after he gets lost on hoth, the creepy, dense look of dagobath, the spiral towers of cloud city, and of course that lightsaber battle between luke and vader. spoiler!! my highlight out of many of them is the revelation that happens near the end of the movie in cloud city. i am sure most of you have seen the movie but if not, read no further. darth vader reveals to luke during their intense duel that he is luke's father, anakin. of course in the process, vader chops of luke's hand and he falls through a chute but is saved from falling to his death thanks to the millennium falcon. also, the movie ends with han solo being captured by the empire and frozen solid. so these events are just some of the reasons why this film is darker and more sinister than the space opera feel of the first film. the acting remains a strong point in the movie. harrison ford is excellent as always. i loved his ""wounded ego"" attitude and his bantering with chewbacca added some lightheartedness to the movie. yoda is my favorite new character. not only did they want a realistic puppet, they actually wanted a good actor to bring that puppet to life. and frank oz did just that. mark hamill and carrie fisher remain excellent in their respective roles as luke and leia. and the voice of james earl jones? well, the same magic that it always created! need i say more? star wars: empire strikes back is my favorite star wars movie, and frankly one of the best sci-fi films of all time. it really expanded upon the mystery and the lore the first film provided. the film explores its mythology in darker tones and that added depth and humanity to our characters. lawrence kasdan's and leigh brackett's screenplay took lucas's world and created something that was evolutionary and breath-taking while staying true to its roots. the film ended on a sinister cliffhanger, so you bet we will be seeing a third film. the story and the visuals are fantastic, and now you can see why this is my favorite star wars film. my grade: a+ ""no, i am your father!"" (vader to luke) ""try not, do, or do not!""

150;hall895;one of the rare sequels which manages to surpass the original, the empire strikes back is an all-time classic. a much more personal tale, this film is really all about the journey of young luke skywalker. a new hope followed skywalker as he became involved in the rebellion against the galactic empire. here the rebellion is put on the back burner. this is less the story of a grand rebellion and more the story of one young man's growth as he continues to fulfill his destiny. we pick up with the rebels in hiding on a secret base on the remote ice world of hoth. all the familiar figures from last time around are here, including han solo, princess leia, chewbacca and the droids r2-d2 and c-3po. and luke skywalker is here as well and it is skywalker whom darth vader seems most interested in finding. last time out vader and the empire were simply interested in wiping out the mostly anonymous rebels. now, vader has taken a personal interest in young skywalker. the movie kicks into high gear as the empire locates the rebel base and a great battle ensues. the rebels are forced to flee their base and here our heroes go off in different directions. guided by the spirit of former mentor obi-wan kenobi (alec guinness in what is basically a cameo role) luke skywalker heads for the distant swampy planet of dagobah where he is to be trained by the old jedi master yoda. soon to be one of the most beloved characters in the series, yoda is a 900-year old, two feet tall, green alien creature. the performances of puppeteer frank oz as yoda and mark hamill as skywalker are crucial here. were the performances lacking audiences might have found it hard to believe these scenes where the young jedi trainee converses and interacts with the rather odd little creature. but hamill and oz pull it off well. on dagobah luke (and the audience) learn much about the force and the ways of the jedi. in the original film the only jedi we saw, obi-wan kenobi was a rather mysterious figure. now some light is shed on exactly who the jedi are and what is required to become one. while luke trains on dagobah, han solo and princess leia are sidetracked on their journey to meet up with the rest of the rebels. harrison ford is terrific again playing solo as he has the ultra-confident wiseguy role down pat. carrie fisher is again strong in the role of leia, who drops some of the pretense of the last film and begins to give in to her rather obvious feelings for the swashbuckling solo. eventually han and leia make their way to cloud city where we are introduced to another new character in the saga, han's old friend lando calrissian. han and leia don't quite trust lando and it soon becomes apparent that things in cloud city are not quite what they seem. sensing his friends are in danger luke skywalker leaves dagobah to attempt to rescue them. skywalker arrives in cloud city to meet his destiny. han, leia and the rest of the characters fade into the background as the climax, much as the entire film, will be all about luke skywalker. where the original star wars ended with an epic space battle, here everything leads up to a thrilling one-on-one showdown capped by one of the most jaw-dropping revelations ever seen in film. some will say the ending of the empire strikes back leaves the audience hanging. it is true there is not a clearly defined traditional ending as in the original film. but the ending here is powerful in its own way. it leaves you in great suspense, eagerly awaiting the inevitable conclusion to the saga. the film is not truly self-contained, it requires the knowledge of what has come before and the expectation of what will come after. it is by not going for the easy hollywood ending that the empire strikes back truly triumphs. taken on its own merits the empire strikes back can be said to even surpass the original star wars. the acting performances are again first-rate. yoda is a fascinating and thoroughly enjoyable new character. in playing lando calrissian, billy dee williams gives us someone well worth rooting for. or against, we're not quite sure. the john williams score, including the famed spine-chilling imperial march, is magnificent. the visuals are dazzling, as would be expected. and most importantly we have a truly great story. the empire strikes back, much more so than a new hope, is luke skywalker's movie. it is fascinating to watch his journey as he moves towards fulfilling his ultimate destiny.;27 May 2005;10;['rare', 'original', 'personal', 'young', 'new', 'involved',

151;sharky_55;"empire strikes back took everything that was revolutionary from star wars and improved it, and then some. it is deeper, more mature, and asks more questions of the world. r2d2 and chewbacca, who became lovable fan favourites from the moment they hit the screen in 1977, did so without speaking a single word, but here they are much more than just accessories to the plot. in their grunts and roars and beeps, they now became beacons of loyalty for our group. the iconic opening crawl speaks of the events in between the two films - a time skip has occurred and the rebels are in hiding. the strengths of the characterisations show us exactly what has happened in these months unseen; luke has become a respected fighter and commander, han a captain, and his bickering and romantic tension with leia only growing stronger (and which results in one of the most iconic confessions of love of all time). we see the bonds of friendship so much stronger in this sequel, and as chewie attempts to repair cp3o and carries him around like a backpack, we recognise this is as an emotion of universality. no wonder lucas used it again with luke and yoda. fox had placed little faith in the original, and the budget had been constricted, and lucas's vision mellowed. but after the immense popularity and success, esb was given full backing. the world of star wars was now even more fully realised. we had visited the deserts of tattoine, the aztec pyramids rebel bases amidst jungle territory, and now the icy planets of hoth, where an imperial assault is imminent. the battlefield was now much clearer and the greenscreen backdrops of the dogfight-style fighter pilots more detailed, more immersive - fellow rebel ground fighters, jets and imperial assault crews now milled around in the background, and live explosions proved to be more threatening than the multicoloured digital explosions in the black of space. there was real weight and fluidity in the way that the x-wings would speed in and out and under and over the at-ats, and the coverage now provided a greater and more epic scale of the action; see luke run around the legs and dangle from the elephant- like robotic beast, and how the millennium falcon weaves around an entirely three dimensional asteroid field and narrowly escapes from a gigantic space slug. we have more new developments. besides the stop-motion photography of the at-ats, which creates an oddly appropriate jerky walking motion, we also have the puppetry of the endearing tauntauns which amble about in the snow, and their models are amazingly detailed, head to claw in a thick frost-covered hair, a dragon-shaped head and curved horns. and there is the old jedi master yoda, whom i am conflicted on; at times it remains painfully obvious that he is a puppet, whose mouth does not correspond to the truths that he speaks, but they are great and important truths that become even more evident once luke encounters the foreshadowing of himself in a vader helmet. and of course the matte paintings are once again immaculate and beautifully detailed; in particular the landing platform on the edge of the cloud city, and the glorious bespin itself, bathed in the pink glow of the sunset and clouds. as the falcon soars away above the sunset, williams' cloud city orchestral theme is at its most stirring, and is the second most iconic in the soundtrack, right after (what else?) the imperial march. never has a trumpet fanfare been so menacing and so recognisable - also named darth vader's theme because the mere sighting of it signalled his presence and power. vader is photographed more ingeniously than in star wars (in brightly lit exteriors) and this enhances his terrifying persona; giving instructions from his own personal capsule, force-choking over the communications channel, emerging from icy mist in the freezing tunnels of hoth, slivers of light hitting his mask and creating a dark and shiny gleam, and in that climatic duel between father and son, both are silhouetted on the orange steps by the smoking vents, and the colours of the shimmering lightsabers tell us all that we need to know about their allegiances. this is one of the classic movie villains at his peak, but it is more than black and white (or blue and red) morality - there is just a hint of fatherly affection behind that mask, buried deep below, but we see the inklings of a plan, tinges of regret that have formed over the years living in the dark side. and in luke's horrified reaction, the realisation that his own vices may well lead him down the same path. the studio was not entirely happy about leaving vader in his tumbling tie fighter after the explosion of the first death star; sequels were regarded as pulpy cash-ins rather than significant narratives. but empire proves its worth, and then some - it ends with vader's cruel blow and confession, the loss of a hand, and the capture of a beloved character...but there is still a glimmer of hope. it remains one of the remarkable sci-fi achievements.";25 November 2015;10;['revolutionary', 'deep', 'mature', 'more', 'lovable', 'single', 'more', 'iconic', 'unseen', 'respected', 'romantic', 'strong', 'iconic', 'strong', 'little', 'original', 'immense', 'full', 'aztec', 'rebel', 'imperial', 'imminent', 'clear', 'greenscreen', 'detailed', 'immersive', 'rebel', 'imperial', 'live', 'threatening', 'digital', 'real', 'great', 'epic', 'robotic', 'dimensional', 'gigantic', 'more', 'new', 'appropriate', 'thick', 'curved', 'old', 'obvious', 'great', 'important', 'evident', 'immaculate', 'particular', 'glorious', 'pink', 'orchestral', 'stirring', 'second', 'iconic', 'imperial', 'menacing', 'recognisable', 'mere', 'star', 'terrifying', 'own', 'personal', 'icy', 'dark', 'shiny', 'climatic', 'orange', 'classic', 'more', 'black', 'white', 'blue', 'red', 'fatherly', 'dark', 'horrified', 'own', 'same', 'happy', 'first', 'significant', 'cruel', 'beloved', 'remarkable'];0.1613531935900357
152;vip_ebriega;"my take: bigger and surprisingly deeper, this visual fest still stands as the finest offering under the label of star wars. the first ""star wars"" is, like what shakespeare would say, such a palpable hit, that making a sequel will indeed be a big challenge, even for a man who has it all, george lucas. yet, lucas succeeded. ""empire strikes back"" is better than the first film, and that's a great achievement enough. making a sequel to one of the hardest things, perhaps, even to the most prolific or talented of directors. ""empire strikes back"" rivals and precedes it's predecessor by throwing in a lot of visuals. but stunning visuals that outdo everything in the original isn't just what the public demands. by the time empire strikes back hit screens, star wars has already caught with the public. everyone knows who these characters are. now, all that's left there is to know who they really are. if star wars is the introduction, empire is what george lucas must have really had in mind. lucas was wise to pass the directorial reigns to irvin kershner, a director who knows how to direct, and use his imagination thru filming. i've seen kershner's other films, and i must say, they're all evident in ""empire"". the plot this time centers more deeply on an every-growing political conflict. the republic forces, hiding from a temporarily retreating galactic empire, are planning there next attempt on the imperial forces. led of course by luke skywalker (mark hamill), han solo (harrison ford) and princess leia (carrie fisher), the forces are settling on a secret base on an uncharted planet. the evil darth vader (dave prowse, voiced by james earl jones) bares a grudge on young skywalker (after events in the first film), and vows vengeance. after a sudden attack by imperial forces at the rebel base (a visual-effects spectacle), young luke must follow his very destiny. now, this is where the real events in the ""star wars"" series really turns. at this point, lucas has earned his place in hollywood for his terrific storytelling talents. i wouldn't dream to tell the entire story, for i'm not that kind of film reviewer. but i'm pretty sure, you've seen this by now. be that any version, you definitely have. lucas has issued enough dvd or video versions of this film to make you see it. remembering watching ""the empire strikes back"" and the other ""star wars"" films when i was a kid is a key to actually enjoying them now. these kind of films are just plain terrific spectacles. one, that hollywood movies today should be. pure spectacle in special-effects and visuals and also in plot and story. how many blockbusters are still made this way? the empire strikes back is probably the best star wars there is. riveting, exciting, fun but what deeply surprises is the depth and storytelling. wherever george lucas may have gone nowadays, we always have empire to remind us how he, or anyone, used to make 'em. rating: ***** out of 5.";23 September 2007;10;['big', 'visual', 'f', 'fine', 'first', 'palpable', 'big', 'well', 'first', 'great', 'hard', 'prolific', 'talented', 'stunning', 'original', 'public', 'wise', 'directorial', 'other', 'evident', 'political', 'galactic', 'next', 'imperial', 'secret', 'uncharted', 'evil', 'young', 'first', 'sudden', 'imperial', 'rebel', 'visual', 'young', 'very', 'real', 'terrific', 'entire', 'sure', 'enough', 'other', 'terrific', 'pure', 'special', 'many', 'good', 'riveting', 'exciting'];0.1573359073359073

156;khanbaliq2;i recently watched the original star wars trilogy (1977-1983) in order to see how good these films really are. i already pointed out that i won't be seeing star wars: the last jedi in a theater because star wars: the force awakens really disappointed me. the force awakens is perhaps the most shallow, uninspired piece of filmmaking that i've ever seen in my life. actually, recently, i got a lot of enjoyment out of reading user reviews of the force awakens on imdb. almost all the popular reviews on imdb gave this film a rating of one out of a possible ten stars. on the other hand, almost all paid film critics praised the force awakens when it was released. as some people pointed out, this shows that film critics working for popular newspapers and websites can't be trusted. they praised the force awakens because they were paid by walt disney studios or because they were pressured. there is a word in the english language that describes this situation. it's corruption. what's interesting is that disney has been pressuring movie theaters into showing the last jedi in all the largest auditoriums when the film will be released. in other words, it seems that disney wants to make as much money as possible in as little time as possible with the release of the last jedi. make of this what you will. possibly, the last jedi is a disappointing film, just like the force awakens. therefore, disney wants to make as much money as possible before negative reviews by honest film critics begin appearing on the internet. i'm sure that the last jedi will be showered with overwhelming praise by paid film critics upon release, just like the awful the force awakens was. i'm not saying that the last jedi will be just as bad as the force awakens. rian johnson probably managed to make a better film than the force awakens. but it's possible, maybe probable, that the last jedi will also turn out to be a disappointment and a cash grab. anyway, let's get back to the original trilogy. i've got to say that i was rather impressed by these three films, especially by the empire strikes back. the visuals impressed me the most. i don't really think of star wars as science fiction. this is why i didn't include star wars films on my list of the best science fiction films. for me, these films are more like space fantasy or science fantasy. but the visuals of space and spaceships in these films are some of the best ever put to film. george lucas created quite an imaginative world in star wars. there is no doubt that lucas is a visionary. but, of course, lucas grew up at a time when americans were brought up to be inventive, capable, and original. for the last several decades, however, americans have been brought up not to be inventive and knowledgeable but to be uninventive and obedient. such is the policy of the capitalist american ruling class. therefore, americans don't really invent anything anymore and they can't come up with original ideas. i've seen the original star wars trilogy four times, i think. now that i'm no longer a teenager, i realize that these three films are quite impressive pieces of filmmaking. the special effects are particularly impressive. but lucas and company were also smart enough to bring in experienced british actors in order to make certain scenes more meaningful. as it turns out, many of the novels in the star wars expanded universe are worth reading too. i'm now reading heir to the empire, deceived, and darth plagueis. what i should mention is that i'm not hating the new star wars films because i'm just a hater. i'm not obsessed with star wars, and i've never been a fan, but i still wanted these films to be good. unfortunately, they're not good. they contain propaganda, just like the original trilogy did, but they are unoriginal corporate cash grabs. on the other hand, the empire strikes back is such a good film that i got an urge to watch it again after it was over.;5 November 2017;10;['original', 'good', 'last', 'shallow', 'uninspired', 'popular', 'possible', 'other', 'popular', 'english', 'interesting', 'last', 'large', 'other', 'much', 'possible', 'little', 'possible', 'last', 'last', 'disappointing', 'much', 'possible', 'negative', 'honest', 'sure', 'last', 'overwhelming', 'awful', 'last', 'bad', 'well', 'possible', 'probable', 'last', 'original', 'impressed', 'most', 'good', 'good', 'imaginative', 'inventive', 'capable', 'original', 'last', 'several', 'inventive', 'knowledgeable', 'uninventive', 'obedient', 'such', 'capitalist', 'american', 'original', 'original', 'impressive', 'special', 'impressive', 'smart', 'experienced', 'british', 'certain', 'meaningful', 'many', 'worth', 'new', 'good', 'good', 'original', 'unoriginal', 'corporate', 'other', 'good'];0.219553489439853
157;stamper;with this masterpiece of the star wars saga, which in my opinion is the best part of the whole series. i always thought that way and i guess that will never change. of course i got some criticism, but it is basically the same i have for episode iv and that would be that the special effects seem not as good as they once did, which is basically due to the enormous change and improvement on the special effects department. besides that though i do not have any criticism on this film. as with the other episode i also am talking about the special edition here and i must say that lucas has done some good improvement with this episode as well. there were a bunch of altered or added effects, like explosions and a few scenes in the city in the clouds, but the part that was altered best, i think, was the one in the beginning involving the creature in the snow. there were really some good scenes integrated here, which all looked very real. maybe besides the fact that there was just a little blood when luke gave the creature that stroke with the saber. that might be another criticism of this film. i mean there is quite a bit of lightsaber action in which someone is hit (three scenes) and it just appears that there is almost no blood lost. this might be regarded as a bit unreal by some people, but i was satisfied with that, for i am used of it since i was just a little kid and i think it was much better than the stuff that happened for instance in indiana jones (which i saw when i was about 11 or so) . for those scenes at the end of the first indiana jones really gave me the creeps when i watched that film for the first time and i had quite a couple of nightmares afterward. whereas nothing of that kind happened after i had seen any of the thee 'old' episodes of the star wars saga about a year earlier. what i especially like about this film is, of course the battle on hoth, right at the beginning, which starts this episode of the epic tale. in this film there are much more elaborate and much better battle scenes. but not only on hoth, but also on the city in the clouds. i'm not talking about those laser fights here, but i'm talking about the lightsaber duel between darth vader and luke skywalker, which is so much better than the saber duel in episode iv between obi wan and vader. last but not at all least there is much more character development in this one than in episode iv and that also is what makes this such a great film. besides all that, this film also introduces us to yoda, (well if you've not seen episode i that is) and the emperor, who is the driving force behind the oh so evil vader. speaking of which, he is really evil in this film. i mean if you thought you have seen his full wickedness in the first part you are so wrong. this man really is unpredictable and bad to the bone. his heart has been, you might say, destroyed by the dark side of the force, which is composed mainly of fear and hate. yoda is though important not that much of a main character, than you'd expect. he is just the person who is responsible for the 'upbringing' of the jedi knights and who has been responsible for that for about 800 years. although he seems quite useless and strange at the beginning, he actually is quite smart and helpful for luke in this episode in which luke sees his connection with the force reach a higher level. while luke and yoda prepare for battle han and leia are just making time fly by with a lot of jokes and action. i really must say here that harrison ford is great as han solo, who in this episode (again) delivers most of the jokes. he is quite the scoundrel (as princess leia rightly noticed) and he is by far my most favorite character in the whole series, for his one liners and his conversations with princess leia will always be remembered by me. my other favorite comedian from the first film (c 3po) is not on such a roll as in the first one, but he still is pretty funny. the fact that han solo is my favorite character does not mean i do not like luke, or i do not sympathize with him. it is just that if i wanted to be a character in star wars i would want to be han solo, because i think he is coolest and because i think if i could be someone in this saga i could be han solo. besides all that, there happens something in this star wars film, that is well known and remembered by all fans of the saga and it is something i do not want to spoil for anyone of you who has not seen this film (if there are such persons). all of the fans will know what i'm talking about and i think that is the biggest and most important event of the whole saga and by far the most touching one too. it brought tears to my eyes when i saw it again, something i would not have expected. it was just done so well, i really must applaud everyone who took part in that scene and of course george lucas and john williams, who in my eyes is the god of scores. watch, be blown away, surprised and moved. may the force be with youalways. 9 out of 10;25 December 2000;9;['good', 'whole', 'same', 'special', 'good', 'due', 'enormous', 'special', 'other', 'special', 'good', 'altered', 'few',

158;ivo-cobra8;star wars: episode v - the empire strikes back (1980) is an excellent timeless classic that it is the best sequel of all time. i love this film to death, it is my second favorite film and the best sequel in the star wars franchise that i love. the empire strikes back is a movie that it is one of the best sequels i can think of, it is right there with aliens (1986), it is right there with terminator 2: judgment day (1991) it is an excellent sequel and it really does establish the empire as a value treat. empire strikes back is still and excellent film which i really believe is a timeless classic. this is my second favorite film from director irvin kershner. number 1 favorite irvin kershner film will be robocop 2 (1990) which is very underrated action flick. i still have to review those movies someday. empire strikes back (1980) is the best one of the series, because it's deeper, darker, more philosophical. it's great because darth vader and the empire are at their most menacing, the direction is creative, the characters feel real, the nature of the force is explored more without losing its mysticism, and the pacing is, as george lucas would put it, faster and more intense than any other film in the saga. the plot is actually more a rescue mission that luke skywalker (mark hamill) is coming to rescue his friends han solo, princess leia organa, c-3po and chewbacca are captured on a planet bespin in cloud city from villainous darth vader. han solo's friend lando calrissian (billy dee williams) set the up and with darth vader he set a trap for luke. also luke studied the force under jedi master yoda to become a full jedi knight but in the end he must confront darth vader (david prowse) by him self. the origins of luke skywalker are reveled. empire strikes back was released in 1980 it is directed by irvin kershner this time and not george lucas. because george lucas decide that he want to make this sequel independent one, so he ended up coming with his own, founding for the film. getting a loan and money he earn from the first movie and it success, so he decided he wanted, to found the film him self, and he wanted to be more an executive producer to keep an eye on the lamp, he moved to a bigger studio in orange county, california, so he diced to be more a producer he did not want to direct empire strikes back. so his first choice was irvin kershner, who was a professor at uc in the uc film school, that george attended too and he always liked irvin kershner and of course he was a former professor and it was a hard way talk him to do it and the first time irvin kershner didn't want to do it, so george called irvin's agent and his agent said to irvin take it so he did and the rest is a history. this stands the test of time, the best film he ever directed! i love john williams score still the same, but i think john williams changed the music score for a little bit, but that's just my opinion. things that i love in this film: i love the battle with rebels fighting with the imperial at-at walkers on the ice world of hoth. that is my favorite scene on ice world in the film. the imperial at-at walkers are incredible well made with classic special effects. i love that the origins of luke skywalker are reveled, that luke is the son of darth vader, who is actually anakin skywalker, before he become darth vader and went to the dark site. for the first time ever, we see an emperor in a hologram talking to darth vader. the falcon with han solo, princess leia organa, c-3po and chewbacca hiding in the rocks try's to eat a monster. luke faces with darth vader him self face to face and get his arm cut off and then he jumps off the bridge, because he didn't want to join his father in a dark force. the lightsaber duel throughout the chamber between luke and darth vader was excellent and it was epic. the training sequence with luke and master yoda were excellent and epic. a new hope and the empire strikes back are my favorite films in series, that are in the franchise, this film get's a perfect 10 score for been the best sci-fi adventure sequel of all time.;25 April 2016;10;['excellent', 'good', 'second', 'favorite', 'good', 'good', 'excellent', 'excellent', 'timeless', 'second', 'favorite', 'favorite', 'underrated', 'good', 'deep', 'dark', 'philosophical', 'great', 'menacing', 'creative', 'real', 'fast', 'intense', 'other', 'more', 'villainous', 'full', 'jedi', 'independent', 'own', 'first', 'executive', 'big', 'first', 'former', 'hard', 'first', 'good', 'same', 'little', 'imperial', 'favorite', 'imperial', 'incredible', 'classic', 'special', 'dark', 'first', 'dark', 'excellent', 'epic', 'excellent', 'epic', 'new', 'favorite', 'perfect', 'good'];0.3399184998674794

160;The_Movie_Cat;"the second in the initial run of star wars movies, and i must insist that their extreme popularity has always alluded me. the original star wars film, a new hope, is often cited as the greatest film ever made when such surveys are taken amongst the public and not amongst the critical fraternity. i mean, they're rubbish, surely? yet all sorts of cod psychology goes up to justify what really are just cowboys and indians in space. take a look at this religious analogy of the phantom menace: ""a man wearing a shawl, sporting long hair and a beard travels through a town collecting disciples. after many biblical encounters they meet a man with the appearance of a horned devil who carries a staff horizontally, like a cross. this is ultimately what kills the man, though his death helps to save his disciple. he dies so that his disciple might live."" this is a description of the basic events of the film, and attention is also drawn to the fact that there are three generations of man in the film (qui-gon jinn, obi-wan kenobi and anakin), like the father, son and holy ghost. and what is phantom another word for? in all honesty, that christian analogy of the fourth star wars film isn't genuine - i made it up in two minutes while shopping for groceries. but it just shows how easy it is to craft a pseudo-intellectual subtext into what is a crass, sfx-crammed movie and palm it off as genuine critique. while even the most blinkered are shaky on phantom's appeal, the fact that star wars makes a regular top 10 appearance in the imbd chart, trouncing even such greats as citizen kane, goes to show, to my mind, that people are scared to disagree with popular opinion. as a film, star wars isn't spectacular. the direction is average, at best, while acting, and especially dialogue (george lucas' major weak point) are one-dimensional. so this would leave you to believe it must be great science fiction then. it isn't. ""fetch the mind probe"" utters darth vader at one point, without any hint of irony. childish and vapid, this dumbed-down, popcorn sci-fi pales, surely, when compared with such greats as 2001, planet of the apes or a clockwork orange? yet this ""emperor's new clothes"" effect even sticks to the sequels, causing the noxious ""return of the jedi"" to surf irksomely around the top 100. which brings us to the empire strikes back. the only star wars film to date that jettisons formulaic plotting, comfortable in the fact that it follows a movie and it knows a movie will succeed it. put simply, sandwiched in between ""hope"" and ""jedi"", empire doesn't require the luxuries of a beginning or end, so is essentially one big middle. this can be off-putting at first glance, particularly an unresolved climax which can leave the viewer feeling like they've been cheated. yet this is, by star wars standards, sophisticated and depth-filled, a massive slap in the face for george lucas who had little input into this dark instalment. though he supplies the story, the dialogue is given a human, more adult edge by leigh brackett and lawrence kasdan, while irvin kershner's direction jettisons the ""point and shoot"" fixations of ""phantom menace"" for genuine cineramic sweeps. strangely, with it's blood and mutilations, ""empire"" wasn't given a ""pg"" certificate. but the internal nature of good/evil and the symbiosis between luke and vader (mark hamill, with the better direction, even threatening to act on occasion), lend this one a worthwhile backbone that means you don't ""have to pretend you're a kid again"" in order to enjoy it. the most sophisticated and depth-filled star wars film, infinitely better than anything that followed, and leagues ahead of it's merely-average predecessor, it is quite beautifully filmed and the only one of the four that will always hold surprises on any number of repeated viewings.";22 December 1999;8;['second', 'initial', 'extreme', 'original', 'new', 'great', 'such', 'critical', 'rubbish', 'religious', 'phantom', 'long', 'many', 'biblical', 'horned', 'basic', 'holy', 'phantom', 'christian', 'fourth', 'genuine', 'easy', 'intellectual', 'genuine', 'shaky', 'regular', 'top', 'imbd', 'such', 'scared', 'popular', 'spectacular', 'average', 'good', 'major', 'weak', 'dimensional', 'great', 'such', 'new', 'noxious', 'top', 'only', 'formulaic', 'comfortable', 'big', 'first', 'unresolved', 'sophisticated', 'massive', 'little', 'dark', 'human', 'more', 'leigh', 'phantom', 'genuine', 'cineramic', 'pg', 'internal', 'good', 'well', 'worthwhile', 'sophisticated', 'average', 'only'];0.1894545454545454
161;Ruskington;not for the life of me do i understand how people think this is better than its predecessor. yes it has its moments but there is a distinct drop in quality, not least when it comes to the special effects. at times it looks like watching a close up of toy spaceships being moved around on fishing wire. the development of skywalker is poor throughout these films and is particularly bad here. his progression from outer-galactic farmhand to jedi knight is laughably far-fetched and just doesn't seem feasible. his tutelage under yoda is under-done and the use of 'the force' as a plot band-aid is tiresome and insincere, a clear example of lucas' often childish writing. the battle scenes were poor in a new hope but get even worse in empire strikes back. very poor choreography and, even for 1980, pretty amateurish special effects. did people really find the battle between skywalker and vader in any way engaging? i honestly just don't get it. there is plenty to admire about this film and it's certainly not the worst sequel ever made but a classic it is surely not.;1 June 2020;6;['well', 'distinct', 'least', 'special', 'poor', 'bad', 'outer', 'galactic', 'fetched', 'feasible', 'tiresome', 'insincere', 'clear', 'childish', 'poor', 'new', 'bad', 'poor', 'amateurish', 'special', 'bad'];-0.2299567099567099

163;Angry_Arguer;"george lucas doesn't understand religion. he can never convey the concepts and theories of it (or the belief in it for that matter) to any extent. hence, the best movie he directed is american graffiti since it is not so concerned with making obvious subtexts. lucas pretends to know philosophy in the star wars series, but he never embellishes on the gray area between his monolithic ""good"" and ""evil"" sides. that said, the empire strikes back remains the best in the star wars series because lucas lets the reigns of directing fall to someone who knows what they're doing. irvin kerschner is not a talented or smart director, but he has more sense in his head than lucas. lucas' head is stuck in never never land so it is up to kerschner to add sense to the movie. there is also the support of lawrence kasdan (before the man wound up making garbage like dreamcatcher) and leigh brackett touch up his original story in order to remove unnecessary garbage. as pauline kael put it, the movie is not concerned about the ""comic book hedonism"" of the original star wars. return of the jedi would emphasize what happens when lucas gets his way (again) and hires out some poor sap to direct. the level of concern about yoda this time is not the same as the ewoks in return of the jedi, smart move. the level of static shots, using just pans and tilts, are marvelous compared to the constant sense of motion that star wars wants to make. it gets worse with attack of the clones and phantom menace. the biggest factor is that the effects haven't aged. the space scenes are elaborate, but not annoying, and john william's score aptly supports them. compare the asteroid pursuit here to the vastly inferior one in episode ii, the magic has faded with cgi. overall, there are good movies and bad ones. the empire strikes back is not better than star wars, it is a quantum leap forward from it. if any film in the series holds my record for ambition, execution, and presentation...this is it. 4 out of 5 stars.";17 August 2003;9;['good', 'american', 'concerned', 'obvious', 'lucas', 'gray', 'monolithic', 'good', 'evil', 'good', 'talented', 'smart', 'more', 'lucas', 'leigh', 'original', 'unnecessary', 'pauline', 'concerned', 'comic', 'original', 'poor', 'same', 'smart', 'static', 'marvelous', 'constant', 'bad', 'phantom', 'big', 'elaborate', 'annoying', 'inferior', 'good', 'bad', 'well', 'quantum'];0.1371428571428572

170;zac-04879;the momentum throughout the largely-adored star wars instalment isn't exactly energetic enough to win against a new hope. so overall, it's a very well-constructed sequel that continues with the epic sci-fi action, but is mainly disappointing. the new director, irvin kershner, definitely builds onto george lucas's original and clever direction. the force, the explosive effects, the appealing battles and the cool robots are all brought back, except they're not as fascinating this time... the real flaw is the exceedingly unhurried pace, and it manages to coat all the creativity. although the empire strikes back leaves off with a reasonably satisfying touch, it fails to leave you excited for the next movie. it's a likeable flick worth experiencing in the cinema, but it's adored a little too highly. but still, there's absolutely no doubt that the big fans of the series will love it. if you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.;22 October 2021;6;['energetic', 'new', 'epic', 'disappointing', 'new', 'original', 'clever', 'explosive', 'cool', 'fascinating', 'real', 'unhurried', 'satisfying', 'excited', 'next', 'likeable', 'worth', 'little', 'big', 'full', 'other'];0.1820496632996633

179;DarthVoorhees;the original star wars was a spectacular movie.when you watch it,you are hooked from beginning to end.star wars didn't drag.it is an amazing film to look at too,the aliens,droids,and the fantastic planets.doing a sequel would not be an easy task.watching empire strikes back you get the same experience while watching star wars,maybe even more so.all though star wars is a without a doubt a great film,it had some flaws,mainly in the character development/dialogue areas.empire strikes back soars in these areas.you didn't really know much about darth vader in the original star wars,except he was a former jedi who became a sith lord,and helped start the galatic empire.empire strikes back gives him an all new edge,he is eviler,angrier,and obsessed with finding luke skywalker.luke earlier in the film has a vision of obi-wan kenobi,his slain jedi master from the original star wars,telling him to seek out yoda on the dagobah system to complete his jedi training.luke does so after imperial forces drive out the rebels from their base on the hoth system.han solo has grown more from star wars as well.he isn't the tough guy he used to be.he is softer and is falling madly in love with princess leia.the character of han is given much more character development,he is maturing from the smuggler he once was.he is afraid of being chased around the galaxy by the empire,and jabba the hutt's bounty hunters but he knows he must do what is right.han,leia,c-3po,and chewie are being chased by the empire most of the film.vader knows luke loves his friends,and that they are his weakness,if he finds them,and tortures them luke will do his bidding.luke learns the force from yoda on the swamp planet of dagobah.yoda is an interesting character.we all know he is a rubber puppet but for most of the time is very life like and you forget about it,because the character works so well.another benefit of the yoda character is that we learn much more about the concept of the force from him,the concept hasn't really been fully explained but you get the basic idea.luke is getting pesky he wants to become a jedi and grows tired of yoda's methods of training.yoda explains that a jedi doesn't want excitement,and that they must be patient.he also tells luke that the jedi aren't warriors.through a vision of the future,luke senses what could happen to his friends by vader's hand.he rushes to save them abandoning his jedi training.han meets with lando calarissan,an old friend of his,on bespin for a place to hide.the empire is there waiting for han,they turn him over to the bounty hunter,boba fett.han is put into carbon freeze.just when you think anything couldn't possibly be worse,luke arrives to save his friends,falling directly into vader's trap.luke arms himself with his lightsaber and challenges vader to a duel.the duel in the original was badly done,partially because of alec guiness' age at the time.the duel between vader and luke is so much better because it is darker and thrilling.the battle lasts very long but eventually luke is defeated after vader chops off his fighting hand.and this is when possibly one of the most memorable lines in film history is said.vader asks luke if obi-wan ever told him what happened to his father,luke replies in a rageful voice,he told me you killed him,vader replies no luke i am your father.i would have loved to been alive in 1980 to see empire strikes back,and the reaction to that line. esb is without a doubt superior to star wars.it is darker,scarier,and a lot more is done with the characters.darth vader is really just a henchman in the original,here the character is taken to an all new level.a part of me wishes they hadn't done the prequels,with revenge of the sith coming out this may,a lot of the mystery and fun behind the character will be gone.it wasn't the dark mask that frightened you,it was who was under it,the mystery and suspense of it.empire strikes back is a great film,and even though star wars is excellent,empire strikes back is the superior movie. 10/10;3 April 2005;10;['original', 'spectacular', 'amazing', 'fantastic', 'easy', 'same', 'great', 'much', 'original', 'former', 'sith', 'galatic', 'new', 'eviler', 'slain', 'original', 'imperial', 'more', 'star', 'tough', 'soft', 'more', 'afraid', 'most', 'swamp', 'interesting', 'most', 'more', 'basic', 'pesky', 'tired', 'luke', 'old', 'bad', 'original', 'well', 'dark', 'memorable', 'rageful', 'alive', 'superior', 'dark', 'more', 'original', 'new', 'dark', 'great', 'excellent', 'superior'];0.2687073437073436

181;Blue-Grotto;"this film made such an impression on a ten year old boy that i, watching it forty years later for just the second time, still know the details of the story, characters and scenes by heart. rebels hiding on an icy planet are discovered and overrun by darth vader, storm troopers and sophisticated machinery. the prize that eludes their grasp is not so much the rebel forces but a young man, luke skywalker, who has the potential to become a great leader, visionary and warrior; a jedi knight. while skywalker trains to be a jedi his friends are captured and used as bait to lure him into a trap where he will be forced to choose whether he wants to join vader's forces or die. the secret sauce of the empire strikes back and what makes it infinitely better than star trek, is the jedi knight philosophy expressed by its master practitioner yoda. it simply radiates wisdom and truth and resonates in our hearts. ""do or do not,"" yoda says ""there is no try."" he warns against anger, fear and aggression which flow easy and are seductive. it is much better to ally yourself with the ""force"" and the life energy that surrounds and binds us. the romance between the characters of han solo and princess leia, and the acting of harrison ford and carrie fisher that bring it to life, also makes a sad sack of the star trek franchise. unfortunately, the romance is unbalanced and macho oriented, as well as pg rated. still, it is more romance than a hundred star trek episodes put together. mark hamill is a bad actor who, deservedly, drifts into the shadows and has no more successful roles to play. while the empire strikes back is a wonderful film, it does not occupy the exalted place in my mind and heart as it did 40 years ago. it is the difference too, between boy and man. these days i desire more depth in beauty and wisdom, in writing and cinematography, than this somewhat simple film achieves. still, there is some magic here among the vanilla.";22 May 2020;8;['old', 'second', 'icy', 'sophisticated', 'rebel', 'young', 'great', 'secret', 'seductive', 'well', 'sad', 'unbalanced', 'more', 'bad', 'successful', 'wonderful', 'exalted', 'more', 'simple'];0.1821428571428571
182;alindsayal;so my next step in watching star wars films is the 2nd film released the empire strikes back and i'm going to spoil the review for anybody watching this is my favourite film i have ever seen so expect me to be very positive about this film. the premise of the film sees luke skywalker travel to the planet dagobah and learn from a jedi master in order to improve his skills, while leia, han, chewbacca & c-3po are on the run from the empire with darth vader in charge of everything. main character there is sometimes some criticism of mark hamill's performance in the first two star wars films because he does complain and wine quite a bit. however, i think this helps make this character feel interesting to me, the other two jedi's we meet in the first two films in obi-wan & yoda are very wise and all knowing so easy to respect but hard to relate to. luke is us the audience, we don't understand the teachings of the jedi and we get frustrated easily, luke makes mistakes as a character which makes him easier to root for as he feels very human compared to these other characters who feel like gods. this film does a great job in making luke flawed but also making us care about him and want to see him succeed in his mission despite these flaws. supporting characters as mentioned in my previous review harrison ford as han solo & carrie fish as leia are brilliant supporting characters and they are great in this film together. they have so much charisma and there chemistry together is off the charts (probably due to real life chemistry), they have some of the most iconic scenes in film history together in this film and there romance really evolves in the film and feels very natural and appropriate for the two characters on screen. now onto possibly the star of the show the character of darth vader, in a new hope we are given a brief introduction to vader but in this film he is centre stage and he is the embodiment of pure evil in this film. he is menacing and you are scared of his power as we aren't really shown that in the previous film, he is very commanding and you learn more about his character that makes him even more interesting then he was in the previous film. frank oz voices yoda in the film and he was a great addition to the film, you can really see how wise yoda is as a character and i really liked his dynamic with luke in the film as you see two people pretty much at different points of life and how they treat things which leads to them clashing. billy dee williams plays lando carrissian, a smuggler that are heroes meet and he also has loads of charisma and charm to him even though you can tell he maybe isn't as honest as he lets on and like han from the previosu film he has his own motivations to help the team. story this film takes risks with its story by splitting the characters up into two different storylines but it really pays off. you have the slower but really interesting personal story with luke & yoda and you have the faster more exciting romantic story involving han & leia. they both mesh incredibly well and they both give an audience member different things to enjoy and it allows the pacing to feel perfect and well done. obviously this film has some twists in it that are very well known but i wn't mention them specifically in case there is somebody who doesn't know about it, but it is all handled perfectly and really adds drama to this film but also the future films aswell that was pretty revolutionary at the time and even holds up now even though i know the twists. script the script for this film is so well written, the dialogue makes the characters feel so real and the drama is amped up in this one to truly make you care about the characters and the plight that they are in. the humour is good too especially with han & leia as it fits there characters perfectly and feels right for them and their romance. also the twists are perfectly handled and written brilliantly to allow you to really sink them in and understand them. style this film's style is darker then a new hope but it feels right as the heroes are plunged into a darker story and as the title of the film suggests the villains are all over them from very early on. in terms of action scenes the battle of hoth at the beginning of the film is one of my favourite battles not just in star wars history but in film history. also the lightsaber battle between vader & luke is faster and just as personal as the one between vader & obi-wan making it more exciting and a much better watch. also john williams score is even better in this film and really adds to the suspense and the darker story that is being told. i should also mention that i watched the newer blu ray version but unlike a new hope the changes are very small and i actually thought they were fine and didn't change the film one bit. overall overall, i literally struggle to find any faults with this movie. it is the perfect middle part of a trilogy and should be watched as that so watch a new hope, empire strikes back & return of the jedi in a short time frame to truly appreciate the development of the characters and the story. with this being my favourite film of all time i heavily recommend this film and the other two films in the trilogy. rating - 10/10.;12 December 2021;10;['next', 'favourite', 'positive', 'main', 'first',

197;ronakkotian;i remember watching the empire strikes back when i was young and just completely loving it. even today it remains as my favourite film in the franchise. star wars: the empire strikes back follows luke skywalker training more and more to become a jedi whilst han solo and princess leia are pursued by darth vader. after a new hope, everyone was so excited to see the next star wars film. it became one of the most anticipated films of the early 80s and once it finally came out, people just fell in love with it. this is the best star wars film to date and here's why. first of all the camerawork in this movie is absolutely excellent. rip irvin kershner, you did a great job. the special effects definitely evolved since episode iv as they look really good. it's astounding to think that this movie came out in 1980 because how beautiful the set design and effects were. whilst a new hope didn't have many fight sequences, this one has plenty and the action scenes are extremely entertaining to watch that keep the adrenaline flowing. apart from all the positives mentioned, the area where this film shines is its characters. the acting by everyone was superb once again. writers leigh brackett and lawrence kasdan wrote a beautiful script as we learn more about each of our beloved characters. the chemistry between leia and solo is fantastic and quite funny at times. we learn a lot about luke's past and his relation to vader which makes up for a great conflict between the two. if you thought darth vader was evil in the previous film, wait till you see how menacing he becomes in the empire strikes back. this film also gave us yoda which was an absolute treat. the empire strikes back is my favourite star wars film and i don't think any other film can reach its level. the film is well paced alongside some incredible action sequences that keep the intensity going. our heroes are given a lot of depth which makes us root for them and care about them throughout and the villains have never been so menacing. the empire strikes back is a classic and will remain a classic for a very long time.;10 December 2019;10;['young', 'favourite', 'more', 'new', 'excited', 'next', 'early', 'good', 'excellent', 'great', 'special', 'good', 'astounding', 'beautiful', 'new', 'many', 'entertaining', 'superb', 'beautiful', 'more', 'beloved', 'fantastic', 'funny', 'great', 'evil', 'previous', 'menacing', 'absolute', 'favourite', 'other', 'incredible', 'menacing', 'long'];0.3101033375226923

""empire strikes back"" starts off in the ice planet hoth where luke, han and leia have been stationed with the rebel troops as they try to hide from darth vader after the destruction of the death star. in the film's beginning, luke and solo have been separated during a snowstorm in which luke gets attacked by a creature in the snow, and taking him where luke will be lunch. luke manages to defeat the creature, as he is now unstable to move where he sees the ghost of obi-wan kenobi, telling him to go to see the master jedi, yoda where he will finish his jedi training. after han rescues luke, the base camp is under attack by the imperial as now everybody escapes from the camp, being separate from one another as luke and r2-d2 take the x-wing and go visit yoda, while han, princess leia, chewbacca and c-3po take to millennium falcon to cloud city to visit a pal of han solo's while escaping darth vader, who has hired bounty hunters to take solo to jabba the hutt; and at the same time, han has feelings for princess leia as he tries to put the moves on her. luke and r2-d2 arrived in a deserted swamp in another planet where they meet the creature yoda, who is small, old and is much like a doll that people will want to buy from the stores. yoda gets luke into shape, as he wants him to confront his enemies in the future; also to see if luke has what it takes to be a jedi knight without having any fears or anger towards his journey. the apprentice and the droid leave yoda as obi-wan tells the green creature that he is their only hope; while yoda says that there's another one with the same gift as luke. han solo, leia, chewbacca and c-3po arrived at cloud city where they meet lando calrissen (billy dee williams), a mercenary turned peace adviser of the planet and friend to han, where they go inside to relax, until 3po has been abducted and darth vader arrives in the waiting room, capturing luke's friends and taking them hostage. vader has a surprise for luke skywalker where he has a carbonate freezer ready to kill luke, but first, he must give bounty hunter boba fett what he wants: han solo. vader tests the machine on luke where he is a block of ice with a monitor on the side. boba's got the prize and must return solo to jabba the hutt. luke arrives at the scene where boba fires at him and than seeing the peril that his friends were in, r2-d2 goes to help the princess, chewy and 3po as luke finds darth vader in the carbonate room where they duel with a grand surprise in the end.

203;harryplinkett14;this is no doubt the best of the three star wars films. i don't count the 'prequels' or recent 'sequels', spin-offs and such. the original film was lots of fun, but it was also trying to find out what it was, to establish a distinct tone, to define the universe it was played in, and so on. also, a limited budget impacted the production in tangible ways. now, for 'empire', they had all these things in place. the characters were developed, the universe defined, the budget was there. also, a better film director was employed this time around. the film further develops the characters, in most enjoyable and interesting ways. there is drama here, that neither the first nor the third film ever came close to. and the scenes on hoth remain the most memorable for me personally. but there is a problem here: the exploration of the 'force'. it never went anywhere. it got bogged down in the swamps of dagobah, and became incoherent drivel that seemed to randomly pick up elements from various philosophies. yoda's teachings have all the depth of a 'how to find peace with the universe' booklet you can buy for a dollar. i hated yoda and everything about him. when they realised they were dealing with quasi-philosophical nonsense, the filmmakers tried to compensate for it by making yoda arrogant and pretentious, as he makes silly demands on his pupil. also, the return of obi wan was annoying to me, and totally unnecessary. but another problem is created by turning luke's training into his mess: he remains an alien character. we emote with han, leia, chewie, and the droids, but not him. he never becomes intriguing or relevant for our emotional investment in the film. until the end of the third film, he remains this alien figure that exists to push forward the plot about the 'force', while everything truly interesting and emotionally engaging revolves around the other protagonists. his confrontations with vader remain sterile and feel like something the film is obligated to deliver, but no one truly enjoys. when i was a kid, i wanted to be han solo. luke never became a hero, and nothing he ever did moved me the way the adventures of han and the other protagonists did.;26 October 2019;8;['good', 'recent', 'such', 'original', 'distinct', 'limited', 'tangible', 'well', 'enjoyable', 'interesting', 'first', 'third', 'memorable', 'incoherent', 'various', 'quasi', 'philosophical', 'arrogant', 'pretentious', 'silly', 'annoying', 'unnecessary', 'alien', 'intriguing', 'relevant', 'emotional', 'third', 'alien', 'interesting', 'other', 'sterile', 'other'];0.0482804232804232

211;willcundallreview;"star wars: episode v-the empire strikes back is just a film that shows how a sci-fi should be done but also, how to create a movie that is perfection. with so much so good about this there isn't much stuff wrong with it and criticism does not come easy. it is well acted, comedic but also ultimately reaches extreme new emotions for a film series and a sequel that really touches whatever you already knew about film. overall i felt it was a masterpiece, and here below is why. the story is an epic one and plots just about everything you want to see when spaceships are flying round perfectly. this one also works so well in the entire series as a whole and without this only really episode iv would be ground breaking, it just combines action, adventure and comedy into a bundle of greatness. on that note of comedy, although the plot is very dramatic, you get that one two between characters that is just superb to see and reinvents old cliches. the main cast return to good form and probably even better than before, mark hamill improves and although he isn't as good as he probably should be, he controls the role well. harrison ford yet again puts in a sublime acting display and his skills seen here are reason enough why film is so important to some people. i did feel carrie fisher also gets a little better from previously seen and when ever her and ford are on screen there timing is brilliantly done. george lucas doesn't direct or write this one and it could be said it benefits because of that, irwin kershner does direct it well although the real star behind the camera is lawrence kasdan who along with leigh brackett create a script that has to be one of the best ever seen in film, just so well written all the way through. i even think the effects improve overall and some spectacular space scenes make this also as well deeply dramatic, also heart raising. criticisms well i said about how hard it is so let's try and find some. the only thing i can think of is occasionally parts can seem rather silly, vader sometimes has really random sets used with him and overly extravagant ""offices"". at times the effects are not good but it was 1980 so i can't criticise it for that at all. fans of star wars well, this should be there favourite one and although some come close, it is still overall the best movie in the series. if you like sci-fi, this is even worth it as a one off watch and even if you have never seen a star wars film before, this will still entertain. the only people i think who would dislike this are people who really don't like sci-fi as that is the only thing i can think of if you don't at least find it kind of ok. overall it is more or less a just about flawless film and one that is essential viewing for any fan of all things film. it appears on so many best films of all time lists and can even top them at times so don't go in thinking you might not like it, give it a go and empire may just come out being your favourite film of all time. i also will add that if anyone ever needs to see what the best type of acting is then watch this movie, all the cast just seem perfect and even the extras can seem brilliant.";17 August 2014;10;['much', 'good', 'much', 'wrong', 'comedic', 'extreme', 'new', 'epic', 'entire', 'dramatic', 'superb', 'old', 'main', 'good', 'well', 'good', 'sublime', 'enough', 'important', 'little', 'well', 'real', 'leigh', 'good', 'spectacular', 'dramatic', 'hard', 'only', 'silly', 'random', 'extravagant', 'good', 'favourite', 'overall', 'good', 'worth', 'only', 'only', 'least', 'ok', 'flawless', 'essential', 'many', 'good', 'favourite', 'good', 'perfect', 'brilliant'];0.2429525518341307
212;diac228;"prior to 1980, there had not been a movie sequel that quite destroyed over dethroned the original in terms of quality, cultural impact, and everlasting effect. ever since 1916, when the first movie sequel was born (fall of a nation---completing your pointless trivia of the day), there had been very few successful sequels that could stand tall with the original. of course, there was french connection ii, and godfather ii, but neither of them could quite compare to the original. enter empire strikes back. not only did this sequel have a tougher job to live to its original counterpart (a box office phenomenon that would forever change marketing, merchandising, and film-making for generations to come), but this sequel quite frankly did the unthinkable by changing the tone, raising the stakes, and not promising a happy-go-lucky ending that usually associates with sequels. empire strikes back is yet another star wars movie that broke the rules of how to make a film and also ushered a new style and technique of film-making. this movie didn't have the expected ending. not all the backstories and main stories reached a resolution. the bad guys did win. the good guys were doomed. this sort of stuff doesn't happen in blockbuster sequels, but empire strikes back dared to do this. accompanying the change in pace is an excellent score, superb directing, incredible action, top-notch special effects, and basically the complete package in entertainment. the blend of action, drama, suspense, romance, and humor is among the best you'll ever see in a movie. not only is it one of the best sequels ever, but it's also one of the greatest movies ever. this sort of movie-making magic just can't be duplicated. empire strikes back is about the travels of luke skywalker, princess leia, and han solo (mark hamill, carrie fischer, harrison ford) as they suddenly encounter a massive resistance coming from the dark side of the force. led by an angrier and less sympathetic darth vader, the rebels are suddenly faster, swifter, and smarter in their attempt to control the universe. at the same time, luke begins his training to become a jedi knight, only to have his training stalled when the conflict is becoming increasingly dangerous to all his friends. while it is obvious george lucas didn't have every detail planned out in the trilogy (example: leia/luke/han love triangle), he had a grand idea as to where the franchise was going story-wise. the strongest part of empire strikes back is like that of the original: the special effects and the associating visual spectacles that transports you to a totally different universe. the film was larger-than-life, as every location is grander and more impressive than the last: beginning with hoth (and its classic snow battle) and ending with bespin. while this was lucas' creation and story, we cannot forget the directing of irvin kershner, which was the best of the entire franchise. thanks to him, the acting here was best, the surprises were best-hidden, and the pacing was at its peak. the two hours breeze by here, and is capped by one of the strongest finishes in any blockbuster movie. all of your regular characters were back and were at their most entertaining here: han solo is at his cockiest and funniest in the second installment, luke skywalker is at his most heroic (and most foolish), 3-cpo is at his funniest (and most irritating), and then darth vader is at his downright scariest. when luke has to fight him, the only hint of sheer terror in the trilogy occurs thenas darth vader pretty much tosses him around like an unwanted ragdoll. adding to the fear is john williams' immortal imperial march song, which makes its debut here. the rest of the music in this movie is also spectacular, and should have won the oscar that year. bottom line: this is one of the top sequels of all-time, because it separates itself from the original by changing the tone, and expanding (and improving) upon everything that make the original star wars so great: the writing, special effects, directing, costumes, blend of action and comedy, set design, characters, musical score, pacing, and overall fun. empire strikes back outperforms the original star wars in every aspect; from the better first act to even the smaller things like the lightsaber dueling choreography. it would be years before we find a blockbuster sequel that can top the original, and that's terminator 2 which doesn't occur until the next decade. like i've said about star wars, if you have not seen this movie, it's because you are trying so hard to avoid it. if you don't like this movie, then it's because you just don't enjoy good movie-making. empire strikes back is one of those rare movies that can be wholesomely entertaining yet engrossingly deep at the same time. this is borderline-art, and is a sheer joy from the first minute to the last. the empire strikes back: raising the bar for blockbusters and sequels everywhere---too bad there's been so few of them that have matched the same level of quality.";2 October 2009;10;['original', 'cultural', 'everlasting', 'first', 'pointless', 'few', 'successful', 'tall', 'original', 'french', 'original', 'tough', 'original', 'unthinkable', 'happy', 'lucky', 'new', 'main', 'bad', 'good', 'blockbuster', 'excellent', 'incredible', 'top', 'special', 'complete', 'good', 'good', 'great', 'massive', 'dark', 'angry', 'sympathetic', 'fast', 'smart', 'same', 'jedi', 'dangerous', 'obvious', 'grand', 'strong', 'original', 'special', 'visual', 'different', 'large', 'impressive', 'last', 'classic', 'lucas', 'good', 'entire', 'good', 'strong', 'blockbuster', 'regular', 'entertaining', 'second', 'heroic', 'foolish', 'scariest', 'only', 'sheer', 'unwanted', 'immortal', 'imperial', 'spectacular', 'bottom', 'top', 'original', 'great', 'special', 'musical', 'overall', 'original', 'well', 'first', 'small', 'blockbuster', 'original', 'next', 'good', 'rare', 'entertaining', 'deep', 'same', 'sheer', 'first', 'last', 'bad', 'few', 'same'];0.233087283087283

218;Med-Jasta;"that's what i called this when i was too small to reach the movies in my house. my poor mother had to decipher that description. just as important as a new hope was to movies, empire strikes back is to sequels. and why? because lucas paid for this himself. no one has ever been in his position before. to make huge movies that are financed by the creator. no studio would ever allow a movie like this, it took risks: it's not a rehash, its darker, a realistic puppet was a serious main character and a lot of the story is left in the air. but while this movie is darker than it's predecessor it's not a dark movie, its just darker. people seem to forget that. it's a more serious story but it's still able to maintain the fun feel of 4. it also continues the speed from 4 as well. instead of getting in huge fights they are just small scuffles. this doesn't feel for a second that it's trying to outdo the original. the story and the characters are expanded and deepened. yoda was a huge risk, it's hard for us to think of a puppet not being taken seriously, but no one had ever attempted to make a life like puppet before. and sequels weren't a sure cash in either. in order for this movie to break even it had to be the most successful sequel of all time. it's these things that lucas gave us. he not only knows how to tell a story and make a great movie but he takes risks to do it at the same time. he did this his whole career. if this movie failed not only was star wars dead but so was lucas' career. that'll motivate you. my favorite sw set is in this, the carbon freezing chamber. i don't know if it's the steam, the orange light or the vastness but i love this room. everyone looks cool here. especially the stormtroopers, their white really illuminates the orange well. and you get vader and boba in here too. the snow troopers are very cool. i can't figure out if i like them or the episode 3 clones best. lando is a great addition because he's the han that could have been. and lando gets crap for being bad but he really does make the best call. he appeases vader to save his life while still giving himself the freedom to save han in the end. and he hasn't seen han in years maybe he's become a real , the last time he saw him he was a smuggler after all. and billy dee is great, i don't know if anyone is as effortlessly smooth as this guy. 3p0 in pieces is a great addition that provides endless jokes. i love han's love story with leah because she's given him no indication that she's interested. and he acts like they have this dating history. but he is right because she does want him. and the best part of the movie: yoda/training. not only is yoda the most powerful jedi of all but you hang on his every word of wisdom. lines repeated for my entire life. i have always loved the fact that the most powerful jedi was the smallest. there's just something about that idea that really gets me. and there's really something to be said for the fact that yoda is not actually real. we all know that frank oz did the voice and puppeteered yoda but the fact that yoda is not actually real really helps to make his character real. it's not necessarily frank oz as yoda, what you see is the little green puppet as yoda. there aren't pictures of him at studio 54 or news of him getting married. yoda is yoda. when he is not being the puppet on screen he doesn't exist which really helps to his reality. the biggest complaint since lucas finished the saga was that ""i am your father,"" is now not a surprise any more. which is true, you do know, but watching them in order you'll probably be surprised that anakin turns to the dark side. and it might be a surprise that vader tells luke this because as far as we know vader doesn't know who luke is. he doesn't even know that he has a kid. and we think that anakin is dead. i don't know... only time will tell with people who watch these in episode order";14 April 2020;10;['small', 'poor', 'important', 'new', 'huge', 'realistic', 'serious', 'main', 'dark', 'dark', 'dark', 'serious', 'able', 'huge', 'small', 'original', 'huge', 'hard', 'sure', 'successful', 'great', 'same', 'whole', 'dead', 'lucas', 'favorite', 'orange', 'cool', 'cool', 'great', 'bad', 'good', 'real', 'last', 'great', 'smooth', 'great', 'endless', 'interested', 'right', 'good', 'powerful', 'entire', 'powerful', 'small', 'real', 'frank', 'real', 'real', 'frank', 'little', 'green', 'big', 'more', 'true', 'surprised', 'dark', 'dead', 'only'];0.1671618475863759

224;OttoVonB;it is 3 years after episode iv and the rebels are on the run from the empire. luke skywalker explores his jedi heritage only to be confronted with disturbing truths, darth vader continues his quest tom punish the rebels, and han and leia are on the run. the galaxy has become a much darker, more dangerous place. after a traumatizing experience directing the first star wars film, series creator george lucas vowed he would stay away from the camera this time, and crank up his degree of control. because, while production had been misery, young george had negotiated the shrewdest deal in film history: exclusive rights on all star wars related content and derived products. when star wars became not just a hit but the hit of the century, mr lucas held all the cards. while the subsequent creation of a prequel trilogy might taint the whole story in retrospect, one should admire george lucas for opting to be as faithful to his story as possible, and for deploying unprecedented independent power to back his vision. so lucas enlisted director irvin kershner as well as writers leigh brackett and lawrence kadan and put them to work. lucas kept his focus on overall production and the effects work, the complexity of which far exceeded anything attempted 3 years prior. the result, any star wars fan will concede, is not just the finest film in the series but one of the best sequels ever made. much like the benchmark godfather part ii, it builds on and deepens the themes of its predecessor while exploring new, unchartered territory. it also took many brave narrative risks, most of them ruined by the unnecessary prequels. it gave the characters new depth and resonance, along with some of the most memorable dialogue in a series not often noted for its language or performances. watching the bad guys have their day can be a thrilling experience and, as the title implies, this is the empire's film through and through. vader is at his most enigmatic and evil, and john williams already legendary score achieves new heights unrivaled since. this is everything you could possibly want from a sequel to the greatest space opera in existence.;20 September 2002;10;['disturbing', 'dark', 'dangerous', 'first', 'young', 'shrewd', 'exclusive', 'related', 'derived', 'subsequent', 'prequel', 'whole', 'faithful', 'possible', 'unprecedented', 'independent', 'overall', 'fine', 'good', 'benchmark', 'new', 'unchartered', 'many', 'brave', 'narrative', 'most', 'unnecessary', 'new', 'memorable', 'bad', 'enigmatic', 'evil', 'legendary', 'new', 'great'];0.1305836139169472

and must report to vader. the falcon has docked aboard the avenger until they can fly away undetected to a safe place. han tells leia the way they will escape is when the avenger dumps it's trash, then we will float away undetected along with the rest of the trash. in the meantime they must search for a safe port to land, in the onenid system. they find bespin, which is home to cloud city. han is familiar with it's administrator, lando calrissian ( billy dee williams). inside the avenger, darth vader employs a few bounty hunters to find the falcon. a substantial reward await the one who finds it. among them is boba fett ( jeremy bulloch). he is the mandorolian, who vows to make good on vader's promise. when the trash is released, the falcon detaches; and heads for cloud city, not realizing boba fett is behind them, in slave 1. luke's is now training successfully, but it is suddenly interrupted when he sees visions of the future. he tells yoda he must go and save them, but yoda demands he must stay and complete his training. luke promises he will return, and fly's off. once the falcon arrives in bespin air space, the four are met with numerous cloud city pod cars. they are authorizing them for a landing permit which they don't have. it gets a little uneasy, but finally they get permission to land. they are instructed to land on platform a, i believe. once they get out of the falcon there is no one there to greet them-strange. this makes leia very uneasy, and han gets upset with her. a few minutes pass, finally lando along with his trusted aide lobot( jack hollis ) arrive. at first, it looks like it could be an angry reunion, but lando welcomes them, especially leia. while in cloud city han and lando catch up on old times, han tells lando the falcon needs repairs. leia senses something is wrong especially when 3po goes missing. when han and leia are alone waiting for lando, she tells han something just isn't right. when chewy comes in he is carring c-3po, he's been blown into parts. leia hopes chewy can fix him fast. lando comes in notices the droid and says something, but he wanted han and leia to join him in a refreshment first. once they arrive to dine, the door opens up. there is vader, fett, and stromtroopers and they surround them. lando said he had no choice but to turn them in, lando was offered a deal to fix his own problems. when han and leia are held captive lando tells the two, vader doesn't want them; but skywalker. leia and han realize they are bait and will experience torture while there. vader tests the carbon freezing chamber on han successfully. han is frozen and given fett. the chamber is reset for the emperor's real prize- skywalker. when the deal lando made with vader keeps changing for the worse. he realizes he must do something to save his friend, but it's too late. vader gets news that an x-wing is approaching, he tells the commander to allow skywalker to land. once luke lands, he notices leia. leia shouts it's a trap. luke will find vader confront him in a light-saber duel; and realizes the truth about vader. it's up to leia, lando, and chewy must conjure a plan in order to find han. the empire strikes back is the best of the original trilogy. it is packed with action, adventure, and a big surprise. i also thought that bespin( cloud city ) was awesome, along with the introduction of boba fett.";5 March 2018;10;['several', 'strong', 'rebel', 'imperial', 'rebel', 'complete', 'successful', 'first', 'reluctant', 'other', 'new', 'jedi', 'right', 'slick', 'huge', 'safe', 'low', 'new', 'dark', 'powerful', 'great', 'tough', 'turbulent', 'noticeable', 'x', 'wing', 'deep', 'angry', 'hopeless', 'x', 'free', 'terrifying', 'able', 'free', 'fatal', 'undetected', 'safe', 'undetected', 'safe', 'familiar', 'few', 'substantial', 'boba', 'good', 'numerous', 'little', 'uneasy', 'strange', 'uneasy', 'upset', 'few', 'angry', 'old', 'wrong', 'right', 'vader', 'own', 'captive', 'real', 'bad', 'late', 'luke', 'light', 'good', 'original', 'big', 'awesome'];0.1283577841911174

234;mmallon4;"the empire strikes back is my least favourite of the original trilogy, i guess i just prefer the more light-hearted nature of a new hope and return of the jedi (plus when has darkness become a measure of quality?), as well as the sense of closure given by those films but calling it my least favourite is like saying this pizza with 19 slices of pepperoni is it not as good as this pizza with 20 slices of pepperoni. it's appropriate that the second part of the three-act story is the dark entry so the more light-hearted third act can act as a release from the darkness and despair. imagine if star wars went in the direction of the planet of the apes franchise? it's a miracle the studio had no input into the film, creating the movie sequel all movie sequels aspire to be. what if it was a rushed out sequel titled star wars ii? if jaws started the trend of blockbusters and star wars cemented it, then the empire strikes back was the final step in the birth of the blockbusters, by cementing the rules behind the art of the movie sequel (and creating the subtitle any movie sequel wishes they had). however, could the film's quality also due to lucas not having any input into the writing or directing of the film? the empire strikes back is a film of more advanced directorial prowess than a new hope in this ridiculously fast-paced movie. right from the start, you can tell the characters within the empire strikes back are much deeper than the first film. han and leia are simply one of the greatest romances in all of cinema; the classic tale of two who pretend to hate each other but are secretly in love, a trope as old as cinema. watch as the two engage in the hottest moments of a generally a-sexual franchise. it's no surprise the two are posed in the manner of rhett butler and scarlet o'hara on the film's poster. yet the empire strikes back introduces the closest thing to rivaling the coolness of han solo in the form of lando calrissian played by billy dee williams, to inject some smooth blaxploitation vibes into the star wars universe (not to mention the beauty of the cloud city theme). the planets in star wars are like characters themselves from the tundra of hoth providing a counter to the deserts of tatooine, to the intimacy and poignancy to the scenes on the swamp planet dagobah and its one (as far as we know) lowly inhabitant. yoda really is a perfect creation, like obi-wan, you do wonder if everything he says is full of nonsense when you break it down but it doesn't matter. it's just a shame the perception of the character has become bastardized because of the prequels. plus what is it about stop-motion that is just endlessly appealing to look at from the long shots of the tauntauns to those majestic herds of impending was elephants known of at-ats during the battle of hoth. the manner in which the stop motion doesn't have the full fluid motion of live action movement but not to the point that it looks choppy is a visual i never tire off. although the darkest, the empire strikes back is the funniest film of the series. c-3po constantly telling people about the improbability of escaping the situation they're getting themselves into, to han's many sarcastic whips never fails to get a laugh. plus the movie keeps teasing you that you're going to get to see that iconic jump to light speed shot from the first film, making it all the more satisfying when you finally do get to see it. even darth vader is significantly deepened as a character in the empire strikes back, thanks in part to him getting his own theme music to strike the fear of impending authoritarianism into your heart, but also thanks to certain plot twist.""i am your father"", the most well-known piece of pop culture knowledge. is there anyone in the civilised world who doesn't know darth vader is luke skywalker's father? should we try and preserve the secrecy of these plot twists so future generations can enjoy the surprise?";4 May 2015;10;['least', 'original', 'light', 'hearted', 'new', 'least', 'favourite', 'good', 'appropriate', 'second', 'dark', 'light', 'third', 'rushed', 'final', 'due', 'advanced', 'directorial', 'new', 'deep', 'first', 'great', 'classic', 'other', 'old', 'hot', 'sexual', 'scarlet', 'close', 'smooth', 'swamp', 'inhabitant', 'perfect', 'full', 'long', 'majestic', 'full', 'fluid', 'live', 'choppy', 'visual', 'dark', 'many', 'sarcastic', 'iconic', 'light', 'first', 'satisfying', 'own', 'certain', 'civilised', 'future'];0.2146438878581735

237;Puroo;just before the release of rise of the skywalker, i had decided to watch every single star wars movie so that i could finally understand the memes and also catch up on time. so as i watched the empire strikes back, i was actually really disappointed. because of how much people speak about it, i was expecting it to be something more than that. but as i grew up, i started appreciating it more and more. why i hated it earlier and why i like it now, i'll explain it further in the review. back when i saw this movie for the first time, i was getting more and more surprised at every scene. i had heard about all the characters like yoda, darth vader, han solo, chewbacca, r2d2, c3po etc, but i didn't know what was their deal. i did know yoda was a green guy who was very skilled, but i didn't know anything else about him. this is the reason why i liked his introduction so much. the problem was, however, that i already knew he was yoda. so all that acting, i wasn't going to buy it. similarly the darth vader scene was a huge bummer. the way people used to describe it was as if he removes his mask and says it with an emotional background music. but instead he just simply speaks it out in a claustrophobic environment, with the background music completely quenching the impact. it was in no way as good as everyone described it. i might have liked the scene if i didn't already know about it, which basically shows how this movie suffered from the success it received. the camera quality has also aged very poorly. i don't know why, but somehow i just can't watch old movies. i get bored and start feeling sleepy very quickly. it happened as i watched episode iv, it happened as i watched superman and it happened as i watched the godfather. i actually slept at the part where luke is training on yoda's planet. this is the first movie ever that i watched in two different days. once as i slept and once after i woke up the next day. and somehow it left such an impact that even today i feel sleepy whenever i watch any star wars movie. with all the bad things said, now let's move on to why i like this movie now. first of all the whole idea of a space opera is so awesome. i have always been very much into astronomy since i was a kid so an entire movie series made around this is something like a dream for me. i can imagine this could also be true for many kids in the 60's and 70's. the cgi is quite awesome for the time. like i said about the darth vader scene or the yoda scene, they must have looked so cool when they were seen for the first time. the part where han is embossed rises too much tension, since he's such a likeable character and now he's at stake. if george lucas went by his multiple movies idea instead of a franchise then this could have been such an awesome take. i feel really mad at myself that i learnt about all the spoilers from this movie except for han getting embossed. i wish i could rewatch this after having removed everything i know from my memory. this movie should be re-released in 4k hdr so that i don't fall asleep while watching it again. it is a pinnacle in the star wars series and i really hope the franchise can return back to this level.;30 June 2021;7;['single', 'disappointed', 'much', 'more', 'more', 'first', 'more', 'surprised', 'green', 'skilled', 'huge', 'emotional', 'claustrophobic', 'good', 'old', 'bored', 'sleepy', 'first', 'different', 'next', 'sleepy', 'bad', 'whole', 'awesome', 'entire', 'true', 'many', 'awesome', 'cool', 'first', 'much', 'likeable', 'multiple', 'awesome', 'mad', 'asleep'];0.1630184331797235

'star wars' even created the entire concept of the modern day blockbuster and influenced hundreds of films after it, is the biggest movie in the history of popular culture and created a new religion. a recent poll in britain asked people to identify their religion and a substantial portion of them wrote in ""jedi knight"".

243;Thrashman88;"having read most of the comments herein, i must agree that ""the empire strikes back"" is the best movie from the original trilogy. the acting, effects, story and most noticeably, the music, surpass far and away the original (and that is saying a lot!!!). though it's obvious ""empire"" would not be the classic it is were not for the first star wars, it still manages to stand high on its own. as a music lover, i must say the the original ""empire"" soundtrack has to be john willimas best musical score ever. the ominous ""imperial march"" (also known as darth vader's theme) was so strong, that its motif has appeared in all subsequent films, including ""the phantom menace"". same goes for the love theme of han and leia, yoda's theme, and the list goes on. on the acting side, harrison ford's acting on this one was his most mature performance out of all star wars movies. his performance on ""return of the jedi"" looked watered down compared to this one. same goes for carrie fisher's performance. in ""return"" she looks tamed and subdued, a far cry from the bossy, devil-may-care attitude of the first one and ""empire"". and mark hammil's acting on this one was his most solid and convincing. it's weird that ""empire"" worked so well, since most of director irving keshner's movies are always a bit contrived. he also did ""robocop 2"", but that was a mess (thanx in part to the plotless script and last minute re-writes).

246;rollernerd;"welcome to another edition of adam's reviews!! **queue in intro music** ""adventure, excitement a jedi craves not these things"" tonight's movie review is star wars episode v - the empire strikes back (1980) where we find the evil lord darth vader on the search for luke skywalker at any cost. the empire are also at their most menacing after the events of the previous film where the death star was destroyed and are hunting down the rebels. this chapter also continues the journey of young luke skywalker to become a jedi. we start on the ice and snowy planet hoth where luke encounters a wampa who captures him and ties him upside down in order to eat him. the gang are concerned and han goes out looking for the missing luke. here we get to witness a glimpse of the force and the ""ghost"" force of obi-wan-kenobi. once luke is rescued and taken back to the rebel base, the planet is under threat by the empire and soon a battle commences with the rebels fighting with the imperial at-at walkers. the walker machines themselves are so creatively made and give the extra punch to the battle. this film soon splits up the heroes where luke and r2 travel to a distant swamp planet so luke can receive further jedi training from master yoda. the problem is, yoda does not want to teach him how to become a jedi, since he finds luke extremely impatient and can sense luke's anger similar to his father anakin. obi wan tries to change yoda's mind, but only when luke promises to really gives his best, yoda accepts the challenge. the training sequence with luke and master yoda were excellent and epic. one of the greatest lines in the series are found in this film given by yoda, ""do or do not, there is no try."" the degobah set is just one of the best sets ever. it looks like a real environment. it's dirty, slimy and foggy and makes you wonder why yoda would ever want to live there in the first place. luke has this dark vision of himself battling vader, which is a vision of the future that might happen and kills vader and sees himself in the helmet, just before it explodes. meanwhile, han, leia, chewie and c3po are on the run and with the falcon's hyperdrive broken, they are chased by the empire's tie fighter. the gang are also trying to escape imperial battleships and use different manoeuvres including flying through asteroid fields. we see han's pilot capabilities including hiding in one of the asteroid rocks which happened to be a giant alien creature's stomach. han solo and princess leia maintain the personalities that they developed in new hope and we get to see a love/hate relationship between the two of them, where neither one of them wants to admit their feelings for the other. this romantic subplot is characterized perfectly and both actors have the chemistry to show their feelings for each other grow more and more as the film progresses. darth vader is defs badass evil in this film which can be demonstrated with his lack of patience for failure among his fleet. yeppp the scene where he force chokes those who fail him one after the other. he promotes an imperial guard to a higher rank and there's just this look of fear on this guard's face. so manyyyy things happen in this film, we get see lando calrissian, a smuggler who is looking after the people on cloud city and an old acquaintance of solo and chewie. we get to see bobba fett and vader together, we see the emperor in a hologram talking to darth vader and towards the end of the film we have the startling revelations which reveals the origins of young skywalker. the scene when solo is about to be carbon frozen and we see leia taking the chance to let emotions go with providing cheesy romantic moment by saying 'i love you' just before han is lowered into the freezing chamber, and he saves the moment by responding, ""i know""....chillss...typical han solo way. the movie from start to end was mind blowing, the direction is creative, the characters feel real, the nature of the force is explored more without losing its mysticism and the pacing is fast and more intense than its predecessor. darker and more mature with great effects for an 80's movie, appealing characters and lots of spellbinding action. the storyline is tighter, and goes much deeper into character development. the performances are terrific, especially by harrison ford and billy dee williams. the scenes between luke and yoda are just timeless along with the lightsabre duel between darth vader and luke skywalker, which is truly one of the most suspenseful and dramatic scenes in the entire saga. overall 8.6/10.";4 May 2021;8;['evil', 'luke', 'menacing', 'previous', 'young', 'snowy', 'rebel', 'imperial', 'extra', 'distant', 'further', 'impatient', 'similar', 'good',

248;I_Am_The_Taylrus;"spoilers now, for such a film like this i am going to do a much longer comment than i usually do. it is not going to be as large as my older comments but this is still a fair size none the less. anyway, about the film, this is not the best movie of all time, but is it the best star wars movie of all time? i think so. this is of course the fifth star wars movies, but the second in the order of release. first, the acting. the acting is fantastic. each character has more depth than they use to, too. there was also no cheesy lines, unlike star wars iv. star wars iv had a really cheesy line, but i mentioned that particular line in my comment for iv. secondly, the special effects. the special effects are really cleaned up and polished to make everything in the movie look nice and smooth. the effects are also ahead of its time, which is definitely a good thing. the lightsaber effects are also brilliantly done. the hyperspace scenes also look amazing and are incredible to look at, and look way better than the original star wars movie, but that was made in 1977 and this was made in 1980, so i am not complaining. thirdly, the plot. the plot itself is much darker than the plot for the original star wars. the plot is one of the many reasons why this is the darkest star wars movie. revenge of the sith is the second darkest, but this plot is brilliant and well-written. it is also more difficult. here is the plot. sith lord darth vader is after luke skywalker. after a battle on the planet hoth luke takes personal jedi-training lessons of the force from master yoda, who is a brilliant and small green little jedi master who is over eight hundred years old. meanwhile, han solo and princess leia and chewbacca and c3-po and r2d2 go to cloud city where han's friend lando calarissian is. the only problem is that it is a trap. darth vader is there and captures them. he forces han to lure luke there. luke goes to cloud city to rescue them. darth vader wants to put luke in a freezing chamber. they test it out on han. he becomes frozen and it taken by bounty hunter boba fett. then, lando, leia, chewbacca, c3-po, and r2d2 escape. after that, luke goes into the freezing chamber. darth vader is there waiting for him. they have a lightsaber duel. vader cuts off luke's hand and tells him that he is his father. luke does not believe him obviously. vader persuades him to come to the dark side. luke escapes and is rescued by leia. luke gets a mechanical hand and they set out to find han. overall, this is the most perfect star wars movie ever made. you can not go wrong with this film. everything is prefect, especially the famous lines. ""no, i am your father."" that is one of the biggest twists ever in a land of some pretty big twists. well, there are not a lot of big twists these days, but that line is still one of the biggest twists in american movie history. anyway, this is one of the best sci-fi movies ever made. any movie fan will love this. 10/10 recommended films: star wars v.";27 April 2007;10;['long', 'large', 'old', 'fair', 'good', 'good', 'fifth', 'second', 'fantastic', 'more', 'particular', 'special', 'special', 'nice', 'smooth', 'good', 'amazing', 'incredible', 'original', 'dark', 'original', 'many', 'dark', 'second', 'brilliant', 'difficult', 'personal', 'brilliant', 'small', 'green', 'little', 'old', 'only', 'freezing', 'frozen', 'freezing', 'dark', 'mechanical', 'perfect', 'wrong', 'prefect', 'famous', 'big', 'big', 'big', 'big', 'american', 'good'];0.2525651927437641

253;luke-a-mcgowan;in many ways, the empire strikes back is the perfect sequel. but before i begin, let me get one thing out of the way. this is not the best star wars film of all time. that honour lies with the original, which it always will. there's a multitude of great scenes here, but i can and will argue that every one of them is derived from the original. in case the original star wars lulled you into a false sense of security - the death star is destroyed, tarkin is dead and vader is lost in space - empire strikes back (the name says it all) opens with the iconic battle of hoth, where the rebels are once again on the run from an empire with superior numbers and firepower. everything about this battle sets the mood of empire - most of which is spent on the run. if your heart isn't beating faster than usual when vader is walking up to the millennium falcon, then you're straight up lying. there's no point wasting space talking about the performances in empire strikes back, because hamill, fisher, ford, daniel and the actors behind vader are just as good in this film as they were in the original. ford and fisher's on screen chemistry is what every movie couple aspires to be - it is not only believable but obvious that the princess falls for the scoundrel solo. frank oz joins the cast as the delightful yoda, and his performance is perfect both in yoda's wisest and most comedic moments. see also billy dee williams, who became one of the franchise's most beloved characters in such a small amount of time. williams' easy smile and commanding delivery shows us very clearly why he was in the conversation for the role of han solo. the reason that empire strikes back is the perfect sequel is that it delves deeper into the parts we wanted to know more about. yoda warns us that luke is not right to be a jedi, and then we watch luke make the very mistakes yoda was warning him about. vader is built into an incredible villain in this movie - he knows luke is his son and he still maims him. one of the things i loved in this movie was the similarity of vader's approach to admiral ozell and captain needa's failures. ozell is a buffoon and needa an honest and upfront man willing to accept responsibility, and they both meet the same fate. its a small thing, but it says so much about vader's lack of empathy. kershner is a very skilled director, probably the best in the franchise. some of my favourite directed scenes include the devastating duel between luke and vader, where it is immediately obvious that luke is out of his depth, and the incredible scene in which vader's human head is revealed to the audience. a facial expression or change in body language is enough to speak volumes to the audience. i'm not in love with empire strikes back. i find hoth's yeti, the giant asteroid worm, and the community's bizarre obsession with boba fett to be rather annoying. i also found hoth, dagobah and bespin to be relatively flat and uninspired worlds by star wars standards. but they are all such tiny things in what is obviously an incredible film - the film that gave me my name.

263;illbebackreviews;"after i watched episode iv, i had high hopes for this movie and thankfully it did not disappoint me at all. the very first scene once again got me into the movie with luke skywalker patrolling the hoth base. immediately, we are thrown into mystery and suspense. slowly, lucas reveals certain things and luke is attacked. we are then told of a hidden rebel base on the snowy mountain of hoth. after a probe droid investigates the area, its destroyed and this gives the empire a chance to get revenge on the destruction of the death star. han solo continues to be a mystery. he seems like he may just leave, but turns back to save the day. that scene with luke using all the power he had to get the lightsaber off the snow was one legendary scene as the music build up just steals it! the battle of hoth then ensues. again, it doesn't focus on special effects. and we see some at-at's and some rebel ships led by luke skywalker. we see a new imperial leader by the name of veers. the tension is in the air for some really special film. after han, leia and chewie along with the two droids escape hoth from vader, we are immediately into the story. vader pursues the millennium falcon and hires bounty hunters to bring han to him in order to get luke to the dark side (that's after they figure out he's strong with the force). luke goes to dagobah and every scene there had something very special. the scene with yoda lifting up luke's tie fighter was one legendary scene. this was the yoda. a mystery to all. his quote ""size matters not"" has now being destroyed in the prequels where he jumps around to make up for his size. eventually, luke falls for vader's trap and gets himself to bespin. han is betrayed by his friend lando to vader. vader prepares to carbonate him and test it to see if it will kill or not. after han is frozen, luke arrives and sets for the most legendary lightsaber duel of all time (not that prequel crap). this scene between luke and vader has so much tension and emotion that the prequels lacked. the scenes with lando, leia and chewie getting off bespin was also cool. i mean, how much cooler could lando be? he's the second best sw character to me now! eventually the film ends on a cliff hanger setting the events of episode vi. this worked well and ends my review of one of the all time best films.";17 October 2012;10;['high', 'first', 'hoth', 'certain', 'rebel', 'snowy', 'legendary', 'special', 'rebel', 'new', 'imperial', 'special', 'dark', 'strong', 'special', 'legendary', 'legendary', 'prequel', 'much', 'cool', 'much', 'cool', 'second', 'good', 'good'];0.4244359562006621
264;Lewis_Heather787;yes this is the best that i believe star wars has to offer and this has to be the best movie sequel ever made as well, improving whereto original had already knocked it out of the park. irvin kershner at the time was an interesting choice as the director to the sequel of on of the biggest movies ever made, but what a fantastic choice is was. the reason why choosing kershner as director was so brilliant was because of his background in film making. his films were much character driven with lots of emotion and heart to them, nothing that twas at the scale of star wars . characters are ultimately what make star wars so great, its the attention to detail, wit, charm and interactions that make them so enjoyable to watch. irvin not only delivers on this he excels and produces a star wars film that no one could have predicted. this film has such a good contrast between the shots in this film, however neither one carries the film more than the other. from the huge opening on hoth to the more intimate moments between han and leia this never misses a beat. next the story which is much much darker than the original film, and doesn't it work brilliantly with the subject matter at hand. the story has the rebellion on the run from there victory against the death star and they have been chased across the galaxy, the desolate world shows how desperate the rebels are. the story does has a lot of these small things that add up to one big overall theme of desperation and fear that holds you throughout the film. which adds to the tension that know of the characters are safe form danger and that any one of them could killed any minute, fantastic tension builder. more broadly this film is dark,complex,interesting and rich. not only does this film hit its infamous special effect action scenes but also knocks out of the park its emotion story line as well, a truly iconic film and story. if you thought that the groundbreaking special effects in star wars were amazing the sequel to that film somehow managed to better it. the opening battle on hoth is one of cinemas greatest openings to a film and never lets down. the effects still to this day hold up and are a thrill to watch, it really shows the scope of this film. ever single effect in this film doesn't look out of this place and adds an element of wonder at times and also horror, which is extremely effective in the scenes. there are two final positives of the film, firstly the performances in the film are brilliant. needless to say that all of the returning cast are really good and also build on their characters from the first film. not surprising there are two characters that have more of an impact in this film than others and those characters are luke and vader. from the training with yoda to the showdown with vader at the end of the film, mark hamill delivers a more mature aspect to the character who is ready to make the transition from rebel to jedi. he also shows the physicality to match the change as well never showing physical weakness throughout the film. vader, in the first film he was just the villain of the film and not much more. this film however elevates vader to a new level and shows much more depth to the character that he was missing in the first film. he is everything he is in the first and more much much more. oh yeah and he is luke's father.......oh spoiler alert for if you've been living under a rock, to be fair if you watch films 1 to 6 you already know that anyway before you reach 5. the film positive is once again the score by john williams which is perfection, the score in this film adds so much in every scene no matter how small or big the scene is there is always a memorable theme to it through the score. finally this film is the best star wars film and in my opinion wouldn't ever be beaten, 90 out of 100% a true icon of cinema and the best sequel in history. director,story actors,effects and score are all at there top of their game none of them fault at once, true greatness!;29 December 2016;9;['good', 'good', 'interesting', 'big', 'fantastic', 'brilliant', 'much', 'great', 'enjoyable', 'good', 'more', 'other', 'huge', 'intimate', 'dark', 'original', 'subject', 'desolate', 'desperate', 'small', 'big', 'overall', 'safe', 'fantastic', 'dark', 'complex', 'interesting', 'rich', 'infamous', 'special', 'iconic', 'groundbreaking', 'special', 'amazing', 'great', 'single', 'effective', 'final', 'brilliant', 'needless', 'good', 'first', 'surprising', 'more', 'mature', 'ready', 'physical', 'first', 'more', 'new', 'more', 'first', 'first', 'more', 'fair', 'positive', 'small', 'big', 'memorable', 'good', 'true', 'good', 'true'];0.297747113997114

267;jerekra;"i love the star wars films as a whole. however i feel that the empire strikes back is easily the greatest film of the series and one of the greatest films ever made. the rebels are forced to flee from the ice planet of hoth after the imperials discovered their hideout there. solo, leia, chewbacca, and c 3p0 take off in the millennium falcon. luke meanwhile travels to the dagobah system to learn from the jedi master yoda. darth vader then puts all his efforts into capturing the millennium falcon as to lure skywalker to him. vader then plans to turn skywalker over to the dark side of the force. the main reason for this film being awesome is that there is so much going on. there really is no main setting and instead see various awesome settings. the ice planet hoth, swampy dagobah system, asteroid field, cloud city of bespin; it just is great how there are so many different places where action takes place in this film. the action in this film is legendary. battle of hoth is awesome and the imperial at at walkers are really a spectacle to behold. the asteroid field chase with the millennium falcon is also great. also who can forget the legendary lightsaber duel at the end between darth vader and luke skywalker. i certainly never will forget that duel, to me that is the best moment in star wars history. this film does an awesome job developing characters. solo and leia develop a romantic relationship that i think fits the film well. also the character of chewbacca is portrayed more as a great companion and useful at helping out rather than just as a lumbering brute as he is in the first film. luke starts to use the force more and develop into a jedi. darth vader also goes from being just an evil villain in the first film and becomes a legendary villain also capable of making outstanding strategies. vader in this film is the greatest villain i have seen in a film and the way that he is portrayed in this film is awesome and the best portrayal of a villain in a film. new characters are added in this film. lando calrissen gets his first appearance. i do not really like or dislike lando that much. yoda make his first appearance in the star wars franchise. who can not like yoda? yoda is easily one of the most powerful presences in a film and a master of the force. frank oz does an awesome job portraying yoda. but to me the best new character in this film is boba fett. fett is a great bounty hunter who will hunt down people in constant pursuit. fett is my favorite star wars character and he adds to the films overall tone of suspense and unease in this film. the music is phenomenal in this film. this is the first film to use the imperial march song and that film goes great with darth vader. when it is played at the same time as when vader is on screen it is outstanding. easily one of the best musical scores ever in a film, hats off to john williams. deserved to win an award for composer of the year. great music, action, lots going on, character development, great new characters, this film is the best sequel ever made and also the best of the star wars films. recommended to the highest.";11 April 2009;10;['great', 'great', 'dark', 'main', 'awesome', 'much', 'main', 'various', 'awesome', 'swampy', 'great', 'many', 'different', 'legendary', 'awesome', 'imperial', 'great', 'legendary', 'good', 'awesome', 'romantic', 'more', 'great', 'useful', 'lumbering', 'first', 'evil', 'first', 'legendary', 'capable', 'outstanding', 'great', 'awesome', 'good', 'new', 'first', 'much', 'first', 'powerful', 'awesome', 'good', 'new', 'great', 'constant', 'favorite', 'overall', 'phenomenal', 'first', 'imperial', 'great', 'same', 'outstanding', 'good', 'musical', 'great', 'great', 'new', 'good', 'good', 'high'];0.4815263748597082

288;BadWebDiver;"i'm probably gonna be the most unfashionable & despised reviewer alive for saying this, but i am not a huge fan of this episode. in fact, i consider it to be the weakest in the story. now, when you've stopped hyperventilating, i'll explain why. the worst scene i feel is when luke and han say goodbye to each other at the ice hanger. one copy of the script i read says that they gaze at each other with a ""deep sense of admiration for the other's wisdom and heroic endeavor"" (- or something like that). well i'm sorry, but all i could see were two truculent teenagers behaving like immature brats. the sexual tension between han and leia had, imho, been ham-fistedly set up almost from the first scene. in a hectic rush, it felt like the audience was banged over the head that there was ""unresolved chemistry"" between the two characters - almost straight out of a dime novel. which leads to the big farewell scene, and we get that sullen sour look from han as he and luke say ""well, see ya"". (wow - high quality drama!) **spoiler warning** and to top that off, just look at how luke behaves with yoda. after leaving hoth, he has this determined quest to find this mysterious individual he's never met, breaking rebel orders in the process. then when he crash-lands on the planet, he seems to go into a hissy fit when everything isn't quite what he expected. then this little green man (believe it or not!), turns up and asks if the young man wants any help. there's some comic schtick as the little fellow bumbles around in the camp, with luke harping like a nanny throughout. then the guy beckons the hero to follows him back to the hut. and luke, ""with a deep sense of destiny"", follows him. they arrive at a little forest house. luke whines about the situation, and then - (tada!)- we find out that the little fellow is ... yoda! (could see that one coming a mile away!!!) so our interstellar hero is then all gushing and plaintive - practically fawning over the little guy!. geez, the whole episode plays like a two-bit soap. if this is supposed to be the best episode in the series; well i'm sorry, but i'd rather stick to the original. at least that had some style and a tight whup-ass plot! and the sexual tension was handled more subtly, with a tinge of comedy.";24 October 2004;6;['unfashionable', 'despised', 'alive', 'huge', 'weak', 'bad', 'other', 'other', 'deep', 'other', 'heroic', 'sorry', 'immature', 'sexual', 'imho', 'first', 'hectic', 'unresolved', 'big', 'sullen', 'sour', 'high', 'luke', 'mysterious', 'rebel', 'hissy', 'little', 'green', 'young', 'comic', 'little', 'fellow', 'deep', 'little', 'little', 'interstellar', 'little', 'whole', 'good', 'sorry', 'original', 'least', 'tight', 'sexual'];0.0005915178571428

293;Vimacone;"star wars instantly became en grained in popular culture when it first premiered. i could imagine the anticipation moviegoers had when the first sequel was released. sequels rarely match or surpass the originals, but the empire strikes back is considered the greatest sequels for good reason. instead of rehashing the plot elements and formula from the first, it builds upon it, with more suspense and unexpected twists. granted, in this case it was part of a lengthily saga that called for more than one movie to tell the entire story. of the films from the original trilogy, return of the jedi has always been my personal favorite, but this one has a more compelling story with danger, excitement, solid character development, and the unexpected twists that would leave audiences anticipating more in the next installment. luke's introduction to and training under yoda has many iconic scenes and dialog. i was always amused when a swamp monster attempted to eat r2-d2 and then spit him out (""luckily you don't taste very good""). harrison ford's performance as the cynical han solo is excellent as always. the romance that builds between him and leia was entertaining. the best sequences were at the end, when lando unwillingly sets up our heroes at the cloud city for darth vader. i like how c3po is the first to become aware of it before the others do as well as the audience. i especially thought lando's revelation to leia and han about vader setting up a trap for luke was well delivered. luke's battle with vader was epic and terrifying along with an iconic and frequently parodied revelation. his timely rescue by leia and landa foreshadowed another revelation for the following film. i can see why this has been a favorite among star wars fans. what makes this one especially strong is that it ends in a cliffhanger. i can also imagine audiences anticipating the next film to see what happened next.";9 December 2017;9;['popular', 'first', 'great', 'good', 'first', 'more', 'unexpected', 'lengthily', 'more', 'entire', 'original', 'personal', 'compelling', 'solid', 'unexpected', 'next', 'many', 'iconic', 'amused', 'good', 'cynical', 'excellent', 'entertaining', 'good', 'first', 'aware', 'epic', 'timely', 'favorite', 'star', 'strong', 'next'];0.3324404761904761

295;martinpersson97;whenever one of the few good movie sequels comes out, it is (rightfully) held in comparison to this sequel to star wars (1977). not only is it one of, or maybe even the best sequel ever made, but also one of the best movies of all time. star wars was a lighthearted adventure, full of memorable characters, groundbreaking special effects and conciously campy plot of a colorful group of heroes fighting an evil empire led by a dark lord and prevailing at the end. the empire strikes back sets itself apart from that right off the bat, when the empire takes revenge for their loss, utterly crushing the rebellion in an epic battle on the ice world of hoth. following a iconic battle with the imperial walkers, the rebels are forced to escape, han solo and princess leia in one way and luke in another, hoping to find the legendary jedi master yoda who can complete his training. yoda himself is one of the main draws to the movie, he is such a fantastic character. luke goes looking for a great and physically strong warrior, yet instead finds this miniature creature who has no physical skill or weapon provice at all, instead he complements it with his spiritual strength, showing that the force truly stands above such trivial matters. the puppet looks amazing and frank oz does a great job voicing him. we are also introduced to a nice twist in which we finds out that darth vader is not actually the true main villain, but merely a minion. we always knew there was an emperor, but when his shadowy hologram appears for the first time, we learn that he uses the force, and that he was the one who converted vader to the dark side in the first place. then, of course, there is the climax, in which luke fights vader, seeking revenge for ben kenobi and his father, and in the end learning that darth is actually his father. it truly stands as one of the great twists in cinematic history and turned the story completely upside down. overall, the movie maintains the sense of lightheartedness and fun of the original, whilst making it more dark and complex. the character development, special effects and music are all amazing. director irvin kershner truly nailed it in his follow-up to a legendary film. this is how you make a sequel to a movie without doubt! just make sure you watch the 1980 theatrical cut, as george lucas came back in later releases and ruined the film, even though he didn't make it.;8 August 2020;10;['few', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'lighthearted', 'full', 'memorable', 'special', 'campy', 'colorful', 'evil', 'dark', 'epic', 'iconic', 'imperial', 'legendary', 'main', 'fantastic', 'great', 'strong', 'miniature', 'physical', 'spiritual', 'such', 'trivial', 'amazing', 'frank', 'great', 'nice', 'true', 'main', 'shadowy', 'first', 'dark', 'first', 'great', 'cinematic', 'original', 'dark', 'complex', 'special', 'amazing', 'legendary', 'sure', 'theatrical', 'later'];0.3001526251526251

299;mgruebel;"many people think that 'the empire strikes back' is the best of the original three, but i still vote the original higher. still, for a film without a real beginning, middle, or end, this one is darn good. frank oz' puppetry really reached an apex in the early 1980s, with films like 'dark crystal' and 'empire.' no wonder yoda made the cover of time magazine (as star wars did several times). the original yoda is much more whimsical and playful than the 'earlier' yoda of episodes i-iii. he toys with luke while dispensing vaguely confucian wisdom. the facial articulation is very good, and there is a certain palpable reality in physical special effects and good puppetry that the later digital yoda just did not quite reach; besides the fact that oz was obviously instructed by lucas to keep it more serious. then there is the oedipal turn the story takes: ""luke, i am your father."" i was actually surprised in 1980 when i saw this, and over the years i have gone from judging it corny to a masterstroke. it's probably both. for those who saw star wars pre-1980, it's clear that this was not the original plan. interestingly, george lucas has done some cleaning up of older movies to conform to the later canon (all but cutting a luke-leia kiss in the original that was just not quite brotherly-sisterly enough), but left a lot of it alone, like obi wan providing minimal explanation for his 'subterfuge' in the original star wars movie. like in a good charles dickens novel, everyone turns out to be related to everyone or have met the person who did the thing who helped the other who... other than yoda and that revelation, the story that takes luke from ice planet hoth to be trained by yoda and finally confront his dark side in the form of his father for the first time, does not have too many exciting turns or characters. calrissian was planted in it for political correctness as a han solo scoundrel duplicate (i'm grateful though because billie dee was a pretty good scoundrel). han literally gets frozen while lando takes over for a while, as though there's not room for two of them. still, i have to give it an 8. it is skillfully crafted for a middle piece, and lucas really honed his special effects magic some more since the first installment. it's as enjoyable to see now as in the 80s, and its lower density special effects are almost prophetic of what is to come again: special effects that serve the film, not the other way around.";18 March 2014;8;['many', 'good', 'original', 'original', 'high', 'real', 'middle', 'good', 'early', 'dark', 'several', 'original', 'whimsical', 'playful', 'early', 'confucian', 'facial', 'good', 'certain', 'palpable', 'physical', 'special', 'good', 'later', 'digital', 'serious', 'oedipal', 'surprised', 'clear', 'original', 'old', 'later', 'minimal', 'original', 'good', 'other', 'other', 'dark', 'first', 'many', 'exciting', 'political', 'grateful', 'good', 'frozen', 'middle', 'special', 'more', 'first', 'enjoyable', 'low', 'special', 'prophetic', 'special', 'other'];0.1993650793650793
300;keelhaul-80856;"empire has long been known as the greatest star wars flick. i would say that return of the jedi would have beaten it for this title, if it had laid off the overdose of ewoks and buffoonery that populate the middle of the film, and lose sight of the otherwise excellent and violent epic being told. empire was actually the very first sw film i ever saw as a child. i saw it sitting on a library shelf and empire looked the best to me for some reason, even on the box. i took it home and was thrilled to see the huge hoth snow battle right to start with. from there, i already felt immersed in the sw universe, though i hadn't seen the original.( i had played with toys and heard about it from friends.) great music, great script, great action, and the crazy revelation after a light saber duel of vader being luke's father. plus, billy dee williams!!! interaction between the silly droids and chewbacca(but still felt cool, and not as childish as prequel nonsense). i remember han solo's line really surprising me, as i was only in about 2nd grade, when he replies to leah's ""i love you,"" with ""i know"", as i had never heard anyone say this in a movie. i was expecting the usual ""i love you too."" it seems silly now, but for the time, empire had some witty and sarcastic moments that are way better than other entries in the saga. landing in a monster's mouth while running from the empire through an asteroid field? awesome, and the music and tension with that scenery are forever etched into my brain. john william is awesome. the hoth scenery and dagobah meeting with yoda and cloud city were all some of the best locations for star wars material. everything about this film screams classic and epic greatness on many levels. boba fett and the mercenaries are introduced, and it leaves us with so many cliffhangers that it is utterly more exciting and suspenseful than iv and vi. i also had the old super nintendo video game for empire(and return) and played them constantly.";13 October 2017;10;['great', 'excellent', 'violent', 'epic', 'first', 'good', 'huge', 'hoth', 'right', 'original', 'great', 'great', 'great', 'crazy', 'light', 'silly', 'cool', 'childish', 'prequel', 'surprising', 'usual', 'silly', 'witty', 'sarcastic', 'well', 'other', 'awesome', 'awesome', 'hoth', 'good', 'classic', 'epic', 'many', 'many', 'exciting', 'suspenseful', 'old', 'super'];0.2966386554621849
301;michael_the_nermal;"some spoilers ahead ""empire strikes back"" is the best of the ""star wars"" movies, and a vast improvement over the original. this may have to do with the absence of george lucas as director, but the most conspicuous examples of this film's qualities are the improved acting of the leads since their appearance in the original, new memorable and interesting characters, and a compelling storyline. mark hamill and carrie fisher are slightly better than they were in the original. luke skywalker still seems a bit green and immature, but he undergoes some transformation as he undergoes his jedi training with yoda. for a rubber puppet, yoda is a magnificent character. he embodies the mature spiritual and moral characteristics that lucas wanted the jedi to embody. he warns luke not to yield to his dark visions of his friends' suffering, and that he must instead complete his training. it is yoda, rather than obi-wan, who truly leads luke down the long and arduous path to being a jedi. frank oz, despite sounding like one of his myriad muppet characters, brings a calm, almost dispassionate persona to yoda. this great jedi master is a welcome addition to this movie. another new interesting character is lando calrissian, played elegantly by billy dee williams. calrissian, like han solo, is morally ambiguous, and is forced to betray his old friend after han and leia have been intercepted by darth vader and the mercenary boba fet. he is a almost a mirror image to the roguish han solo, though his switch to the side of the good guys seems rather abrupt. overall, williams plays his rather secondary role admirably. one of the few characters to improve is lord vader. james earl jones has trained his voice to match vader's ruthlessness and lack of empathy. he plays the bad guy as calm, cool, contemplative, and almost emotionless, which matches vader's spiritual nature (his devotion to the dark side) and which amplifies the character's ability to intimidate audiences. if vader were some cackling, maniacal supervillian, no one would take his menace seriously. the scriptwriter deserves some credit for making vader far more sadistic and evil than he was in the original, e.g. his willingness to risk his own men's lives in an asteroid field, and his penchant for strangling a series of imperial officers for simple mistakes. david prowse, the man in the darth vader costume, also does very well here. the story is better than the first because it moves beyond the simple ""damsel in distress"" and ""good-triumphs-over-evil"" themes of the first. the good guys do not triumph either in the beginning or the end, and we also learn that the force is a more complex power than the original movie suggested, e.g. that yielding to one's emotions, even to save one's friends, is a dangerous gamble. the actions scenes and special effects are equal, if not better, than the first movie's. the settings of the ice planet of hoth, the swamp world of dagobah, and the glittering white cloud city mining camp are beautifully rendered. this, like the first movie, is not high art, but it is a very competent and mature science fiction movie.";4 March 2007;8;['good', 'vast', 'original', 'conspicuous', 'improved', 'original', 'new', 'memorable', 'interesting', 'compelling', 'well', 'original', 'green', 'immature', 'magnificent', 'mature', 'spiritual', 'moral', 'luke', 'dark', 'long', 'arduous', 'myriad', 'dispassionate', 'great', 'welcome', 'new', 'interesting', 'ambiguous', 'old', 'mercenary', 'roguish', 'good', 'abrupt', 'secondary', 'few', 'bad', 'calm', 'cool', 'contemplative', 'spiritual', 'dark', 'maniacal', 'sadistic', 'evil', 'original', 'own', 'imperial', 'simple', 'well', 'first', 'simple', 'good', 'first', 'good', 'complex', 'original', 'dangerous', 'special', 'equal', 'well', 'first', 'swamp', 'first', 'high', 'competent', 'mature'];0.1757974025974025

305;mohit_sinsniwal;star wars: episode v - the empire strikes back (1980) is an excellent timeless classic that it is the best sequel of all time. i love this film to death, it is my second favorite film and the best sequel in the star wars franchise that i love. the empire strikes back is a movie that it is one of the best sequels i can think of, it is right there with aliens (1986), it is right there with terminator 2: judgment day (1991) it is an excellent sequel and it really does establish the empire as a value treat. empire strikes back is still and excellent film which i really believe is a timeless classic. this is my second favorite film from director irvin kershner. number 1 favorite irvin kershner film will be robocop 2 (1990) which is very underrated action flick. i still have to review those movies someday. empire strikes back (1980) is the best one of the series, because it's deeper, darker, more philosophical. it's great because darth vader and the empire are at their most menacing, the direction is creative, the characters feel real, the nature of the force is explored more without losing its mysticism, and the pacing is, as george lucas would put it, faster and more intense than any other film in the saga. the plot is actually more a rescue mission that luke skywalker (mark hamill) is coming to rescue his friends han solo, princess leia organa, c-3po and chewbacca are captured on a planet bespin in cloud city from villainous darth vader. han solo's friend lando calrissian (billy dee williams) set the up and with darth vader he set a trap for luke. also luke studied the force under jedi master yoda to become a full jedi knight but in the end he must confront darth vader (david prowse) by him self. the origins of luke skywalker are reveled. empire strikes back was released in 1980 it is directed by irvin kershner this time and not george lucas. because george lucas decide that he want to make this sequel independent one, so he ended up coming with his own, founding for the film. getting a loan and money he earn from the first movie and it success, so he decided he wanted, to found the film him self, and he wanted to be more an executive producer to keep an eye on the lamp, he moved to a bigger studio in orange county, california, so he diced to be more a producer he did not want to direct empire strikes back. so his first choice was irvin kershner, who was a professor at uc in the uc film school, that george attended too and he always liked irvin kershner and of course he was a former professor and it was a hard way talk him to do it and the first time irvin kershner didn't want to do it, so george called irvin's agent and his agent said to irvin take it so he did and the rest is a history. this stands the test of time, the best film he ever directed! i love john williams score still the same, but i think john williams changed the music score for a little bit, but that's just my opinion. things that i love in this film: i love the battle with rebels fighting with the imperial at-at walkers on the ice world of hoth. that is my favorite scene on ice world in the film. the imperial at-at walkers are incredible well made with classic special effects. i love that the origins of luke skywalker are reveled, that luke is the son of darth vader, who is actually anakin skywalker, before he become darth vader and went to the dark site. for the first time ever, we see an emperor in a hologram talking to darth vader. the falcon with han solo, princess leia organa, c-3po and chewbacca hiding in the rocks try's to eat a monster. luke faces with darth vader him self face to face and get his arm cut off and then he jumps off the bridge, because he didn't want to join his father in a dark force. the lightsaber duel throughout the chamber between luke and darth vader was excellent and it was epic. the training sequence with luke and master yoda were excellent and epic. a new hope and the empire strikes back are my favorite films in series, that are in the franchise, this film get's a perfect 10 score for been the best sci-fi adventure sequel of all time.;26 May 2019;7;['excellent', 'good', 'second', 'favorite', 'good', 'good', 'excellent', 'excellent', 'timeless', 'second', 'favorite', 'favorite', 'underrated', 'good', 'deep', 'dark', 'philosophical', 'great', 'menacing', 'creative', 'real', 'fast', 'intense', 'other', 'more', 'villainous', 'full', 'jedi', 'independent', 'own', 'first', 'executive', 'big', 'first', 'former', 'hard', 'first', 'good', 'same', 'little', 'imperial', 'favorite', 'imperial', 'incredible', 'classic', 'special', 'dark', 'first', 'dark', 'excellent', 'epic', 'excellent', 'epic', 'new', 'favorite', 'perfect', 'good'];0.3399184998674794

307;cdjh-81125;when talking about sequels that improved ten fold over their originals the empire strikes back will always rightfully be mentioned because this is a film that takes its characters to whole new levels of intrigue and development and places them in a vulnerable position and is a masterpiece. for one this films opening is possibly the best of the entire franchise, we are perfectly re introduced to these characters and understand were they all are, we see exactly how they are dealing with the events of the first film and they brilliantly spend this first act building up to the empires attack in hoth which gives the battle itself a whole new level of intensity. this first battle is incredible, we feel the scale and power of the empire from all perspectives making you realise just how powerful they really are and how much the rebel alliance are up against. when we get past this battle the film is split into two separate arcs that are cut together and told perfectly, there's never a moment we're the audience is bored with either story as the characters along with the storytelling make both of them just as entertaining and satisfying as each other. luke's time on dagobah is incredibly intriguing, the way this film talks about the jedi and the force is extremely well done it makes them seem more deeper than mere warriors and the inclusion of jedi master yoda was a very good way of emphasising this as it shows the enlightenment the force can bring. the other arc of this movie cantering around han solo and princess leia on the run from the empire is extremely entertaining with seamless special effects and a much more intimate and character driven story than the previous instalment, the romance that eventually develops is done just right it feels natural as well as not forced and the chemistry between the two is impeccable. when we finally get to the last act of this film it's all come together perfectly to create for a nail baiting final show down. the fight between darth vader and luke is absolutely incredible, not only the mental but physical war that goes on between the two is so satisfying, the famous reveal doesn't see out of field but plausible and the ending was not entirely satisfactory as it left the characters in a questionable position that sets up for a better place for a sequel. the empire strikes back is not only one of the greatest sequels ever made but one of the greatest movies ever made, the characters are all given their own arcs, it's incredibly entertaining with seamless special effects and action sequences. this sequel builds on everything from the original and improves upon it making for a sci-fi masterpiece. 100%/a+;22 December 2016;10;['whole', 'new', 'vulnerable', 'good', 'entire', 'first', 'first', 'whole', 'new', 'first', 'incredible', 'powerful', 'much', 'rebel', 'separate', 'entertaining', 'other', 'intriguing', 'deep', 'mere', 'good', 'other', 'entertaining', 'seamless', 'special', 'intimate', 'previous', 'right', 'natural', 'impeccable', 'last', 'final', 'incredible', 'mental', 'physical', 'satisfying', 'famous', 'plausible', 'satisfactory', 'questionable', 'well', 'great', 'great', 'own', 'entertaining', 'seamless', 'special', 'original'];0.2552513774104683

312;Jackblyth8;when george lucas was asked which was the worst star wars film, he responded with 'the empire strikes back', one of the only original films from the saga that he did not direct. episode 5 was proven to not be the worst episode and instead, was rather flattered by the critics, gaining 94% on rotten tomatoes and 8.7/10 on imdb. the ensemble cast is carried over from the first film released 3 years before episode 5, 'a new hope' and produces a thrilling encounter of the rebellion' resurrection. it is evident that the titles are almost back and forth for the rebellion's sake, whenever a title is in their favour, the next episode pushes them back. it has been 3 years since the destruction of the death star and the rebel alliance, led by princess leia, has set up a new base on the ice planet hoth, a desolate, low-temperature, snow-blizzard land. the imperial fleet, led by merciless darth vader, hunts for the new rebel base by dispatching probe droids across the galaxy. luke skywalker, struggling to control himself in the cold, is captured by a wampa while investigating one such probe. he finds himself tied up, hanging from above in a dark cage, the newly named jedi is able to escape by using the force and his lightsaber. before luke succumbs to hypothermia, the force spirit of his deceased mentor, obi wan kenobi, instructs him to go to the swamp planet dagobah to train under jedi master yoda. han solo discovers luke and keeps him alive by keeping him under the body fat of his dead tauntaun mount, and the two are rescued by a search party the following morning. luke as clearly matured in the three years he has been present in the rebellion, and he see his character develop throughout. being more independent, wiser and learning to take matters into his own hands, moulding into the jedi that obi wan formerly was. the probe alerts the imperial fleet to the rebel's location . the empire launches a large-scale attack using at-at walkers to capture the base, it was admitted that scenes featuring the large walkers took the longest to film, reasoning their slow and lethargic movements. the rebels manage to evacuate, han and leia escape with c-3po and chewbacca on the millennium falcon, but the ship's hyperdrive malfunctions. they hide in an asteroid field, where han and leia grow closer amidst the tensions, the pair seem to attract quite easily to one another. several bounty hunters, summoned by vader, assist in searching for the the falcon. meanwhile, luke travels with r2-d2 in his x-wing to dagobah where he crash-lands in the middle of an eerie swamp. the x-wing used by luke is named aa-59 and is a t-65b model. the star fighter is armoured with 4 laser cannons, 2 proton torpedo launchers and 6 proton torpedoes (crucial in the act of destroying the death star), weighing 110kg its class 1 hyperdrive rating allows it to be extremely flexible, fitting into narrow spaces. luke meets with a diminutive creature whilst first plays with young skywalker, joking around him and confusing him with his distinctive speech. he later reveals himself as yoda, who reluctantly accepts luke as his apprentice after conferring with obi wan's spirit. we visualise for the first time, the wise jedi legend yoda, who appears unique in his aspects. his small frame supports him as a jedi, with his low space tee of gravity proving for good balance. his wrinkled face is deceiving to the sith at first, but inside him is a ruthless nature. his wisdom of the force is beyond any other jedi, his experience manifests this. the character itself is a puppet, performed by frank oz who also supplies his voice, oz is also the puppeteer behind the famous miss piggy, from 'the muppets'. luke learns more about the force from yoda, who lifts his x-wing out of the swamp using the power of the force. after evading the imperial fleet, han's group travels to the floating cloud city on the planet bespin, which is governed by han's old friend lando calrissian. bounty hunter boba fett, son of jango, tracks the falcon and, with vader, forces lando to hand the group over to the empire. boba is similar to jango apart from his improved suit design, he aims to continue his father's legacy as a bounty hunter, and has a personal hatred toward the jedi, following jango's decapitation from mace windu. vader plans to use the group as bait to lure luke, intending to capture him and turn him to the dark side of the force. luke experiences a premonition of han and leia in pain, yoda explains to him the importance of patience and that learning the ways of the force takes time to master, against his and obi wan's wishes, luke abandons his training to rescue them. vader intends to hold luke in suspended animation by imprisoning him in carbonate, selecting han to be frozen as trial experiment, this, much to chewbacca's discontent, taking his anger out on lando. han survives the process and is given to fett, who plans to collect a bounty on him from jabba the hutt. the term bounty hunter originates from south africa, coming from the search for hms bounty, the famous ship captained by william bligh that mutinies in april 1789. this could infer to boba fett's armour, embodying the traditional south african colours of green and yellow. lando, still loyal to han, frees leia and chewbacca, but they are too late to stop fett from departing with solo. under attack from numerous stormtroopers, they fight their way back to the falcon and flee the city. meanwhile, luke arrives and engages vader in a tense lightsaber duel that leads them to the city's central air shaft, vader appearing more defensive than offensive. vader severs luke's right arm, significant as the same happened to anakin when in combat with dooku. after darth vader disarms the young jedi, he tempts him to embrace his anger and join the dark side of the force. luke reiterates obi wan's telling, accusing the sith lord of murdering his father, metaphorically speaking that is true. vader reveals that he is luke's father, in 'four words' best known to the film. horrified, luke drops into the air shaft and is ejected beneath the floating city, hanging from an antenna. in a mixture of mental states, he reaches out telepathically to leia, who senses him and persuades lando and chewy to turn back. after luke is brought aboard, they are chased by tie fighters towards vader on his star destroyer and finds out that the falcon's hyperdrive has been tampered with, but the confident, intelligent droid r2-d2 reactivates it, allowing them to escape. luke rejoins the rebel fleet and his severed hand is replaced with a robotic prosthesis, just like his father's previously. lando and chewbacca begin their quest to save han, as the other rebels watch in unison as the falcon departs. episode 5 sees the first confrontation of luke and his father, darth vader and makes for an exciting next chapter to how he, being the only accessible jedi left, will go about defeating the evil sith lord. leia and han's relationship expands in the screenplay, but of course is cut short due to vader's experiment involving the pilot. this situation isn't resolved in the film and supplies a strong costarring base for the next chapter. an incredibly directed film, shows the rebel alliance growing stronger and replacing the former 'republic', allowing it to compete

313;rmirchandani;"star wars: episode v- the empire strikes back is a fast paced and action packed movie that delivers on all levels. it has emotion, a great love triangle, action, amazing visual effects and phenomenal dialogue and acting. the banter between the main characters han solo, princess leia and luke skywalker is perfect and often times hilarious. harrison ford's portrayal of han solo is much better and more enjoyable in this sequel. his charisma is a delight. the chemistry these characters have is perfect. the opening scene where luke skywalker gets captured by a bigfoot looking creature and saved by han solo is one of the best opening scenes ever and proves that the movie is fast paced and dives right into the plot. the appearance of ben obi wan kenobi and him being a sort of guide to luke skywalker is great. he inspired luke to become a jedi. on the other hand, yoda trained luke to become a jedi, but his training was short lived. the final fight between luke skywalker and darth vader aka anakin skywalker is amazing. the infamous ""i am your father"" line fitted perfectly in the scene. the ending sets up the third movie in the franchise where luke skywalker, princess leia, c3po and r2d2 set out on a mission to rescue han solo from jabba the hutt. to conclude, empire strikes back is a worthy sequel and even better than the first star wars movie. it is visually pleasing and a joy to watch. every character is incredibly likable and the camaraderie between the characters is on point. no wonder this movie received an oscar and worldwide recognition. everyone should see this movie at least once in their life.";15 November 2019;10;['great', 'amazing', 'visual', 'phenomenal', 'main', 'perfect', 'hilarious', 'well', 'enjoyable', 'perfect', 'good', 'great', 'other', 'lived', 'final', 'amazing', 'infamous', 'third', 'worthy', 'well', 'first', 'pleasing', 'likable', 'oscar', 'worldwide', 'least'];0.3662499999999999
314;troy-daniel-bush;"my favorite star wars film and my fifth favorite movie of all time. it does exactly what a sequel should do: improve upon its predecessor! the pacing is slower but it helps the story and the characters to develop. the tone is a lot darker. sometimes this can work to the detriment but here it helps the movie. the chemistry between han and leia is fantastic! it's charming and funny! the ""nurfherder"" and ""lazerbain"" lines were stupid but you forget about that scene pretty quickly. the score is superb. the imperial march is one of the best pieces of music ever conceived. it goes in directions you don't expect. and i'm not just referring to the big twist. i'm also referring to how the movie ends at a low point as well as a cliffhanger. it leaves things up to your imagination. like luke's face in the mask. or the force, despite it going a little deeper into it. effects that were impressive for the time are at this point either bad but very charming, or still good. an intimidating villain. this is the movie that turned darth vader into one of the best villains ever! in fact, the empire in its entirety is a lot more threatening. fantastic performances from everybody. complex, nuanced characters. even though yoda is clearly a puppet he still feels alive. seeing him as cg in the prequels infuriates me. i do not believe for a minute that he is there. memorable lines: ""i'll see you in hell!"" ""i love you."" -> ""i know."" ""no! do! or do not! there is no try!"" out of all the star wars movies this one has by far the best script. intense action. the action also feels a lot more gritty compared to a new hope. it's super well-shot, especially compared to all the other star wars films! this is a movie that really lets you soak in the environment! sure, it's got some cheese, some dumb lines, and some things that don't make any sense, but that's to be expected from star wars. and because everything else is so good you don't really care. even when i was a kid this one was my favorite. i didn't know why at the time. but looking back on it, i can say that it was because the film is darker and slower compared to the others. i'm also happy that out of all the movies in the original trilogy this is the one that george lucas screwed with the least. i hate that for changing, ""you're lucky you don't taste good."" to ""you're lucky you got out of there."" thank you, george, for once again not thinking something through and taking that enjoyably corny joke and changing it to something completely bland that makes luke seem less witty. however, i give credit where credit is due: you made cloud city seem a lot less claustrophobic, despite the fact that, much like the cg in all of the prequels, and the cg you just had to shoehorn into a new hope, the cg looks like garbage!";10 September 2020;10;['favorite', 'fifth', 'favorite', 'slow', 'dark', 'fantastic', 'charming', 'funny', 'nurfherder', 'stupid', 'superb', 'imperial', 'good', 'big', 'low', 'little', 'deep', 'impressive', 'bad', 'charming', 'good', 'good', 'threatening', 'fantastic', 'complex', 'nuanced', 'alive', 'memorable', 'good', 'intense', 'gritty', 'new', 'other', 'dumb', 'good', 'favorite', 'dark', 'slow', 'happy', 'original', 'least', 'lucky', 'good', 'lucky', 'bland', 'witty', 'due', 'less', 'claustrophobic', 'new'];0.1926346801346802

328;TheMovieDoctorful;"guys...what can i say about ""empire"" that hasn't already been said by countless fans, critics and film professors around the world? this is the movie that turned ""star wars"" from what was at the time little more than a soap opera in space into one of the greatest sagas in all of fiction. its characters are diverse and well developed, its storytelling is magical, its effects are groundbreaking, its world-building is perfection, its allegories to classical literature and world mythology are brilliant. it is to science fantasy (and american cinema in general) what ""the odyssey"" was to literature. ""empire"" does an excellent job maintaining a dark, suspenseful tone throughout its run-time; from luke's narrow escape from the cave of the vicious wampa to the millennium falcon navigating through a perilous asteroid field (and a space slug) to escape certain doom at the hands of imperial tie fighters, to han suffering a devastating betrayal at the hands of a close friend, ""empire"" is a movie that constantly has you on the edge of your seat. of course, the most suspenseful, intense scene of the movie has to be the lightsaber duel on bespin between luke skywalker and darth vader. the eerie lack of music, the dark, atmospheric lighting (the fact that we are mostly seeing the combatants lightsabers and not their actual motions only adds to the suspense) and the emotion driven, ""brute force"" fighting style of the combatants make the duel almost impossible to take your eyes off of. without spoiling anything the shocking, powerful conclusion to the duel is what seals it as one of the best fights in film history. its conclusion, while tragic, is oddly sentimental; vader's vicious dismemberment of luke is what oddly brings them closer together from a perspective of empathy and understanding. this is a film that takes countless risks, something that i have nothing but respect for. nothing is sugarcoated. true, the film is not without its fair share of comedic moments (a good thing, as they're quite charming and always elicit at the very least wide smiles if not full on laughs), but this is a very different movie than the lighthearted, cheesefest that ""a new hope"" was. if anything, ""episode v"" was the movie that proved that the star wars saga was indeed capable of true tonal diversity. ""empire"" is a movie about the destruction of hope, about fear clouding the judgment of good people with devastating and tragic consequences. these themes are excellently conveyed through the development of luke, han and even darth vader, whose arc simultaneously concludes in both total victory and crushing, emotional loss. vader is proof that you don't need an endless supply of dialogue to make your mark as a complex, fascinating character. the acting is (for the most part) really impressive. mark hamill's performance as luke skywalker is vastly improved from his fairly uninspired showing in a new hope. true, he has his whiny and petty moments (and not all of them are justified), but this is actually quite important in making luke flawed, human and relatable. if luke started out as a morally flawless superman liked by everyone who makes all the right decisions, he would lose his humanity and relatability as a character. how tragic it is that his ethic and ambition are rewarded by the world-shattering revelation of his greatest hero's corruption? frank oz does phenomenal voice work as yoda, bringing depth and complexity to a character that could have very easily been a cheap ""merlin"" ripoff. not only does he bring a nuanced wisdom to the role of yoda, oz also has fantastic comedic timing that never feels out of character. yoda is a somewhat insignificant and pathetic looking creature in both physical appearance and mannerisms, but he uses this meekness in appearance and voice to test luke's compassion and patience. what makes him such a great mentor and wise master is that he does not train his students bodies (which he refers to as ""crude matter.) he trains their will power. their minds. their morality. also, that green henson puppet looks just as real today as it did 36 years ago when it first waddled across dagobah. hands down, the best performance in the movie, and perhaps the entire original trilogy, has to go to james earl jones as darth vader. vader is blessed with more screen time here than he was given in ""a new hope"", as well as better writing. this is a blessing jones makes the absolute most of. not only did he send chills down my spine with the passion and cold intensity of his ruthlessness, his nuance in showing vader's repressed humanity and depression is done with the skill and subtlety of, for lack of a better term, a master. earl jones's phenomenal voice acting commands complete attention every time vader appears on screen. even decades after its initial release, ""empire strikes back"" has easily the best special effects in the franchise. not only were the animatronics, costume, makeup and set design and digital effects revolutionary for the time, not only are they made with unmatched detail, they still look shockingly realistic to this very day. even ignoring the effects, the visual storytelling as a whole is exceptional. the warmer and more airy aesthetic of a new hope is replaced with a darker and filthier visual style. the film frequently plays up the paradoxical interplay of organic and industrial imagery, almost like a ""tetsuo"" lite at times. the harsh reds, deep blues and swamp greens of the color scheme subconsciously tell us that we have left the safeness, comfort and familiarity of a new hope for a world far more hostile, demanding, gritty, expansive and violent. i could go on and on about everything ""empire"" does perfectly. not only is it a phenomenal film, it's a revolution of sci-fantasy filmmaking and, in my opinion, the best movie of the 1980s. it is our generations equivalent to what ancient greeks must have felt reading the classical works of homer. a masterpiece in countless ways.";17 August 2016;10;['countless', 'more', 'great', 'diverse', 'magical', 'classical', 'brilliant', 'american', 'general', 'excellent', 'dark', 'suspenseful', 'narrow', 'vicious', 'perilous', 'certain', 'imperial', 'devastating', 'close', 'suspenseful', 'intense', 'eerie', 'dark', 'atmospheric', 'actual', 'brute', 'impossible', 'shocking', 'powerful', 'good', 'tragic', 'sentimental', 'vicious', 'countless', 'true', 'fair', 'comedic', 'good', 'charming', 'elicit', 'least', 'wide', 'full', 'different', 'cheesef', 'new', 'capable', 'true', 'tonal', 'good', 'devastating', 'tragic', 'total', 'emotional', 'endless', 'complex', 'fascinating', 'most', 'impressive', 'uninspired', 'new', 'true', 'whiny', 'petty', 'important', 'human', 'relatable', 'flawless', 'right', 'tragic', 'ethic', 'great', 'phenomenal', 'cheap', 'fantastic', 'comedic', 'insignificant', 'pathetic', 'physical', 'great', 'wise', 'crude', 'real', 'good', 'entire', 'original', 'more', 'new', 'well', 'absolute', 'most', 'cold', 'well', 'phenomenal', 'complete', 'initial', 'good', 'special', 'digital', 'revolutionary', 'unmatched', 'realistic', 'very', 'visual', 'exceptional', 'warm', 'more', 'new', 'dark', 'filthy', 'visual', 'paradoxical', 'organic', 'industrial', 'tetsuo', 'harsh', 'deep', 'new', 'hostile', 'demanding', 'gritty', 'expansive', 'violent', 'phenomenal', 'good', 'equivalent', 'ancient', 'classical', 'countless'];0.1046023000568455

330;jaredpahl;"public opinion on popular movies has a way of snowballing towards one of two directions. a disappointing movie becomes an unholy dumpster fire and a solid sequel becomes an undisputed masterpiece. the empire strikes back is certainly overrated. it's a great film, as are all the star wars movies (the six that count anyway), but episode v is not a dramatic step up from a new hope or any of the other films in the saga. the movie has become so overrated that many say it's not just the best star wars movie, but the only star wars movie that is any good at all. people are dumb. and i want to take the contrarian stance, but let's face facts, the empire strikes back is a perfect sequel to the landmark movie event that was star wars. it deepens the mythology, lending george lucas' world a gravity and psychological weight not seen in the buoyant original. it's also just as quirky and clunky as any other star wars film, so let us not rewrite history. tesb is a great film, a great star wars film, possibly the best of the six, but not the overwhelming triumph of the series that so many people claim it to be. a change in director for a star wars film is not the world-shifting event many like to portray it as. george lucas remained the architect of the empire strikes back. exhausted by the trials of shooting a new hope, he hired irvin kershner to get his vision onto the screen. the result works, contrary to popular sentiment, because the style of the film doesn't deviate too harshly from lucas' original. there is a movement in the fan community to credit kershner as some kind of auteur that wrangled the saga's reigns from lucas and envisioned it in his own way. that's hyperbolic nonsense. kershner does a good, nay, great job with lucas' material. he is a reliable professional, but not a genius that saved the series from its creator. it was lucas, after all, who envisioned this story. the darkness of empire is also a fan favorite element. there have been volumes of words written on the film's approach to the second-act trope of going darker and more weighty before an eventual triumphal finale. empire adheres to this structure very well, eschewing a hero's journey for a cliffhanger, to-be-continued bummer of an ending. for some reason, this is really profound to lot of fans. like a revolutionary idea that elevates the film to stratospheric levels. i've never gathered why darker, bad-guy-wins endings are considered any better than heroes-save-the-day endings. just because they don't happen as often? darkness is valued more than almost anything when it comes to blockbuster film buffs. maybe it comes from some deep-seated embarrassment that you like a silly thing like star wars in the first place, and a darker film validates your love. ""see, it's dark, like a grown-up movie!"" i'm comfortable admitting that i prefer star wars as the kid-friendly space adventure it is, and while i can appreciate, and actually welcome the darker chapters, i feel no obligation to elevate them as worth ""more"" as films. that's all to say that star wars: episode v - the empire strikes back is a great movie. a perfect sequel, a terrific middle chapter in a terrific trilogy. however, the push to declare it as the undisputed pinnacle of the entire star wars project is frustrating. a new hope is always going to be the most iconic, the most cherished, the film that will last forever. revenge of the sith still bests empire for dramatic intensity and darkness. and personal tastes must dictate that any of the other movies in the saga could hold favor over it. yet, the empire strikes back still has some kind of stranglehold on the top spot of star wars films. it's the easy consensus pick. you can point to the fact that pesky gorge is not credited as writer nor director (even though his influence superseded everyone else's), you can identify it's clear ""dark"" elements as evidence that the movie is ""more mature"", and you can also just go along with the herd and proclaim it as the best because that's what everyone says. the movie's reception really shouldn't bug me the way it does. i really love the empire strikes back. i think i take issue with its overinflated sense of greatness because it comes at the expense of the other five films. each one of george lucas' six movies has a claim as someone's favorite. they are all of a very high level of blockbuster filmmaking. i want to give the others the praise they also deserve. 88/100";26 May 2020;8;['public', 'popular', 'disappointing', 'unholy', 'solid', 'undisputed', 'great', 'dramatic', 'new', 'other', 'overrated', 'many', 'good', 'only', 'good', 'dumb', 'contrarian', 'perfect', 'psychological', 'buoyant', 'quirky', 'clunky', 'other', 'great', 'great', 'good', 'overwhelming', 'many', 'many', 'new', 'contrary', 'popular', 'original', 'own', 'hyperbolic', 'good', 'great', 'reliable', 'lucas', 'favorite', 'second', 'dark', 'weighty', 'eventual', 'profound', 'revolutionary', 'stratospheric', 'dark', 'bad', 'well', 'more', 'blockbuster', 'silly', 'first', 'dark', 'dark', 'comfortable', 'kid', 'friendly', 'dark', 'worth', 'more', 'great', 'perfect', 'terrific', 'middle', 'terrific', 'undisputed', 'entire', 'frustrating', 'new', 'iconic', 'cherished', 'dramatic', 'personal', 'other', 'top', 'easy', 'pesky', 'clear', 'dark', 'mature', 'good', 'overinflated', 'other', 'favorite', 'high'];0.2188498622589531
331;robb_772;one of the rare sequels that arguably tops it's own classic predecessor, the second film in the original star wars trilogy manages to seamlessly combine the cliffhanger thrills and good-natured humor of the original with a darker and more adult-oriented storyline. producer/writer george lucas (who also directed the first film) decided to pass the directorial duties over to semi-avant guard director irvin kershner (best known at the time for 1970's loving and 1972's up the sandbox), which proved to be an ingenious move. kershner's dramatic background serves him well in helming the complex plot, and he pulls fully-rounded characterizations from the entire cast. the merging of kershner's storytelling talents with lucas' mastery of the film-making technique is the very heart of this, which is arguably the greatest space adventure ever. the film works in numerous ways. scene-by-scene, the film continually tops itself with one startling set piece after another, yet the picture also gels perfectly together as cohesive roller-coaster ride of suspense, romance, and still-dazzling special effects - with even some philosophy effectively thrown into the mix. many of the series most intriguing characters are introduced in this installment, including space-age playboy lando carlissian (charismatically played by billy dee williams), ruthless bounty hunter boba fett (an unrecognizable jeremy bulloch), and especially the ultimate mystic yoda (flawlessly voiced by frank oz). the notorious emperor (voiced by the sinister clive revill) also makes a brief-but-memorable appearance that initiates an intriguing set up for the following film. the new cast of characters are seamlessly woven into the saga's vast tapestry, and perfectly compliment the returning cast members, most of whom are at their best in this film. mark hamill's seemingly perpetual man/child luke skywalker actually does an impressive deal of growing up in this installment, and the deeper characterization suits the winsome actor well. harrison ford and carrie fisher are given a genuinely believable romantic subplot that never feels contrived or tacked on, and c-3po (the delightful english actor anthony daniels) and r2-d2 once again steal nearly every scene they appear in as the series' sparring robots. and this is to say nothing of darth vader's (once again eerily voiced by james earl jones) shocking revelation to luke during the film's bravura climax, which is a plot twist that packed a major wallop back in 1980 and is still somewhat startling even today.;25 May 2006;10;['rare', 'own', 'classic', 'second', 'original', 'good', 'natured', 'original', 'dark', 'more', 'first', 'directorial', 'semi', 'avant', 'ingenious', 'dramatic', 'complex', 'entire', 'very', 'great', 'numerous', 'cohesive', 'special', 'many', 'intriguing', 'ruthless', 'unrecognizable', 'ultimate', 'mystic', 'notorious', 'sinister', 'clive', 'brief', 'memorable', 'intriguing', 'new', 'vast', 'most', 'good', 'perpetual', 'impressive', 'deep', 'winsome', 'believable', 'romantic', 'delightful', 'english', 'shocking', 'major', 'startling'];0.1773510480747323

345;fearfulofspiders;coming from a hardcore fantasy fan, when it comes to science-fiction, star wars - episode v - the empire strikes back is the best of the best. compared to the slightly campy style of a new hope, the empire strikes back is full of darker characters and personalities, be they new people or familiar faces. mark hamil is superior in comparison to his role in episode iv, as well as carrie fisher and harrison ford. james earl jones is the epitome of evil as darth vader, and makes him one of the scariest villains ever portrayed in film -- besting his role in the previous installment. billy dee williams is great as lando calrissian, a suave and more swashbuckling character than hans solo at times -- in appearance and attitude at least. george lucas' story is executed so well, both screenplay and direction, it surpasses a new hope in every aspect. taking us to new worlds, and giving us new characters that we either love, hate, or simply do not trust. the twist near the end (as everyone should know by now) is one of the best scenes ever put in a motion picture, and one of the greatest lines ever conceived. this is a darker star wars than a new hope, which was more kid-friendly, however this is more for adults. the tone of the film is slightly grimmer, and the stakes are higher. the replacement of lucas in the directing chair is probably the best decision made in the entirety of the franchise. just like episode iv, this film has excellent visual effects. the battle on the ice planet hoth is so memorable and beautifully shot, it truly deserves its mark as the highlight of the entire series. the score is better this time around as well. improving onto old themes, and creating some rousing new ones, john williams has really outdone himself. i highly recommend this music to all. overall, with eye-candy and brains, the empire strikes back is better than the first, and the greatest science-fiction film ever. definitely see this film.;6 September 2008;9;['hardcore', 'good', 'good', 'campy', 'new', 'full', 'dark', 'new', 'familiar', 'superior', 'scary', 'previous', 'great', 'more', 'swashbuckling', 'least', 'new', 'new', 'new', 'good', 'great', 'dark', 'new', 'friendly', 'more', 'high', 'good', 'excellent', 'visual', 'memorable', 'entire', 'well', 'old', 'new', 'well', 'first', 'great'];0.3030587121212121

351;raphaklopper;"after the huge success of ""star wars"" both critical and in the box office, giving birth to a new era cinema. george lucas was already planning its sequel, but decided to divide his work with the director irvin kershner and screenwriters lawrence kasdan and leigh brackett, many fans were afraid (even with lucas writing the story), but this group brought the saga to a all-new and unexplored level. ""empire"" begins shortly after the huge events of its predecessor with the entire rebel army after destroying the "" death star"", fleeing through galaxy with the powerful imperial fleet right behind them with ruthless darth vader (david prowse) in command. and with the rebels we see luke skywalker (mark hamill) finally realizing his dream of becoming a pilot in the rebel army against the empire, and alongside him his ""inseparable"" friends: the brave and cocky (and badass) han solo (harrison ford); the brave and intelligent leia (carrie fisher); the.....chewbacca (peter mayhew); r2-d2 (kenny baker) and c-3po (anthony daniels). but their lives begin to suffer a great risk when the empire finds the rebel position in the ice world of hoth, where a huge battle starts forcing the rebels to retreat. han, leia, chewbacca and c - 3po manage to escape in the millennium falcon, but end up being captured later by darth vader thanks to a betrayal of han's friend, lando calrissian (billy dee williams). meanwhile, luke and r2 were able to escape as well, but with the voice instruction from obi - wan (alec guinness), luke is advised to go to the dagobah system and meet the jedi master yoda (frank oz) which will help luke know and control the ""strength"", which later will bring him sinister secrets and the sacrifice for his friends. at the time it came-out, the film was poorly received by critics and fans, but perhaps understandable. no one at the time expected to see a major change in direction that the director and writers, hell, even the lucas led to film and its history, and today the film is considered not only the best star wars ever made, but also one of the best sequel of a saga in the cinema. if lucas in the 1st film had already revolutionized the modern cinema, so here he and his team raised barriers never explored. while the 1st movie had the great adventure of luke going to rescue the princess from evil forces in a massive sci-fi style full of humor and thrilling moments. in this one he maintain the great sense of adventure and the humor is not lacking thanks to han, but here everything is brought to a much more human side thanks to its unforgettable characters. and also thanks to the writers who deliver an amazing and beautiful narrative to the characters since small to big dialogues between the characters showing their human side, and also further exploring the ""jedi"" topic that it wasn't been well explored in the 1st movie. but also the other side where the film is taken is into a very dark twist that began when dark secrets from the past begin to appear. a flawless script and characters very well evolved, but also at the technical aspects the film rises completely. from the incredible visual effects with a beautiful visual direction from kershner. and also the new and memorable soundtrack from john williams ""the imperial march"", you know, that dan dan dan dan dandan dan dandan, dan dan dan dan dandan dan dandan (i know, it's strange to describe a song writing and not listening, well anyway)?! not only the best ""star wars"" or the best sequel ever made, but also one of the best movies ever made will be marked forever in the history of cinema. all thanks to a flawless script, beautiful direction, strong performances (especially mark hamill with an incredible evolution of acting) and the biggest twist that cinema ever had makes ""empire strikes back"" an eternal masterpiece! 10/10";23 September 2013;10;['huge', 'critical', 'new', 'leigh', 'many', 'afraid', 'new', 'unexplored', 'huge', 'entire', 'rebel', 'powerful', 'imperial', 'ruthless', 'rebel', 'inseparable', 'brave', 'cocky', 'brave', 'intelligent', 'great', 'rebel', 'huge', 'able', 'sinister', 'understandable', 'major', 'good', 'good', 'modern', 'great', 'evil', 'massive', 'full', 'great', 'human', 'unforgettable', 'amazing', 'beautiful', 'small', 'big', 'human', 'jedi', 'other', 'dark', 'dark', 'technical', 'incredible', 'visual', 'beautiful', 'visual', 'new', 'memorable', 'imperial', 'strange', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'beautiful', 'strong', 'incredible', 'big', 'eternal'];0.2784600815850815

366;squir1y;"i know what you're thinking. ""there are millions of movies out there, what makes this your all time favorite?"" well the truth is this. i've seen hundreds of movies in my life. when it comes to me and film, there's no genre i don't like and a movie has to have a lot of annoying qualities for me to dislike it. so i'm quite easy to please when it comes to the cinema. i know i haven't answered your question yet but bear with me. there was a time before i saw star wars and at that point i never really saw a movie that i didn't like. but once i first witnessed the adventures in that galaxy far, far away, my imagination (for the very first time) was actually pulled from reality and into this ""space opera"". i've never really been one for fantasy. in fact to this day, i can't quite understand the hoopla surrounding harry potter or the lord of the rings. but for some reason i can't really explain, these movies did it for me. you see, the (original) star wars trilogy for me is what really made me look at movies as more than just something to keep you entertained on a rainy day. at this point on, it was the basis of comparison to all the films i've seen in my life. i have yet to see a movie that i like better and i doubt i ever will because when it comes to my taste in movies, this trilogy is as perfect as it gets. now that i've totally gotten over my little star wars love fest there, let me go on to explain why the empire strikes back is my favorite. i didn't see star wars until i was 15 so i wasn't one of those kids who grew up with it. although if i knew then what i knew now, i'm sure it would be different. anyway, i started seeing all this commotion about it's special edition re-release in 1997. it was obvious that there was something special about these movies that stood the test of time. so i went into the basement and found my dad's old beta copies of the trilogy and decided to check them out. (i'm glad i kept my old beta vcr, heheh) i popped in the original film and suddenly a whole new world of film was opened up to me. (but that's a whole other story.) i was so captivated by the magic of the original film, that i was kind of afraid to watch the sequels as i was afraid they would be inferior. how do you live up to that kind of masterpiece? i've never second guessed a movie since that day. so the time came to watch the empire strikes back. i wanted to see the continuing adventures of luke skywalker, han solo and princess leia and see if they could really bring down the evil darth vader. they blew up the death star already i thought they won! until this point, i thought star wars was just this happy tale of good triumphing over evil. well... i was blown away to see luke attacked by the wampa ice creature when the movie started, the at-at walkers demolishing the rebel base on hoth, han solo frozen in carbonite before the eyes of those who loved him and darth vader revealing luke skywalker's true parentage. (of course, i already knew that, but everyone knew even if they didn't see the movies.) at the end, the bad guys won. you don't really see that in a lot of movies, because it wouldn't work. unless you're creating a trilogy, that just doesn't sit well with audiences. if i saw robocop and at the end he was blown to pieces, i would be disappointed. but here it works, because you knew there was another movie coming and there was time to make everything all right. this movie has everything a film buff could love. it has action, humor, romance and characters that i haven't been so in love with until i saw trainspotting. however, that's a completely different type of film. by the time it was all over, i realized that this film had more of an impact on me emotionally than the original film did. at the end of the first film i found myself cheering for the characters. at the end of this one i found myself worrying about them and hoping that it would all be all right. the star wars saga is, and will always be my favorite saga of all time. because even if i'm having a bad day at work or one of my friends gets mad at me for saying something stupid or a girl decides she's finally had enough of me, the star wars saga will always be there to bring back my sanity. heheh. and that's why this is my favorite movie of all time. 10/10";28 October 1999;10;['favorite', 'annoying', 'easy', 'first', 'original', 'more', 'rainy', 'perfect', 'little', 'favorite', 'sure', 'different', 'special', 'obvious', 'special', 'old', 'beta', 'glad', 'old', 'original', 'whole', 'new', 'whole', 'other', 'original', 'afraid', 'afraid', 'inferior', 'evil', 'happy', 'good', 'rebel', 'true', 'bad', 'right', 'different', 'more', 'original', 'first', 'right', 'favorite', 'bad', 'mad', 'stupid', 'enough', 'favorite'];0.1230455060812203

368;Marx_Bros_Fan86;"since its release the empire strikes back has gained a lot of popularity, and it is now widely considered to be the best of the series. initially many people were disappointed with its cliffhanger ending. i know i wouldn't want to wait three years for the answer to the ""big question"" that was surely on everyone's minds! anyway, i think empire has become widely respected for its maturity in comparison to the other star wars movies. it's much more dramatic than a new hope, and it doesn't have the cutesy aspects of return of the jedi. until revenge of the sith, empire was the darkest star wars movie. empire clearly beats it in the execution department though. all of the characters are put into the worst situations imaginable and have to fight their way out. i think empire's greatest strength is the character development of luke, han, and leia. luke faces his greatest fear (confronting vader) and a romance blooms between han and leia. while the script and the performances are not oscar worthy i do think this star wars movie has the best performances in the series. i believe this is largely due to irvin kirshner taking over the director's helm for lucas. lucas is notorious for not being very good with actors; his trademark instructions are ""do it faster and more intense."" kirshner and producer gary kurtz made sure a lot of care went into the character moments. personally i don't think lucas would have done that. another aspect i like is the fact that the character development is very well balanced, so it doesn't feel like any of the principle characters are just tag-alongs, like in rotj. darth vader becomes the ultimate bad ass here in his hunt for luke. my favorite vader line: ""the force is with you young skywalker... but you are not a jedi yet."" the lightsaber duel is my favorite of the series as well. there was something evil about the carbon freezing chamber, perhaps it was that red glow. empire brought us to some of the best locations in the series, such as the swamp planet dagobah, the ice planet hoth, and cloud city. this happens to be the only star wars movie that doesn't have tattooine. the snow speeder battle contains some excellent stop motion animation which holds up very well today. it certainly was unusual to put the major dogfight scene in the beginning of the movie rather than at the end, but i don't think many people complained. we are also introduced to new characters like lando calrissian (billy dee williams), boba fett (jeremy bulloch), and yoda. frank oz's performance is nothing short of amazing. he deserves a great deal of credit for turning a rubber puppet into a living, breathing person. like lucas said, if that puppet hadn't worked the whole movie would have been lost. one valid criticism of empire is that the action really just stops once luke lands on dagobah. i can't say i was ever bored by empire's middle act. i found luke's jedi training and han and leia's moments to be thoroughly entertaining. however, i can perfectly understand why a casual moviegoer would be bored by this act. either way, ebs is still a must see for any film buff.";21 February 2007;10;['good', 'many', 'big', 'other', 'dramatic', 'new', 'cutesy', 'dark', 'bad', 'imaginable', 'great', 'great', 'oscar', 'worthy', 'good', 'due', 'notorious', 'good', 'intense', 'sure', 'balanced', 'principle', 'ultimate', 'bad', 'favorite', 'young', 'evil', 'red', 'good', 'such', 'only', 'excellent', 'unusual', 'major', 'many', 'new', 'short', 'amazing', 'great', 'whole', 'valid', 'luke', 'middle', 'entertaining', 'casual'];0.187438574938575
369;tjgoalie13;star wars: the empire strikes back is arguably the best star wars film ever made, and one of the best films ever made. the film immortalized the already iconic characters that george lucas created in star wars, while making a very dense and entertaining film. the empire strikes back is so great because of the improvements made to darth vader, the ambitious tonal change, and the fact that it still contains one of the best twists ever. with enough analysis the most impressive thing about the empire strikes back is how hard it is to find flaws in the film. darth vader still stands, and probably always will stand as one of the best villains ever brought to the screen, second on my list only to the dark knight's joker. however, in vader's first appearance vader is slightly inconsistent in that he's a temperamental villain often yelling, which isn't nearly as scary as a villain who remains calm. i would contest that the best villains act like they are always in control, whether they are not, it is in the empire strikes back that vader develops into this villain, while also systematically murdering his failing accomplices. it could be argued that vader's development helped the tonal change that empire strikes back brought. it's another testament to the villain, when they are so chilling that the tone of the film seemingly dives with them. as vader develops into the more controlled, systematic villain the tone of the film dives into a darker world. with star wars being considered, at least partially, a kids film it seems extremely ambitious of lucas and kershner to make a film directed at kids dark, something many filmmakers are unwilling to do today. the dark tone helps accentuate the character development as the characters hit their all time lows, and the film's tone represents that the world isn't always nice. the story for empire strikes back, being the middle film in the trilogy, had the most freedom, and used it accordingly. the story of empire strikes back is arguably, the strongest in the series, as the film was one of the earliest to say the bad guy can win, in a giant blockbuster, another very ambitious move. however, the best element of the story is the unpredictable turns it makes, in particular it's iconic twist. the twist remains one of the most famous of all time, for a reason, and the film benefits from it. in the end empire strikes back has the best story in the trilogy, the best character development, is very ambitious, and immortalizes it's iconic villain. on top of all of that it has been copied numerous times over the years, and remains one of the best films ever made. empire strikes back still stands as the embodiment of what makes star wars so great.;28 October 2015;10;['good', 'good', 'iconic', 'dense', 'entertaining', 'great', 'ambitious', 'tonal', 'good', 'enough', 'impressive', 'hard', 'good', 'second', 'dark', 'first', 'inconsistent', 'temperamental', 'scary', 'calm', 'good', 'tonal', 'chilling', 'systematic', 'dark', 'least', 'ambitious', 'dark', 'many', 'unwilling', 'dark', 'nice', 'middle', 'most', 'strong', 'early', 'bad', 'giant', 'ambitious', 'good', 'unpredictable', 'particular', 'iconic', 'famous', 'good', 'good', 'ambitious', 'iconic', 'numerous', 'good', 'great'];0.2770833333333332

372;eamon-hennedy;this is superb. this is truly one of the best sequels i have ever seen, not only as a star wars film, but as one of the best sequels in the history of film making. like the granddaddy of all sequels, the godfather part ii, the empire strikes back takes the original, develops it and continues with it but is not afraid to go into darker places. we have hans solo being frozen alive, luke being told that darth vader is his actual father and to top it all of he has his arm chopped of by him. as kid's films go, this is brilliant and dark. if the first film was like the magician's trick, this is more like a shakespearean play, a hint of tragedy taking hold of proceedings. the characters are taken on more darker paths throughout the narrative that leads to a frightening downbeat cliffhanger. there is a sense of maturity in the proceedings here. maybe it comes with a different director using the special effects tools in a more mature manner of different writers, but the more superficial problems that the first film had are gone here. the acting is much, much better, mark hamill putting in a brilliant portrayal of a luke that is finding his life taking a more darker turn than before. the chemistry between carrie fisher and harrison ford retains some of the more fun and light hearted aspects, but then this leads to a darker pay off and a scene of sheer emotional intensity it is almost blinding. to think, this was intended as a kid's film. once again the special effects are fantastic, but the screenplay from lawrence kasdan and leigh brackett as well as the direction of irvin kershner make this a stand out too. john williams' music is superb as always, but here he outdoes even himself, possibly doing his finest music for his hollywood blockbuster market. the sweeping music during the asteroid chase and the vader theme are undeniably classic pieces of music. this being the second part of the trilogy there are none of the constraints of the first part. the film begins almost mid flow, with the rebels on the run (this in itself marking out the downbeat nature of the film, the rebels aren't so much as fighting as running away), there is no nagging re-introductions of characters or dialog that covers what's happened before in part one, which is most welcome. what we get is essentially the second act on a three act film, and here everything clicks into place perfectly. the first one may be the most fondly remembered, but for me, the empire strikes back is the one that is the greatest.;1 December 2003;10;['superb', 'good', 'good', 'original', 'afraid', 'dark', 'frozen', 'alive', 'actual', 'brilliant', 'dark', 'first', 'shakespearean', 'dark', 'frightening', 'downbeat', 'different', 'special', 'mature', 'different', 'superficial', 'first', 'much', 'well', 'brilliant', 'dark', 'more', 'light', 'hearted', 'dark', 'sheer', 'emotional', 'special', 'fantastic', 'leigh', 'superb', 'fine', 'hollywood', 'sweeping', 'classic', 'second', 'first', 'mid', 'downbeat', 'much', 'nagging', 'welcome', 'second', 'first', 'great'];0.2441697191697192

375;michaelgarykelley1994;"when it comes to sequels, i strongly believe that everyone gets an empty feeling in their stomach. there can always be a misfire when it comes to the next chapter of a saga, and this one was one of those films that worried many, many fans. at the same time, however, it was very anticipated. ""star wars: the empire strikes back"" ranks as my second favorite ""star wars"" film, following closely behind ""star wars: return of the jedi"". most fans would disagree with my arrangement of favorites, yet i don't believe any would disagree with this film getting an outrageous score. that's right. ""star wars: the empire strikes back"" is--simply put--phenomenal. everything from the scale of the film to the sets to the acting to the writing has improved from the original film. the rebel alliance, at the beginning of this film, are relocated in an icy planet called hoth. as they wait for luke to return from his scouting, han solo goes on the rescue to save luke, whom was captured and nearly eaten by a polar bear-like monstrosity. after they return to the rebel base, the empire locates the rebels with a droid sent to hoth, and then they invade the area, attempting to find luke skywalker and his friends. the base is destroyed, but now luke must go to dagoba, in search for jedi master yoda so that he may begin his jedi training. once again, mark hammill, harrison ford, and carrie fisher (along with every single actor from the original film) make a return for this enormously exciting sequel. however, their performances have taken a huge step upward, crafting one of the best character-based films ever created. this time around, you can practically cut the tension in the air with a lightsaber because of these stupendous performances. it seems like every actor became one with their character even moreso than in the original phenomenon. another huge step forward was the writing. george lucas may have created the prequel films in later years, but there is no denying that his writing was extravagant in this particular film. ""star wars: the empire strikes back"" has a deep message along with a--what i consider, at least--better storyline, along with better character arcs. lucas outdid himself with this screenplay. this film also included one of the most shocking plot twists in film history, and it changed ""star wars"" fans forever. this particular scene also became the most quoted line in cinema history, seeing as how revolutionary it had become. one more surprise with this film is that the special effects have gotten ten times better than the original. everything about this film is perfect, to a tee, when it comes to the special effects. we even get a real lightsaber fight this time around, clocking in at about fifteen minutes long. i wasn't near being born when this film came out, but everyone tells me that this lightsaber battle was so intense that they couldn't control themselves at the the theatres. even the space scenes look real. the detailing of the scale models used for spaceships were extensive and edgy. ""star wars: the empire strikes back"" is just too perfect. the film was way beyond its time of release, and that is an absolute mouthful. my rating for ""the empire strikes back"" is a complete, well-deserved ten-out-of-ten stars. i recommend this movie to anyone and everyone. may the force be with you! god bless, and merry christmas!";16 December 2013;10;['empty', 'next', 'many', 'many', 'same', 'anticipated', 'second', 'favorite', 'most', 'outrageous', 'right', 'phenomenal', 'original', 'icy', 'polar', 'like', 'rebel', 'jedi', 'single', 'original', 'exciting', 'huge', 'good', 'stupendous', 'original', 'huge', 'prequel', 'later', 'extravagant', 'particular', 'deep', 'least', 'well', 'well', 'shocking', 'particular', 'revolutionary', 'more', 'special', 'well', 'original', 'perfect', 'special', 'real', 'intense', 'real', 'extensive', 'edgy', 'perfect', 'absolute', 'mouthful', 'complete'];0.1915413533834586
376;AmyJenson1995;i remember watching a star wars documentary called empire of dreams which is about how the first trilogy came to life and his tremendous success which is still going on today. during one of the many interviews george lucas gave for this doc, he remembered the huge deal of pressure he had to bear on his shoulders while filming empire strikes back. he produced it with his own money he earned thanks to the huge success of the first movie as he wanted to keep his independence from the big studios. the fans had also a lot of expectations about the upcoming movie so george lucas wanted it the same level if not better than a new hope. and it is. while a new hope was focused on this small band of young people and their struggle to destroy a devastating weapon of mass destruction, lucas has dedicated this movie into developing each one of the characters as well as the relationship between them with its lot of surprises. that famous scene when luke learns the terrible truth about his father's fate is one of them and to me this is the knockout moment of empire. the other big novelty is this romance between han and leia. it's a great addition to the story line which allows us to discover another entirely hidden side of both of them. it's fun and sweet to see them teasing at each other. it adds some lightness too in a very dark plot. we are also introduced to three main new characters who are part of the star wars legacy: yoda, the emperor and lando calrisian. there's no need to introduce yoda, the cunning and wise jedi master, who is maybe small by this height but awesomely powerful with the force. in the first movie, obi-wan introduced us to this powerful invisible superpower but yoda is the one who tells everything about it while we follow luke in his jedi training. he shows us the true meaning of the force. this was what made this character so important to the general story. about the emperor, even if we don't see much of him in empire, we understand that he's the main villain of the story and that in fact darth vader is one of his victims. of course we still see a lot of epic combat scenes like the battle of hoth with those imperial walkers advancing towards the rebel base, the pursuit in the asteroid field or of course the duel on bespin between luke and vader which climaxed with the surprising revelation of darth vader to his son. all of those made this movie incredibly awesome. to me empire strikes back is the best episode of the entire saga and it's not surprising that so many are seeing it as the movie to compare each time a new star wars movie is released.;8 January 2017;10;['first', 'tremendous', 'many', 'huge', 'own', 'huge', 'first', 'big', 'upcoming', 'same', 'well', 'new', 'new', 'small', 'young', 'devastating', 'mass', 'famous', 'terrible', 'other', 'big', 'great', 'fun', 'sweet', 'other', 'dark', 'main', 'new', 'small', 'powerful', 'first', 'powerful', 'invisible', 'jedi', 'true', 'important', 'general', 'much', 'main', 'epic', 'imperial', 'rebel', 'surprising', 'awesome', 'good', 'entire', 'surprising', 'many', 'new'];0.1978566149297856

383;tml_pohlak_13;"for some reason, the beginning of this ""star wars"" movie is ""messed up"" again. in the original star wars, the first 25 minutes is boring. the same argument does not (indeed, can not) apply to the empire strikes back. it starts on an exciting note, and the excitement never slows down. what's wrong then? the beginning is just too confusing! a while passed between the two films, and luke's voice sounds somewhat different. so for about the first 10 minutes of the movie, (where no faces are shown, and only han solo's name was mentioned) i was wondering: ""is it really him? or was it someone else?"" omitting that confusing first 10 minutes, this movie was, to be perfectly honest, amazing. the acting really improved, i think, from the original. i positively loved billy dee williams (who should've played two-face in batman iii) in this movie. james earl jones, who delivered a fantastic performance in the original, was even better here. (darth vader's sardonic line ""apology accepted"" was just amazingly delivered!) he was even scarier, i'd say. harrison ford's character was a little more developed, as was carrie fisher's. mark hamill did a great job, too. of course, now we get to the list of annoying characters. c3po really began to bug me in this movie, which he didn't do as much in the original star wars. i still found chewbacca to be really irritating most of the time. r2d2's inability to communicate in anything other than beeps and whirs (that had to be interpreted by c3po) got on my nerves really often. and, of course, before yoda revealed who he was (although everyone knows by now how he looks like), he was the most annoying of the lot. what i loved about this movie was john williams' music. he certainly went against my expectations. instead of composing a sci-fi sounding score, with futuristic sounding instruments, he composed one ""traditionally"". and it was far more effective than any sci-fi music could've been! the plot is a lot more exciting, dangerous, and, i'd say, refined, than the original. it never slows down it's a wild ride. it certainly is a huge improvement over the original star wars.";12 March 2009;10;['original', 'first', 'same', 'exciting', 'wrong', 'confusing', 'different', 'first', 'honest', 'amazing', 'original', 'fantastic', 'original', 'well', 'sardonic', 'scary', 'great', 'annoying', 'much', 'original', 'most', 'other', 'annoying', 'futuristic', 'effective', 'exciting', 'dangerous', 'original', 'wild', 'huge', 'original'];0.1379629629629629

387;xiaoli7377;"note: this review is based on the 2019 version of the film available on disney+. there have been many different versions of ""the empire strikes back"" released through the decades, and the original ""star wars"" trilogy is infamous in the fact that the original theatrical versions of the films are not widely available to the public. with this in mind, i believe that denoting which version of the film that i am watching to write this review should be taken into account. ""the empire strikes back"" is the least altered of the original movies, with only a few very minor shots, special effects, and continuity changes made to the movie. it is commonly believed that this is because george lucas had the least amount of involvement in the production of this one. i honestly don't mind any of the changes made to the second film at all: the continuity changes help bring the movie in line with other films in the franchise, and the updated special effects at cloud city are nowhere near as jarring and annoying as the changes to mos eisley in the first movie, or jabba's palace in ""return of the jedi."" that all being said, i would still prefer the option from disney to watch whichever version of the movies that i want to watch. a special release similar to the ""blade runner"" box set would be nice. ""the empire strikes back"" takes place some time after ""star wars"", as our heroes are all in hiding on the remote ice planet of hoth. darth vader (david prowse/james earl jones) is sending probes out to distant star systems to find the hidden rebel base and to find luke skywalker (mark hamill), who the emperor (ian mcdiarmid in this version, clive revill/marjorie eaton in the original) believes will be a powerful asset. after a battle between snow-speeders and at-at walkers on hoth, luke splits off from han solo (harrison ford) and princess leia (carrie fisher) to go to the planet dagobah, where he will receive further jedi training from master yoda (frank oz). meanwhile, han, leia, chewbacca (peter mayhew), and c-3po (anthony daniels) make a daring escape from the empire through an asteroid field. they eventually wind up in cloud city, which is governed by an old friend of han's, the sly lando calrissian (billy dee williams). everything from the original ""star wars"" is improved. the stakes are higher, the plot, pacing, and tone are all slimmed down and tightened. mark hamill gives a much better performance this time around, no longer being the annoying and whiny brat that he always seemed to be in the original to me. the single main villain this time, as opposed to having two villains in the first film (tarkin and vader), gives the movie a much better narrative focus. vader is also much more interesting in this movie, too. he was little more than a henchman for tarkin in the first, but this time his character is given some depth, and he also delivers one of the greatest plot twists in the history of cinema. the special effects in ""the empire strikes back"" are yet another thing that lucasfilm beefed up. compare the death star attack in the first movie to the asteroid field scenes in the second. the use of puppets for tauntauns, asteroid monsters, and yoda all still hold up well today, forty years after the release of the movie. the stop motion effects for the tauntauns are probably the only effects that have aged poorly, but they're actually pretty well obscured by the snowy environments of hoth, and they're really only employed during long shots anyways. this is a personal favorite, and it's rightly regarded as one of the greatest sequels of all time. most great sequels still often stand in the shadows of their predecessors. i can only think of three off the top of my head that completely blow the originals out of the water (""terminator 2: judgment day"" and ""the dark knight"" being the other two). the entire original ""star wars"" trilogy is worth a watch for any movie fan. i can understand personal arguments for the preference of either of the other films, but one can't deny that ""the empire strikes back"" is the most well-crafted film in the entire saga. it's quite a shame that both the prequel and sequel trilogies were not able to recapture the magic and cultural influence that the original group of movies did, which set a benchmark for action-adventure blockbuster cinema and inspired generations.";18 September 2020;10;['available', 'many', 'different', 'original', 'infamous', 'original', 'theatrical', 'available', 'original', 'few', 'minor', 'special', 'least', 'second', 'other', 'special', 'jarring', 'annoying', 'first', 'special', 'similar', 'nice', 'remote', 'distant', 'rebel', 'clive', 'original', 'powerful', 'further', 'daring', 'old', 'original', 'high', 'well', 'annoying', 'whiny', 'single', 'main', 'first', 'well', 'narrative', 'interesting', 'more', 'first', 'great', 'special', 'first', 'only', 'snowy', 'long', 'personal', 'favorite', 'great', 'great', 'dark', 'other', 'entire', 'original', 'worth', 'personal', 'other', 'entire', 'prequel', 'sequel', 'able', 'magic', 'cultural', 'original'];0.1663826232247284
388;CalDexter;the first sequel is the darkest and the best ever made. (i know that episode iii is still to come out but i dunno...) my own theory for the success of the empire strikes back is that at the time of it's release audiences believed it would be more of the same as the first film but bigger and better, what they got also was a great storyline, developing characters both good and bad, blazing action sequences and john williams empire/darth vader score that was to return in the next movie. my personal favourite character in this episode has to be darth vader. alfred hitchcock once said if you make a thriller or suspense drama and there are bad guys in your story they have to be interesting and dangerous, in vader's case his introduction on his star destroyer when we first see him standing with his back to us gazing out at the empire's fleet of cruisers, you hear his heavy breathing, the film is saying to us 'no introduction necessary!' after that he starts murdering commanders who fail to catch the rebels in the millennium falcon with a wit that is darker than his cape, i also loved the part where he has an audience with the emperor, that scene is dripping with evil, vader perched on a podium while a huge hologram of the emperor beams over him and they plot to lure luke skywalker to the dark side, this scene also suggests that vader has purpose for wanting skywalker to live, as we later find out. the memorable duel between darth vader and luke skywalker is one of the most defining moments of the trilogy. i remember seeing this film on it's special edition re-release in the glasgow odeon in 1997, when vader states 'the force is with you young skywalker...but you are not a jedi yet.' luke climbs those stairs to face his nemesis, the audience just shut up. what i'm saying is this moment is the fight the fans were all waiting for and the outcome was so surprising and cliffhanging that people could not believe that a space fantasy film had come to such a conclusion of uncertainty for the heroic rebels. the empire strikes back is not only the best star wars film but quite possibly one of the greatest films ever made in over a hundred years of cinema history.;10 August 2004;10;['first', 'dark', 'good', 'own', 'more', 'same', 'first', 'big', 'great', 'good', 'bad', 'next', 'personal', 'favourite', 'alfred', 'bad', 'interesting', 'dangerous', 'star', 'heavy', 'necessary', 'dark', 'dripping', 'huge', 'dark', 'memorable', 'defining', 'special', 'glasgow', 'young', 'surprising', 'heroic', 'good', 'great'];0.210969387755102
389;thesouthfamily2-552-707097;"""the empire strikes back'' is the best of three star wars films, and the most thought-provoking. after the space opera cheerfulness of the original film, this one plunges into darkness and even despair, and surrenders more completely to the underlying mystery of the story. it is because of the emotions stirred in ""empire'' that the entire series takes on a mythic quality that resonates back to the first and ahead to the third. this is the heart of the original star wars trilogy. entirely apart from the story and the plot, the film is worth seeing simply for its sights. not for the scenes of space battle; but watch it for such sights as the lumbering, elephant-like imperial walkers. or for the cloud city, on its spire high in the sky. or for the face of a creature named yoda, whose expressions are as convincing as a human's, and as subtle. or for the vertiginous heights that luke skywalker dangles over, after nearly plunging to his death. there are a couple of amusing subplots, one involving han's easily wounded male ego, another about vader's knack of issuing sudden and fatal demotions. then comes the defining moment of the series. can there be a person alive who does not know (read no further if you are that person) that luke discovers darth vader is his father? but that is not the moment. it comes after their light saber duel, when luke chooses to fall to his death rather than live to be the son of vader. in the glory days of science fiction, critics wrote about the ""sense of wonder.'' that's what ""the empire strikes back'' creates in us. like a lot of traditional science fiction, it isn't psychologically complex or even very interested in personalities (aside from some obvious character traits). that's because the characters are not themselves they are us. we are looking out through their eyes, instead of into them, as we would in more serious drama. we are on a quest, on a journey, on a mythological expedition. the story elements in the ""star wars'' trilogy are as deep and universal as storytelling itself. watching these movies, we're in a receptive state like that of a child--our eyes and ears are open, we're paying attention, and we are amazed.";25 January 2014;10;['good', 'provoking', 'original', 'entire', 'mythic', 'first', 'third', 'original', 'worth', 'such', 'like', 'imperial', 'convincing', 'subtle', 'vertiginous', 'amusing', 'sudden', 'fatal', 'defining', 'alive', 'light', 'traditional', 'complex', 'interested', 'obvious', 'serious', 'mythological', 'deep', 'universal', 'receptive', 'open', 'amazed'];0.131060606060606
390;Mitch-25;a lot of people have said this before, but i will say it again, empire strikes back is the best of the star wars series. star wars was great, don't get me wrong. but, star wars was a movie to introduce the characters. this is a movie to let those characters do something. when you see the battle on hoth or on cloud city, you know the characters. this movie gives them much more to do. plus the special effects are very very good, and even in 2002 more than hold their own against the best of today. yoda was an outstanding creation. i can not understand some of the comments i have seen here that criticize lucas for including yoda. he provides balance to the entire series, and is most certainly not a muppet. it was a very necessary part of the movie and of the series.;9 December 2002;10;['good', 'great', 'wrong', 'more', 'special', 'good', 'more', 'own', 'good', 'outstanding', 'lucas', 'entire', 'necessary'];0.4047619047619047
391;Mitch-25;i remember seeing this classic movie as a kid. i loved it then, and now that i am grown up and know a bit more about movies (and have seen many more of them), i love this movie even more. where star wars: a new hope was a movie that introduced the main characters of the first trilogy, empire is the movie that really gets into the meat of the story. luke trains with yoda to become a jedi, the others (han, leia and c3po) are chased by the evil empire, and of course luke finds out that darth vader (the best villan in the history of the movies) is his father. this is also the movie where george lucas was free to do just about anything he wanted with his special effects. and, it really shows in this movie. the scenes on hoth with the imperial walkers are very cool even by today's standards. the asteroids and space battles are much better than in a new hope, much more refined. just about everything in this movie effects wise is an improvement on a new hope. i love all three of the first trilogy. i even like episodes 1 and 2 (although they both pale in comparison). however, this is by far the best of either of the series. let's just hope that episode 3 lives up to the greatness of this great movie series.;28 August 2003;10;['classic', 'more', 'many', 'more', 'new', 'main', 'first', 'evil', 'good', 'free', 'special', 'imperial', 'cool', 'well', 'new', 'refined', 'wise', 'new', 'first', 'good', 'great'];0.3194203944203944

394;charlessmith702210;"i can only speculate in episode iv that because vader realized that his imperial battle station was destroyed by the rebel force, his own ship went back to one of the star destroyer ships. this is because at the start of episode v, you see vader on one of those star destroyers. those imperial space ships, which looks like a slice of cheese in white with their big triangular shapes, also appear in earnest in episode vi, but i think i am going to jump ahead...... the only exciting part in episode v seems to be when the small band of rebel fighters destroy two of the imperial walkers, which look like large metallic horses in white, armed with 2 twin cannons. one rebel fighter used a harpoon string to knock out one walker; the other fighter actually was brave enough to get into the underbelly of the walker, rig that area with a thermal bomb, and then the bomb blew up causing that walker to go down for good. another exciting part was the awful part---you still witness vader's evil wizardry, including the part when he magically chokes to death one of the star destroyer officers for failing to stop the rebel forces soon enough. besides the confrontation of the rebel forces with the imperial walkers, the action in episode v was less exciting than all of the other star wars flicks, but you see things that you normally see in space--an asteroid field where some of the imperial ships chasing some of the rebel fleet were destroyed, and of course, the different colors of the planets. of course, like any star wars movies, there are quiet moments in episode v through those famous clashes involving light sabres and ship attacks. the quiet moment that i had to carefully look into was luke's jedi training with yoda while luke was on dagobah. this jedi training was a little bit like army boot camp and prison torture, especially when luke, in a handstand, uses the force to try to move a heavy object. well, the conclusion of the flick doesn't involve an explosion, but instead, it is in two parts: vader fighting against luke, and also han solo being condemned to be frozen alive in a carbonite casket. some of the star wars fans may have been a little sad to see one of the good guys being frozen alive. in addition, there was even larger tension when the star destroyer was going to use the tractor beam on the millennium falcon after luke, who confronted darth vader on cloud city and lost his hand in a light sabre fight, says that he will never turn to the dark side of the force, although vader says by doing so, he can save the galaxies from further doom. in other matters, han solo, after rescuing luke from vader, finds out that the falcon had its hyperspace drive tampered with. it seemed like hope was going to be destroyed fast for the good guys on the falcon with the tractor beam on the vader ship about to be activated on the falcon, until that miracle droid, r2-d2, found a way to repair the hyperspace drive control, and just like that, like as if it was fired from gun, the falcon disappears into space at light speed. vader is shocked. well, you see a little good in him....i anticpated that he would magically choke the new star destroyer admiral for letting the falcon escape, but he decides not to, and focuses his ideals on the construction of a second death star...which will appear in earnest in episode vi. the final shots of the movie, as i found out, is sullust, a rebel staging area in space (not on a planet), where the falcon is rescued by large rebel fleet mostly made of transport ships and frigate ships, and will play a very major part in episode vi. here, leia and luke are determined to confront the evil jabba the hutt and try to rescue han solo from the carbonite casket.";16 December 2006;6;['imperial', 'rebel', 'own', 'imperial', 'white', 'big', 'triangular', 'only', 'exciting', 'small', 'rebel', 'imperial', 'large', 'metallic', 'white', 'armed', 'twin', 'rebel', 'other', 'brave', 'thermal', 'exciting', 'awful', 'evil', 'rebel', 'rebel', 'imperial', 'exciting', 'other', 'imperial', 'rebel', 'different', 'quiet', 'famous', 'light', 'quiet', 'jedi', 'little', 'heavy', 'alive', 'little', 'sad', 'good', 'frozen', 'alive', 'large', 'light', 'dark', 'further', 'other', 'good', 'about', 'light', 'shocked', 'little', 'good', 'new', 'second', 'final', 'rebel', 'large', 'rebel', 'major', 'determined', 'evil'];0.0326562971911809

397;cleary-joshua;"i would argue, as would many others, that this is the best of all six star wars films. i mean, it's just got so many awesome components to it. firstly, there's the change in leia and han's relationship. their previous banter throughout episode iv, and the first half of this film, almost begs for the two of them to end up together. and i'm really glad that they did at the moment when they did, because to be honest, their constant jibes at each other were getting a bit annoying. thanks to that carbon-freezing chamber, they stop bickering and eventually end up together. next, there's yoda. i'm pretty sure star wars would not be nearly as successful as it is without this little green creature. he's completely insane at first (a stark contrast with the prequel trilogy), and it really works in this light. he's the crazy master that luke has to follow because obi-wan trusts him, and despite all of the crazy, he's very lovable and quite awesome. there are so many other things in this film that i could mention, because there is so much of merit here. i could talk in great detail about hoth, at-ats, cloud city, obi-wan visions and of course lando calrissian. however, there is one major plot point which i want to talk about, which is the famous ""i am your father"" twist. (i would say spoiler, but please!) i have previously commented on the extensive use of twists in the plot of star wars, and the fact that you can't be sure what was decided on originally, and what was a late addition. i do believe, however, that this twist was thought up in the original story, when episode iv was being written. having watched ""a new hope"" knowing about it, there are a lot of things said which hint at the fact that vader is luke's real father. it is also completely spoiled if you've seen any of the prequels despite the fact that it's now become a complete cliche, it still works well in the film, and later becomes a useful plot point in the climax of episode vi.";21 June 2013;10;['many', 'good', 'many', 'awesome', 'previous', 'first', 'glad', 'honest', 'constant', 'other', 'annoying', 'sure', 'successful', 'little', 'green', 'insane', 'stark', 'prequel', 'crazy', 'crazy', 'lovable', 'awesome', 'many', 'other', 'much', 'great', 'major', 'famous', 'extensive', 'sure', 'late', 'original', 'new', 'real', 'complete', 'useful'];0.1763544536271809

400;amiranda-39274;"as a kid i was never interested in star wars, for one reason or another i just never watched any of the movies. it was until 10 years later when i was 17 years old, that i was visiting my grandparents for the day and i decided to watch some cable, i came across a star wars marathon, it happened to be the final battle of ep 1, where darth maul fights quigon and kenobi, i was spellbound. i was blown away by star wars that i didn't change the channel and i decided to watch the rest of the 6 movie saga in one night. my life was forever changed that day. recently i decided to have a star wars marathon, and give an up to date review of the 6 movies. the story: after the destruction of the death star, the empire is determined to find and destroy the rebellion, and darth vader has special interest in finding luke skywalker, to turn him to the dark side. after an extraordinary battle on the ice planet of hoth, the rebellion are now on the run, with han, leia and chewbacca being mercilessily chased by the empire. meanwhile luke is told by the ghost of his old mentor, ben kenobi to travel to an obscure planet to find an ancient jedi master named yoda, to complete his training as a jedi knight. despite yodas best efforts, luke is still not ready, which complicates things, when his friends are captured by the empire, and he decides to go rescue them, defying yoda and kenobis advice. what proceeds, is the most impactful confrontation in all of fiction. with luke having a lightsaber duel with darth vader, and ending with vader revealing that he is lukes long lost father. if there is a person alive who doesn't know this spoiler than i would be surprised, even i knew about the"" i am your father "" way before watching it, but i will say every time i see it i am amazed and shocked by this impressive plot twist the characters: luke is far more mature in this movie, but can still be reckless, despite his efforts to be trained by yoda, he chooses to save his friends over his much needed training, and is handed his ass by vader, which humbles luke and puts him back on the path to being a powerful jedi with experience. darth vader is also given a lot of development in this film, instead of being the faceless big bad, we understand he is a servant to an even greater evil, but we are reminded that vader is ruthless and not to be trusted, which is what makes his reveal to luke seem questionable. despite this you can feel his disappointment when luke refuses to join him, and that he is not the emotionless monster we all believed him to be. the rejection of his own son could have very well awakened anakin within him, and in fact it is luke that creates the potential for vaders redemption. han is shown to be just as smug as ever, as he tries to gain the affection of leia throughout the movie, but it is his love for his friends and leia that make him so much more than a scruffy looking nerf herder. leia is quite aggressive in this movie, mostly towards han, but that could be because she has repressed feelings for him, that she doesnt not want to acknowledge since it might bring down her authority, but as we all know love makes you stronger. lando calrissian has to be the smoothest talker in this galaxy, and despite his betrayal, he is still likeable, which is why its a relief when he helps the heroes in the end. boba fett doesn't have many lines, but his mere presence is spine tingling, and being the first mandalorian on screen is quite impressive. yoda is goofy and cute at first, he then makes the transition to the wise grandmaster of the jedi we know and love, never once is the illusion shattered for me, by his puppetry work, instead i believe he is a living breathing creature. the action: the battle of hoth is quite impressive, with the walkers, space fighters, and ground troops all creating an amazing action sequence that is both energetic and immersive. the millennium falcon chase, can seem quite long, but there is so much done with it, such as going through an asteroid field, that it contributes to the adventure aspect of the film. while the lightsaber fight is not as energetic or as spectacular as the ones seen in the prequels or clone wars tv show, this fight is still well choreographed, with vader also using a lot of force powers during the fight, as well as a lot of suspense being included with luke being hopelessly outclassed. all the effects from the creature to the lightsabers, are highly better in this movie than the first, and it really makes you feel that this is a real galaxy. the legacy: this is without a doubt the best star wars movie that not only gives the audience a good dose of action, adventure, romance, and wonder, it is also the movie that defined star wars. yoda educating luke about the force is both profound and engrossing, and is probably what helps lead to the grand expanded universe of star wars that makes it one of the most unique works of science fiction ever. allowing star wars to be so much more than just the movies, and why it affects so many people, past, present, and future. the training scenes with yoda are compelling, the action is enthralling, the romance between han and leia is great, the build up of luke and vaders confrontation is full of tension, and the reveal always leaves me in awe. this movie will forever be timeless and touch everyone's heart who see's it. in the end, this movie is impressive, most impressive.";27 January 2021;9;['interested', 'old', 'final', 'spellbound', 'determined', 'special',

402;Tyson14;"when we all sat down to watch ""the empire strikes back"" for the first we figured we knew what would happen in the rest of the trilogy. at the end of the second film we assumed darth vader would beat luke in a lightsaber duel and then at the end of the final film luke would finally kill darth vader. but then in what is still one of the biggest one-two punches ever aimed at an audience darth vader cuts off luke's right hand and stuns the audience with the revelation ""i am your father."" suddenly the idea that luke was going to kill darth vader went from absolute metaphysical certainty to something very much in doubt. the thought that it would be three years before we found out how this would play out drove us absolutely crazy (remember the wonderful speculation that boba fett was a clone of obi- wan?). i have to admit that i never really believed that george lucas intended for darth vader to be luke skywalker's father from the very start. if he had then we would not have had that ""what i said was true...from a certain point of view"" from obi-wan kenobi in ""the return of the jedi"" to explain the statement that darth vader killed luke's father in the original ""star wars"" (change the name all you want, it is still ""star wars"" to me). but for a plot twist it certainly floored audiences. i went to the first showing the first day for all three ""star wars"" movies and since my brother made the mistake of flipping through the comic book version and stumbling across the film's big revelation (which he immediately shared with me) i was not surprised at what happened. but i still remember the audience gasping twice when luke lost his hand and darth vader said his big line. ""the empire strikes back"" is far and away the best of the ""star wars"" movies, whether you are talking the original three or all of the prequels as well. it is a very dark film in which things are constantly going wrong. luke is attacked and almost killed by a snow monster, the base on hoth is attacked and evacuated, the millennium falcon end up inside a giant worm, luke abandons his training with yoda too soon to help save his friends, lando betrays han who ends up a frozen statue, and then luke loses his hand and learns the truth about daddy. the only real bright spot in the movie is when leia and han fall in love (the comic relief with c-3po does not count) and even that ends on a major downer. there is nowhere to go but up at the end of this one and it is rather amazing how many people would go back repeatedly to see a movie whose idea of a happy ending is that nobody is dead yet. george lucas again wrote the story but the script by leigh brackett and lawrence kasdan brings the level of the dialogue up to a more adult level than the saturday morning serial feel of the first film (ultimately, they might be the ones who most deserve the credit for making this the best ""star wars"" film). director irvin kershner draws stronger performances out of the entire cast, which is precisely why he was picked for the second film. the result is an much more ambitious film where the characters have more depth, helped by the dramatic turns at the end that up the ante considerably on the story. luke skywalker is no longer the fresh-faced kid he was when we first met him, having to grow up really fast because of what happens in this film. but when you get audiences to take a muppet as seriously as we take yoda, then you are really accomplishing something. even after all this time this film still works. this movie also reflected a great leap forward in terms of the special effects that were the hallmark of the first film. when we saw ""star wars"" one of the things we fell in love with what how far special effects had come since ""2001: a space odyssey,"" the obvious reference point in the field of science fiction films. but that was nothing compared to what industrial light and magic came up with three years later in ""the empire strikes back."" no wonder lucas wanted to go back and fix some of the special effects shots in his first ""star wars"" film, especially with the x-wing fighters in the final attack on the death star. compare that with the chase of the millennium falcon through the asteroid field in this one, which gets outclassed three years later by the rebel attack on the new death star in the final film. when it comes to the second in a film trilogy ""the empire strikes back"" is the standard by which such things are judged. granted there are not many of them, but ""the attack of the clones,"" ""the matrix: reloaded,"" and even ""the two towers"" do not rise to the challenge. ironically, ""the empire strikes back"" was so good that it made it difficult for ""the return of the jedi"" to be better, especially since the final film was going to be more upbeat (and that was before all those cute ewoks showed up). when i think about walking out of a movie theater with the words ""to be continued"" in my mind, this is the movie that epitomizes that thought.";4 August 2014;10;['first', 'second', 'final', 'big', 'right', 'absolute', 'metaphysical', 'crazy', 'wonderful', 'very', 'true', 'certain', 'original', 'first', 'first', 'comic', 'big', 'surprised', 'big', 'good', 'original', 'dark', 'wrong', 'giant', 'frozen', 'only', 'bright', 'comic', 'major', 'amazing', 'many', 'happy', 'dead', 'leigh', 'serial', 'first', 'good', 'strong', 'entire', 'second', 'ambitious', 'more', 'dramatic', 'faced', 'great', 'special', 'first', 'far', 'special', 'obvious', 'industrial', 'special', 'first', 'x', 'wing', 'final', 'rebel', 'new', 'final', 'second', 'such', 'many', 'good', 'difficult', 'well', 'final', 'upbeat', 'cute'];0.2084873608534323
403;JTurner82;"given the enormous popularity that star wars received upon its release in 1977, it seems inevitable that a sequel would be produced. it is usually common for a follow-up to an original to be a let-down, but the empire strikes back is not one such example. directed by irvin kirschner, this new chapter in the saga doesn't just live up to its predecessor, it surpasses it--and then some. the storyline takes a darker, more heavy-handed spin as luke, han, leia, and the rebel forces find themselves under assault from darth vader and the imperial troops. as the movie progresses, we root for our heroes to prevail--only to find ourselves downcast when we come to the somewhat sad (yet hopeful) conclusion. yet the movie is all the more magnificent for it. the empire strikes back also gives a chance to expand upon the characters' relationships with each other--to entertaining and occasionally amusing results. the give-and-take banter between han and leia (which, of course, turns into a romance) is hilarious and made all the more memorable by harrison ford's swaggering portrayal of han and carrie fisher coming off as a perfect foil for his bluster. the chemistry between them is definitely a lot more lively and interesting than, say, the love sequences involving natalie portman and haydn christensen in the prequels (not to put both down, however). mark hamill is best known to us today as one of hollywood's best voice actors ever, but his acting as luke skywalker deserves special mention. in empire, he displays an incredible range of emotion and growing pains, which helps the audience to identify with his struggle. his eventual growth from a reckless, unthinking youth to a mature, confident hero is completed full-circle in the final entry of the star wars movies, return of the jedi, but tracing where it begins in this movie credits that. not only are we introduced to all-new worlds such as the freezing, snow-covered ice planet hoth to the musty swamp bog of dagobah, we are introduced to new characters. for example, on bespin, we meet lando calrissian, a charming yet shifty rogue who shares a somewhat shaky friendship with han solo. billy dee williams conveys the character to effectiveness; the transition from traitor to ally is well handled and believable. of course, the most memorable character in the movie is yoda, the crotchety yet benign jedi master who takes it under himself to lead skywalker down the straight and narrow path. in the prequels, we see him flex his facial expression chops through computer animation, but in this film (in addition to jedi) we see him as a rubber puppet operated by frank oz. his playful yet wise nature exudes through the latex and comes across as a staple character--an astonishing triumph for a non-computer generated creation. the production values are spectacular, with unforgettably visceral action sequences highlighting every minute on screen such as the snow battle against giant dinosaur-like walkers, the daredevil chase through the asteroid field, and of course, the climactic confrontation between luke skywalker and darth vader. there are lots of great moments in the empire strikes back one could go on and on about, but none so greater as--**spoiler**--the instant where darth vader reveals that he is luke's father. i can only imagine what the impact of this emotionally charged scene must have been for audiences; of course when seeing the star wars movies in chronological order, this moment may create effects different than from what audiences in 1980 (and frankly, those who have seen only the original trilogy) experienced. in short, not only is the empire strikes back one of the best entries in the star wars saga, but one of the best sequels ever. in 1997, george lucas revamped this film (along with the other two entries in the original trilogy) as a special edition. most of the enhancements aren't as noticeable as in star wars, but one of them is breathtaking--the expansion of cloud city allows us to see an entire depth of dimension to the world that we haven't seen before. by contrast, the moment where we see the ice monster approach luke (the original version has only two brief cutaway shots of this creature) doesn't amaze us as much as the former. this dvd release features a bit more tweaking, most noticeable is a new conversation between darth vader and the emperor (played, in this scene, by ian mcdiarmid). some may oppose such changes, but i liked this particular enhancement a lot. it really helps bridge the entire saga together as a whole (not to mention it makes it more consistent). combine all that with a state-of-the-art visual remastering and sound remixing, and you have a splendid edition of the empire strikes back on your hands.";2 September 2005;10;['enormous', 'inevitable', 'common', 'such', 'new', 'dark', 'heavy', 'handed', 'rebel', 'imperial', 'sad', 'hopeful', 'magnificent', 'other', 'amusing', 'hilarious', 'memorable', 'swaggering', 'perfect', 'lively', 'interesting', 'good', 'special', 'incredible', 'eventual', 'reckless', 'mature', 'confident', 'full', 'final', 'new', 'such', 'musty', 'new', 'charming', 'shifty', 'shaky', 'believable', 'memorable', 'benign', 'straight', 'narrow', 'flex', 'facial', 'playful', 'wise', 'staple', 'astonishing', 'non', 'computer', 'spectacular', 'visceral', 'such', 'giant', 'like', 'daredevil', 'climactic', 'great', 'great', 'chronological', 'different', 'original', 'experienced', 'short', 'good', 'good', 'other', 'original', 'special', 'most', 'noticeable', 'entire', 'original', 'brief', 'former', 'tweaking', 'noticeable', 'new', 'such', 'particular', 'entire', 'consistent', 'visual', 'splendid'];0.2680558512525726

405;filmfan1991;"after the huge success of the first ""star wars"" a sequel was inevitable and this time george lucas stepped down and sat mostly in the producers seat and co wrote part of the script while he handed the directors reigns to his former usc professor irvin kershner. unlike lucas who was a special effects visionary, kershner instead focuses on story and characters, most notably the human face. the story takes place most likely a few years after the first film. with the death star destroyed luke and the rebel aliance is forced to go on the run and into hiding on a remote ice planet hoth. meanwhile darth vader does everything in his power to find luke and bring him to his emperor in order to train him to become the next sith apprentice. afterwords many things happen: romance is formed in the middle of battle, shocking revelations are discovered that change everything and new things are discovered about ""the force"" that are almost zen like by a new character named yoda (performed and voiced by the great frank oz). everything about this movie is phenomenal. the story takes a darker and more personal turn leading to better character development. the action scenes are amazing, epic and well shot and the dialog is so memorable that its embedded into our pop culture. anybody who knows ""no...i am your father."" or ""i know"" should know what i'm talking about.(give some credit to george lucas,the late leigh brackett(who also co-wrote the original ""the big sleep"") and lawrence kasdan for delivering a great script.) as for acting its just excellent. james earl jones and david prowse give their most menacing combination performance that reminds us why darth vader is one the most memorable villains in cinema history. mark hamil's luke is angsty but a little more mature from the last movie. carie fisher and harison ford share great chemistry. anthony daniels and kenny baker are great comedic relief as always giving some levity to even the most darkest of times. frank oz does a wonderful job as yoda who becomes luke's new mentor in ""the force"". alec guinness returns as obi wan kenobi who guides luke to yoda in spirit form. billy dee williams stars as a new character lando calrissian. elaine baker's face and clive revill's voice give us a very chilling first time view of the emperor and lets not forget the one scene wonder bounty hunter boba fett played by jeremy bullochband voiced by jason wingreen.

406;samgiannn;improving on almost every aspect of a new hope, the empire strikes back manages to be the rare sequel to undeniably top its predecessor in both quality and entertainment value while still not feeling rehashed. this was the star wars i wanted with the original, and it was extremely satisfying. in the empire strikes back, the galactic empire is on the hunt for luke skywalker and the rest of the rebel alliance. while darth vader is chasing han solo, princess leia and others across the galaxy, luke studies the force under jedi master yoda. structurally, the film isn't as controlled as a new hope, featuring long action scenes intertwined with dialog-heavy scenes of characterization, but that's an easily forgiven issue. the intense action scenes and darker plot make this a more involving film than its predecessor, and the young actors seemed a lot more confident in their roles. the empire strikes back is an exciting film from start to finish, especially during the final thirty minutes when luke faces off with darth vader. george lucas really knows how to make a memorable climax. although it does get a little cheesy right at the end, the empire strikes back is a great improvement to its predecessor, and it set a high bar for movie sequels.;28 November 2015;10;['new', 'rare', 'original', 'satisfying', 'galactic', 'new', 'long', 'heavy', 'intense', 'dark', 'young', 'confident', 'exciting', 'final', 'memorable', 'little', 'great', 'high'];0.2011898395721925

416;ntvnyr30;"i am always amazed at the creativity of artists. when lucas first proposed ""star wars"" the board at 20th century fox probably thought he was mad, especially since special effects were primitive at best. who could have envisioned what he had in mind when he first made the original? who could have imagined what a light saber was? as many have stated, this is much better than the original, and i wholeheartedly agree. after watching a film so many times, people become immune to the amazing innovations shown. a good example is ""citizen kane"" which included memorable imagery including ""deep focus"", low angle shots that showed ceilings, overlapping dialogue, and camera trickery. many people see ""kane"" for the first time and proclaim ""big deal!"" in ""the empire strikes back,"" some of original innovations are the imperial walkers, the ice planet of hoth and the zen-like yoda who philosophizes with phrases like ""try not. do. or do not. there is no try."" i won't re-hash the plot since everyone knows it by now, so i will review the intricacies that make this film work so well. i think the humor in this film works tremendously: for one, the interplay between han solo and c3po cracks me up (""sir if i may venture an opinion--"" ""i'm not really interested in your opinions 3po.""). another thing that works is another character not listed in the credits--the millennium falcon. the lovable ""piece of junk"" that is forever under repair but always comes through in the clutch, like when han et al were trying to escape from hoth. there was a pretty tense moment when the falcon wouldn't start while the empire's stormtroopers entered the docking bay (""would it help if i got out and pushed?"" ""it might!""). and yet, the falcon came through as always when the laser machine gun appeared. further, the non-functioning light speed on the falcon is a great sub-plot of the film. darth vader is at his very best (or worst?) in the way he kills off his own men who fail him. the scene when he kills off admiral ozzle is priceless not only for vader's vengeance but for admiral piett's trying not to look at his dead former commander on the deck. another great scene is vader killing off captain needa (""apology accepted captain needa."") i will even overlook the ""borrowing"" from ""casablanca"": in that film, the nazis first won't let victor lazlow leave casablanca and then change their minds when they won't let him stay. in this film, princess leia was supposed to stay and then vader ""altered"" the plans. some of the greatest films are great in part to the score. how john williams didn't win an oscar is another infamous slight by the academy (he did win a bafta). the ""imperial march"" is such a sublime acievement, perfectly fitting for darth vader's gang. lucas ventured into dangerous territory in trying to make a film better than the original ""star wars"", but he succeeded. unfortunately, his luck ran out 22 years after the original ""star wars"" was released when he tried to recapture the glory--and money--when he made the infamous prequels. his casting choices that were so inspired in the original trilogy became so insipid 22 years later.";15 March 2009;10;['amazed', 'mad', 'special', 'primitive', 'original', 'light', 'many', 'well', 'original', 'many', 'immune', 'amazing', 'good', 'memorable', 'deep', 'low', 'many', 'first', 'big', 'original', 'imperial', 'like', 'interested', 'lovable', 'tense', 'non', 'functioning', 'light', 'great', 'good', 'bad', 'own', 'admiral', 'priceless', 'admiral', 'dead', 'former', 'great', 'great', 'great', 'infamous', 'imperial', 'sublime', 'fitting', 'dangerous', 'well', 'original', 'original', 'infamous', 'original', 'insipid'];0.276994851994852
417;charlieoso;three years after george lucas changed cinema with his 1977 mega hit star wars its first sequel came out. to me this is the best of the whole series of films so far containing both secrets and the introduction of a few great characters to be added to the list of star wars cast. to me as well this film sits only behind stanley kubrick's 2001: a space odyssey in space stories put on screen. darth vader (david prowse, voice of james earl jones) is on the hunt for the rebels. it looks like he has found them, so the rebels are on the run to escape his clutches. han solo (wonderfully played by harrison ford) and chewbacca (peter mayhew) bring along princess leia (carrie fisher) and c-3po (anthony daniels) within the millennium falcon (which gets a lot of screen time in this film). meanwhile luke (mark hamill) is of the dagobah system in search of yoda (voice of frank oz) to continue his jedi training. this film is different than the original and really is much darker as the title of the film suggests. john williams is back and with new themes like the amazing 'imperial march' he has an even richer score than the original. i do believe lucas did the right thing in bringing in two excellent screenwriters in leigh brackett and later lawrence kasdan. i have no idea who came up with what idea, but i am glad lucas got some fresh perspectives and perhaps ideas to infuse into his space epic. as well as having veteran director irvin kershner direct the sequel. this film has everything a star wars fan loves. also starring billy dee williams who is pretty cool as lando calrissian...until chewie gets ahold of him and look fast for john ratzenberger who plays major derlin.;13 February 2019;10;['first', 'good', 'whole', 'few', 'great', 'jedi', 'different', 'original', 'dark', 'new', 'amazing', 'imperial', 'rich', 'original', 'right', 'excellent', 'leigh', 'glad', 'fresh', 'cool', 'major'];0.3310876623376623
418;LBytes;"this is rated a scoutch lower than the 1st star wars flick, although it is right behind aliens and slightly ahead of t2 as the best sequel ever. it loses 0.3 because of the disjointed forced emotions of han and leia, who have great repartee but romance is just not there. i didn't buy it anyway. other than that the movie is great. it still has some of the best action sequences around and numerous video games have lifted elements of it for combat and light saber duels. the cgi enhancements added in the 90's are less obvious and less intrusive than those in star wars, and really add or subtract little if anything. the epic scope of the power of the empire and the considerable abilities of the resistance are shown to great effect in ultra large scale space panoramas, and are breathtaking if you allow yourself to be taken in by it all. the large scale gets a big help with a large screen. i think a lot would be lost watching this on a 27"" tv. the dvd is part of the the star wars trilogy pack. the audio is even better than star wars, with even more lfe and surround action. this has to be the best remastering of film audio i've ever heard. the video is no less impressive, with nary a blotch or smear to be seen anywhere. darth vader looks like he's been cleaned and pressed just for this dvd release! this is as good as it gets 10/10.";12 October 2004;10;['good', 'disjointed', 'great', 'other', 'great', 'good', 'numerous', 'light', 'obvious', 'intrusive', 'little', 'epic', 'considerable', 'great', 'ultra', 'large', 'large', 'big', 'large', 'well', 'more', 'good', 'impressive', 'good'];0.3815178571428572

421;Theflyace;"after star wars was a smash hit in 1977, a sequel was put into the works. the empire strikes back is one of those sequels that is equal to the original, while still being its own film. while i can't personally say it's the best film of the saga, it comes pretty darn close. as with any second film in a trilogy, we begin after an unspecified amount of time following the battle of yavin. the rebels are discovered on the ice planet hoth, and are promptly defeated by the imperial walkers. our main group is split up into separate teams. luke, following advice from the force ghost of obi wan, seeks out the wise teacher yoda (a puppet played in a stunningly real performance by puppeteer frank oz) who teaches him the true power and meaning of the force. leia and han, along with chewie, threepio and r2, are pursued by the empire for use as bait in a trap by darth vader. for a film that has no real beginning or end story-wise, this film has more emotion and character study, exactly what george lucas and director irvin kershner wanted. during his experiences with yoda, luke develops an inner conflict about darth vader and the dark side, and that he must confront this evil in a duel. we as an audience also learn the power of the force, which is further strengthened as a religious idea, such as yoda's line, ""you must feel the force around you."" such material is what makes empire great, is that we move deeper and deeper into darker and more thoughtful thematic material. the real interesting part of this film is the big reveal in the third act, where vader reveals luke's true parentage. it is simply one of the greatest scenes to ever grace the movie screens, and such an emotional pull that we still get lost in the moment even though we all know who he is now. on the opposite side, the stuff on leia and han's side of the film is good, but not great. let me explain. the love story is actually very well done. there's not a lot of smooching and sappy sentiment, but it happens very naturally, along with some banter. harrison ford also delivers one of the best improvised lines when leia says ""i love you."" he simply says, ""i know."" those are actors who really know their characters. but the rest it seems just to be ""funny"" or unnecessary annoyance. chewie and threepio fit into this category, though threepio is far more interesting than chewie so... i guess i give him a pass. the rest of the movie is pretty good. the effects are unbelievable, the music is perfect, with john williams giving us the universally loved ""imperial march,"" and the terrifying lightsaber duel between vader and luke being the highlight of the entire film. its one of the best of the saga. i say ""one of the best"" because, for me, this ties with two of the other films, episodes vi and iii. all three of these films are on the top of the game and great films to watch. onto the first in the sort of ""lackluster films the fans love to rip to shreds...";14 January 2014;9;['equal', 'original', 'own', 'good', 'second', 'unspecified', 'imperial', 'main', 'separate', 'wise', 'real', 'true', 'real', 'more', 'inner', 'dark', 'religious', 'such', 'such', 'great', 'dark', 'thoughtful', 'thematic', 'interesting', 'big', 'third', 'true', 'great', 'emotional', 'opposite', 'good', 'great', 'sappy', 'good', 'funny', 'unnecessary', 'fit', 'interesting', 'good', 'unbelievable', 'perfect', 'imperial', 'terrifying', 'entire', 'good', 'good', 'other', 'vi', 'great', 'first', 'lackluster'];0.2878968253968254
422;andrewnmiller;following the massive success for the first star wars film, george lucas had hoped to become independent from the hollywood system in choosing to finance the budget from the other two sequels himself. to develop the story for empire strikes back, lucas brought on sci-fi writer leah brackett to write the screenplay. in the first draft, brackett would have luke's father appear as a spirit to luke thus tying into the backstory provided in a new hope. upon reading leah's screenplay, george was less than pleased but before he could meet with her and fix the script, brackett passed away thus leaving lucas to write the next draft himself but he brought on lawrence kasden to reanalyze the screenplay. unlike a new hope, lucas chose not to direct empire strikes back because he was focused on running lucasfilm as a business, overseeing the vfx company industrial light and magic, and financing other lucasfilm projects. george then offered the director's chair to his old film mentor, irvin kirschner. known for more character-driven films like the eyes of laura mars, kirschner had never directed a blockbuster before and he originally rejected the offer, fearing the sequel wouldn't match the standard of the original film. when he called his agent, though, he later accepted the job at his agent's behest. shooting for empire strikes back began in norway in early 1979 where they encountered the worst storm in 50 years with temperatures of -20 degrees and 18 feet of snow. on one occasion, the crew were unable to leave their hotel to shoot a scene of luke escaping the wampa cave so irvin was able to achieve a shot involving luke's exit of the wampa cave by opening the hotel's doors and filming mark hamill running out into the snow while the crew remained warm inside. when the film opened in june of 1980, it did incredibly well at the box office and with moviegoers, but critics were mixed on the film, but over time, the film has been received far more positively and is now considered by many to be the best out of the entire star wars saga. in the annals of moviemaking, no film series has had as much of an impact on me and my love of film as george lucas' epic sci-fi saga, star wars. much like many other kids of my generation, i grew up thinking, dreaming, watching, and playing star wars. i watched the original trilogy on repeat and owned so much star wars merchandise at one point in my life that it became an obsession. when i was growing up, the second film in the original star wars trilogy, the empire strikes back was never my favorite as i always preferred return of the jedi over it but in more recent years after watching the film more times when i even care to count, i began to see the film more for what it was and still is as over 40 years later, empire strikes back is still a fantastic film and one of the few sequels that manage to be even better than their predecessors in terms of story, themes, and characters. the film opens with the empire searching for the rebels using probe droids. the rebel aillicene has fled to the ice planet hoth as a result of the empire's pursuit. while out on petrol, jedi in training luke skywalker is ambushed by a wampa. back at echo base, han solo is worried that luke hasn't returned so sets out to find him. meanwhile, luke is able to escape the wampa's cave with the use of his lightsaber but soon succumbs to the frigid temperatures. han eventually recuses luke and takes him back to the base to recover. the rebels are soon discovered by an imperial probe droid and prepare to evacuate the base. the empire launches an attack against the rebel base using at-at walkers. han, leia, c-3po, and chewbacca manage to escape the base just in time onboard the millenium falcon but their hyperspace is malfunctioning as they are pursued by the empire and flee into an asteroid field. meanwhile, luke and r2-d2 travel to the swamp planet dagobah and encounters a small green creature who reveals himself to be the jedi master yoda. at first, yoda feels luke is too old to be trained as a jedi but finally agrees to train him in the ways of the force. now, luke must learn to master the force while leia and han find themselves in love with one another as the empire closes in around them. star wars: a new hope has often been discussed to death in terms of the context of the late 70s, either as a political subtext of the vietnam war, george lucas' rank as an up-and-coming director alongside the likes of coppola and speilberg or even the way how the film shifted hollywood's focus away from more low-key dramas to massive blockbuster films. despite all that, it's often overlooked how dynamically the empire strikes back is rooted in the conditions of the early 1980s. there're a lot of reasons for this but the most obvious one is that return of the jedi deliberately fled back to the trappings of a new hope, right down to the choice to restage the vietnam war with the ewoks standing in for the veit cong. there's also a sense of in which the artistic markers of the empire strikes back is far more subdued than those of a new hope or even the last jedi. when viewed with a modern look, empire strikes back seems to signal the arrival of the 1980s. much like terminator 2: judgment day or spider-man 2, it expands both the scoop and scale of the star wars universe but also pushes the saga forward in terms of story and characters. even looking past the now quintessential unveilings of family ancestry and changing power aspects, the empire strikes back redefined what a star wars film could be. it's no longer about steering though the just vagueness of an uncertain future or battling with the spirit of american might. it's instead about trekking through social power resources or finding your place in a vast universe. much like aliens, predator or die hard, empire strikes back feels like not only a classic 80s film but also, the first truly great 80s blockbuster. admittedly, the empire strikes back came out in may of 1980, a time of transition for america. jimmy carter was still the president but his grip was failing and in the spring of 1980, a new dawn was coming. the 70s had been a rough time for america as it dealt with the consequences of the vietnam war and watergate. it had dealt with an oil panic as well as an economic slowdown. the standard family unit was turned upside down as the rise of the two-income family left many kids somewhat unguarded and the increased devoice rate made it easier to dissolve the traditional nuclear family. it's not surprising that the 1970s saw a boom in the horror film genre that tapped into those fears. star wars: a new hope want against that background with its idea of a used future where things were dirty, grimy, and beat-up and where there is no explanation on how technology works in this galaxy as things just happen with the flick of a switch. this idea, as opposed to a slick-looking future, seemed to connect with audiences in a country that was dealing with the injuring of their own idea of what dreams could be. even the darth star seemed like an apocalyptic level threat, with the capacity to destroy an entire planet. the world for a new hope appeared to be on the verge of falling apart with industrialized prisons on wheels, trash disposals crushing scrap iron in the depths of an intergalactic weapon of mass destruction as well as a washed-up smuggler and his beat-up ship. in contrast, the world of the empire strikes back looks far more polished and shiny. the opening scene replaces the hot sands of tatooine with the ice wastelands of hoth. the industrialized surrounding of the darth star has been replaced by the regularly glossier and clearer interiors of imperial star destroyers. there's no sign of an apocalyptic weapon of mass destruction, just the imperial fleet doing their business as they always do. indeed, the opening crawl of the empire strikes back proclaims that the empire has already welcomed automation, leaving a lot of the rebel hunting to probe droids. even darth vader went though a redesign between a new hope and empire to make his costume look more smooth and polished. the shoulder pads are more noticeable, vader's center respirator is more complicated, his eyes are black and glossy thus removing the red hue from a new hope. at one point in the film, the viewer does get to see vader without his helmet, thus showing he isn't a robot but an actual flesh-and-blood human. this fits perfectly with the massive artistic shift of the empire within the film as a whole. in a new hope, the character of grand moff tarkin was portrayed as a commanding persona, having a characteristic figure and speaking with an ice-cold command whereas the empire strikes back introduces us to several imperial officers who feel like pencil-pushing minsters rather than men who evoke fear into their subordinates. outside of vader, imperial officers seem exchangeable and ubiquitous. admiral piett somehow survives until return of the jedi mostly by keeping his head low to the ground but few viewers of the films would be able to pick him out of an imperial line-up. in the empire strikes back, the empire seems to have become an organization specified by its middle-management. it's a massive and ungainly organization that exists to squeeze the galaxy into submission through the use of force and terror. in a new hope, the empire was portrayed as a planet-killing monster whereas empire strikes back depicts them as a more controlled operation as vader never issues orders to destroy hoth or bespin even though he does have the power to do so but rather threatens to bring them both to heel through sheer force. this shift in the characterization of the empire in the empire strikes back feels very much in tune with what was happening in the 80s as america progressed into the reaga era. much like the 70s, the 80s would be seen as a decade of excess and consumerism. this kind of fear was also perfectly captured;28 August 2020;10;['massive', 'first', 'independent', 'other', 'first', 'new', 'less', 'pleased',

426;MinorityReporter;the second instalment of the original trilogy is in my opinion far better than the original film. the original film introduced something brand new to the movie scene back in the 70's but aside from being an instant classic and being very original it had some problems. the characters were very badly drawn up making them nothing more than card board cutt-outs and in the end that felt very unfulfilled. this problem is rectified in empire strikes back. its very obvious that george lucas has had more fun writing the characters in the second movie. he begins to give them edge and more depth. the story in the second film is also far more fulfilling than that in the original and the twitch at the end is still one of the most interesting and well-thought-out twitches in movie history. the acting has also improved loads since the first film mostly due to the fact that the characters are better defined. especially mark hamill shines in this film and if you compare him to the character of anakin, played by hayden christensen, in episode ii you begin to see some similarities. they are both quite hot tempered and impatient and you actually see where george lucas was going. also harrison ford begins to show his real talents in this film. there are a few new characters in the film like lando calrissian, played by billy dee williams, and yoda, voice acted by frank oz, and they are both good adds to the cast list. the effects have of course improved and they serve to make the film even more visually interesting than the first film. furthermore the second film is darker than the original film and this darkness works very well within the star wars universe and i wish they had use this darkness more in the third and final film of the series. all in all empire strikes back is the best star wars film out of all the series. 9/10;19 April 2005;9;['second', 'original', 'original', 'original', 'new', 'instant', 'original', 'more', 'unfulfilled', 'obvious', 'more', 'second', 'more', 'second', 'more', 'original', 'interesting', 'first', 'hayden', 'hot', 'impatient', 'real', 'few', 'new', 'good', 'interesting', 'first', 'second', 'dark', 'original', 'third', 'final', 'good'];0.2340909090909091
427;k_g_barreto;the empire strikes back, sequel to a new hope, is fairly considered by many as the best movie of the star wars saga, because the film presents exciting fresh ideas, a more mature tone, it's mindblowing, fun as hell and is presents everything what makes people love star wars. the characters are better here than before, in a new hope. darth vader is more intimidating, looks cooler and in every scene where he is, he's being badass and that's makes everything better. the relantioship of leia and han is just perfect, every scene of them interacting is really fun to watching and the time passes just too fast. the training of luke in dagoba, with yoda, shows why star wars is the phenomenon it is, because embraces the weird stuff with pride, fantasy and sci-fi at their best. lando is a charismatic character, and even by what he's done, you can't feel angry about him. it's great to see luke's journey evolving, and reaching the apex in return of the jedi. the visual effects here are better than in a new hope. the battle of hoth is amazing, the at-at walkers were so damn perfect, makes it everything better, and the photography of the whole sequence is great, as in the whole movie itself, the sountrack, again, as in the movie itself. every aspect of the movie deserves compliments. the most remembered scene of the movie, the revelation that darth vader is luke's father, is revolutionary, mainly because of the date when the movie was released, is that what i mean when i said exciting fresh ideas. the movie is worthy of a second watching, and even more. it's impossible to get sick of it. it's not the greatest film ever made, and it doesn't need to be, the empire strikes back has everything that is needed and more. it's a classic film and deserves all the love that receives.;29 August 2019;10;['new', 'many', 'good', 'exciting', 'fresh', 'mature', 'well', 'new', 'intimidating', 'cool', 'badass', 'well', 'perfect', 'fun', 'weird', 'good', 'charismatic', 'angry', 'great', 'visual', 'well', 'new', 'amazing', 'perfect', 'whole', 'great', 'whole', 'remembered', 'revolutionary', 'exciting', 'fresh', 'worthy', 'second', 'impossible', 'sick', 'great', 'more', 'classic'];0.2831657589722106

445;bhicks56;star wars, obviously the most inspired, barrier-breaking science fiction/adventure movie ever made (thus far), showed us that you could fit your three acts in three separate movies. i think the first one was spectacular, an invitation to a fantasy world unlike any you have witnessed before or since. a very good first act, a very good introduction. but empire strikes back, in my opinion, is the best in the trilogy. why? let me break it down: 1) yoda. what more can i say? an ancient alien midget. a wisecracking jedi master. where han solo gives us the irony of the series, yoda gives us the muppet-ized hilarity of it. 2) billy dee williams as lando calrissian. the only brotha in the future it looks like, but the dude is bad. he also gets more acting skills and character conflict here than he does in return of the jedi. 3) han solo and princess leia. it's so funny when you look at star wars: a new hope, and you think that she loves luke. han and leia are so cute here. bickering, fighting, kissing, and in the end, admitting of their true feelings. and han always knew. what a lovely intergalactic romance. 4) we first learn of darth vader's true identity and his relation to skywalker. 5) awesome light sabre showdown between vader and luke that served up what we couldn't get from vader and obi-wan's confrontation in hope. unfortunately, it was rehashed into an overlong, boring one in jedi, inserted between an even more boring starship battle. 6) oh, and speaking of starship battles. there are none! i think these are the main flaw of all the film containing them. they are cool to witness for the first few minutes, but they go on and on without doing anything different or interesting within the long time. 7) luke loses his hand. throughout empire, you feel this dark dread, but this is the icing on the cake. a lost battle of luke's. but the war is not over. 8) the set pieces are out of this world. the icy snow in the beginning. the misty, marshy swamp of yoda's home. the heavenly blissful city in the clouds. even the death star looks better than the last one! not to mention darth's suit looks much better, as do r2d2 and c3p0, most likely to do with the gross earned from the first one. 9) there are so many cool creatures and machines here. like the elephant-like tanks in the beginning or the llama-like creatures used for horses around the snowy desert. there is a flaw however. a very annoying one, in fact. chewbacca moans too much! you get so tired as he goes on and on about the desperate situation. i guess it was meant to go with the ongoing dread and unease you feel throughout the film. after all, this is the act ii, the conflict of the trilogy. still, i believe episode v to be the best of this trilogy. now to see which will be the best of the first three episodes....;3 December 1999;10;['inspired', 'separate', 'first', 'spectacular', 'good', 'first', 'good', 'good', 'more', 'ancient', 'alien', 'only', 'bad', 'more', 'acting', 'funny', 'new', 'cute', 'true', 'lovely', 'intergalactic', 'true', 'awesome', 'light', 'boring', 'main', 'cool', 'first', 'few', 'different', 'interesting', 'long', 'dark', 'lost', 'set', 'icy', 'marshy', 'blissful', 'well', 'last', 'well', 'likely', 'gross', 'first', 'many', 'cool', 'like', 'llama', 'like', 'snowy', 'annoying', 'tired', 'desperate', 'ongoing', 'good', 'good', 'first'];0.1774531024531024

451;pulikd;"visually, this is easily the best of the original ""star wars"" trilogy. there are reasons for that. for instance, the ridiculous little puppets meant to act as alien creatures. ""the empire strikes back"" uses them the least. and one of them is so surprisingly good in both how it looks and how the plot handles it this creature with big ears feels real and is a great addition to the big picture. then there are the special effects and the sets that, obviously, were made in a time when making them was a much harder process than in the twenty-first century, but they look real. all this physical material ages well. even the ""special editions"" are not an obstacle. the plot is structured in a different way than the one from three years earlier. it does not have that clear line between the loud and the quiet parts of the story. different things are not placed far from one another. they are numerous and aren't given as much room to breathe as the last time. the overall tone of the picture is, apparently, the reason for many to regard ""episode v"" as the best in the whole franchise. it is dark and bold for a mainstream movie, which isn't something you often find. still, there are things to criticize, like the battle on the ice planet. of course, it is beautiful, but the design of the imperial walking machines, as menacing as it may look, makes no sense. they are big, clumsy and slow. then there is the plot itself. we have this huge imperial fleet of colossal starships with great firepower chasing one little rebel ship because the person in charge of that fleet wants to get their hands on one particular rebel person. of course, the prior movie is proof enough of how important that one young rebel fighter is, but still, how about the rest of the rebel fleet? the movie has it in the beginning and at the very end. for the most part it is ignored. of course, one can say that this isn't exactly science fiction, which is correct. but the dark and seemingly serious tone of the picture and some of the stupidity in the plot are not good friends.";9 August 2021;7;['good', 'original', 'ridiculous', 'little', 'alien', 'least', 'good', 'big', 'real', 'great', 'big', 'special', 'hard', 'first', 'real', 'physical', 'special', 'different', 'clear', 'loud', 'quiet', 'different', 'numerous', 'much', 'last', 'overall', 'many', 'good', 'whole', 'dark', 'bold', 'beautiful', 'imperial', 'menacing', 'big', 'clumsy', 'slow', 'huge', 'imperial', 'colossal', 'great', 'little', 'particular', 'rebel', 'prior', 'important', 'young', 'rebel', 'very', 'most', 'correct', 'dark', 'serious', 'good'];0.139021164021164

453;Nominahorn;"i just finished re-watching all six lucas-era star wars films in episode order (i-vi) with the commentary and want to give my reviews of each film. let me preface by saying that i am a lifelong star wars fan who grew up with the original trilogy and literally have no memory of a time in my life before sw. as such, i am not going to be totally unbiased in my reviews, but i will try to be somewhat objective. three years after the destruction of the death star, han, luke, and leia are now all important leaders and heroes in the rebel alliance, which is hiding on the barely-habitable ice planet of hoth. the empire eventually finds their base and attacks it, scattering the rebels around the galaxy, with luke going to dagobah to be trained by yoda, and han, leia, chewie, and the droids playing cat-and-mouse across the sector with vader and the imperial fleet before finally being captured at cloud city on bespin. there, han is frozen in carbonite to be sent to jabba the hutt, and luke, attempting to rescue his friends, is forced into a confrontation with vader for which he is not ready and which will forever change his life. this is the most critically-praised of the sw movies, for reasons i only partially understand. as a kid this was always my least favorite of the movies, probably because it's very talk-y and there are no big space battles. as an adult, i've come to appreciate it a lot more due to the character development and its slightly more mature take on sw, but it's still definitely not my favorite of the saga. the good -this is the first movie (both in my viewing order and in the order made) not directed by george lucas, and because of that, this is also the best movie by far for dialogue. irving kershner and the actors rewrote a lot of the lines on the set, and as a result the banter between han and leia and lando is generally good and for once the characters talking is a highlight rather than a lowlight. -assisted by the above point, this movie is great in the character development realm. not only in terms of han, leia, and luke, but also the supporting characters like chewie and the droids. -boba fett and the slave i -""apology accepted, captain needa."" you can almost see hayden christensen's malicious sneer as vader says that line. -i gained a lot of respect for kershner while listening to the commentary. he had his own spin that he wanted to do on sw, but he also had great reverence for what lucas had done in anh and he made sure to be faithful to the spirit of that movie in every way possible. the bad -hate, hate, hate that they replaced boba fett's voice with the actor who plays jango in aotc. the original fett voice actor had an awesome menacing, gravelly voice and the new voice sounds pathetic by comparison. -i'm not a big fan of stop motion animation and there is a lot of it in this film. the at-ats look fine, but the tauntauns do not. however, the closeups of the animatronic tauntauns look incredible, so it evens out a bit. the ugly -apparently the falcon is able to reach a different planetary system without hyperdrive. no indication is given of distance or how long that took, but we know that that hoth is on the outer rim where stars are far apart, so most likely any trip that took less than decades would require near-lightspeed velocity that would have some severe relativistic repercussions. considering luke seemed to do quite a lot of training during that time, it's possible there is an unacknowledged time lapse of several months, but certainly not years. -i am forced to wonder what vader's real plan was. we know he wants to overthrow palpatine and that he wants to use luke to do so, but he repeatedly says that he is planning on bringing luke to the emperor. was he just saying that for show, all the while planning on smuggling luke away somewhere secret until he could convince him to join hist plot against palpatine? anakin already saw how palpatine would gladly cast aside an old, less powerful apprentice (dooku) for a younger and more powerful one (himself), so there's no way he would be stupid enough to actually deliver luke to him. doing so would be signing his own death sentence. yet he inexplicably does that exact thing in the next movie and then looks shocked when palpatine does to him exactly what he did to dooku. so maybe anakin is really just that stupid?

458;JamesMovieGuy_117;the empire strikes back is a movie that respects the original film while going in a deeper and darker direction. it isn't something that's easy to achieve but irvin kershner was able to do exactly that with this memorable and powerful sequel. after the empire attacks the rebel base on hoth, our set of heroes go seperate ways. luke goes to the dagobah system to learn from the wise master yoda. the rest of the heroes are attempting to flee from the empire until han finds an old friend in cloud city. however, something sinister is happening in cloud city and luke senses this through the force. what is so great about this sequel is its masterful blend of action, humour and deep philosophy. the battle of hoth draws you into the movie with its spectacular special effects. then the movie spends time dealing with the philosophy of the force with master yoda, one of the greatest characters in the series. we also have more humorous adventures with han, leia, chewie and c3po. the climax is what separates this movie from the rest of the series. essentially the heroes lose and the empire gains the upper hand. we also discover a dark secret which wowed people at the time. people didn't know what to think at the time of release but now it's cemented as the series high point. essentially this movie managed to expand upon what was already a perfect roller coaster ride of a movie. this is what a sequel should be and along with aliens and terminator 2, this is the best sequel ever made!;8 January 2018;10;['original', 'deep', 'dark', 'easy', 'able', 'memorable', 'powerful', 'rebel', 'seperate', 'wise', 'old', 'great', 'masterful', 'deep', 'spectacular', 'special', 'great', 'more', 'humorous', 'upper', 'dark', 'high', 'perfect', 'good'];0.4102489177489177
459;nealklein;"in 2002, science fiction can only be described as laden with special effects. quality stories are few and far between, with a return to the fantasy genre as a last refuge for the scoundrel. the two star wars prequels further illustrate this weakness in science fiction. in other words, we are always making comparisons to this film, the grandmaster of all modern science fiction films, ""the empire strikes back"". esb stands on its own merits for so many reasons that i can only hope to give a partial list. having gotten out of the way the troublesome task of introducing us to the star wars universe in the 1977 adventure, we can now jump into the frantic struggle of the rebellion. anything introduced in ""star wars"" is simply improved upon in esb, not overproduced and overrefined. the look of esb is real, gritty, elegant, and sometimes even glowing (as in the cloud city). the elements of creating mood and atmosphere are so perfect that it is no wonder they are copied in so many other films, often to poor effect. the music alone goes from brooding to anxious to frantic to mysterious to exotic with such balance that it defines perfection for future sw film scores. the acting is real and hard and makes no apologies. it is neither over-the-top nor sleepwalked through, and each character is at his/her highest note. yes, the technobabble in some points sounds stupid at times, but it's overpowered by the myriad other positive elements in the storytelling. esb is the last movie made before the indiana jones films forever influenced adventure movies with the relentlessly overlapping and often ridiculous action that hurt ""return of the jedi"" in 1983. (""raiders of the lost ark"" would hammer home the formula of serials to the extent that rotj would be fraught with juvenile moments and caricaturizations of beloved characters, but that's another story.) yoda was, at the time of esb's release, a technological miracle of storytelling. here was a muppet that audiences just *knew* was real, somewhere in the universe. his wisdom reached deep into the human soul, sounding ominous, real, and masterful. the power of the character of yoda is seen in how many adults as well as teenagers and kids in 1980 accepted him as real and respectable. what more could be said about ""the empire strikes back""? it's the masterpiece all others strive to become similar to and never achieve. it ends on a cliffhanger and yet is a self-contained story. it's a classic even if it is seen before it has had the benefit of ilm's special edition rework. it is, in short, perfect storytelling.";5 December 2002;10;['laden', 'special', 'few', 'last', 'other', 'modern', 'own', 'many', 'partial', 'troublesome', 'frantic', 'real', 'gritty', 'elegant', 'perfect', 'many', 'other', 'poor', 'anxious', 'frantic', 'mysterious', 'exotic', 'such', 'future', 'real', 'hard', 'high', 'stupid', 'myriad', 'other', 'positive', 'last', 'overlapping', 'ridiculous', 'fraught', 'juvenile', 'beloved', 'technological', 'real', 'human', 'ominous', 'real', 'masterful', 'many', 'real', 'respectable', 'more', 'similar', 'short', 'perfect'];0.1624606180856181

463;eti55;"i'll admit to not being one of the ""cool"" people (as in cool nerds) who like this installment of star wars better than the first because it's darker and takes itself more seriously. escapist movies such as star wars and raiders shouldn't take themselves too seriously, and it hurts empire a bit..but just a bit. this is still a fun ride. that said, it does take empire a lot longer to get out of the gate than the the first one did. after a long slow buildup, there's that great battle scene on the ice planet hoth (where we first see the imperial walkers). after getting driven from hoth, two stories emerge: while han solo, princess leia, c3po and chewbacca are hiding from darth vader in an asteroid field, luke skywalker(with r2d2) is off on this rat hole of a planet in the degaba system to learn about the force (he gets a vision from obi wan early in the movie telling him to go there). this brings us to a character beloved by a majority of star wars fans yet reviled by me. i'm of course talking about the sanctimonious muppet (later cgi image) yoda. despite the fact that i found his character so annoying, the detail with regard to yoda's facial expressions (his eyes in particular) was amazing back in a time long before cgi. luke starts to learn about the force (in what must be a crash course when you compare it to the ""prequels""), but leaves when he sees visions of his friends in trouble, and despite yoda's admonishments, goes to help them. this is where luke starts getting irritating. he knows vader is setting a trap for him, yet lets his emotions totally get the best of him and goes anyway. makes you wonder if you want to leave the future of the galaxy in the hands of someone this flaky. luke isn't quite as much fun as he was in the first one, but the other characters make up for it. the back and forth between han and leia is even funnier than in the previous movie. in fact, this movie is solo's finest hour (good thing, because the subsequent carbon freeze he went through apparently softened his brain). if you wanted to take the essence of everything i love about solo and bottle it, it would come down to two words: i know. speaking of which, the love story between han and leia (which culminated in those two words) was handled just right..the movie didn't dwell on it, though the sexual tension was evident in the way the two of them sniped at each other early on. darth vader was his bad self..even more in this movie than the first one (and even less patient with fools, as a couple of imperial officers found out the hard way). the fight between luke and vader in the 2nd half was where the movie started to degenerate into taking itself too seriously. star wars doesn't do as well when it gets too dramatic. the visuals are great though. rounding out rest of the characters, billy dee williams is fine as han's old pirate buddy lando, though his character and solo's were pretty similar. then there was the single most over-hyped character in star wars, boba fett (i think he had all of two lines). c3po and r2d2 were great, but they were separated for much of this movie..they work better together. chewbacca's best moment was early in the movie when he was laughing at solo after leia insulted him.. it bugged me for a long time that this movie didn't really end..that it left you hanging for three years until the next one came out (as in leaving han solo in carbon freeze). i finally got past that, realizing that in a sense it does ""end""..our heroes live to fight another day, but only after taking a serious beating for most of the movie. though i didn't like it as much as the first, empire was still a worthy effort. 8.5";5 February 2013;8;['cool', 'cool', 'first', 'dark', 'escapist', 'such', 'first', 'long', 'slow', 'great', 'imperial', 'sanctimonious', 'annoying', 'facial', 'particular', 'amazing', 'good', 'much', 'first', 'other', 'funny', 'previous', 'fine', 'good', 'subsequent', 'sexual', 'evident', 'other', 'bad', 'first', 'patient', 'imperial', 'hard', 'dramatic', 'great', 'fine', 'old', 'similar', 'single', 'great', 'much', 'good', 'early', 'long', 'next', 'serious', 'most', 'first', 'worthy'];0.1544501133786848

470;Sharkey360;i liked this film a lot over other movie sequels, and among the star wars films this one is the second best to the phantom menace. with a huge success like a new hope, making a sequel worthy to it was very tough...unless the makers put their mind to it...and they did. george lucas did not direct this and he found a great direct with irvin k. who made this film more human in nature than the first film. in fact, character expression here is the best and so is the character development...both the best in the series. you get to see just how natural the relationship of leia and han develop, you get to see more emotion, feel pain (like when han got tortured or when luke learned who darth vader is), and so much more. this film is definitely worth striking back for! go for it!;27 December 1999;10;['other', 'second', 'good', 'phantom', 'huge', 'new', 'worthy', 'tough', 'great', 'direct', 'human', 'first', 'good', 'good', 'natural', 'more', 'more', 'worth'];0.2944592988710636
471;chrisrs123;empire strikes back delivers a larger scale, more mature sequel that ticks every box. it's darker but still a lot of fun, it's upped the scale and quality of everything it delivers. planets like hoth, dagobah and bespin have stuck in fans' memories ever since. the main cast all return, just as good as the first time we met them, this time joined by lando calrissian, the smoothest man alive, and jedi master yoda who i'm sure needs no introduction. on the villains front, darth vader is joined by boba fett - a brutally effective bounty hunter of few words. it's a cool cast, spread out across a large galaxy that really feels like the perfect setting for the epic space opera. the twists keep coming, now well known by pretty much everyone but for a new viewer entirely unfamiliar with them they were absolutely groundbreaking. the action's stepped up since the original - skywalker vs vader putting the last film's lacklustre lightsabre duel to shame. the music's as beautiful as ever. the original trilogy are all highly enjoyable films but episode v has the reputation as the best of them and it's entirely possible that might well be the truth.;27 February 2020;9;['large', 'mature', 'dark', 'main', 'good', 'first', 'smooth', 'alive', 'sure', 'effective', 'few', 'cool', 'large', 'perfect', 'epic', 'new', 'unfamiliar', 'groundbreaking', 'original', 'last', 'lacklustre', 'beautiful', 'original', 'enjoyable', 'good', 'possible'];0.3165913796348579
472;VictorianCushionCat;declaring the empire strikes back to be the best of the star wars trilogy is not a unique opinion. but then it clearly is the best, even allowing for the fact that without episodes 4 and 6 the whole thing would make little sense. ultimately it is the deepest and darkest of the three films, with impressive character development, especially luke on his jedi training and the gradual blossoming of the relationship between leia and han. comic relief comes in the golden form of c3p0 always ready to regale his human superiors with some paranoid babbling about the perils of evading the empire. some may think that there is more talking than the other films but then that's the price you pay for plot development, more of this would have been nice in phantom menace. the big revelation that vader is luke's father turns the triology on it's head. yet with the snow battle, the asteroid chase, the manic storming of the bridge of a star destroyer and the light sabre conflict between luke and vader in the dark recesses of cloud city we are hardly being short changed of high budget hollywood action. the inconclusive finale may have been somewhat may have caused a little frustration back in 1980 but that is part of the films strength, meaning it can play out it's plot and character development without having to hurry the story to fit in with the confines of one movie. the empire strikes back is by no means brain surgery, though for elegant science fiction thrills and visionary fantasy with just enough humour you can't go wrong.;3 November 2001;10;['good', 'unique', 'good', 'whole', 'little', 'deep', 'dark', 'impressive', 'luke', 'jedi', 'gradual', 'comic', 'golden', 'ready', 'human', 'paranoid', 'other', 'more', 'nice', 'phantom', 'big', 'manic', 'light', 'dark', 'short', 'high', 'inconclusive', 'little', 'elegant', 'visionary', 'enough', 'wrong'];0.1910416666666666

474;charbelelaro;star wars episode v: the empire strikes back, directed by irvin kershner follows the incredibly successful star wars: a new hope. this movie is directed perfectly, and is accompanied by such an excellent screenplay. the film starts on a high and progressively builds with even more excitement in every scene. the fact that the characters and storyline had already been established in the first film, it allowed for much more entertaining character relationships and action sequences. the visuals in the empire strikes back are even more impressive, and till this day certain sets are jaw dropping. also the music by john williams is outstanding, introducing the iconic imperial march added a new level of darkness to darth vader and the empire. this film fleshes out its main characters, giving them so much more depth. luke's training with the incredible yoda, allowed him to learn important lessons and wisdom. also learning more about darth vader and who he is controlled by makes him so much more complex and compelling. the empire strikes back is my favourite star wars film. every person working on this movie was at their creative peak, so therefore i must give it a 10.;2 April 2019;10;['successful', 'new', 'excellent', 'high', 'more', 'first', 'entertaining', 'impressive', 'certain', 'outstanding', 'iconic', 'imperial', 'new', 'main', 'more', 'incredible', 'important', 'more', 'complex', 'compelling', 'favourite', 'creative'];0.4306839826839828
475;stiv-7;"this one will always be my personal favourite of the original star wars trilogy, mostly because it is the best. everything really came together here; so much so, that even george lucas didn't change that much for the special edition, and what he did change only served to enhance the greatness that was already there. probably the most notable difference between this one and the original star wars was in the writing, by the late leigh brackett and the then-neophyte lawrence kasdan. brackett had a great way with a putdown, but not to the point of simply being snarky. lines like ""i'd just as soon kiss a wookie!"""" i can easily arrange that; you could use a good kiss!"" serve as punctuation, and not the entire point of the film. this is why irony is dying its currently slow and painful death: a lack of skill and judgement in the use of insults, sarcasm, and other putdowns. this film has the great banter of an old bogart-bacall film, which also gave it an edge back in 1980, when so few intelligent films were being released. when the best banter of the year is coming from a space opera, that's pretty dire, but i digress. to critics of my point of view, yes this film is a downer, but that's what makes it so great. as the middle act, it shouldn't have a happy ending, and that's what will be so cool about episodes ii and iii. we know the new trilogy is going to end on a down note, but like titanic, we can't help but watch. if the plot mechanics operate in any way like they did in empire, it's going to be a good time at the movies.";29 November 2000;10;['personal', 'original', 'good', 'much', 'special', 'notable', 'original', 'late', 'leigh', 'neophyte', 'great', 'putdown', 'good', 'entire', 'slow', 'painful', 'other', 'great', 'old', 'few', 'intelligent', 'good', 'dire', 'great', 'happy', 'cool', 'new', 'down', 'good'];0.3005396224146224

477;tom-darwin;"although ""star wars"" set a new, spectacularly high standard for movie effects & action, it was also a remake that featured a cast of unknowns & semi-retired character actors. even with a big budget and built-in audience, it would have been easy to make a second-rate follow-up or even a dud bad enough to kill the franchise. leigh brackett's clever script, irvin kerschner's directorial craft, george lucas's unprecedented production values & the energy & intensity of the cast allowed ""the empire strikes back"" to set a standard for outer-space adventure that has never been equaled. lucas's first original ""star wars"" story emphasizes the series's two great strengths: fantastic action & the wily, wicked galactic empire. after their hidden base is found & destroyed, the rebel alliance flees in disarray, with solo (ford), princess leia (fisher), chewbacca & the droids hotly pursued in the damaged millennium falcon by an imperial fleet. luke (hamill) vanishes into a jungle planet to find jedi mentor yoda & complete his training. story flaws, including the fact that luke's training takes place in the same amount of time as the millennium falcon's pursuit & the introduction of important characters near the end of the film, are unnoticeable unless you're looking for them. the action starts early & never lets up, with the battle of the ice planet alone more than enough for any action film. but there's plenty more where that came from, with the amazing flight through the asteroid field & the lightsaber duel in the cloud city standing out. ford makes the most of his opportunity of developing solo as a charming ""scoundrel,"" with fisher game as his reluctant love interest. hamill, who isn't really leading-man material, is sufficiently believable as the peasant hero growing into an elite warrior. the new age, oriental ""force"" (rarely called a ""religion"") gets more prominence in ""empire"" but never bogs down into hokiness or boredom. all these elements combine to give the film a never-failing theme of harried heroes hounded by an evil force that is so vast, powerful & diabolically clever that the viewer is moved almost, but not quite, to despair--exactly where kerschner wants us. this is outer-space fantasy, not science fiction, so don't look for any science. and despite ""the force"" as a plot device, there's no point in looking too deeply for heavy themes or subtle meanings. in fact, subtlety of any kind was pretty much killed off by this and other lucas & spielberg films. all you get with ""empire"" is a couple of hours of straightforward, nonstop, matchless thrills without condescension or manipulation that you can enjoy again & again without ever getting tired of it.";29 April 2006;10;['new', 'high', 'semi', 'retired', 'big', 'easy', 'second', 'bad', 'leigh', 'clever', 'directorial', 'unprecedented', 'outer', 'first', 'original', 'great', 'fantastic', 'wily', 'wicked', 'galactic', 'rebel', 'imperial', 'same', 'important', 'unnoticeable', 'enough', 'more', 'amazing', 'most', 'charming', 'reluctant', 'leading', 'believable', 'elite', 'new', 'oriental', 'more', 'evil', 'vast', 'powerful', 'clever', 'outer', 'heavy', 'subtle', 'other', 'straightforward', 'nonstop', 'tired'];0.1690664711632453

485;darioilg;"the incredible, universal success of ""star wars"" in 1977 was a big incentive for george lucas and his squad to deliver a sequel that could cover them in money just like the first did and that could satisfy fans and critics. the final result was (and is) a fantastic movie, arguably the best sequel ever in this kind of cinematic experience. as lucas left the writing job to his fellow storyteller lawrence kasdan (very possibly the real mastermind behind the most amusing lines, considering the awful job lucas did all alone with the prequels), the adventure is just as iconic as ""a new hope"", but with a darker and somewhat more mature mood, as the title suggests. if ""star wars"" was an epic poem, and in some ways it is, this film should be considered its ""discentio ad inferos"", that is the lowest moment for the hero, who then rises from its ashes and manages to win once and for all (""return of the jedi""): both han solo and luke skywalker find themselves in great danger at the hands of darth vader, a character that immediately grows in depth after one of the last scenes, which is also one of the most famous scenes (and worst quoted lines) in the history of cinema and possibly the best idea to come from george lucas's mind. one possible mistake could have been to recycle our beloved characters in cheap fashion, but instead everyone of them grows and gets more defined through the story and we are introduced to yet some other iconic members of this wonderful universe, like master yoda, lando calrissian and the baddest bounty hunter ever, boba fett. on top of all that, john williams's music is just as fantastic as the first time around, modelling itself to the more grim atmosphere. is episode v better than episode iv? not for me, but it's the other masterpiece in the saga. 9/10";24 January 2016;7;['incredible', 'universal', 'big', 'first', 'final', 'fantastic', 'good', 'cinematic', 'fellow', 'real', 'amusing', 'awful', 'alone', 'iconic', 'new', 'mature', 'epic', 'discentio', 'low', 'great', 'last', 'famous', 'bad', 'good', 'possible', 'beloved', 'cheap', 'other', 'iconic', 'wonderful', 'badd', 'fantastic', 'first', 'grim', 'well', 'other'];0.2095454545454545

492;jennifer_litchfield;"star wars - episode v, the empire strikes back, rather suffers from 'middle child' syndrome. being the second of the original trilogy it has neither the fresh appeal of originality that marked its predecessor, nor is it required to reach any conclusions. the result is a film with decidedly minimalist plot development. the empire is still hunting down the rebel alliance, luke skywalker is still training to be a jedi knight, and. . . . .. . . . . well, that's pretty much it. instead of a solid storyline, the viewer is treated to 122 minutes of cobbled-together battle sequences (although watch for the impressive imperial walker troop carriers, which resemble out-sized armoured elephants). the characters however, have developed considerably since the first film - it's nice to see loyal chewbacca show a sense of humour. the sexual tension between princess leia and han solo is palpable. . . . . . . . . . until they kiss (which looks about as exciting as snogging a shoe). in a clever twist, yoda the jedi master is not a hercules-type warrior, but a wizened green dwarf; the characterisation would have worked even better had he not had a voice a-la-sesame street. in the special edition of episode iv, a new hope, there is an obvious and uncomfortable chasm between those scenes which have been unaltered since they were shot in 1977 and those that were digitally re-mastered and altered 20 years later. fortunately the same is not the case in episode v. but why was it necessary to darken the picture contrast so drastically? for fanatics the empire strikes back is of course an integral component of the star wars dynasty. viewers with a more casual interest in the story could probably get away with skipping this installment altogether.";12 January 2003;4;['middle', 'original', 'fresh', 'minimalist', 'rebel', 'jedi', 'solid', 'impressive', 'imperial', 'sized', 'armoured', 'first', 'nice', 'loyal', 'sexual', 'palpable', 'exciting', 'clever', 'wizened', 'green', 'la', 'sesame', 'special', 'new', 'obvious', 'uncomfortable', 'same', 'necessary', 'integral', 'casual'];0.1559253246753246
493;watcher101;"i know i'm going to get a lot of hate for this, but, to me, i found empire to be the, shall we say, least appealing of the trilogy. i know that this sounds bad, but hear me out before you judge me; i have an explanation. i know that most people consider empire to be the best in the series, but i always found it to be the, for lack of a better phrasing, least appealing. better than the spinoffs (solo and rogue one), which i mostly found to be unnecessary cash-grabs, but still last place in the nine movie lineup. i still love this movie, but there were some key factors that kept it in the lowest position. the biggest issue i had with it is that it had a massive amount of exposition. don't get me wrong, the battle on hoth was awesome, so was the fight between luke and vader, but everything else in the middle was pretty much a bunch of data dumping, where luke is learning about the force, and han and leia's relationship is developing while they hide and try to repair the millennium falcon. and while i do think that things like world building, character growth, and relationship development are important, when your story is primarily that, it's going to suffer in my opinion. now, as a kid, i had severe adhd and a very short attention span, so all the stuff in between the exciting action sequences made it very hard for the movie to hold my interest. for me it was like: what's happening with luke? oh, he's still learning about the force. ok, what's happening with han and leia? oh, they're still hiding and fixing the falcon while getting closer. what's happening with vader? oh, he's still looking for the falcon. ok, lets get back to luke. oh, he's still learning about the force. rinse and repeat for again and again for over an hour. for a kid like me with a very sort attention span, it was very hard for all this to hold my interest. and sure, they had little tidbits like the giant asteroid worm, but it wasn't enough to hold my attention for long. there was also the cliffhanger ending regarding han's fate, which my childhood self did not appreciate and was very upset about. even what was arguably the greatest movie twist in history left no impact on me thanks to my own father, who told me that darth vader was luke's father back when i watched a new hope for the first time; something i will never forgive him for. now that i'm older, i definitely have a deeper appreciation and understanding for this movie than i did as a kid, and scenes that i once considered to be boring i now find much more appealing, but the damage was done from numerous re-watches over the years from when i was a kid. so yeah, this is a ranking based a bit on circumstances, but unfortunately that's where it stands. still a great movie that everyone should see.";10 April 2020;8;['least', 'bad', 'most', 'good', 'well', 'least', 'appealing', 'well', 'rogue', 'unnecessary', 'last', 'key', 'low', 'big', 'massive', 'wrong', 'awesome', 'important', 'severe', 'short', 'exciting', 'close', 'sort', 'hard', 'little', 'enough', 'long', 'upset', 'great', 'own', 'new', 'first', 'old', 'deep', 'appealing', 'numerous', 'great'];0.1285732323232323

495;deepthinker566;after i've watched star wars episode iv: a new hope, i started to watched the second movie of the original trilogy and it's considered the best film of the series, its star wars episode v: the empire strikes back. it stars mark hamill, harrison ford, carrie fisher, david prowse, billy dee williams, frank oz, anthony daniels, etc. the story of luke skywalker, han solo, princess leia and the others didn't end with the destruction of the death star - it continues in the empire strikes back. imperial forces have since driven the rebels to hide on the ice world hoth. but even on such an icy, backwater world, they cannot escape the wicked darth vader's eye for long, and he devastates the rebel base in an assault with the gigantic at-at walkers. luke flees to dagobah to begin jedi knight training with yoda, while han solo, chewbacca, princess leia and c-3po run the blockade of imperial star destroyers in the millennium falcon. the imperials pursue them across the galaxy and eventually catch up with them at bespin. now darth vader plans to use them as bait to lure luke skywalker to him, and turns han solo over to boba fett as a prize to be delivered to crime lord jabba the hutt. luke learns a terrible family secret after losing a swordfight with vader. will he - and the others - escape the empire's clutches? since the first and the third film made changes to the special editions, i did not see anything that was changed, except for the backgrounds in cloud city. probably after this review, i'll review the final film of the original trilogy, star wars episode vi: the return of the jedi. this is another great film along with the other star wars movies. cant wait for episode 6. star wars episode v: the empire strikes back gets 10 stars.;24 May 2010;10;['new', 'second', 'original', 'good', 'imperial', 'wicked', 'long', 'rebel', 'gigantic', 'imperial', 'terrible', 'first', 'third', 'special', 'final', 'original', 'great', 'other'];0.1398851148851149
496;BenjaminPopkin;this film is as star wars as star wars gets in that it is one of if not the best story told in the franchise. empire strikes back takes everything that was good about a new hope and just completely expands upon it. it is arguably the greatest sequel in cinematic history. each character is given more emotional depth including luke, leia, han, and even vader this time. a new hope is a fun movie, this movie feels more like an emotional experience in comparison. this is the first film in which the imperial march, one of the best songs created for a movie ever is heard. also, this movie contains probably the most shocking reveal in all of cinematic history. the sets are more grand, the effects are more spectacular, and the music is absolutely some of the best in all of star wars. the film sets genuinely feel completely real. from hoth to dagobah to bespin the locations in this film are so incredibly detailed and well made. dagobah especially feels like a completely different planet. none of the sets even feel like sets. they feel like real places. also the special effects are marvelous especially for its time. the asteroid belt scene in particular is not only breathtaking to see but the music mixed in as well makes it so much fun to watch. which brings me to the action. much more fun and much more grand in comparison to a new hope. the opening hoth battle is such a great scene not only because of the special effects and the captivating action but also because of the stakes. the fact that we are following all the characters and they are all doing something makes it feel like they are actually in trouble and it makes for an engrossing scene. the fight with luke and vader is also a great action scene. the scene where luke is looking for his friends and runs into vader. the lack of music, the choreography, and all the colors work together to tell the story. one of the best set ups to a fight, like ever. the fight itself is very emotional for both characters which leads up to the big reveal at the end. luke willingly chose death over joining vader. it's a cliffhanger, literally. i feel like the yoda stuff is shorter than it should be. don't get me wrong i think the training scenes with yoda on dagobah are great. but, it feels too short and almost underwhelming. it starts off very funny when we meet yoda, i love that scene after luke crashes. i also think the dialogue between yoda and luke as well as yoda and ben is really well written. yoda feels like a goofball at first, but quickly begins to come out as a genuine and wise character. all of those scenes are extremely quotable as well like yoda says some really smart things. in the end it feels like lukes training is extremely rushed and i understand it's because he chose to leave, but still i would have liked to see more. that doesn't mean i don't appreciate the scenes we did get. the tie fighter scene is awesome and i think about yoda's quotes to luke on a daily basis. overall, the empire strikes back is honestly a masterpiece of cinema. it is one of the best movies ever made without a doubt. the characters all have so much more depth to them. it completely steps it up in comparison to a new hope. in terms of the character development, special effects, script, and execution. there is never a dull moment, and it is filled with iconic moments. the whole third act is so emotionally powerful. the scene where they lose han, and then the vader and luke scene afterwards. such well shot, emotional and beautifully filmed scenes. it ends with one of the best cliffhangers ever. everyone is on a low note, and no one knows what's gonna happen next. the empire strikes back is nothing shy of a masterpiece. *chefs kiss* i like new hope better because it's much more simple and fun. revenge of the sith is my favorite, easily.;30 March 2022;10;['good', 'good', 'new', 'great', 'cinematic', 'emotional', 'new', 'emotional', 'first', 'imperial', 'good', 'shocking', 'cinematic', 'grand', 'spectacular', 'good', 'real', 'detailed', 'different', 'real', 'special', 'marvelous', 'particular', 'much', 'more', 'more', 'grand', 'new', 'opening', 'hoth', 'great', 'special', 'great', 'good', 'emotional', 'big', 'short', 'wrong', 'great', 'short', 'underwhelming', 'luke', 'genuine', 'wise', 'quotable', 'smart', 'rushed', 'more', 'awesome', 'daily', 'good', 'more', 'new', 'special', 'dull', 'iconic', 'whole', 'third', 'powerful', 'luke', 'such', 'emotional', 'good', 'low', 'shy', 'new', 'simple', 'favorite'];0.3012474367737526

507;orourkec-292-269155;well, well. not bad at all this film. i thought that empire strikes back was a good motion picture and an improvement over a new hope which i completely disliked. what's good about empire strikes back is that it is more involving than its predecessor, it is fresh, dark, sinister, emotional and unpredictable in an original and great way but what comes as a particularly interesting subplot in this film is the daring, slick, ironic, manipulative, show-off and comedic dialog shared between han solo and princess leia. we witness awesome moments whenever it is only the two of them talking together alone in what looks like a romance moment between the two of them. and also the good thing is that the romance and dialogs between them is not over-the-top as some people might expect from a part romance film. and harrison ford is impeccably well cast as han solo in this movie, both in his acting and his looks and he is ultimately an exceptionally interesting character. and darth vader he isn't bad either. he is perfect as a villain: he is obsessed to catch the rebels that won a victory over his galactic empire three years earlier and he also punishes his commanders that involuntarily fail him in his attempt to catch the rebels by strangling them by the use of the force. and he is also beautifully voiced by james earl jones though to be honest his small accent bothered me a bit and it harmed his beautiful and haunting voice as darth vader a bit. actually, i think i will not consider it as a flaw as a matter of fact because of his beautiful and haunting voice and i think that his beautiful and haunting voice is enough to undo the flaw. well done on all that. and last but not least...the sound. the sound was absolutely fantastic in this movie and it arguably deserved the academy award for best sound which it won. one thing i think should have been improved in this star wars movie would have been to dig deeper into the idea of the force. my rating for empire strikes back is 7.2/10;18 September 2014;7;['bad', 'good', 'new', 'good', 'fresh', 'dark', 'sinister', 'emotional', 'unpredictable', 'original', 'great', 'interesting', 'daring', 'slick', 'ironic', 'manipulative', 'comedic', 'awesome', 'good', 'interesting', 'bad', 'perfect', 'galactic', 'honest', 'small', 'beautiful', 'beautiful', 'beautiful', 'enough', 'last', 'least', 'fantastic', 'good'];0.2808516196447231

511;zurnd;"it has been echoed an infinite amount of times before. it has been chanted from the highest hilltops and the most well known critic sites on the internet. it has been said time and time again. star wars episode 5: the empire strikes back is not only the best star wars movie, but the best movie sequel ever made, and a prime example of how follow ups can match up and even prevail over their predecessors. while i like the prequels and the film that started it all in 77, the empire strikes back has always been the sw film that glowed the most for me and had the best scenes out of the entire saga. it also introduced my all time favorite star wars character and my favorite movie character in general, brought to life by a man who based the character's look and facial expressions off his own. the empire strikes back is the ideal star wars film for me, and although it received a mixed reception when it was first released, it has garnished a monstrosity of a following these last couple decades and it shines as one of the greatest sci-fi thrillers with loads of twists and turns to quench your thirst. from the opening battle on the snowy world of hoth to the final confrontation between luke and his soon to be revealed father, darth vader, this film has a scale, a scope, a powerful, eminent feeling to it. john williams' exuberant score plays through like an orchestra at an opera and each scene carries suspense and magnitude as you see the events the main characters must live through. as a sequel, it also digs much deeper into the characters' souls and puts them up against powerhouses we never thought they'd go up against, not even in the first movie. luke skywalker must train to become a jedi on the swamp planet of dagobah and at the same time, he must learn what makes the ways of a jedi work. he must be patient and believe in the unbelievable, which is something he fails to do at first (that is why you fail!). he also must learn to avoid the temptations of the dark side and learn what the force is all about. the force is not always about lifting things and tricking people's minds, it's a much bigger entity than luke could ever imagine, and it's something that touches every life form. in a peanut shell, the force is with everything and allows all creatures to coexist and be bound together as one solid package. this is one of the many lessons yoda teaches luke in the second act of the movie. luke's friends, han and leia are also met with extreme challenges in this sci-fi sequel. as they are constantly on the run from the relentless empire, they must learn ways of hiding and working together for the benefit of surviving the empire's vicious clawing. han and leia must also balance their romantic feelings for one another and learn to get along as well as not let their inner devils get the best of them. but in the realm of seriousness, there is also a bit of comedy and endless excitement. i love han's relationship with c-3p0 (never tell me the odds!) and that the millennium falcon is always malfunctioning and breaking down. it can't even make the jump to light speed, which it did so frivolously in the first outing. the chase through the asteroid field remains one of my all time favorite scenes out of the saga and john williams' score for the scene amplifies it's awesomeness. now let's talk about yoda, my favorite star wars character and movie character of all time. designed by stuart freeborn, yoda drew inspiration from albert einstein, buddha and even kermit the frog, but overall came off as a wise little creature with a brain as big as the galaxy itself. he undeniably has the best dialogue out of the movie and at times, it's hard to believe that yoda was a puppet and not some real life alien from another world. luke takes his teachings seriously, but when vader uses luke's fears to his advantage (by torturing han and leia), he flees in a state of franticness and his inexperience is the main reason why he fails against vader in the cloud city ""windy room"". when darth vader revealed himself to be luke's father, many jaws dropped, many undies were pooped, and many gasps were heard throughout the theaters back in 1980. today, the climatic twist is still as legendary as it was then and it has been lampooned bazillions of times on television shows, parodies and other movies. what makes the scene great is the build up. it's something we weren't expecting and when it came, it smacked us hard in the faces. of course, there is so much more to talk about, like the fett man, the awesome harryhausen style stop motion of the at-ats and the tauntauns, the brilliant, exotic looks of the environments and the overall quality of the film, but i've rambled on long enough. the empire strikes back is a mesmerizing experience that still holds up some 33 years later. if you had to watch one star wars movie and didn't know which one to watch, why not give this one a viewing. i don't even think you need to see the first film to enjoy this masterpiece, for it's energy and richness makes it stick out like pink hair. it's truly an experience that will leave lifelong lasting memories, so if you need a getaway, take a trip to that galaxy far, far away and let george lucas' imagination do the talking.";15 June 2013;10;['infinite', 'high', 'good', 'good', 'prime', 'follow', 'most', 'good', 'entire',

512;MovieRat-2;"out of the four star wars films (only episodes 1,4,5,and 6 existed when this was written) i feel that this is the most philosophical of the group. the scenes with yoda and luke remind me of those old kung fu movies with the wise, old master teaching the art (or in this case the ways of the force) to his young and inexperienced disciple. those scenes and the battle between luke and darth vader are pure classics. despite this, i did not place this part at the top of my list of ""best star wars movie."" after seeing episode 4, where the underdog rebels rise up against incredible odds to defeat the all powerful empire in a beautifully done space battle, episode 5 seemed to be sharp turn towards the opposite direction. han gets captured, frozen in carbonite, and transported to jabba; the empire beats the crap out of the rebels time and time again; luke gets his hand hacked off; and darth vader reveals that he is luke's father. totally different than the episode before it. those who have seen the first one (episode iv for those who don't know) and haven't seen the second one (episode v) then i have just this to say...shame on you! but seriously, be wary. it is not called, the empire strikes back for nothing.";3 August 2000;8;['philosophical', 'old', 'wise', 'old', 'young', 'inexperienced', 'pure', 'good', 'incredible', 'powerful', 'sharp', 'opposite', 'different', 'first', 'second', 'wary'];0.1649553571428571
513;sjwest;"this movie achieved an extremely rare accomplishment in cinematic history the sequel surpassed the original in all departments. other examples of this are 'the godfather' and 'the terminator'. 'star wars' and 'godfather' were the next chapter in a trilogy and thus were the continuing story rather than the beefing up of an original high concept movie conceived with the sole objective of cashing in on the appeal of the original. 'the terminator' was not planned as a trilogy, but rose above the production company cash in norm by delivering a developed story and limiting action sequences to fall into the context of the story. these movies indicate to us that good stories are fundamental to the long term audience acceptance. lucas certainly had this in mind. the composition of the next chapter requires character development. of importance here is ensuring the characters have changed as a consequence of their previous experiences. this not only creates audience interest for the audience, but also offers opportunities for challenging adventures for our heroes. the best example of this is skywalker. the realisation of his power has given him a sense of purpose and he relishes the opportunity to learn. he retains his youthful enthusiasm and spirit of adventure. although feeling a high sense of duty, he still has concern for his friends and rushes to their aid. his development as a jedi knight has alerted the empire to the threat that he poses. vader has relentlessly pursued him and taking advantage of his commitment to his friends, finally manages to lure him into a showdown. this of course led to the memorable scene where vader reveals his true identity. this set the stage for an engaging conflict in the next chapter. the story can now flow seamlessly thus maintaining the captivated audience. conflict is what gives impetus to the story and it must be plausible so as to maintain the credibility of the story. it is the prime character driver and as our characters develop, so the conflict becomes greater further motivating them towards resolution. there is no greater emotive conflict than that of father and son on opposing sides of the battlefield. it would be natural for audiences to identify with this. this served to create a solid platform for mass audience appeal. the relationship between ford and fisher had grown. their differences in character had endeared them to each other. the conflict between the two was riddled with weak lines that at times were silly but which probably helped to inspire giggles from the younger members off the audience. it was designed to indicate innocent love. given the huge success of this movie, the lines would not have gone to waste. ford was well cast for the role. he is a watered down clint eastwood doing it his own way, but as a team player with a strong sense of moral commitment to his friends, much unlike eastwood who is a loner lacking commitment and with lewd sexual fantasies. although his character needed to go, the natural family values of ford seeped into his character. he was not the gunman, but the man fighting for the survival of his family. the acting was the single biggest improvement. much of this can be credited to the new director. lucas is a writer by nature and the reticence inherent in a writer may not translate well to that of the director who needs to be outwardly expressive. the most visible improvement for me was that there was a greater menace about vader. i believe that this was due his less animated style. he was more methodical in method somewhat like a cold assassin. he did not expend unnecessary energy as he ruthlessly hunted down skywalker. this improvement to the character augmented the dark feel of the movie. also worthy of special mention was hamill. gone were the false facial mannerisms and now we have a performance showing the inner turmoil and conflict. hamill, with a little help from the director, was growing in stature. the lack of restraint was not evident here as it was in the first one. this was a necessary progression since the character was faced with greater personal conflict and without the restraint we would have had a hammed up offering. an obligatory requirement for sequels is that our heroes encounter different characters on their adventures. this can be a most difficult task, especially when the first chapter was a great success. the idea is to introduce new characters to the audience which would spark new interest as well as being within the context of the story. the new characters of note were the bounty hunter and yoda. the bounty hunter blended into the story since he compared well with vader. this was by no means indicative of a lack of creativity, but was in fact the perfect addition. a character was created that inspired interest, but retained the continuity of the story since he was instantly recognisable as someone who could be in allegiance with the dark side. the retention of the story continuity and the addition of originality required inspired creativity. he was human only in shape. we could not see any part of his body thus limiting his identification as an emotional being that could be reasoned with. he was the manifestation of a cold blooded killer. although lacking the over bearing presence of vader, he was an ominous foe. characters such as these do not have much screen time. the more we know about our foes, the less of a threat they are. notwithstanding this fact, he is one of the more memorable characters. in the battle between good and evil, yoda was the wizard preparing the knight for the duel. he had the characteristics necessary of someone on the side of the good. his animated mannerisms and comical features endeared him to the younger audience and his grim warnings about the power of the dark side enthused entertainment for the rest. guinness had a small part to play in this chapter and yoda was his replacement, thus evidencing the continuity and originality previously mentioned. the assault launched on the imagination by the original had now been intensified with advanced weaponry. improvements to the armoury were more emotive content within the acting; new characters which added value to the battlefield and of course the then spectacular special effects. of particular note is the twist in the plot where the true identity of skywalker's father is revealed to him. this jolt was not enough to awaken us from our trance like state of hyper imagination. the 'star wars' machine rolled on ever conquering, enslaving audiences worldwide who readily accepted their subservience. the stage was graced with a story rich in design and complemented with vivid images. the wait for the next chapter would be a long one.";21 September 2003;9;['rare',

519;asiduodiego;"after star wars was released, madness came and invaded george lucas' professional and personal life. suddenly, a self-avowed abstract filmmaker was the center of media and fan attention. star wars became a hot name in cinema, so a sequel was demanded by almost everyone. the good thing of the original ""star wars"" was that it was made resembling classic sci-fi serials in the 40s and the 50s, such as flash gordon, so it had an episodic feel: at the end of the original movie, there were many ""plot-threads"" open to explore: luke becoming a jedi, darth vader, the fate of the rebellion, etc. so, after three years of production, came ""the empire strikes back"". and it didn't disappoint. the movie somewhat loses the light and charming mood of the original, but replaces it with character development, drama and concept exploration. the space adventure feel is more serious this time: it's not the scenario of ""saving the princess"" anymore, rather a cat and mouse chase, with a feeling of doom surrounding the characters. there is learning, adventure, introspection, confrontation, betrayal, revelations, and at the end, a well crafted cliffhanger, leading to the next movie. ""empire"" is somewhat more respected by sci-fi fans than the original ""star wars"", maybe because it took itself more seriously than the last one. the first movie had the mood of a ""fairy tale in space"". this one has more dramatic and introspective tones, and a more dreadful scenario. at the end, the fate of one of the main characters is left unknown for the audience: this movie took risks. to summarize, this is not in the same vein as the original ""star wars"", but it has an excellent development, story and tone, which makes this movie an enjoyable experience and an endurable classic. a masterpiece for the sci-fi-fantasy genre. 10/10";21 March 2011;10;['professional', 'personal', 'abstract', 'hot', 'good', 'original', 'classic', 'such', 'episodic', 'original', 'many', 'open', 'charming', 'original', 'serious', 'next', 'original', 'last', 'first', 'dramatic', 'introspective', 'dreadful', 'main', 'unknown', 'same', 'original', 'excellent', 'enjoyable', 'endurable'];0.1736666666666666

525;blubb06;"one of my favorites of the original star wars trilogy, and i know every line by heart in german and english. george lucas, of course, couldn't keep his fingers entirely still, and when i talk about it now i mean the latest dvd version of the special edition. but compared to its sequels, it is the one that has gained the most from cgi. german fans, unfortunately, have to put up with the rather destructive efforts of re-dubbing darth vaders voice in two little scenes with seven dialog lines: his conversation with the emperor and another scene at the end of the movie. the original german voice, heinz petruo, had unfortunately died in 2001. but even so, all that needed to be added was one sentence: vader: ""how is that possible?"" the studio didn't use its sophisticated mix-mastering equipment to rework the original tapes, move the other six sentences around a little and get a guy that, with a few audio filters, sounded roughly like the original voice to speak those four words. they did a completely new dub. it proves the engineer knew how to apply filters, but the voice acting is best described as talentless, and the manager who hired him should only do commercials. now, mr. lucas, which number was i supposed to call if i'm not satisfied with sound quality? on the other hand, i think he deserves more praise than he got (at least from me) for his efforts to preserve the magic of the trilogy. i recently had the rare opportunity to watch a ""genuine"" laserdisk edition of the original movie. it's closer to the real cinema experience because there is no pal speedup, which produces a slightly slower pacing and darker voices (something ntsc viewers are not aware of). but even with the lower image resolution, it had noticeably aged. the stop motion animation looks jerky, the spaceships too static, color mismatch and compositing lines jump into view, things we never noticed - because they could not be done better at the time. all these things were fixed in the special edition. so without the remarkable devotion of mastermind george lucas, the first three star wars films in their original form would be slightly dusty ""classics"" today, like flash gordon or the frankenstein films, with special effects that look occasionally funny. george lucas kept the trilogy alive for a new generation. still, the originals preserve movie history. they breathe the flavor of the 70s and 80s in their sound effects and interior designs, and their inferior technical quality serves to draw attention to atmosphere, acting and story - at least for me, it was never mere fascination with special effects. they only serve as make-believes. without history, there is nothing to look back to.";22 February 2008;7;['original', 'german', 'late', 'special', 'most', 'german', 'destructive', 're', 'little', 'original', 'german', 'possible', 'sophisticated', 'original', 'other', 'little', 'few', 'audio', 'original', 'new', 'satisfied', 'sound', 'other', 'more', 'least', 'rare', 'genuine', 'original', 'close', 'real', 'pal', 'slow', 'dark', 'ntsc', 'aware', 'low', 'static', 'special', 'remarkable', 'first', 'original', 'dusty', 'frankenstein', 'special', 'funny', 'alive', 'new', 'interior', 'inferior', 'technical', 'least', 'mere', 'special'];0.1261399711399711

527;rorymacveigh-66661;although star wars episode iv was groundbreaking, as a kid i always loved to see star wars episode v, as basically it took all the things developed in the first movie, and built on them to create something 1,000 times better like a good sequel should, rather than just retracing the steps of the previous film. although my family didn't own episode v, my brother's friend did, and surprised me when i was about 6 years old by bringing over episode v in secret, and i adored every last minute of it! so what's the deal? after the destruction of the death star in the previous film, the empire gained its revenge, and the rebel alliance was scattered across the galaxy in a bitter chase. now on the ice planet of hoth, jedi luke skywalker is told in a vision to go to the planet of dagobah to learn from a mystical jedi master known as yoda. meanwhile, the empire determines their location, and after a vicious fight between the ill-equipped rebels and the empire's at-at walkers, the group must flee the planet, with han solo and chewbacca taking princess leia and c-3po in a desperate bid to escape the imperial blockade aboard the millennium falcon, whilst luke and r2d2 journey to the swamp world of dagobah to find the mysterious jedi, all while being pursued by the vengeful dark lord, darth vader, obsessed with turning luke to the dark side. as i said, rather than retreading the first movie like many sequels do, the empire strikes back takes all the elements from the first movie, the fantastic models, the gripping action, the story, the characters, and expands on them. the development of the characters, such as romantic relationship that you can genuinely believe between han and the princess is established, luke is trained in the art of a jedi, being able to control and channel the force, and darth vader's truly evil powers are built upon, now being a ruthless leader of a frightened army. the story is also one that throws you on so many loops. i've watched this movie a million times so nothing surprises me, but if you're watching for the first time, there are many things about this film that will give you a shock, or take you by surprise. i of course wont name them, but you'll see what i mean. the action sequences have also been massively improved since the last movie. whilst the battle above the death star, though long, was impressive, the battle against the at-at's in the snow with the stop-motion movement of the walkers and the fight of the snowspeeders is just so good it's practically real. every individual piece is manipulated and choreographed to perfection to create a truly awesome fight scene. the lightsaber battles too have been made more energetic, and take place on a wider range of locations, as well as the mastery of the force and powers that it entails being developed heavily. overall, i consider this both my best science-fiction film, but also my best film of all time. a film that even today has me hooked, and continues to be the awe and inspiration of so many even 35 years after it first hit the big screen. i recommend this movie to everyone, because it appeals to just about everyone!;27 March 2015;10;['first', 'well', 'good', 'previous', 'old', 'secret', 'last', 'previous', 'rebel', 'bitter', 'mystical', 'vicious', 'desperate', 'imperial', 'swamp', 'mysterious', 'vengeful', 'dark', 'dark', 'first', 'many', 'first', 'fantastic', 'gripping', 'such', 'romantic', 'able', 'evil', 'ruthless', 'frightened', 'many', 'first', 'many', 'last', 'impressive', 'good', 'real', 'individual', 'awesome', 'energetic', 'wide', 'good', 'good', 'hooked', 'many', 'big'];0.1342342342342342

532;keuhkokala;"movie sequels do not often improve the original film. in the science-fiction genre, there are however some exceptions. movies like aliens, x-men 2 and bride of frankenstein improved their already great predecessors (many would add terminator 2, but i won't, because i prefer small budget action-cyber-thrillers to big-budget bonanzas). the greatest sequel (i haven't seen godfather ii and i do not count return of the king as a sequel) of all time is none other than the empire strikes back. as star wars was just an amusing little adventure flick with one-dimensional characters and a simple story, however well made and funny, esb is a lot deeper in comparison. the characters have real emotions now and the universe is a lot more dangerous place than before. just look at the luke in the first film, who is sadder for the death of ben, who he knew only two days, than he is after his aunt and uncle, who have raised him as their own son, die. now, compare him to the luke in the sequel, and his despair as vader tells him his secret in the very famous scene. it's a shame mark hamill's career went only downhill from here, because he could've done some great ""serious"" acting (oh, come on. he's playing the trickster as harrison ford makes billions with each of his movies). fortunately, the humor has survived from the original film. chewie, c3po and han vs. leia tongue lashings still create giggles, but the funniest character is of course jedi master yoda. it's brilliant how they could make a demented old muppet, who can't speak sentences with the right word order, a respectable icon of wisdom. although the humor, the story is a lot darker than in the previous film. deception, death and war are constantly present, and come together in one of the best climaxes i've ever seen. the empire strikes back has almost everything that one could wish for; strange creatures, romance, humor, darkness (not the band you twit!) and epic fights both in space and on the ground. the only downside is, that the story is left unfinished in the end, but one could always see the next episode of the star wars saga, the return of the jedi right after finishing this movie. this one should be shown to cynics, who loathe science fiction. if this doesn't turn them into fans of the genre, nothing will. 10/10 the best part (spoilers): oh, there's so many to choose from! some of my favorites are; the climatic lightsaber fight, han solo being dipped into carbonite, millennium falcon getting lost inside a giant space worm, the rebels succeeding in stopping the walkers in hoth with tying their legs together with rope and luke fighting bogus vader inside the tree of knowledge, killing him and seeing that the face behind the mask is really himself.";28 May 2004;9;['original', 'great', 'many', 'small', 'big', 'great', 'other', 'amusing', 'little', 'dimensional', 'simple', 'funny', 'deep', 'real', 'dangerous', 'first', 'sad', 'own', 'famous', 'great', 'serious', 'original', 'brilliant', 'demented', 'old', 'right', 'respectable', 'dark', 'previous', 'present', 'good', 'strange', 'epic', 'only', 'unfinished', 'next', 'good', 'many', 'climatic', 'giant', 'bogus'];0.199234693877551

545;DavidPumpkins;"stuck right in the middle of the revolutionary opening chapter, ""a new hope"" and the action-packed finale ""return of the jedi"" came this much darker, more involving tale. ""the empire strikes back"" takes a slower and more thoughtful approach as young luke skywalker (mark hamill) is told by his former mentor obi-wan kenobi to travel to the dagoba system, in the far reaches of the galaxy, to find kenobi's own jedi master, yoda. at the same time as he is receiving this information, the imperial army is bearing down upon the ice planet of hoth, where the rebel alliance have set up base. leia (carrie fisher)and the other leaders of the alliance order an immediate evacuation but they are not quick enough and a huge battle breaks out, plunging the base into chaos. amidst all this confusion, han solo (harrison ford) and his reliable co-pilot chewbacca are trying to make their own bid for freedom and plan to leave the alliance behind to make their fortune elsewhere. as chaos sets in on the base, leia and droid c-3po end up on board solo's millennium falcon and they make their bid for freedom unsure of their destination. meanwhile, luke and r2-d2 have crash-landed on dagoba and find it to be a dank, unpleasant swamp crawling with all manner of insects and strange wildlife. luke finds yoda eventually, but he is not what he expected at all. all the same he is willing to be taught and yoda begins to train him in the ways of the force so that he too may become a jedi. meanwhile, on the run from darth vader and the imperial army, solo decides to visit an old friend of his, lando calrissian (billy dee williams) who in fact, lost the millennium falcon to solo on a bet some years earlier. however, despite the initial welcome, disaster follows and luke is forced to halt his training halfway through to try and resolve the situation... very dark in tone and aimed less at the children than the other episodes, ""the empire strikes back"" ranks as one of the finest science-fiction films ever made, building on the outstanding special effects of ""a new hope"" and also vastly improving the plot. the acting, of course, is top notch and who could ever forget that mind-blowing ending? lucas may not have been in the director's chair for this one but it doesn't mean the film is any less worthy than the original, it surpasses it in terms of story, character development and enjoyment. perhaps the most critically acclaimed episode, ""the empire strikes back"" is certainly the most influential and significant piece of the puzzle. fantastic.";13 March 2001;10;['revolutionary', 'new', 'dark', 'more', 'slow', 'thoughtful', 'young', 'former', 'far', 'own', 'same', 'imperial', 'rebel', 'other', 'immediate', 'quick', 'huge', 'reliable', 'co', 'pilot', 'own', 'unpleasant', 'strange', 'same', 'willing', 'imperial', 'old', 'initial', 'dark', 'less', 'other', 'fine', 'outstanding', 'special', 'new', 'top', 'notch', 'worthy', 'original', 'influential', 'significant', 'fantastic'];0.1623917748917749

548;jamesnicholls-58600;this is a great movie, especially for it's time. i think the overall character line up of this film was nearly as good as a new hope, as whilst obi-wan still made some appearances he wasn't in this nowhere near as much as a new hope, though yoda in this film makes up for that a lot. the lightsaber duel between vader and luke in this was much more better than the duel between obi-wan and vader in a new hope so it's definitely far better than a new hope on that. this film has many great parts such as the dagobah part and some of the spaceship parts in this (particularly the asteroid field part) were pretty entertaining. the romance in this movie had a lot of emotion and chemistry in it, the romance added another ark to the tension between han and luke as they were both competing for leia's affection so i found that quite interesting and complex. overall this film is the 5th best star wars movie for me and the 71st best film for me. a lot of people put this film first or second on their list of best star wars films but i feel a lot of people do that because they watched star wars saga for the first time in non-chronological order and instead by release date which would make that big reveal at the end more memorable and emotional for them. the problem with rating a movie based on shock value is because the shock or surprises a film has only really does that on the first viewing so yes if you watched empire strikes back before the prequels then that scene would be very shocking but i don't tend to include shock value in my rating as a lot of people watch a film more than once. besides i think watching the films in chronological order (starting with tpm) is better and more shocking, seeing anakin become vader, chopping windu's hand off, as a person who watched the prequels before the originals i think that scene was more shocking on first viewing than what it would be if i had watched the bit where vader reveals he's luke's father in empire strikes back before the prequels. the first 30-35 minutes of this film were somewhat boring for me, there just wasn't much interesting complex things happening all it was was vader simply finding the rebel's secret base on hoth and most of it was just mindless boring basic action involving a spaceship battle (though the bit with the yeti like monster and some lines han said were quite good). the rest of the film though is what makes this film truly great. the empire strikes back is also the only original trilogy film which has bits of truly great scenery as i really liked the look of cloud city, the rest of the scenery though (with a mild exception for dagobah) was pretty drab and dull i think. the vader scenes where vader seemed to be hesitant to violently face his son and tried his best to convince the emperor to spare him i felt were pretty interesting and emotional. i also really liked the bits where obi-wan and yoda are hesitant to train luke because they see too much of anakin in luke which i felt was a great way to really connect luke and anakin and i always felt that yoda probably wouldn't have accepted luke being further trained in the force if yoda and obi-wan weren't so desperate to defeat the emperor.;8 March 2021;9;['great', 'overall', 'good', 'new', 'much', 'new', 'well', 'new', 'well', 'new', 'many', 'great', 'such', 'entertaining', 'interesting', 'complex', 'good', 'good', 'second', 'good', 'first', 'non', 'chronological', 'big', 'memorable', 'emotional', 'first', 'shocking', 'chronological', 'well', 'shocking', 'shocking', 'first', 'first', 'boring', 'interesting', 'complex', 'secret', 'most', 'mindless', 'basic', 'good', 'great', 'only', 'original', 'great', 'mild', 'drab', 'dull', 'hesitant', 'good', 'interesting', 'emotional', 'hesitant', 'much', 'great', 'desperate'];0.1637941919191919

550;Betelgeuse-19;the empire strikes back is a bit more improved from the original. first, the writing. the writing in a new hope really needed a polish, but it really is pretty good here, though nothing oscar-calibar. also we get to see the great yoda here, which he was absent in a new hope. second, the acting. mark hamill is better here than he was in a new hope, probably because he is in more dangerous situations than he was in a new hope. i think this is because in the original and rotj, hamill was pretty bland and flat unless if he was in a real turning point or in danger, which was pretty scarce in those films except when he found his aunt and uncle dead, or a couple of other situations i forget. carrie fisher isn't as semi-wooden here either, she is actually quite good. thridly, the effects look more polished. in the original they looked cheesy at best, but here, they look more smooth and real, except for the creatures at the beginning of the film were luke was stranded. but the lightsabres look better, the sound effects are smoother, and is more pleasing. fourthly, the plot is more devolped. the plot in the original felt like it was stolen from a medival fairy tale with princesses, here, it shows more of the dark side, the characters are more devolped, the suspence is better, and the events are more layered. overall, this is great polish-up from a new hope. one gripe though would have to be how the irony from the original lacks here, but it is still a great film. 9/10;30 May 2002;9;['improved', 'original', 'new', 'good', 'great', 'absent', 'new', 'well', 'new', 'dangerous', 'new', 'original', 'bland', 'flat', 'real', 'scarce', 'dead', 'other', 'semi', 'wooden', 'good', 'polished', 'original', 'good', 'smooth', 'real', 'luke', 'sound', 'smooth', 'pleasing', 'devolped', 'original', 'more', 'dark', 'well', 'layered', 'great', 'new', 'original', 'great'];0.2720741901776385
551;j-tochtenhagen;i remember watching episode v in the theater back in 1980/81 and i walked out with an uncomfortable feeling that this was just a moneymaking episode and simply not finished. in fact it wasn't, since it was designed to be the dramatic middle-part of the trilogy, which i did not know at the time - i was 14 and had no idea about the trilogy. if there would not be an episode vi this would indeed be a major downside of episode v, but as the center part of the trilogy it was the best possible movie. in fact the plot does not really feel that epic, it just develops the characters more and prepares for the final act of episode vi. now, more than 36 years later we do have two completed trilogies and a new one just started plus a prequel to episode iv and all those movies can be judged from a wider angle and perspective. having said that, this one is still one of the best, although not the most enjoyable, which i think is episode vi. but all three original movies are very close and from a cinematic point of view tesb stands out, since it has the most perfect balance between all the aspects that makes star wars great. any other episode has its flaws and issues, but episode v is almost complete in all ways. in addition to this it simply downgrades the prequel episodes 1-3 to just being a lousy effort, but although lucas tried to create something unique they totally fail in terms of being a serious contender to the original trilogy. almost everything is either over sized or flat, and especially that is the complete opposite of episode v. it's technically advanced, serious, funny, full of ideas and action and has a straight plot. something very rare these days.;30 December 2016;9;['uncomfortable', 'dramatic', 'middle', 'major', 'center', 'good', 'possible', 'epic', 'final', 'more', 'new', 'prequel', 'wide', 'good', 'enjoyable', 'original', 'close', 'cinematic', 'perfect', 'great', 'other', 'complete', 'prequel', 'lousy', 'unique', 'serious', 'original', 'sized', 'flat', 'complete', 'advanced', 'serious', 'funny', 'full', 'straight', 'rare'];0.1523082386363636

""star wars"" was, with the exception of ""jaws"", the first real blockbuster film, and empire was without question the first blockbuster sequel. this film took all the storyline elements of the first film and took it to an entire new level. it took the special effects in the first movie and advanced them even further, with the help of a much bigger film budget this time. we all know what happens, luke trains to be a jedi, finds out his father is darth vader, and nearly falls to his death while trying to escape the dark lord. leia and han fall in love, and han is put into carbonite at the hands of vader and boba fett, with a little reluctant help from his buddy lando calrissean. the character of lando was in interesting and often overlooked element of this film. when we first meet him we think he is han's friend and billy dee williams does a great job of concealing his intentions before handing him over to the empire. of course lando was in a bad spot, if darth vader told you to do something, would you say no? most people contend that this is the best ""star wars"" film, its debatable. the original is always going to be the first one that comes to people's minds when thinking of the whole series. however, if empire is number 2, its a close number 2. the deepness of the story in episode v goes beyond what was introduced in episode iv, which is the reason many claim it is the better of the two films, and the best of all 6 films. nevertheless, empire ranks right up there with some of the greatest blockbuster films ever, and its hard to argue it is the greatest sequel ever made.";23 May 2005;10;['entire', 'new', 'successful', 'first', 'real', 'blockbuster', 'first', 'blockbuster', 'storyline', 'first', 'entire', 'new', 'special', 'first', 'big', 'luke', 'dark', 'little', 'reluctant', 'interesting', 'great', 'bad', 'most', 'good', 'debatable', 'original', 'first', 'whole', 'close', 'many', 'well', 'good', 'great', 'blockbuster', 'hard', 'great'];0.273174202340869

557;pgear83;"this is the fifth part of my essay on the themes and motifs of star wars. the empire strikes back is widely considered the best of the star wars movies and is one of the darkest. released in 1980, it continued the story and contained what was, at the time, the most shocking moment in cinema history in the revelation of luke skywalker's parentage. lucas' use of pairs of things continues to be strong motif. luke is sent to dagobah to train one-on-one with yoda, hearkening back to the master-apprentice relationships of the glory days of the republic. these scenes contain some of the best dialog in the series as yoda explains the nature of life and the force: ""we are luminous beings, not this crude matter."" one of my favorite moments in the entire series also occurs, as luke beheads the apparition of darth vader whose mask disappears to reveal luke's own face, foreshadowing the twist to come. after luke abandons his training to save his friends, it is revealed by yoda that there is in fact another who can save them (ie not one but two). technology is once again presented as potentially dangerous and above all fallible. the millennium falcon is constantly in a state of disrepair and never seems to work properly at the most critical times: a classic motif of science-fiction. technology is also demonized by the shadowy presence of boba fett and especially by the only semi-human darth vader. the climactic moment of this movie occurs in cloud city, as luke and vader duel in a hellish chamber of smoke and red lights. vader severs luke's right hand (as his had been previously by count dooku) and reveals that he is luke's father. luke chooses to fall to his death rather than live with this truth but he is saved by deus ex machina. the omnipresent malevolence of technology rears its head thereafter, as luke's hand is replaced with a mechanical one, making him just slightly more like his father and nemesis and leaving the viewer in doubt as to how the story will conclude. criminally ignored in its time by the academy, the empire strikes back is likely the greatest film of the genre ever made and sets the stage for the conclusion of the greatest series of all time. 10/10";30 August 2007;10;['fifth', 'good', 'dark', 'shocking', 'strong', 'good', 'luminous', 'crude', 'favorite', 'entire', 'own', 'dangerous', 'fallible', 'critical', 'classic', 'shadowy', 'only', 'semi', 'human', 'climactic', 'hellish', 'red', 'right', 'omnipresent', 'mechanical', 'likely', 'great', 'great'];0.1334586466165413

567;exterminator_99;"the year is 1980. with ""star wars"" already engrained into popular culture shortly after its release (much like ""the lord of the rings: fellowship of the ring"" is today), fans were left to ponder what the sequel could offer. three years after the release of the original, they found out. ""the empire strikes back"" delivers a strong emotional punch. unlike its predecessor however it is not an uplifting and feelgood film. far from it in fact. ""empire"" is a dark, brooding and somewhat surreal film, bristling with conflict and drama. as a result it stands head and shoulders above its prequels and sequel. we join the rebel alliance possibly five or so years since the destruction of the death star. despite their victory, the empire continues to close in. retreating to the ice planet of hoth, the rebels are on the run. a hugely impressive imperial starfleet nears hoth under the leadership of darth vader. obsessed with locating young luke skywalker (mark hamill) vader is unrelenting in his pursuit. urged on by the knowledge that skywalker represents a shift in the balance of the force, vader vows to either destroy the boy or turn him to the dark side to benefit himself and the emperor. meanwhile luke himself has grown up, if only slightly, since his accomplishments in the first film. more aware of his uncanny power, luke feels the force now but cannot control its impulses. his talent is raw and under the advise of the apparition of obi wan kenobi (alec guiness), luke is instructed to learn from yoda, a great jedi master on the planet of degobah. as the empire invades hoth we are treated to an impressive ground battle. making use of the wads of money available to him at the time, lucas and director irvin kershner commit to a great deal of stop motion camerawork, with the at-at walkers and snowspeeders in combat. even today, 22 years since ""empire"" was released, it still impresses. we also witness the first sparks of romance between han solo (harrison ford) and princess leia (carrie fisher). their character development in this film outweighs their contribution in the sequel ""return of the jedi"", but it works perfectly here. the empire is presented as a powerful but incompetent and bickering military machine, with officers destroyed at vader's whim. impatient and lacking any tolerance whatsoever, vader is infuriated at the inability of his highest ranking officers. the empire seems to fulfill the notion of trying to crack a walnut with a steamroller: powerful but ineffective. the film's dark and eerie tone takes off when luke arrives on degobah. a huge swamp of animal, plant and supernatural life, degobah is an embodiment of the force. after crashlanding his x wing fighter, luke wishes to locate yoda. impatient and complaining, luke is shocked to find a small creature who he originally dismisses as a pest actually is yoda. mindful of luke's age and impatience, yoda is reluctant to train him. obi wan kenobi's spirit urges yoda to try. he agrees and luke's training begins. luke is tested beyond his mental and spiritual beliefs under yoda's guidance as he faces his ultimate fear and the possible confirmation of his dark beliefs. the yoda character (a puppet performed by frank oz), is at once cute and believable. his wisdom is beyond comprehension and his ability to conduct and feel the force is illustrated brilliantly. add in john williams' ""yoda's theme"" and you have the makings of one of the more memorable of all characters in the saga. aware of his abilities to see the past and the future, luke envisions the possible death of han and leia as they are double-crossed after seeking asylum. torn between finishing his training and saving his friends, luke leaves degobah to save them. little does he know their suffering is nothing more than a trap set by darth vader on the cloud city of bespin. luring him in, vader challenges luke. fans of the original lightsabre duel between obi wan kenobi and darth vader will get blown away here. the battle still remains the best of all duels in the saga, with the ultra powerful vader manipulating the young but strong luke. set in the dark hues of black, blue and grey their lightsabre fight and its subsequent shock conclusion make ""empire"" truly memorable. the film's ending is left wide open and ready for ""return of the jedi"" as the viewer leaves the film uncertain but eager for more. the special effects and set and costume design remains superb and the floating menace of the empire's starfleet is more awe inspiring and terrifying than the original's death star. the dark tone of this film is replaced by a warmer feel in rotj, but it is the power and dramatic tension that makes this film the best of the ""star wars"" saga so far.";29 January 2002;9;['popular', 'original', 'strong',

575;KrazzyDJ;"it's now an accepted fact that the first star wars is regarded as one of the most, or amongst some communities, the most successful movie of all time both in terms of critical acclaim and box office gross. attempting a sequel to a movie of such magnitude, while an exciting prospect from the movie goers' perspective, is a suicidal task for the crew behind the same. one can only imagine the immense pressure of expectations that the makers of this film would have gone through while making this movie and even more so when the movie eventually saw the light. however, this movie not only fulfills all such hopes that fans of the first movie would have from the sequel but takes the star wars franchise into an even better and exciting territory, and improving upon the minor flaws of the first, turns out to be an adventure that can be regarded as good as perfect in all aspects of film-making. although i had gotten a slight hint of this from the forums and internet talk, i now realize why this is regarded as the best movie in the star wars universe. there's little need to get into the plot as it is best experienced by watching the movie directly. to describe it in short though, darth vader is desperately after luke skywalker and wants to turn him to the dark side. in an attempt to capture him, he plans to use his friends han solo and princess leia as bait. meanwhile, luke, guided by obi-wan kenobe's voice through the mystical force must travel to dagobah where he must learn the true ways of a jedi knight in order to confront the evil lord darth vader. once again, all the elements that made the original star wars a success abound in the sequel. there's a well conceived story put together in place, great writing and editing that makes all the sequences feel connected to each other allowing them all to flow together, there's the original cast giving better performances this time being more aware of their characters, and of course, there's the by now famous star wars opening musical piece. lucas, busy handling his newly established visual effects house and finances, hands over the directorial reins to his trusted professor irvin kershner. a professor at the university of cinema sciences, the way he handles the epic sequences while at the same time concentrating on expanding and developing the characteristic traits of the main cast gives the film an emotional depth which was sorely lacking in the original movie and which was one of my complaints with that film - the characters there were appeared too flat and devoid of personality as though they were just going through the motions. the presence of some character development this time allows us to connect with them even better which in turn makes the situations in which they get involved in a lot more engaging. amongst all, the character of han solo as a dependable ""scoundrel"" is what really stands out; ford plays him out in a near perfect way which is not only consistent with what solo was in the first film, but also takes it in a further positive direction. his sequences with carrie fisher as princess leia are amongst the high points of the movie and are brilliantly played out. we also see mark hamill as a now slightly more mature luke skywalker as he journeys to dagobah to learn the ways of a true jedi from the strangely voiced yoda. and of course there's the inseparable duo of c-3po and r2-d2 who are actually forced to stay apart from each other for a major portion of this movie. as much as i can admit to not being able to understand anything r2 says, i have inexplicably grown to like his presence immensely in star wars. the film features visual effects and action on a scale that's almost twice as big as its predecessor (the budget only confirms this). spending $32 million on a movie in 1980 would not have been regarded as a wise decision but thank goodness that lucas decided to go for it or we might not have been able to witness space battles on such a huge scale. the battle on the ice planet at the start of the movie is brilliantly staged and a behind the scenes documentary sheds some light on how some of these miraculous shots were achieved. what's really great about the action is that unlike the heavily edited action sequences of present films wherein the average shot just lasts for about 2-3 seconds, shots in star wars last longer making the action very comprehensible and easy to follow. its easy to see the strategies being adopted by each side while fighting as opposed to units just being brought down by random shots fired by people / creatures obscured by the miss-mash editing. and the best sequence of the movie comes towards the end in an epic battle between luke and darth vader that literally will send your pulse racing. even more exciting is the battle's infamous outcome which i shall not reveal. movies like the empire strikes back come only once in a while. perhaps, every decade must have only a few of these movies present. fans would obviously come up with a few nitpicks here and there but as far as my opinion goes, this movie is perfect in every aesthetic and area of film-making i'm ever aware of. now that this movie has set such high standards for the star wars saga, i wonder where the next movies will take me. suffice it to say, the empire strikes back strikes a positive blow from which recovery is simply not possible. a winner all the way !!! score: 10 / 10";12 February 2012;10;['accepted', 'first', 'most', 'successful', 'critical', 'such', 'exciting', 'suicidal', 'same', 'immense', 'such', 'first', 'well', 'exciting', 'minor', 'first', 'good', 'perfect', 'slight', 'good', 'little', 'short', 'dark', 'mystical', 'true', 'jedi', 'evil', 'original', 'great', 'connected', 'other', 'original', 'well', 'aware', 'famous', 'musical', 'busy', 'visual', 'directorial', 'epic', 'same', 'characteristic', 'main', 'emotional', 'original', 'flat', 'devoid', 'engaging', 'dependable', 'near', 'perfect', 'consistent', 'first', 'further', 'positive', 'high', 'mature', 'true', 'inseparable', 'other', 'major', 'able', 'visual', 'big', 'wise', 'able', 'huge', 'miraculous', 'great', 'present', 'average', 'comprehensible', 'easy', 'easy', 'random', 'miss', 'good', 'epic', 'exciting', 'infamous', 'few', 'present', 'few', 'perfect', 'aesthetic', 'aware', 'such', 'high', 'next', 'positive', 'possible'];0.1878146853146853

582;sdillon-1;contains spoilers the general consensus among fans and critics says the empire strikes back is the finest star wars film. i would have to agree. it's darker, funnier and more dramatic than the first film. although not a sequel in the strictest sense of the word, it belongs to an elite club of 'even-better-than-the-original' films along with the godfather part ii and toy story 2. the empire strikes back in the hands of studio bosses would probably have been a straight rehash of the original. thankfully, george lucas had complete financial and creative control, bringing in director irvin kershner and screenwriters lawrence kasdan and leigh brackett (who died before the film was finished) to help realise his vision. these collaborators deserve as much credit as lucas himself for the unmitigated masterpiece that resulted. the empire strikes back picks up the story again as the rebel alliance are hiding from the evil empire on snow planet hoth. here we are re-introduced to our heroes luke skywalker, han solo, princess leia and droids c3po and r2 d2. luke is attacked by a snow monster (a kind of abominable snowman called the 'hoth wampa'). he defeats the creature but is lost in the icy night and begins to freeze to death. in his delirium, luke sees a vision of his dead mentor obi wan kenobi instructing him to find jedi master yoda and train as a jedi. at the same time, romance is brewing between han solo and princess leia, although they both refuse to admit it. han intends to leave hoth with co-pilot chewbacca and pay off his debt to jabba the hutt before his bounty hunters catch up with him. however, han's departure is delayed by rescuing luke. unfortunately, it doesn't take long for the empire, under the leadership of darth vader to find the rebels. vader has suddenly become obsessed with tracking down luke skywalker and turning him to the dark side of the force. the rebels are attacked (in a brilliant battle sequence with huge walking machines called at ats) and our heroes take separate paths for the remainder of the film. han, leia, chewbacca and c3po flee imperial forces through space, and luke seeks jedi master yoda to be instructed in the force and become a jedi. several things about this film are superior to any other film in the star wars canon. for a start, the acting is never better than here (largely thanks to kershner). even mark hamill is good and the romantic banter between harrison ford and carrie fisher is brilliantly performed, recalling the classic hollywood screwball comedies of the 1930s and 40s ('would it help if i got out and pushed?') there are some great new characters, such as yoda (frank oz), the best puppet character in film history with the possible exception of et, and lando calrissian (billy dee williams), a double-dealing rogue from han's past. despite having very little screen time, bounty hunter boba fett (jeremy buloch), became a favourite among fans, and we even get our first glimpse of the evil emperor (played here by clive revill, not ian mcdiarmid). the planets visited are more interesting than in any of the other films. cloud city is wonderful (especially the carbon freeze chamber), dagobah is an appropriately gloomy swamp, and the hoth wastelands are spectacular. the production design is absolutely first rate. also, john williams music is at its best here, with fantastic new themes including one for yoda, a great love theme, and the stunning imperial march (or darth vader theme). needless to say, the editing, cinematography, sound and special effects are all wonderful (particularly in the asteroid chase). the witty screenplay never wastes a second and is full understated emotion, particularly in the tearful climax to han and leia's romance. is this really the end of han solo? in 1980 audiences had to wait three painful years to find out. now thankfully, we can simply pull out our vhs of return of the jedi. by the way, this one also has the best lightsabre duel in the entire saga. which brings us to the ending. the greatest thing about the empire strikes back is how the plot is propelled, by a brilliant and now legendary twist, to its downbeat conclusion. the dark ending is crucial because it creates a huge sense of uncertainty for the final film. will good really triumph over evil? this story is great because it's more complex than just good versus bad. luke not only has to overcome the evil empire but the evil in himself. it's about resisting temptation, even to the potential cost of ones life. whatever george lucas does with episode iii, nothing for me will ever top this truly magnificent film.;25 July 2003;10;['general', 'fine', 'dark', 'funny', 'dramatic', 'first', 'strict', 'elite', 'well', 'original', 'straight', 'original', 'complete', 'financial', 'creative', 'leigh', 'much', 'unmitigated', 'rebel', 'evil', 'abominable', 'hoth', 'icy', 'dead', 'same', 'co', 'pilot', 'obsessed', 'dark', 'brilliant', 'huge', 'separate', 'imperial', 'several', 'superior', 'other', 'well', 'good', 'romantic', 'classic', 'great', 'new', 'such', 'good', 'possible', 'double', 'little', 'favourite', 'first', 'evil', 'clive', 'interesting', 'other', 'wonderful', 'gloomy', 'hoth', 'spectacular', 'first', 'good', 'fantastic', 'new', 'great', 'stunning', 'imperial', 'needless', 'special', 'wonderful', 'witty', 'full', 'understated', 'tearful', 'painful', 'good', 'entire', 'great', 'brilliant', 'legendary', 'downbeat', 'dark', 'crucial', 'huge', 'final', 'great', 'complex', 'good', 'bad', 'evil', 'potential', 'magnificent'];0.1991525019098549

584;joekay;"""empire strikes back"" is a wonderful example of how much better a movie can be when it's not directed by george lucas. lucas, as witnessed by most of his movies, including the latest ""phantom menace,"" is a genius at creating astonishing imageries and forming a spectacular visual setting for the storyline to work through. however, as far as storytelling goes, irwin kershner does so much better. there are two reasons why this should be considered the best of all three; oh no wait, four, if you count ""the phantom mess,"" which i'm still bitter about for the fact that it will forever remain as a part of the star wars saga -- one drop of ink will make the entire vat of water black, and that's what happened. anyway, the first reason: the storytelling is amazing. it was appropriately paced and appropriately lengthy. it does much better development of later plot lines than any of the other movies. the romance between solo and leia, for example, is done ever so gently and craftily. luke is finally acting like a decent actor, as his character goes through major transformation from a reckless, brash jedi wannabe to a man whose identity was completely turned upside down. and what about darth vader, the greatest villain in cinematic history? you see him here more as a guile, manipulative, tactical, and extremely intelligent character than episode iv, where he was much more machinelike and brute. and to me, the ending of this movie had so much more drama than the other two; oh, i mean three, i guess (grr...). one of the most captivating, significant, and shocking lines in movie history, ""luke, i am your father!"" still sends shivers and jolt through my body. this is where everything is revealed, and all of the questions presented implicitly in the first star wars are answered. second, this was simply the most difficult one to make, and you have to give due credit to writers, directors, and produces for that (yes, that includes lucas). this transition is done ever so perfectly, and that is why i consider this movie a notch better than all others. well, that is, if you don't by the fact that it is flat-out the best movie anyway. if you have not seen any star wars movies yet. start watching from episode iv, not i! it will make more sense to do so. oh, by the way, here's how i rank the star wars movies. star wars: ***1/2; empire strikes back: ****; return of the jedi: ***; (and yeah yeah, the phantom menace: **) i'm just praying episode ii is better than the previous!";21 August 2000;10;['wonderful', 'well', 'most', 'late', 'phantom', 'astonishing', 'spectacular', 'visual', 'well', 'good', 'phantom', 'bitter', 'entire', 'black', 'first', 'amazing', 'lengthy', 'well', 'later', 'other', 'decent', 'major', 'reckless', 'brash', 'great', 'cinematic', 'more', 'manipulative', 'tactical', 'intelligent', 'more', 'more', 'other', 'captivating', 'significant', 'shocking', 'first', 'difficult', 'due', 'well', 'flat', 'good', 'more', 'phantom', 'well', 'previous'];0.2050245098039215

586;mt7176;in 1977 when star wars came out it was the biggest thing to happen to movies in a very long time. star wars was a science fiction film that focused on escapism rather than scientific lore that usually weighs down other sci-fi films. instead of explaining everything through the actors dialogue lucas just showed us with sophisticated direction, set designs, and special effects. still if it was not for empires strikes back the star wars saga would not have achieved the level of pop culture status that it now enjoys, for if it was star wars that introduced us to the worlds and the main characters of the original trilogy it was empire strikes back that gave us the entire theme of star wars saga. it clearly showed us the struggles of the good and power of the evil. the empire is just not a government body to be despised but to be feared as well. the empire is a collected evil who iss everywhere. the story also reveals much more in terms of who luke actually is, of his gifts, and how he could be a candidate for either good or evil. as well it hints at the connection between luke and leia and of course reveals the luke and vader connection. plus this film through color and music and the interweaving of character development and action sequences swings us a way from the space opera frivolity of the first film and sends us through a mystical fantasy both dark and beautiful, dangerous and brilliant. last of all the writing in the film elevated the saga in a way that no other star wars film has been able to do. leigh bracket and lawrence kasdan worked wonders in their screenplay. instead of soaking some serious and more romantic moments with dialogue that is heavy worded we get moments that are mixed with clever one liners and situations that forces han and leia to fall in love. i wish i could say the same about attack of the clones love story, which was fine but failed to capture that sort of chemistry. in short this films is a masterpiece and one that has not been matched. it has not been matched in memorable characters, plot revelations, atmosphere, or music. although few films have come very close they all still fall short of this one fantasy.;21 January 2003;10;['big', 'long', 'scientific', 'other', 'sophisticated', 'special', 'main', 'original', 'entire', 'good', 'collected', 'more', 'good', 'evil', 'first', 'mystical', 'dark', 'beautiful', 'dangerous', 'brilliant', 'last', 'other', 'able', 'leigh', 'serious', 'romantic', 'heavy', 'clever', 'same', 'fine', 'short', 'memorable', 'few'];0.1413382594417077

600;tyrantlizardthad;empire strikes back is highly regarded as a masterpiece and one of the best sequels ever made, and it deserves all of the praise it gets. after all this time, it's still one of the best star wars movies to date and the best of the original trilogy. the opening hoth sequence is extremely tense, dramatic, well-paced, and explosive. the cold environment works as a great way to show how much darker and grim this film is going to be. luke's training with yoda on dagobah is awe-inspiring and this subplot has a ton of character development. we learn much more about the force and what it truly means to be a jedi, luke's character flaws are explored, and we get more hints and obi-wan and vader's past. the empire chasing the millennium falcon is intense and suspenseful. darth vader's fearsome presence and brutal executions give chills. lando's betrayal and han being frozen in carbonite is impactful. vader and luke's lightsaber duel is one of the finest, most brutal and nail-biting fights in all of star wars, and vader's reveal that he is luke's father is powerful. the entire movie is an immensely thrilling and entertaining ride. all of the performances are top notch, and so is the character development and dialogue. we get to see luke learning how to become a jedi and a deep exploration of his character flaws, han and leia fall in love (while han continues to be his awesome witty self), leia opens herself up to relationships, and vader gets a lot more screentime in this one. we see more of how ruthless, passionate, hateful, terrifying, and selfish he is, all of which make him such a great sith, but also a small bit of his softer side at the end when he speaks with luke through the force, foreshadowing his change in return of the jedi. we are also introduced to yoda, who is an inspiring and unique mentor figure, and the puppet used to portray him has aged quite well in it's execution. speaking of which, like the entire original trilogy, the special effects are stunning and groundbreaking, with lots of astounding practical sets, puppets, animatronics and miniatures and gorgeous green screen and matte shots (though in terms of the latter two, these haven't aged the best, but they were top notch for their time). and finally, john williams continues to outdo himself with the amazing, exhilarating musical score. this movie introduced the imperial march, perhaps the best villain theme in cinema history. a definite masterpiece all around.;25 August 2021;10;['good', 'good', 'good', 'original', 'hoth', 'tense', 'dramatic', 'explosive', 'cold', 'great', 'much', 'dark', 'more', 'more', 'intense', 'suspenseful', 'fearsome', 'brutal', 'impactful', 'fine', 'brutal', 'star', 'powerful', 'entire', 'thrilling', 'entertaining', 'top', 'notch', 'deep', 'awesome', 'witty', 'more', 'more', 'ruthless', 'passionate', 'hateful', 'terrifying', 'selfish', 'great', 'small', 'soft', 'inspiring', 'unique', 'entire', 'original', 'special', 'stunning', 'groundbreaking', 'astounding', 'practical', 'gorgeous', 'green', 'latter', 'good', 'top', 'amazing', 'musical', 'imperial', 'good', 'definite'];0.1935131195335276

606;I_am_Jacks_Revenge;"i think when this came out in 1980, no one saw the twist at the end coming. if you don't know the twist because you have been blocked from or chose to block the star wars saga, you are missing out. i don't know a lot of people who don't know how it ends. i will tell the story as best as i can since i don't have it at home (it's sad, i know): we begin at a very cold planet where luke goes out and is missing. many people want to give up searching for him. meanwhile, luke gets kidnapped by the 1980's version of an alien abominable snowman. after escaping the monster and killing it (i think), luke goes out into the blizzard and sees obi-wan's spirit in the distance, telling him to go to yoda on the planet dagobah, and continue training. han solo finds him, about to freeze to death, and rescues him. back at the base, they treat him and he makes a full recovery. later on in the movie, the evil guys come to the planet and attack using those at-at walkers. the big battle begins and of course, the good guys win. what did you expect? on dagobah, a little green man meets with luke and r2d2. he is revealed to be yoda. what i find cool is that frank oz has done the voice of yoda for all of the star wars movies. you can tell that it's him in the return of the jedi because when he says ""when 900 years old you reach, looking good you will not be"" he sounds like fozzie from the muppets. luke starts his training. skipping a bit, the gang meets lando calrissian, the former owner of the millennium falcon. they all try to evade the empire, but they realized that they've been tricked by lando, who says that he had to join the bad guys to keep them from invading the city they're in. luke is lured by his friends to the empire and darth vader. getting close to the intense part of the movie, they take luke, leia, and han to a new place. han gets frozen in carbonite. you'll see him like this in the next movie. when everyone leaves except for luke and darth vader, the battle of all battles commences. as their fight ensues, they reach an area where if you fall, that is almost certainly your doom. darth traps luke and chops his lightsaber along with his right arm and they both fall down. luke tells darth that he killed his father. and then, the big twist............ are you ready? here it is. after luke says that here is what darth says: ""no, luke. i am your father."" in my opinion, best twist they made back then. naturally, luke denies this. darth offers luke to join the dark side, but instead, like any crazy fool, he jumps. he calls to leia, using the force (foreshadowing? maybe...) and he gets rescued. they look for han, and the movie ends. how was that? make your pick on which of the original ones was the best. i don't care, really. george lucas is awesome. the movies are awesome. watch and you won't be disappointed.";16 November 2007;10;['sad', 'cold', 'many', 'alien', 'abominable', 'about', 'full', 'evil', 'big', 'good', 'little', 'green', 'cool', 'frank', 'old', 'good', 'former', 'bad', 'intense', 'new', 'next', 'right', 'big', 'ready', 'good', 'dark', 'crazy', 'original', 'good', 'awesome', 'awesome'];0.1110563543599258
607;ztruk2001;how do you follow up the most successful science fiction/fantasy film of all time? make a sequel that's bigger and better than the original. not only is the empire strikes back better than a new hope, but it completely blows it out of the water. the first star wars film started it all and paved the way for the second installment, but essentially it was a fairly bland and simple space adventure with great special effects. return of the jedi, which followed the empire strikes back, was also a weaker film. empire is clearly the best film of the original trilogy. so much in fact it transcends the other films and it's easy to appreciate the film out of the context of the star wars universe. while the first film was too cartoonish and the third too unbalance, the second hit exactly the right note. the story picks up several years after a new hope. the death star is destroyed and the rebels are hiding at their base on the ice planet of hoth. the empire is hot on their trail with a zealous darth vader combing the galaxy in search of them. from the very start of the movie it's one big giant chase. unlike the other two films, empire gets the big battle out of the way in the beginning so that it can slowly build down until the climax. it's a reversal of the typical adventure film arc and it works perfectly. in empire all of the characters are fleshed out and become as real people, whereas in a new hope they just served the storyline. there's the classic greek mythology pathos going on with the battle between good and evil. there are also many shades of gray in the film, as the characters drift in out and of good and evil, and face difficult decisions. out of the entire trilogy the middle film also features the most impressive and elaborate sets. over the course of two hours we are taken into four different worlds, the ice planet hoth, the swamp world of dagobah, an asteroid field in space, and cloud city. all four locales are entirely impressive. the lighting is another key factor in the film's vibrant look. lighting becomes the most flamboyant towards the end of the film during the dusk looking scenes at cloud city. finally something must be said of the epic lightsaber duel between luke and vader that makes up the film's climax. it's the best duel in any of the films. storywise there's a lot on the line, but it's choreographed and filmed so well it wouldn't matter how it ties into the story. it's the dirtiest and grungiest of all the duels. it's nice to actually see the physical effects of fighting for a change. in the other films the characters are pretty much stoic but here we get to see luke grow out of breath, tire, bleed, and have his cloths torn. he stumbles around, expresses emotion, and even gets a few nice on-uppers on vader when he's underestimated. ultimately it's a wonderful way to finish a great film. also i should mention the good performances from billy dee williams, carrie fisher, and harrison ford.;9 April 2005;10;['successful', 'big', 'well', 'original', 'new', 'first', 'second', 'bland', 'simple', 'great', 'special', 'weak', 'good', 'original', 'other', 'easy', 'first', 'cartoonish', 'third', 'second', 'right', 'several', 'new', 'hot', 'zealous', 'very', 'big', 'giant', 'other', 'big', 'typical', 'real', 'new', 'classic', 'good', 'many', 'gray', 'good', 'evil', 'difficult', 'entire', 'middle', 'impressive', 'elaborate', 'different', 'swamp', 'impressive', 'key', 'vibrant', 'flamboyant', 'epic', 'good', 'dirty', 'nice', 'physical', 'other', 'stoic', 'few', 'nice', 'wonderful', 'great', 'good'];0.2104427019521359
608;charleswjoke;i am a star wars fan since i was a kid and it's very hard to watch this film critically after all these years. what i was wondering throughout this viewing is why does this movie work as well as it does. it really shouldn't... the dialogue and acting is average, the special effects aren't picture perfect, the plot is as old as plots come yet i felt compelled to watch and be entertained. i was enthralled with this movie once again. perhaps, its the simple cinematography that doesn't really try to do anything special but just works, maybe its the simple hero story of growth and learning, maybe its the chance to live in this entertaining and strange world where meeting a green little creature can change the tide of the film. this movie instills a sense of hope to the viewer. we somehow know everything will be ok, the heroes will live another day, which is really strange as the plot of this star wars is all about the failures of the heroes, the failure of luke, the failure of the rebels... but the movie leaves a slight glimmer of hope that makes all the difference. this film hearkens back to a simpler time, where films were simple and enjoyable and people liked that with a childish sense of naivety, but hey, we should all be children once in a while.;16 November 2015;8;['hard', 'average', 'special', 'perfect', 'old', 'simple', 'special', 'simple', 'entertaining', 'strange', 'green', 'little', 'ok', 'strange', 'slight', 'simple', 'simple', 'enjoyable', 'childish'];0.1062343358395989

610;JamesHunt18;"first of all, this is not just my all-time favourite sequel but my all-time favourite film. it thoroughly deserves that title because i consider it nothing less than a masterpiece. it takes everything great about the original and simply improves on it, a task many would've seemed to be impossible. with irvin kershner taking the reigns of director, from george lucas, the film goes into a not necessarily darker tone but more mature. with a new hope being a more light-hearted, but no less iconic, space opera this change puts more focus on the emotions of the characters we have met and, in turn, raises the stakes for heroes, especially luke who must now face his foe. harrison ford, carrie fisher and mark hamill maintain the effortless portrayal of their respective characters from the first film. the introduction of billy dee williams as lando is simply brilliant as he too fully embodies his role and bounces off harrison ford's han solo. another introduction is that of yoda (operated by frank oz) that adds to the mystery of 'the jedi' and 'the force' as this character is just overloaded with so much wisdom and is used so well to build luke's character throughout the film. 'empire' contains possibly one of the most memorable line's in of all cinema; those who have seen this know exactly what i mean. however, it far from relies on this moment as there are a countless number of iconic moments and dialogue. the visual effects of the 1977 release of star wars may have been ground-breaking but this film shows how far the industry has come in 3 years. whether this be the representation of cloud city, the walker assault or even as simple as shots of the falcon flying. these may seem easy enough to manufacture in 2020 but must have been incredible to see in 1980. i am simply gutted i wasn't able to experience that wonder myself. john williams again excels at what he does. he is extra-ordinarily consistent in his quality, and not just in this franchise. he truly sends these films into the history books and is one of the many reasons star wars, empire especially, is still so loved today. empire strikes back is truly the heart of this trilogy and is unquestionable in its quality. the story is unforgettable and the film-making is sublime. i only have two words for those involved in its production: thank you!";22 July 2020;10;['favourite', 'favourite', 'less', 'great', 'original', 'many', 'impossible', 'dark', 'mature', 'new', 'hearted', 'iconic', 'more', 'respective', 'first', 'brilliant', 'much', 'memorable', 'countless', 'iconic', 'visual', 'simple', 'easy', 'incredible', 'able', 'extra', 'consistent', 'many', 'unquestionable', 'unforgettable', 'sublime'];0.2984545454545455
611;clarke-21;all, like many of you, i'm a fan of star wars. since i was born in 1977, i'm what you might call a star wars baby. at least that is what my mother told me. star wars has been a part of my life for years. times have changed, but i remember feeling like the characters in star wars were friends who i was on a journey with. a few years ago, while at dinner with friends. a cinematographer asked me what my greatest movie experience was. without a doubt, return of the jedi's opening scene, where darth vader walks down the plank... i remember the audience's ovation. the movies were fun then. like many of you, i was expecting to feel the same magic, when the last three movies were released. it didn't happen. i could be wrong, but i think the most exciting thing to happen in the star wars universe, within the last 15 years, has to be the phantom menace trailer. i remember seeing this on the internet and hearing the audience going crazy. for a split second, it was 1983 all over again. as the years have passed, i've grown attached to films with similar themes. the hero, who takes off on a journey and has a similar quest to luke. a few years ago, i sought out the writer of another favorite film, the last dragon. the writer, louis venosta revealed to me, that joseph campbell's book, a hero with a thousand faces, was an intricate part of his writing. i had never heard of campbell until this time. i would later find out, that campbell was the writer who influenced george lucas. after reading several of campbell's books and meeting with venosta, i thought about writing the sequel to the last dragon, but then realized that i needed to write my own story. as a native new yorker, and someone who could have lost his life during 9/11, i felt that a story needed to be made. a new myth. i finished writing my first book in 2008. over the last few years, i couldn't figure out how to get the story out to the people who needed and wanted to read it. like many of you, i hate all of the remakes. i was watching empire of dreams, the documentary of the star wars films and i see a comparison between the time when star wars was made and the current state of affairs in the united states today. the name of my book is masternever and the flow of death. you can download the entire book by visiting www.masternever.com i've included an entire soundtrack that accompanies the book. i hope you will download and enjoy the book. i hope you don't mind me posting here. after writing a book and several screenplays, i want to connect with people who have similar interest. the rest of the star wars babies. i'm also posting here, because imdb played a vital role in starting this journey four years ago. you can see me talking about this book, mythology and stories, but visiting this video. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbwdndwirss;29 December 2010;10;['many', 'least', 'few', 'great', 'fun', 'many', 'same', 'last', 'wrong', 'exciting', 'last', 'phantom', 'crazy', 'similar', 'similar', 'few', 'favorite', 'last', 'intricate', 'several', 'last', 'own', 'native', 'new', 'new', 'first', 'last', 'few', 'many', 'current', 'entire', 'entire', 'several', 'similar', 'vital'];0.0819602272727272

616;Lifexinxrewind;"simply put, the empire strikes back is virtually flawless, and easily my favorite film of all time. combining the epic story, iconic characters, and wonderful imagination of the original star wars trilogy with the masterful character driven direction of irvin kershner results in a breathtaking cinematic experience. it can be considered a masterpiece all on its own, and this is in large part to the superior storytelling techniques on display. empire builds on the excellent original film with improved dialog that is consistently witty, and the character development is superb. as with all star wars films, the special effects are impressive and provide new exciting worlds to explore. the screenplay deserves credit for giving meaning to the entire trilogy, especially the scenes with yoda, which get surprisingly deep in the psychological sense. this may also be the finest score john williams has ever composed among a career full of them. in fact, this is fittingly one of the greatest scores composed for a motion picture. every scene is done perfectly, with memorable musical cues for every character, and gives us such iconic themes as ""the imperial march"" and the poignant love theme that beautifully closes the film. there is not a scene in empire that doesn't serve its purpose effectively. the screenplay is one of the very best, balancing so much character driven story with a thrilling plot and one of the best twist endings ever. every major character benefits from a strong dramatic story arc. the film is also remarkably effective at achieving a perfect balance of action, humor, tension, and romance. often times credited with being almost too dark when compared to the other installments, empire actually stands out as the star wars movie with the most genuine wit and humor. it features lots of comic relief, provided by not only the side characters but also with the ever engaging banter between han solo and princess leia, which adds a level of believability to the romantic subplot. the scenes between han and leia are some of the best ever captured in a major blockbuster such as this. harrison ford completely cements han solo as one of the coolest movie characters of all time in this film. this episode makes the most out of being the middle act in the trilogy by jumping almost immediately into an exciting battle with the attack on hoth, and also features plenty of other action, such as the asteroid field chase (both again benefiting from the excellent score). the action on cloud city also serves as being refreshingly suspenseful in its simplicity. and as good as the earlier scenes are, the light saber duel between dath vader, the greatest movie villain of all time, and luke skywalker is a masterpiece in character driven action. so much is going on between the lines in empire it would be impossible to fully cover it. suffice to say that there is more accomplished in these scenes emotionally than in anything seen in the entire prequel trilogy. the ending of the film is, again, beautifully done, with its cliffhanger nature feeling strangely resolved and poetic. the spectacle of incredible effects, characters, and story all comes together in one incredible package, and makes the empire strikes back one of the finest achievements in film history.";5 April 2010;10;['flawless', 'favorite', 'epic', 'iconic', 'wonderful', 'original', 'masterful', 'breathtaking', 'cinematic', 'own', 'large', 'superior', 'storytelling', 'excellent', 'original', 'improved', 'witty', 'superb', 'special', 'impressive', 'new', 'exciting', 'entire', 'deep', 'psychological', 'fine', 'full', 'great', 'memorable', 'musical', 'such', 'iconic', 'imperial', 'poignant', 'good', 'much', 'good', 'twist', 'major', 'strong', 'dramatic', 'effective', 'perfect', 'dark', 'other', 'genuine', 'comic', 'engaging', 'romantic', 'good', 'major', 'such', 'cool', 'middle', 'exciting', 'other', 'such', 'excellent', 'suspenseful', 'good', 'early', 'light', 'great', 'much', 'impossible', 'accomplished', 'entire', 'prequel', 'poetic', 'incredible', 'incredible', 'fine'];0.3765301365301365

629;eye eye;"the empire strikes back is the best movie of all time. star wars (a new hope) and return of the jedi are both amazing but they don't match up to this masterpiece. first of all, the empire strikes back has the best acting of any of the three. harrison ford is perfect for the role of han solo and creates most of the character atmosphere. mark hamill, and carrie fisher also give out solid performances as their characters change through out the entire movie. i also believe that darth vader's part in this one is a bit bigger then the other two. the second best thing in this landmark for movie making is the eye popping special effects. you get to see land battles, ships flying through asteroid belts, and much, much more.(the fighting scene on the planet hoth at the beginning is the best!) even the sound in this film is outstanding! did i mention how good the sound track is? because it was great, especially the empire tune, which will easily get stuck in your head! if i wanted to i could go on and on and on, so i'm only going to say this once; if you see one movie in you entire life, this is the one! if you only see three movies in your entire life, make it the star wars trilogy!!!! 10 out of 10";21 April 1999;10;['good', 'new', 'amazing', 'good', 'perfect', 'most', 'solid', 'entire', 'big', 'other', 'second', 'good', 'special', 'much', 'good', 'outstanding', 'good', 'sound', 'great', 'entire', 'entire'];0.3834253246753247

638;Ithaqua1987;an excellent sequel to star wars, this is easily the darkest and most serious out of all the star wars films, at least until revenge of the sith comes out. this movie benefits from the introduction of yoda, a diminutive yet wise jedi master who helps luke prepare for his showdown with darth vader. it also introduces lando calrissian, han's old gambling and smuggling buddy played very well by billy dee williams. empire is more character driven than the original and relies more on comic relief to help lighten the mood, but it doesn't go overboard with the humor. the story is more refined and the acting is better as well. despite all of this i can't really say that i enjoyed empire more than the original. the original star wars has a certain charm to it that none of the sequels (or prequels) have captured. i'd say that it is at least on par with the original though and is a fitting follow up in what is probably the greatest series of movies in the history of cinema.;17 December 2004;9;['excellent', 'dark', 'serious', 'least', 'wise', 'old', 'more', 'original', 'comic', 'refined', 'well', 'original', 'original', 'certain', 'least', 'original', 'fitting', 'great'];0.2800595238095238
639;ashdoginc;this review is for the 1980 theatrical release and not the 1997 and later specialized editions. this movie really did push movie making when it was released in 1980. the special effects, performances and story are breath taking. it doesn't look too much to existing myths for inspiration but rather in creating its own lore. it takes the force, the darkside, the lightside, the jedi and explores them and expands on them to make a more deeper film. yet it still maintains a sense of humor. the film has aged remarkably well, it is a beautiful movie from start to finish. while the original star wars may have revolutionized cinema, the empire strikes back perfected it. it proved that pop culture can be every bit as good as any drama or period piece. i wouldn't hesitate to put it as a contender as the greatest movie ever made. that is not a guarantee everyone will like it, but it deserves everyones respect.;1 February 2021;9;['theatrical', 'specialized', 'special', 'much', 'own', 'deep', 'beautiful', 'original', 'good', 'great'];0.4602678571428571

641;emeraldreprobates;the second installment of the original star wars trilogy benefits from coming from a time when there were very few films that could be called that. if it was made and released now it would be lost in a sea of big budget battles of good and evil aimed at making big money for a week or two and then disappearing. thankfully it's from a time when it became one of the biggest films of the year or even the decade and it went on to inspire what the film industry is today. without star wars and its army of nerds leading the way, there is no marvel attempt to take over films and no comic-con and you would be looking at a very different world. this film has great moment and legendary quotes or misquotes and of course it has its flaws but what blockbuster doesn't and in the end it is a star wars film so it's worth watching. featured on episode 69 of the emerald reprobates podcast.;3 September 2015;7;['second', 'original', 'few', 'big', 'good', 'big', 'big', 'marvel', 'comic', 'different', 'great', 'legendary', 'worth'];0.26875
642;richardcoppage;the empire strikes back is the best star wars film ever. it beats out all of them. the only reason that i pick empire is because it is so dark. until esipode 3, empire was the darkest of all the star wars films. empire has it's own style, darth vader is badder than ever and luke learns that vader is his father. out of all the people in space, why does it have to be this guy? it has all the great music that every star wars film has, and it also has some love in it too. yes, yes han solo and princess lei fall in love. who would have thunk it? and another thing that adds to this great film....the good guys lose! yes! they lose. vader is the king of the hill when the movie is over, han solo is frozen, luke has only one hand, and lei...well nothing happens to her. empire is the sw film you need to see.;3 December 2005;9;['good', 'only', 'dark', 'dark', 'own', 'badder', 'luke', 'great', 'great', 'good'];0.4125
643;LigerTamer100;forty years ago, in a galaxy far away. a sequel of the movie that changed cinema forever was made, and it sure as heck didn't failed on anyone. every top best sequels i see always has empire strikes back on the number one spot, and there's a reason why. it took many dark turns that nobody at the time saw coming, it didn't use the same elements that the previous movie used and it felt like we were exploring the galaxy a lot more than we did in the last film. if i have to pick where to put this on my star wars rank list, it'd be on the top three, just not sure where in the three spots. the romance part of the film works really well with leia and han. sure, the age gap between carrie and harrison was a bit awkward, but they somehow made it work great for the franchise and became one of the best couples ever. the reveal of vader being the father wasn't a surprise to me when i first watched it, because i started watching the franchise with the prequels first in 2006 and knew what was happening. and i know this is going to cause a debate, but i think yoda is a muppet. it's not because of frank oz performing him, but it's because he feels like one to me. i feel like the jim henson company helped a little bit making him and there was an episode of muppet show where luke, chewie, r2 and 3po was in and to me, that was a deal that lucas and henson made as a fair enough collab as a team. there's even some behind the scenes pictures that jim, kermit and piggy were in. think about that for a few minutes. this is without a doubt, one of the best sequels that was ever made and will always be forever. the force has always been strong with the franchise and fandom, and will forever more.;28 December 2020;10;['sure', 'top', 'good', 'many', 'dark', 'same', 'previous', 'more', 'last', 'top', 'sure', 'awkward', 'great', 'good', 'frank', 'little', 'fair', 'enough', 'few', 'good', 'strong', 'more'];0.2966269841269842
644;brendanmcc02;"the first star wars was a film about adventure - the wishful desire and the rushing excitement of it. it provided the audiences with a sweeping cinematic experience, as they experienced the galactic adventures alongside their iconic characters: luke the hero, han the renegade, leia the princess, obi-wan the wise one, c-3p0 and rd-d2 the comedic duo. the characters were nothing more than archetypes, but this enhanced the immersive nature of the story, because the audience could see their own traits reflected in each character in a galaxy far far away... the empire strikes back is the definitive sequel to star wars because it directly confronts the original's primary theme: adventure. the original was a film about desire; to long for more - to look out on the horizon. however, empire is a film that's not about looking out, but looking in - the film has a stronger focus on the internal, rather than the external. yoda is quick to remind not only luke, but the audience, of this fact: ""all his life, as he looked away... to the future - to the horizon. never his mind on where he was - what he was doing! adventure! (scoffs) excitement! (scoffs) a jedi craves not these things. you are reckless!"" and that's what i love about empire, and that's why it's such a strong sequel - it directly confronts the prior film's ideas. the film dwells on the consequences of someone's narrow-minded pursuit of their wishful desires. luke is not only burdened with responsibility and leadership, but he will face his ultimate enemy: darth vader. but what's so compelling about the two character's conflict is not the external conflict of man vs man, but the internal battle. when luke enters the cave, he confronts his greatest fear. but his greatest fear isn't the man clad in a black cape approaching him, it's when luke sees his own face in vader's helmet. he's afraid that he'll follow vader's path, and that's the internal conflict that propels the training scenes with yoda. the duel between luke and vader is absolute perfection for many reasons: stunning cinematography, choreography and sound design. but those stylistic aspects are nothing without the internal substance. the duel is so enrapturing because of the internal, rather than the external. luke holds an incredible determination to defeat vader for many reasons: firstly, to prove that he can be triumphant over the dark side and to overcome his inner conflict. his second motivation however, is contradictory of his first: it is to kill vader as an act of vengeance for obi-wan. this is why luke chooses to try to kill vader rather than trying to help him. ironically, luke's pursuit to vengeance would ultimately lead him down a path to the dark side - a path which is he so afraid to take, and hence, why he so desperately wants to triumph over vader. this is why the ""i am your father"" moment holds so much impact: luke wanted to prove that he was different than vader - to prove that he wouldn't be seduced by the dark side. however, his greatest fear had been realised: the man he so desperately wanted to be different from, is his father; an inextricable link that he must confront. as written above, one of the greatest strengths of empire are the characters. in this sequel, the characters are no longer labels or archetypes - they only go by their own name: luke is no longer the hero, han is no longer the renegade, leia is no longer the princess; but each are luke skywalker, han solo, and leia organa. the characters evolve beyond their rigid archetypes into the icons we know and love today. han's character is shown to have surprising emotional depth, and the same can be said for leia. her mask of feistiness that she displayed in the first film is shattered in the sequel, as signs of emotional vulnerability are illuminated. furthermore, i found the two character's romance to be brilliant, not just because of the chemistry between ford and fisher, but also because it brought great humanity to a story that was already abundant in it. the empire strikes back is a phenomenal sequel, as it deals with the prior film's themes head-on: most notably, the theme of adventure. the film displays the consequences of one's wishful pursuit for adventure and tells the audience to focus not on what's out there waiting for them, but to focus on what's waiting inside for them. in addition to this, empire greatly elevates the archetypal characters into fully-fledged humans; most notably the trio of luke, han and leia. moreover, the film also dwells on some thought-provoking material, which the prior film lacked in my opinion. what stimulated me intellectually were the intense internal struggles of luke skywalker, and his consistent conflict between light and dark, good and bad. all in all, the empire strikes back is the definitive follow-up to star wars.";9 September 2020;9;['first', 'wishful', 'sweeping', 'cinematic', 'galactic', 'iconic', 'wise', 'comedic', 'more', 'immersive', 'own', 'definitive', 'original', 'primary', 'strong', 'internal', 'external', 'quick', 'reckless', 'strong', 'prior', 'narrow', 'minded', 'wishful', 'ultimate', 'compelling', 'external', 'internal', 'great', 'great', 'black', 'own', 'afraid', 'internal', 'absolute', 'many', 'stunning', 'stylistic', 'internal', 'internal', 'incredible', 'many', 'triumphant', 'dark', 'inner', 'second', 'contradictory', 'first', 'luke', 'dark', 'afraid', 'much', 'different', 'dark', 'great', 'different', 'inextricable', 'great', 'own', 'rigid', 'surprising', 'emotional', 'same', 'first', 'emotional', 'brilliant', 'great', 'abundant', 'phenomenal', 'prior', 'wishful', 'archetypal', 'prior', 'intense', 'internal', 'consistent', 'dark', 'good', 'bad', 'definitive'];0.2312841530054644
645;Celtic80;a new hope set the standard in movie storytelling and special effects. the empire strikes back blows that away. a new hope and the empire strikes back, to me, are about equal in their greatness, but for different reasons. while a new hope was great because it was the first that broke new ground, the empire strikes back is great because it broke new ground while having an almost entirely different story, mood, and flavor than it's predecessor. the acting in the empire strikes back is superior to a new hope. mark hamill definitely got better at acting, and really got into his wide-eyed, impatient, trying to become a jedi character. harrison ford put more depth into han solo, making him more complex than just a shady smuggler. carrie fisher gave a new dimension to princess leia by showing her attraction to han solo, and the way she shows it. and of course, david prowse/james e. jones as darth vader, giving one of the most earth shattering revelations in a motion picture saga. anthony daniels (who i forgot in my review of a new hope) gives more comic relief to the movie with c-3po. an interesting new addition is billy dee williams as lando calrissan. as solo gets more complex, we were given a new character who's shady background made for a shaky alliance with the other characters. also, who could forget frank oz puppeting yoda, who has almost become a modern philosopher for our time. the story and special effects of empire blow away what a new hope had already created as top notch. the models are much more detailed a realistic and they serve the story even more. i can remember as a kid being scared of the imperial probe droid, which reminded me of a spider for some reason. the story is better with a darker mood. empire is really the heart of the story, going further into the mysteries of the force and character development and backgrounds. there is a sense of dread as darth vader talks to the emperor, who is really orchestrating all of these events. also, darth vader's revelation at the end is shocking if you have never seen the movie before. the empire strikes back relied less on a large action scene and instead has many little ones with a great lightsaber duel at the end (although it is nothing compared to the lightsaber duel in the phantom menace). empire adds on to the modern mythology that a new hope started and 'is' the best sequel ever. i personally think it is the best out of all of the star wars movies, although it is hard to choose. go see it. ***** stars (out of *****).;10 August 1999;10;['new', 'special', 'new', 'equal', 'different', 'new', 'great', 'first', 'new', 'great', 'new', 'different', 'superior', 'new', 'well', 'wide', 'eyed', 'impatient', 'more', 'complex', 'shady', 'new', 'most', 'new', 'more', 'comic', 'interesting', 'new', 'complex', 'new', 'shady', 'shaky', 'other', 'frank', 'modern', 'special', 'new', 'top', 'detailed', 'realistic', 'scared', 'imperial', 'well', 'dark', 'shocking', 'large', 'many', 'little', 'great', 'phantom', 'modern', 'new', 'good', 'good', 'hard'];0.1675854527417027

647;Tim Gomersall;"one spoiler for the phantom menace here, folks; same one as on the back of the soundtrack, but less precise. first, i love star wars and i think the empire strikes back is a good film. it just absolutely isn't the best. let me tell you why. everyone i speak to on this subject (and i try not to do it too often) invariably plays the 'dark' card in the discussion. it's the best one because it's so daaaaark, man. leave dark for the blade runners and the aliens; it's so much more at home with them. granted, i think it's particularly effective when a previously untouchable character like han solo winds up getting tortured and you hear his screams. that bit is good. but... it's star wars. darkness is all well and good but it's undone when you know there's another film coming along in which in the opening forty minutes -han will be unfrozen -jabba/boba will be killed -lando will be a fully fledged friend again. empire is a very elaborate set up for a scenario which is undone, as we all know it will be, in the opening scene of the next movie. and when you think about it, it's not really all that dark anyway. empire is the only one of the four films currently made, which doesn't have a major character die in it. think about that one. and at the end, luke's recovered and they're basically ready to kick some empirical butt. it's faintly optimistic. dark? ridley scott need not feel threatened. so there you go. this movie is good. very entertaining (even if some of the yoda bits put me to sleep). but at the end of the day. i think it's atmosphere sticks out like a sore thumb. i hope the 'darkness' in store for episode iii is handled with a bit more maturity, and laced with a bit more authenticity.";26 July 1999;7;['phantom', 'same', 'precise', 'good', 'good', 'dark', 'good', 'more', 'effective', 'untouchable', 'good', 'good', 'undone', 'unfrozen', 'elaborate', 'opening', 'next', 'dark', 'only', 'major', 'ready', 'empirical', 'optimistic', 'dark', 'good', 'entertaining', 'sore', 'more', 'more'];0.3460227272727272

651;joetufano719;"when this movie came out in 1980, people were unsure of how it can live up to the hype due to the success of the previous film. but it did deliver! this movie went to even darker places this time around, and the characters are left at the lowest point by the end of the film. great action sequences, great acting and above all the biggest twist of all time! story: the rebels have built a new base of operations called echo base on the ice planet hoth after the empire chased them off yavin iv in response to the death star being destroyed. it's not long before the empire discovers their new hideout and force the rebels once again to flee from the invasion of imperial at-at walkers. princess leia, han solo, chewbacca and c-3po escape in the millennium falcon, but are later captured by darth vader on cloud city with han solo being frozen in carbonite and handed over to boba fett who takes him back to jabba the hutt. meanwhile, luke skywalker travels to the swamp planet dagobah to continue his jedi training but this time from former jedi master yoda. during his training, he sees visions of leia, han and chewbacca being kidnapped by vader and sets out to cloud cit to rescue them, only get into a confrontation with darth vader where he discovers the most shocking secret about vader. everything in this film is close to perfect as you can get: the battle of hoth is one of my favorite movie battle scenes ever, and the music once again makes it awesome. the asteroid field pursuit is entertaining as hell, and the light saber fight between luke and darth vader... it's basically indescribable. the acting once again is fantastic with mark hamill once again giving another solid performance as a young impatient luke skywalker who fails every task given to him by yoda, harrison ford once again owning the role of han solo and his interactions with princess leia (carrie fisher) make for some really entertaining dialogue. i also like seeing how their relationship actually grows from love/hate to a love relationship, especially since han grows throughout the trilogy. billy dee williams as lando brings his own brand of charm to brighten the mood up until he is forced to betray han, but redeems himself by turning against the empire and helping leia attempt to save han. as for yoda, he is so awesome in this one! frank oz's puppetry is so terrific that it's better than anything cgi can do today (not that i despise cgi). i love the scenes where he's training luke on dagobah, especially the part where he goes ""not this crude matter!"" darth vader is more evil than he was in the first one. he's killing lieutenants left and right that it makes me go, ""i'll do whatever you want, just please don't choke me!"" as for the big twist where he says ""i am your father"" to luke, it still gets me every time. i can't remember the first time i heard him say that line because i was like 5 or 6 years old when i first watched ""empire"" but when he says it and you hear that music playing in the background and the look on luke's face... you still feel that shock that luke feels. it goes without saying that this is not only the best star wars movie ever, this is one of the best movies ever made. as for sequels surpassing the predecessor, for me it's right up there with ""the godfather part 2"", ""the dark knight"", ""spider-man 2"" and ""t2 - judgement day"". even with the foul taste that a lot of people have in their mouths from the prequel trilogy, they need to watch this again to be reminded that george lucas gave us a great saga. final grade: a+";12 November 2012;10;['unsure', 'previous', 'dark', 'low', 'great', 'great', 'big', 'new', 'new', 'imperial', 'swamp', 'jedi', 'former', 'shocking', 'close', 'favorite', 'awesome', 'entertaining', 'light', 'indescribable', 'fantastic', 'solid', 'young', 'impatient', 'entertaining', 'own', 'awesome', 'terrific', 'well', 'crude', 'evil', 'first', 'right', 'big', 'first', 'old', 'good', 'good', 'dark', 'foul', 'prequel', 'great', 'final'];0.1938757321110261

653;thediggens;"there's a reason that sequels of a certain breed are complimented as going the ""empire strikes back"" route. often described as 'bigger, better and darker', it's certainly an appropriate description of empire. it succeeds by taking the most successful elements of a new hope and minimising its weaknesses, while expanding the world. the main cast of episode iv returns for empire, with the major additions being billy dee williams as lando and frank oz providing the voice and charming puppeteer work for yoda. wisely, lucas handed over the direction to irvin kershner, who takes up the helm admirably, and lawrence kasdan tightens up the screenplay. the latter especially improves the dialogue immensely. regardless, its a slick production at its finest, with the effects, both cgi and practical, improving as well- the puppet-work being a standout for yoda's simple yet delightful presence. empire's narrative suffers typically from middle-film syndrome, serving primarily as continuation and set up. as such, it lacks a coherent beginning and the cathartic climax of the finale. but in doing so, it skips lengthy exposition and avoids the responsibility of tying up the loose ends. as such, it gets to indulge in its traits. part of empire's success is how it jumps from set piece to set piece with nary a quiet moment. from hoth, through the asteroid field, to the finale in the clouds, it rarely lets up. and the few quiet moments either ratchet up the tension (the cloud city), or succeed in intriguing world building (yoda on dagobah). what is essentially a glorified training montage works through the interaction between luke and yoda and excellent atmospheric cinematography. what is often forgotten, simply from cultural osmosis, is that empire contains a twist ending. its such common knowledge that its sometimes forgotten that it even is a twist ending. nevertheless, it's a sucker-punch that still has a kick even without the shock. empire does so very little wrong. the characters are memorable, the set pieces are iconic. there's a strong argument for the luke-vader duel being the finest fight scene in the entire saga. while it lacks the extravagant stunt choreography of the prequels, the fight has a rawness to it that later flamboyant fights fail to match. and the emotional tension between the characters makes one really interested. it's often said to be the most morally ambiguous film, as part of its 'darker' theme. it is likely true, and certainly touches upon these issues. but to say this is only to bring attention to how idealistic star wars as a whole is- a betrayal is almost instantly redeemed, and the importance of friendship is at the fore. and it benefits from being able to set up conflicts without having to solve them. certainly, it's only real flaw is its middle-child issues. it doesn't plod, but it's still merely placing pieces in position. chekov's guns are cocked. but damn if it isn't a blast while it does it.";17 July 2014;9;['certain', 'big', 'well', 'dark', 'appropriate', 'successful', 'new', 'main', 'major', 'frank', 'charming', 'slick', 'fine', 'practical', 'simple', 'delightful', 'middle', 'such', 'coherent', 'cathartic', 'lengthy', 'loose', 'such', 'quiet', 'few', 'quiet', 'intriguing', 'glorified', 'excellent', 'atmospheric', 'cultural', 'such', 'common', 'little', 'wrong', 'memorable', 'set', 'iconic', 'strong', 'fine', 'entire', 'extravagant', 'later', 'flamboyant', 'emotional', 'interested', 'ambiguous', 'dark', 'true', 'idealistic', 'able', 'real', 'middle'];0.1702941367575513

658;notevenwordshere;"my personal favorite of the original star wars trilogy -- in fact, it's my favorite among all six films -- the empire strikes back is one of those near-mythological sequels to best the original. this is all the more remarkable because it is the sequel to star wars: a new hope, a classic in its own right. a while ago, i wrote a review for the lord of the rings: the two towers in which i described that movie as suffering from a fault that is common in sequels, a flaw i labeled as ""the meandering middle."" the empire strikes back never suffers from this. i suspect the reason why is because of the sharp writing of empire. lawrence kasdan (writer/director of another classic, body heat) had impressed george lucas with a draft of raiders of the lost ark and was thus brought on to complete a final draft after leigh brackett's death. kasdan's work is most evident in the scenes on dagobah between yoda and luke. in a new hope, the script was plot-driven; empire is character-driven and dark without ever being bleak. the story opens on the frozen planet of hoth, where the rebels are hiding from darth vader and the imperial starfleet. when found, a skirmish ensues, but this is only the catapult into the main plot: han and leia's flee from darth vader; luke's training under yoda; and the eventual union of these two stories. irvin kershner's direction is more ambiguous than lucas'. gone is the ""aw, shucks"" attitude of mark hamill, and carrie fisher is given a strong, mature role this time in place of her previously brash leia. to lucas' credit, this feels as much like the evolution of the characters as it does like improved writing and direction. one special note i want to make is john williams' score. while it is arguable that the whole trilogy is the greatest scored film or film series ever, it is in empire that williams perfects that sublime and terrifying leitmotif for darth vader. while the main score of a new hope was the one that won the oscar, it is ""the imperial march"" that is more widely-recognized today. all told, the empire strikes back is more than just a worthy follow-up to a new hope. it surpasses it, building greatly on theme by adding a truly creepy underpinning of emotion and enlightening us to the chilling person of darth vader. it is easily one of the best films ever made.";22 November 2008;10;['personal', 'original', 'favorite', 'mythological', 'good', 'original', 'remarkable', 'new', 'own', 'common', 'sharp', 'final', 'evident', 'new', 'dark', 'bleak', 'frozen', 'imperial', 'skirmish', 'main', 'eventual', 'ambiguous', 'lucas', 'strong', 'mature', 'brash', 'much', 'special', 'arguable', 'whole', 'great', 'sublime', 'terrifying', 'main', 'new', 'imperial', 'more', 'worthy', 'new', 'creepy', 'chilling', 'good'];0.1315354000837871

661;Cinemagoer77;in a new hope, the wizard behind the scenes capable of using special effects tricks on a lower budget to create a mythological world from his mind was a suspected genius. well, empire confirms that lucas wasn't a one trick pony and confirms he is a genius in the cinematic world through vision and special effects. this time with empire we get to see more of the rich galaxy from lucas's mind and a better emotional tone than the first film which i felt was too lacking considering the genocidal actions of the imperial forces. while some people defend the lack of better emotional reactions in a new hope i argue that emotional reactions validate cinematic hardships. well, in a new hope, luke had begun to develop a bond (he wanted to be a jedi like his father) or tie to his father who had fallen but he doesn't know the revelation ahead of him. obi wan the only person to truly help luke understand who he is and where he comes from has died but his tie to luke is still there helping him early before han rescues him. we begin to see more of what the force is and hans character development too in the rescue. the musical score also adds to the films tone which is something the first film didn't have enough of..i know for some the beautiful music as luke looks toward the sunset was enough in a new hope but since the emotion was off everywhere else i thought a musical score could have helped out or even a pensive stare later lol in empire strikes back we have the dreaded empire theme preceding vaders 1st appearance in the film. iconic music!. before luke uses the force in the beginning we hear soft music that precedes lukes force use in a life or death situation.its actually emotional..we begin to see the force is about feeling. later on yoda hints to young luke of the force, all of it and how scary it can get. force users can succumb to darkness. vader was once a decent person. yoda tells luke you will..you will be.. (afraid)..yoda warns naive luke basically to help him on his journey because the road ahead is extremely arduous, physically and emotionally. every force user faces fear..yoda trains luke as much as possible given the time..luke knows his friends are in danger yet despite all warning luke chooses his friends over yodas and obi wans warning. luke is actually seen as reckless but imo he is facing fear and runs to it actually. i can go on and on how empire strikes back is a fantasy masterpiece in space..everything has been said about this film and why it is historic. there are cinematic moments the world will never see or hear again. period. yes the plot isn't perfect, but it is how the story was told..even better than the first film mind you fantasy films are difficult to pull off..the only fantasy world that i can think of off the top of my head with decent characters was the earlier seasons of game of thrones. fantasy films are not easy to pull off given the 2 to 3 hours time given. lucas created a masterpiece in over 2 hours. with all being stated, empire strikes back revealed that at his best george lucas is a visionary genius and the world will likely never see such an original story told on the big screen like this one.;28 November 2019;10;['new', 'capable', 'special', 'low', 'mythological', 'pony', 'cinematic', 'special', 'more', 'rich', 'well', 'emotional', 'first', 'genocidal', 'imperial', 'well', 'emotional', 'new', 'emotional', 'cinematic', 'new', 'only', 'more', 'musical', 'first', 'enough', 'beautiful', 'luke', 'enough', 'new', 'musical', 'pensive', 'dreaded', 'iconic', 'soft', 'emotional', 'young', 'scary', 'decent', 'naive', 'arduous', 'possible', 'reckless', 'historic', 'cinematic', 'perfect', 'well', 'first', 'difficult', 'only', 'decent', 'early', 'easy', 'good', 'visionary', 'original', 'big'];0.1428090428090428

663;kees_cornelisse477;i will be the first to say this isn't a perfect movie but it's very close to it. this one follows up star wars which was so great at the time that it would be hard to follow it up. but by god they've done it, not only a good sequel but better than the original. yes there are a few nitpick moments but they're overshadowed easily by all the great things in this movie. to begin with the characters, we now have a more mature luke that has learned a bit more about being a leader for the rebels and even his connection with the force has grown to a point where we see him become this great jedi. however there still is a lot to learn and that's why we are introduced to yoda. yoda is a puppet but it never feels like that, he feels like an actual character that is just too great. every line he says is just so quotable and useful that the audience really gets a feel of the force. this is a perfect way to continue what we learned in star wars but make it even bigger and more understandable so that we really get what luke should feel. we also get introduced to lando, which is an old friend of han and it was very interesting to see why he did what he did. at first you think he's good because he seems like han's friend but then he betrays him, however in the end he chose to help them out and ends good. to see this much conflict in a person in so little time was done great in my opinion and i loved how they used him in the next movie following this one. in the last movie we saw a little glimpse of a love between han and leia but now they bond even more and in the end we really care for leia losing han in the carbonite. during the movie we get a lot of funny banter between them leading up to this love and it just feels real. 3po and r2 have split up so now 3po is with han, leia and chewie and he is still the funny droid from the first one. there are a lot of funny moments where he interacts with han and the others so it definitely has a lot of humor as well, more than the first. vader has now had a defeat in the first so he is out for revenge and every scene he is in you feel his menacing presence, you're scared of what he will do but also understands why he does things. the story also works great, after the last one the empire has regrouped their fleet and have hunted down the rebels up to the point where they're hiding on a snow planet called hoth. this is exactly what you would want from a movie called empire strikes back, they are hunting down the rebels because of what we've seen in the last movie. when this movie ends you really know that the empire has won ground on the rebels and the rebels are crippled so now the rebels have to regroup between now and the next. it's the perfect way of showing the empire actually striking back and it makes for a darker but still very interesting movie following up the first. the effects and visuals are once again incredible for it's time, it doesn't look like an old movie, there are a few dated things but its still a beautiful looking movie with excellent usage of practical effects and sets instead of computer generated things that look fake. the battle of hoth and the tie fighter pursuing the falcon through the asteroids are intense scenes that look incredible. also the lightsaber battle improved compared to the last one, not only are the lightsabers better visualized but they choreographed it a bit more to make it a bit more intense but still keeping it grounded and personal. i also want to say that it's a movie with a lot of humor, funnier than the last one, and a lot of good progression in the relationships of the characters. the love between leia and han feels real and at the end you instantly want to see how they deal with getting han back. yoda makes for a great teacher for luke and learns luke what it is to not only be a jedi but also a good person. and to be more specific about this, he makes for my favorite scene ever in a movie, not just star wars. this is of course the scene where the x-wing is sinking and he tells luke that it is not impossible to get the x-wing out of the swamp. by using the force this can be done, luke tries and fails and when he does yoda explains him the true spirit of the force. with this he not only makes the force understandable for luke but also the audience and when luke then says that it's impossible, this little creature uses just his fingers and his incredible connection with the force to get the x-wing out. this shows the ultimate power of the force and it's possibilities. then lastly about the ending, i think it's brilliant, having vader as luke's father makes it so personal and gives us a human side to vader which was needed to make him more of a character instead of this menacing villain. and then to end with the questions about how it will end with luke and his father, about how they will get han back and of course if the rebels will find the strength to defeat the empire. it gives us everything we wanted out of a sequel and left us wanting more. it's the perfect end to a perfect sequel in a great trilogy. and the force will be with us, always.;20 December

665;kadler;"for 10 good reasons esb is the best movie ever: 10. not the same formula studios love taking the same premise and characters and generating cash in a repeatable fashion without having to do much creative work. if they make $60 million on a movie about a talking dog, you can bet they'll try to make $50 to $60 million again with the exact same storyline and characters. the original stars wars was a happy-go-lucky coming of age story where the good guys win. even at 8 years old in 1980 i expected to see the same formula when i went to the drive-in to watch esb. instead, were presented with the best sequel of all time. every sequel knows that if you wish to really establish your franchise in the second film you need to create the magic that esb presents. note: star trek 2: the wrath of kahn is very close is establishing a franchise with a sequel. 9. a change in tone the first film was happy and carefree with no sense of real tension or drama (who didn't believe luke would take out the death star?). the second film is dark and one inescapable dead end after another (luke stuck in the snow, luke's x-wing stuck in the water, han solo in the carbon chamber, luke on the edge, etc.). 8. consistent motivation of characters this movie is about friendship and sacrifice. every major character in this movie from luke to darth vader is used to communicate this message. whether it's luke not willing to sacrifice his friends or vader manipulating luke's weakness; his loyalty to his friends ... the message is always about friendship and sacrifice for those that we care for. a great movie recently had a character (jesus) say ""you are my friends. and there is no greater love than for a man to lay down his life for his friends."" 7. humor in a film with lots of drama, they managed to put lots of decent jokes that really balanced out the tension. seeing han solo, who's always acting like he's in control, lose control when the falcon won't jump to lightspeed is classic. even c-3po has moments of great humor (unlike in the new films). 6. action sequences this movie has some of the greatest action sequences ever; the astroid sequence being the best. there are many great moments to mention, but my #2 action moment all-time behind the opening to x-men 2 is when they are in the falcon being chased by star destroyers and han solo manages to nearly cause two destroyers to collide; pure joy. 5. romance the romantic tension between leia and han solo is quite obvious. i can't think of many moments of cinema more heartfelt than when han solo is being lowered into the carbon chamber. 4. cliffhanger will they save han solo? will luke join the dark side? will the rebels prevail? so many good questions. i can remember distinctly the time between esb and ""return of the jedi"" as being too long. 3. human story in a universe of ships, lasers and people in strange gear ... what stands out most is the human element of esb. you could take this same story and put it in the 16th century or even as a drama set in modern times and it would translate well. 2. music the stars wars theme was already well established, but yoda's theme and the imperial march are songs that will last maybe even longer than the film itself. this is john william's best work ever other than for jfk in my opinion. the music in this film creates a visual and audible masterpiece like nothing other i've ever seen. 1. greatest plot twist in movie history four words ... ""i am your father"". i mean, does it get any more intense? luke finds out the person he hates most, the one thing that he would love to rid the galaxy of most is his own father. not only that, but he immediately realizes as well that someone he stood behind (obi-wan) had been misleading him (obi-wan told him vader killed his father).";26 September 2004;10;['good', 'good', 'same', 'same', 'repeatable', 'much', 'creative', 'exact', 'same', 'original', 'happy', 'lucky', 'good', 'old', 'same', 'good', 'second', 'close', 'first', 'happy', 'carefree', 'real', 'second', 'dark', 'inescapable', 'dead', 'x', 'wing', 'consistent', 'major', 'luke', 'willing', 'great', 'great', 'decent', 'classic', 'great', 'new', 'great', 'good', 'many', 'great', 'pure', 'romantic', 'obvious', 'many', 'heartfelt', 'dark', 'many', 'good', 'long', 'human', 'strange', 'human', 'same', 'modern', 'imperial', 'good', 'other', 'visual', 'audible', 'other', 'great', 'intense', 'most', 'own'];0.3000875639512002

669;easternmoviecritic;the empire strikes back is an example of how well done a sequel can be, it takes the series to a whole new level and is an improvement over a new hope. the amazing thing is that this time lucas wasn't the director. that doesn't change anything, he guided irvin and esb is still his creation. this time everything is on a larger scale. the battles aren't puny and meaningless, they are actual battles. the movie starts with the battle for the icy world hoth. from there the plot splits in 2, one being with luke and one with the rest: leia, han, chewie, 3po and r2. we are explained in more detail how the force works and we see how truly powerful the empire is. thanks to the money lucas earned from a new hope, the empire strikes back has better special effects and some splendid locations, including hoth and bespin. but it's not all about battles, the love story part of the series is also developed, luke's struggle to understand the force and use it continues, while vader is more determined than ever. star wars: the empire strikes back is a remarkable chapter of the star wars saga. final score: 5/5 or 10/10;3 August 2009;10;['whole', 'new', 'new', 'amazing', 'large', 'puny', 'meaningless', 'actual', 'more', 'powerful', 'new', 'well', 'special', 'splendid', 'determined', 'remarkable', 'final'];0.2617037724180581

674;Gen S2rt;"of all the movies that have had follow-ups to the original, many just had sequels made only because the first was successful enough for it. first thing to know: ""the empire strikes back"" is not a sequel. a standard ""sequel"" is simply the same or similar characters from one movie put in the same or similar situation to the one of the original movie, which is complete without any sequel (jurassic park, speed). ""the empire strikes back"" was pre-planned, and while ""star wars"" did seem like a complete story by itself, that was a result of creator george lucas' uncertainty of whether or not they'd be given the opportunity to complete his saga of stories. ""the empire strikes back"" did an excellent job as the film following ""star wars: a new hope"", because it strived toward the same excellence the first one achieved, while the mood of this chapter contrasted that of the first entirely. the first one definitely had a lighter sort of mood to it, as far as the action among the rebels. this film concentrates more on the war itself, and how tough it is on the rebellion. it also has more establishment of the imperials and their ruthlessness, which definitely adds a darker tone to it. score composer john williams helps give this feeling to the film, with the now famous imperial march that is so closely associated with villain darth vader (james earl jones). for a mood this dark, there sure is a lot of really nice scenery in the film, from the glaciers of the planet hoth to the spanning cloudscape of bespin. the special effects remain as amazing as those in ""a new hope"", and have been re-done with a ""special edition"" as well as the first one, although not as much has changed in this film. the acting is also just as good as it was in the first one, with the addition of yoda (frank oz) and lando calrissian (billy dee williams). the emotion of this film definitely surpasses those in ""a new hope"", with the characters' personalities and relationships explored more deeply, such as between han solo (harrison ford) and princess leia (carrie fisher), and even luke (mark hamill) and darth vader, who for the first time have an actual face-to-face confrontation with each other in the unforgettable lightsaber duel. this film is even more suspenseful and action-packed, with an incredible climax and other very high points as well. of all the intense and breathtaking aspects of this film, the one that everyone has remembered since, and will be remembered for as long as ""star wars"" itself, is the revelation by vader to luke, which most people already know by now. if you are one of the very few who don't, don't do anything until you see this film (and the first one, too) and find out from the movie, not from some loud-mouthed friend, the way many of us did. as hard as it would be to make a film as great as ""a new hope"" after it changed the standards of filmmaking forever, this film definitely meets and surpasses the first one. it will also leave you hanging for the trilogy's final film, ""return of the jedi"" (1983), which also does not disappoint in any way. a second must-see for science fiction fans, or movie fans in general.";12 January 1999;10;['original', 'many', 'first', 'successful', 'first', 'standard', 'same', 'similar', 'same', 'similar', 'original', 'complete', 'complete', 'excellent', 'new', 'same', 'first', 'first', 'first', 'light', 'tough', 'more', 'dark', 'famous', 'imperial', 'nice', 'special', 'amazing', 'new', 'special', 'first', 'much', 'good', 'first', 'new', 'such', 'first', 'actual', 'other', 'unforgettable', 'suspenseful', 'incredible', 'other', 'high', 'intense', 'breathtaking', 'most', 'few', 'first', 'loud', 'mouthed', 'many', 'great', 'new', 'first', 'final', 'second', 'general'];0.2596518431063886

""you killed my father"" shouts luke as he battles darth vader ""no luke skywalker"" he replies ""i am your father"" so the enemy is not with out, but within. the empire strikes back is the second film in what will probably, since disney has no intention of slowing down, become the longest running serial in film history. serial here is the key world, not that star wars was originally coincided as such by it's director, although lucas had his hopes and lots of ideas on paper. the original film was thought to be a risky one off or so the studio thought. only a hint towards the end of the production that success and a sequel could be at hand saved darth vader from being blown up like a firework by the millennium falcon. lucas might have hoped that star wars would be such a success that he would be given a chance to make another but to keep making them and to make nothing else was beyond even his imagination. the concept behind star wars, how it worked in lucas' own imagination, is that star wars would be rather like a flash gordon or buck rogers serial. these were made of a number of individual episodes about 20 minuets long with each one ending with a cliff hanger and starting with a miraculous escape. the plotting was sometimes so desperately week the show just about managed to scrape along from one end to another. they were cheap to produce ( although flash gorden was the most expensive of them all) and aimed at young children and the saturday morning picture show. they were made quickly with out to much thought and with sets and music borrowed from other films. put together by people who were ether glad of the work or would have wished themselves else where. they where rich in corn and low in production vales, totally lacking in pretension and made on the the understanding that every thing in it was disposable and forgettable. of course no child of any age has ever forgotten a single moment of every episode and certainly made an impression on lucas. the original star wars film was only pretending to be a weekly episode some where in the middle, (episode 4 actually) in a run of films. so that at the start you are immediately thrown into the action. what has come before is related on the now very famous script that scrawls sharply away from the picture frame just as it did at the start of each successive episode of flash gorden. the screen wipes and the general air of pulp fiction in star wars comes from the serials as well. like many american film makers of his generation, lucas was creating a future world by reliving his past. but the empire strikes back really is a midway episode. dropping you directly into the action with the attack on the ice planet. our band of heroes divide into two groups and take two separate story ark's to dagobah and the cloud city, allowing the film to play off one against the other and introduce new characters in each story line, before winding back them back together for the finale at which point the film oddly just comes to a stop, with every one backed away from the camera and looking out of the window, with out even a cliff hanger ending, the only unresolved situation is having han solo encased in carbon with his fate unknown. perhaps lucas just lost his nerve about copying the old serials but couldn't work the story up a dramatic full stop, so things just hang in the air and then the titles role the empire strikes back has some brilliant and ground braking special effects we are still in a an age before computer generated imagery every thing is optical and physical including a stunning chase through a asteroid field. we follow the path of the millennium falcon between objects that have their own independent trajectory and bounce off each other. we learn the advantage of have regular service checks on your vehicle and the benefits of having every space craft made from the same airfix parts we are also introduced to new characters including a smooth and swishy lando calrissian, muppet sage yoda engaging in hollywood's life long flirtation with eastern philosophy and mysticism. a menacing villain in the emperor played by marjorie eaton and voiced by clive revill (always good to hear the english actor on repeat viewings). the film benefits from not having the burden of a beginning or an ending and with nothing weighing on either side the film just shoots along. neither lucas nor his writers could think up an ending for the return of the jedi that was not just a slight rehash of the first film and from then on it would hugs and kisses at the end of every adventure. so perhaps it is an advantage that this film just comes to a stop. the reason why the empire strikes back story flows concisely and logically could be because lucas has taken a back seat to the rough trade of direction to concentrate on co-production. handing the reins over to irvin kershner a solid talented professional but not to original or individual a director. lucas turned to professionals again for the script. employing lawrence kasdan who would go on to work on raiders of the lost ark and it's interesting to note that leigh brackett wrote an early draft. she goes back a long way and was greatly admired and often used by howard harks, who thought her pulp detective fiction (his favorite reading matter) was amongst the finest, he asked her to screen write the screenplay for the big sleep. asking professionals to work with him on the script may explain why this episode feels the most mature, there are no ewoks, no ja ja binks here thank you very much. leigh brackett died in 1978 and not much if any of her work remains in the finished film but she would have recognized the type of dialog runing between solo and the princess. it was first pioneered by hawks in screw ball comedies during the thirties in films like brining up baby where it is noted by a pompous psychiatrist that "" the love impulse in men very frequently reveals itself in terms of conflict"" lucas really was borrowing widely from everything he loved about the cinema of the past. because of a driving accident just before filming started mark hamill's very visible facial scars needed to be explained in the plot, so the film starts with a mini adventure where han solo has to find luke skywalker who has been lost in the frozen landscape, before nights falls and the temperature drops. this intimate drama was concocted on the spot and yet look at how useful it is at underling the relationship of the characters have with each other right where it is needed at the start of the film. han is reckless, fool hardy but all so decisive and focused. he is the first to realize that luke is absent and he is prepared to risk everything to protect his friend and because something needs to be happening before solo can realize lucas is missing, we see solo and leia constantly bickering in howard hawks style which continues on even as everything collapses around them. everybody in the writing team is on the ball here and a unexpected necessity is turned in an asset for the production. john williams provides another score for the film, the quality of the music is as high as the first and you might seamlessly travel from one to the other with out knowing you have crossed a threshold. william's score has been highly praised but i think that something is missing. william score for the original film has some wonderful small delicate wistful moments, as when luke is contemplating his future while watching the suns of tatooine go down, there is the wonderful cantina band music and that slightly off center rhythmic tic that is played as han and luke prepare for the tie fighter attack. all of which is evidence of william's love of stravinsky, mahler and prokofiev among others. as good as the music is in the empire strikes back there is nothing quite as diverse as that in it's score. but it does have the imperial march and the the imperial march is ace. it was a long time before i realized that williams composed it for the second film. it's hard to imagine that it was ever absent from the saga. it is without doubt the most the additive tune ever put to film. start playing it in your head now! and see if you can stop from repeating the tune again and again, louder and louder until your lips start to move and your head bops from side to side. if you can manage that without making a fool of your self then you are no star wars fan. the most curious aspect of the film is lucas' decision to had over the direction to somebody else and to concentrate on the production side. he felt that trying to do both would to difficult so he chose to produce. in no way was he handing over the film for somebody else to make as a director. as the film's producer he had total control over every aspect of the project to make sure it fitted his vision. by choosing not to be the director he didn't have to deal with an irreverence that was getting in the way with what he wanted , the actors. if technology did not allow him to do away with human beings, then at lease there must be a way of making a film with having to discuss acting with them. eventually that technological dream would come true.";10 April 2020;8;['emotional', 'middle', 'aged', 'good', 'bad', 'black', 'white', 'second', 'long', 'running', 'key', 'such', 'original', 'risky',

682;jrichards2-1;i love all of the original star wars films, but for me this one takes the biscuit. i have heard some people say that the empire strikes back is the weakest of the trilogy, and that it suffers for being in the middle. i would dispute this utterly. for one thing, the plot has a slightly different format to the other two: instead of the old destroy-a-death-star scenario, we have the chance to learn more about the galaxy in general and to explore the characters in more depth. this is the film in which a lot of key character relationships are forged in earnest. it also includes, in my opinion, the best light sabre sequences: alec guiness may be a super actor, but he's not desperately nimble, whilst we do not have the same confidence in luke as we do in return of the jedi. some people these days are dazzled by the modern films, but believe you me, the old ones are better. they have better characters, and are not bloated in the same way. carrie fisher is super as our fiesty heroine, whilst harrison ford takes a strong role and mark hamil excels as the ultimate hero. you don't get much better than this. 9 out of 10.;22 October 2004;9;['original', 'weak', 'different', 'other', 'old', 'more', 'general', 'more', 'key', 'good', 'light', 'super', 'nimble', 'same', 'modern', 'old', 'well', 'well', 'bloated', 'same', 'super', 'fiesty', 'strong', 'ultimate', 'well'];0.1855263157894737

688;billreynolds;"i have seen star wars probably 35-40 times and empire about 20 but had never watched them back to back (on consecutive nights) until the new dvd versions came out. put me in the camp of those who feel the added digital effects are a desecration; i want to see the movies the way they were released originally. i simply tried to ignore the alterations and was successful for the most part. it certainly is nice to see these films in widescreen, with outstanding picture and sound quality. i felt the same way after seeing star wars again that i have since 1977: it is the greatest achievement in the history of movies. to my surprise, however, when i watched empire the next night, i was disappointed. it is a very well-directed, well-polished movie, but to my mind, it lacks the visual, graphic brilliance that helped make the original so extraordinary. star wars and american graffiti, the two masterpieces george lucas directed in his youth, both have an incredible, unmatched look. lucas didn't move the camera much, but he made up for it with the amazing, jukebox-like style of what he photographed with it. empire lacks that quality. ***spoiilers ahead*** star wars was really a perfect story that ended with what is still the greatest action sequence ever (the death star battle) followed by the ultimate coda (the throne room scene). watching empire right afterward was a little jarring. suddenly, without warning, we learn that despite destroying ""the ultimate power"" in the universe, the rebels have gained no advantage, and they're on the run, stuck hiding on a miserable little ice planet with a single, tiny base. wouldn't more fighters, more systems have joined the alliance after the destruction of the death star? how did the rebels go from ultimate victory to being nearly crushed so quickly? another major shock to me -- and probably the biggest weakness of empire -- was the change in the relationships of the three main characters. in star wars, from the moment luke first saw leia, he was in love with her (""who is she? she's beautiful"") -- so much so that he stood dumbstruck when he first entered her cell on the death star. there were strong hints that leia reciprocated -- she kissed him (half on the cheek, half on the lips) twice, looked very nervous when he seemed dead in the final battle, and certainly luke was in puppy-love with her the entire film. now, all of a sudden, in empire, luke and leia are on-screen together for about three minutes total, and there is no hint of luke's love for her. without explanation, now it's all about han and leia, who despite no hint of attraction in star wars are suddenly are madly in love. i suspect there are three main reasons for this: 1. unlike fisher and hamill, harrison ford was not signed up for sequels. he only agreed to come back on condition that his character was developed from the wisecracking, cynical sidekick into the wisecracking, cynical, romantic hero lead. this gave his career a great boost, but in my opinion totally undercut the character of luke skywalker, who should have been the emotional focus of the movie (as he was in star wars). 2. mark hamill's disfiguring car accident in december 1976 (after completion of principal photography on star wars) made it easier to turn his character into a monk-like, asexual person (the process that started in empire and finished in jedi). in star wars hamill was a handsome, though callow, screen presence. but after the accident (despite plastic surgery), he just didn't look good. it hampered his performance and basically destroyed his capacity to play a romantic lead. 3. to the extent that lucas planned to have leia be luke's sister (a terrible decision that i suspect was not made until after the release of empire), they obviously could not be romantically involved. however, their ""incestuous"" love for each other is all over star wars. i think the decision to make leia and luke siblings only came after the radical character revisions in empire eliminated any romantic feelings between luke and leia and turned luke into a boring monk. indeed, empire's greatest weakness is that it's too heavy. the ""dark side of the force"" was only briefly discussed in star wars, but here it's played up to an extent that the concept just can't support. yoda says that ""fear, anger, hatred"" lead to the dark side, but how exactly is a human being supposed to avoid these emotions? the force was fleshed out just the right amount (i.e., not too much) in star wars, but here it is revealed not to make a whole lot of sense. there's way too much ""good vs. evil"" that's no longer presented in a fun style in empire. it's taken too seriously, which reminds me of the lord of the rings movies -- not a good thing.";1 December 2004;10;['consecutive', 'new', 'digital', 'successful', 'most', 'nice', 'outstanding', 'sound', 'same', 'great', 'next', 'disappointed', 'visual', 'graphic', 'original', 'extraordinary', 'incredible', 'unmatched', 'much', 'amazing', 'like', 'perfect', 'great', 'ultimate', 'little', 'ultimate', 'miserable', 'little', 'single', 'tiny', 'more', 'more', 'ultimate', 'major', 'big', 'main', 'beautiful', 'strong', 'nervous', 'dead', 'final', 'entire', 'sudden', 'main', 'cynical', 'cynical', 'romantic', 'great', 'emotional', 'principal', 'easy', 'like', 'asexual', 'handsome', 'callow', 'plastic', 'good', 'romantic', 'terrible', 'incestuous', 'other', 'luke', 'radical', 'romantic', 'boring', 'great', 'heavy', 'dark', 'dark', 'human', 'right', 'much', 'whole', 'much', 'good', 'fun', 'good'];0.1543787529674626

694;dxia;i must imagine that making a sequel to 'star wars' must be like trying to follow johnny carson in the tonight show. how do you follow up an act that was so well received and set the standard so high? there is a such thing as warming up an audience. it's a totally different matter when you blow them away. in these days, when it is customary to believe that sequels have no chance to equal their predecessor, all one has to do is point to 'empire strikes back' to reject that notion. the movie is so elegantly made and so vibrant in its creativity, it somehow finds a way to surpass its predecessor. 'star wars' opens its universe but 'empire strikes back' enriches it. yoda makes his appearance into popular culture. luke discovers the truth of his family. and each character completes an arc that they merely began in the first movie. if 'star wars' is a movie about innocence, the naive farmer boy flying off to save the galaxy, then 'empire strikes back' is a movie about how that innocence was lost. when happens when the party is over? it is well known that mark hamill was in a car accident before the filming of the sequel. the accident did extensive damage to his face, and many worried that he could not act the part of luke skywalker anymore. the result was that he created a far more mature version of skywalker for the better of the franchise. he portrays skywalker as a veteran of the rebellion, aged through fighting and no longer a naive boy. the making of 'empire strikes back' was approached with artistry, which made it a much darker film than its predecessor. not everyone appreciated the change, but no one could deny that it was a masterpiece, very dark and yet very human in its story telling. the scene i remember most comes near the end, when darth vader is staring out the window of his ship watching victory come within his grasp only to slip past him again. the audience cannot see any facial expressions because of his mask, but the pain of his loss is very perceptible. he is a worn soldier, scarred by evil but very desperate for what he wants. it is possible to pity him, which makes the complications of the story that much more compelling. i did not always love this movie. but that has changed. and i expect soon that more people will see that 'empire strikes back' is the defining moment in the star wars saga.;18 February 2004;10;['high', 'such', 'different', 'customary', 'vibrant', 'popular', 'first', 'naive', 'extensive', 'many', 'mature', 'well', 'naive', 'dark', 'dark', 'human', 'most', 'facial', 'perceptible', 'worn', 'evil', 'desperate', 'possible', 'compelling', 'more', 'defining'];0.0274603174603174

706;tagerjd;star wars episode 5 the empire strikes back tells the story of the evil galactic empire attacking the hopeless rebellion after the destruction of the death star. one thing that i feel is worth noting right off the bat is that i don't think this film surpasses a new hope but is ratter on the same level in terms of substance as well as quality. what makes this film good is that it is able to keep its focus on the characters in a universe that is so interesting as well as vast. that is something that makes the original trilogy better in my opinion because in the prequels it was focused on showing us heavily c.g.i. visuals ratter then on the characters. this is one of many factors that make the original trilogy by far the superior films. the plot is also more complex then the first of this trilogy which shows that the people involved with this project were taking risks. the characters were all likable and interesting. and the fact that they filmed at real locations shows dedication from the director irvin kershner. the cons of this picture though are not minimal which leads me to feeling as though it is grossly overrated. the acting and dialogue is still hooky, the effects are showing age, the action is underwhelming, and unfortunately the fan base that surrounds star wars has made it difficult to watch empire as it was intended. the story although complex is occasionally driven forward by plot convinces. and although i did not see this infamous twist coming, i also was not all that wowed. in conclusion the empire strikes back is complex and has relatable characters which is able to drive this picture forward as well as be entertaining. and i'm giving this one a 6/10.;24 July 2016;6;['evil', 'galactic', 'hopeless', 'worth', 'new', 'ratt', 'same', 'good', 'able', 'interesting', 'vast', 'original', 'many', 'original', 'superior', 'complex', 'first', 'likable', 'interesting', 'real', 'minimal', 'hooky', 'underwhelming', 'difficult', 'complex', 'infamous', 'complex', 'relatable', 'able', 'entertaining'];0.1428853754940711

717;karlito5;overall i would say that episode v is the best of the star wars films. star wars episode iv had great special effects however the standards set by that film are easily surpassed by the effects seen here in the empire strikes back. that said though very few films have been carried by the visual trickery alone, episode v could not simply have been an effects driven film as this would have meant that it offered nothing new to the star wars saga. i do, though, love the visual effects in this film. in my opinion they are the best of any of the six episodes my reasoning for this is that although you can tell a few things have been faked it is nothing like episodes i, ii and iii where nothing looks real due to excessive and often unnecessary use of cgi. brilliant as the effects are though they never upstage the actors (as they do in subsequent star wars films). mark hamill is at his most convincing in episode v this though, i think, is largely due to a script that gives his character much more depth than in episode iv. the conflicts within luke are very well played out, his frustration with yoda, his inability to control the force and his eventual recklessness in choosing to face vader, without completing his training, present the very real prospect that he might succumb to the dark side - indeed when i first saw this film i felt luke would have no choice but to submit to vader after their duel on bespin. elsewhere the love story between han and leia develops gradually becomes more intense as the film progresses. there is the hilarious verbal sparing whilst the battle rages on hoth followed by the tender scene on the falcon in the asteroid field where han and leia admit their feelings for one another. all this builds up to the highly charged scenes in cloud city where leia expresses doubts about han's staying power before accepting, as han is about to be frozen, that she loves him (which of course he knew anyway!). i would say that harrison ford gives his best performance as han solo in episode v as he actually has his own story line where as in epiosde iv he is almost there for delivering (great) one-liners whilst he cuts a bit of a peripheral figure in episode vi perhaps what i love most about this film though is the more subtle touches and the little things that make the whole thing real and something that you can relate too. for example i love that moment where han solo hits the falcon's control panel after it fails to light up - haven't we all been there?. then there's the constant bickering that occurs (especially between han and leia) that makes the characters so real. meanwhile vader is at his most menacing - proving that the empire has most certainly struck back. although at the end when admiral piett is expecting to be swiftly executed after the escape of the millennium falcon (as admiral ozell and captain niedhar were before him). however vader chooses to let piett be cleverly suggesting that vader's meeting with luke has altered vader substantially an advertising that often actions speak louder than words. the only problem with this film (apart from being at the whim of george lucas) is that you really need to see episodes iv and iv to fully understand it therefore meaning that as a stand alone film it's not quite as perfect as it is in the context of the other films in the saga. indeed if you read my comment you'll probably see that most of my observations are relative to the other star wars film. however as episodes iv and vi are great films you've really nothing to lose by watching the whole lot. oh did i mention it has quite possibly the best twist in cinema history?;11 January 2007;10;['good', 'great', 'special', 'few', 'visual', 'new', 'visual', 'good', 'few', 'real', 'due', 'excessive', 'unnecessary', 'subsequent', 'convincing', 'due', 'more', 'eventual', 'real', 'dark', 'intense', 'hilarious', 'verbal', 'tender', 'about', 'good', 'own', 'great', 'peripheral', 'subtle', 'little', 'whole', 'real', 'constant', 'real', 'admiral', 'admiral', 'only', 'alone', 'perfect', 'other', 'most', 'relative', 'other', 'great', 'whole', 'good'];0.2148659211159211
718;FLASHP01NT;"i think the real reason the empire strikes back is such a good film is because it was written by leigh brackett, not lawrence kasdan. i believe all the major story ideas and plot points of empire came from brackett's draft and were later adapted, by kasdan, into the final screenplay. had brackett survived and continued working on empire, it probably would have been even better. my first suspicion that kasdan was a hack writer came many years ago after i, like everyone else, heard he had written empire. i immediately checked kasdan's filmography to see if there were any other notable films i had not yet seen. unfortunately, the only other poignant movie written by kasdan was indiana jones: raiders of the lost ark (for which george lucas wrote the story). kasdan also wrote the screenplay for rotj, and i personally think that rotj is both a cheap and poorly written film. rotj was my first clue that kasdan may not have been responsible for the success and quality of empire. upon further research into the writing of empire i eventually found brackett's name buried in an article somewhere: researching brackett i noticed she had co-written the screenplay for ""the big sleep"" (1946) with humphrey bogart and lauren bacall. i remember watching all the major bogart films in college and now, upon comparison to empire, i see major similarities - especially in the romance and drama genres. this is also a big clue. kasdan was able to skate by for many years without writing anything, allowing him to soak up the admiration for empire without providing any body of work for comparison (besides rotj). now that kasdan's name has been plastered all over the media for the disney star wars remakes we can now see that kasdan has no real writing talent. i am happy to say that i know lawrence kasdan is not a good writer.";23 July 2020;10;['real', 'good', 'leigh', 'major', 'final', 'well', 'first', 'many', 'other', 'notable', 'only', 'other', 'poignant', 'cheap', 'first', 'responsible', 'further', 'big', 'major', 'major', 'big', 'able', 'many', 'disney', 'real', 'happy', 'good'];0.2607954545454545

731;s_daad;"this film is bad in the sense that it is hardly a film at all. it has no structure, no dialogue, no screenplay, a threadbare story, but one that is not told because of non-existent direction, etc. it continues where the original left off, and just notches off plot elements one by one without any urge to tell a story, or develop characters, relationships, etc. the makers probably conceived this as a filler between numbers one and three and didn't bother with it. of course, that's all right. i don't have any problem with that. but what really does disturb me is the high praise meted out to this ""film"" from almost every quarter from viewers and critics alike. on this board it's being rated as the 17th best movie of all time. i've consulted quite a few film guides, and they all tag maximum, or near maximum, stars to this film. even more bizarrely, they consider it to be the best of the series, and in my mind it's clearly the worst. what is going on? of course, it's not difficult to see why this film is idolized. the first film was both good and a milestone. not great, but it was the perfect statement for an age. it was a fairy tale that was confused as science fiction. the ""force"" embodied morality, even religion, for the space age. it is set in the distant past and therefore pertains to origins rather than where technology is going. spaceships and laser guns are just the backdrop, and have nothing to do with the story or the subject matter. when this film appeared in the middle of the crisis-ridden seventies, it really must have been a beacon of ""new hope"". and to put the ground-breaking special effects into its proper context, they symbolized optimism. there is no doubt that the effects served the story well, but they served even better the mood of the age. and with all this going, star wars rightly became a tremendous hit, and the focus of fanatic devotion. it was to be expected that any sequel would have been gobbled up by the fan base, as long as it didn't spoil the original. empire doesn't spoil the original. it not only continues the war between good and evil, it does so with more spectacle, more aplomb, more special effects. when people say they like empire, what i think they really mean is that thy like star wars so much that they are thrilled that it has a new and glossy wrapping. because empire is nothing but embellishment. they're not judging the film itself. the ideal situation would have been if star wars remained as a standalone fairy tale. fairy tales end, and they leave us with the aura of ""happily ever after"". they don't go on and on and become sagas, and if they did that would totally destroy the aura. empire is the first mistaken step towards saga, and that is why it quickly finds itself out of its depth. there is nothing else to be told, and that's why the film is so bad. one boring battle joined to another boring battle, and in between we have cardboard characters mouthing atrocious dialogue that serves no purpose whatsoever. the strain tells. everybody is straining to do something when there is nothing to do. the third film, the return of the jedi, redeems itself by trying to finish a story. the prequels are interesting because they are filling in the background. but empire is caught in no man's land. it is bad, and it should be exposed as such. all this pretending isn't healthy, i don't think.";17 October 2010;1;['bad', 'threadbare', 'non', 'existent', 'right', 'high', 'good', 'few', 'maximum', 'good', 'bad', 'difficult', 'first', 'good', 'great', 'perfect', 'distant', 'subject', 'new', 'special', 'proper', 'well', 'tremendous', 'fanatic', 'original', 'original', 'good', 'more', 'more', 'more', 'special', 'new', 'glossy', 'ideal', 'standalone', 'first', 'mistaken', 'bad', 'boring', 'boring', 'cardboard', 'atrocious', 'third', 'interesting', 'bad', 'such', 'healthy'];0.1118261562998405

""do, or do not! there is no try!"" and the scene with luke, yoda and the x-wing is perhaps the most magical in all of cinema. ""i don't believe it!?!"" ""that is why you fail!"" this amazing scene brings chills of rapture down my spine every time i watch it. 5. the mythology - here thanks to yoda's teachings, contrasted by darth vader's brutality and the brief but insidious appearance of the emperor, we truly learn the nature of the force, the dark side and the light. it is simple, yet profound enough to make us think seriously about the nature and of good and evil in our own world. we are reminded that good and evil are both choices, and that choices have consequences. that which is done, cannot be undone. ""once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny..."" 6. darth vader's revelation to luke: i won't spoil it even here, but this is the greatest, most shocking, and most suspenseful cinematic revelation of all time. i don't think audiences today can ever appreciate how audiences in 1980 were left reeling by this fantastic scene, or the three years of debate and anticipation which followed - after so many triumphs in scene after scene, here the empire strikes back truly claims its place in the pantheon of the greatest movies of all time! actually i could probably go on and on listing all the good parts of this movie, as every scene is a triumph. i think the above is a sufficient sampling to support my conclusion as to how incredible and deserving of its legendary status this movie is. the indifferent: 1. nothing about this movie is indifferent! the bad: 1. nothing is bad about this movie! anyone who feels otherwise deserves to be banished to a dark oblivion forever by great chthulu.

748;owenmul;the empire strikes back is the best of the original trilogy, as well as being the best of the entire series. its so good that it is on my top ten films of all time. it manages to switch between the cheery space opera tone of the original film with added darkness and despair. the characters this time around are given much more screen time to grow and develop, being ever more three-dimensional. this depth of character is what adds to the first film and makes it so much better than the rest of the series. it shows the good and the evil, the greed and corruption and the tyranny that grows within the corners of the of the star wars universe. the cinematography, score and special effects remain quite consistent, moving on from those that were present in the first film. the only exception of this is the special effects, which have been slightly spruced up since the first film. the story itself has become a lot more brutal and unforgiving, without moving into spoilers, it fully embraces the dark side of the force and fully explores the darkest corners of its plot. it is because of the emotions stirred in empire that the entire series takes on a mythic quality that resonates back to the first and ahead to the third.this is the heart of the franchise, this is the peak. everything that has been added and built upon from the first film is fantastic, there are no conceivable downsides to this space epic. more reviews at: http://12yearsacinephile.tumblr.com/;27 March 2015;10;['good', 'original', 'good', 'entire', 'good', 'top', 'cheery', 'original', 'more', 'dimensional', 'first', 'well', 'special', 'consistent', 'present', 'first', 'only', 'special', 'first', 'brutal', 'unforgiving', 'dark', 'dark', 'entire', 'mythic', 'first', 'first', 'fantastic', 'conceivable', 'more'];0.2534340659340658

751;ofp857;vote uscwannabe my name is tom costabile and i am currently the lead runner up in the presidency contest at hyperspace.com, known on that site as uscwannabe. i have been intently working on trying to win this election and have come to the conclusion that i can't win this with just friends and family...i'm going to need the help of the millions of fans star wars has adopted for itself to win this contest so i've decided to write this letter to introduce myself and my ideas for the fan club presidency. i went back to school and got my ged. i went to college for media arts and animation (because i wanted to be gl) and got my bachelors. i moved to studio city, ca to go to usc and started my real life, the one i envisioned when i was 5, and within 3 years i own multiple corporations, my dream houses, my dream cars, i don't do drugs or drink in essence, i have everything i have ever wanted for myself and i have star wars and george lucas to thank for it, and my way of giving back is to take my place in the sw world and be the best damn fan club president anyone can. i have a few ideas for how i can make it better for us as fans : i feel that we are entering a very scary time in terms of our beloved star wars. for the first time in sw history we are in a realm of uncertainty as to what's going to happen next. for the entire time sw has been in our lives we knew there was going to be more, it was just a matter of time, and now, according to lucas there will never be another film. of course we're going to have the video games, the board games and the television shows and so on, but nothing, absolutely nothing can compare to watching the midnight showing of a new star wars film. it's probably the greatest experiences of my life and i don't want it to end! i feel that there is a way around this though. if there were more conventions than sw would stay alive forever. if we as fans can come together more frequently i believe sw would never leave us and its that simple. we need to urge lucasfilm to produce more functions in more cities all over the world in order to satisfy the needs of the true fans and as president this will be my number one priority. not just every 3 years, but every year. not in just one city but multiple cities. one of the things i found to be disturbing was that because it was in indianapolis, and only in indianapolis, it was extremely hard for a lot of people to come there. they would have to get time off work, save up money, and make room for this in their personal lives. these reasons deterred a lot of people away and that i feel is not fair to them. it should not cost an extrordinary amount of money and time to celebrate these films and now that there won't be any movies its all we have to look forward to as a group. if lucasfilm will not cooperate with this i feel that we should come together as a group and make it happen ourselves and as president of the fan club i would be more than happy to make all of the arrangements and make this happen! i also feel that sw fans are probably the most enlightened and creative people on the planet. we at an early age saw the talent that went into making these films and have been trying to find that talent within ourselves ever since, and the best part about it is many of us have but we don't know what to do with it!! especially in a day and age where there are more film students than law students and a time where the world is the smallest its ever been in the history of the earth. we as a society are watching films from england, france, japan and so on and seeing the impact that sw has had on not just the usa, but the world!! i propose that if i become president i begin an organization where people from all over the planet can submit their artworks (not just sw stuff) and gain the assistance of people in the entertainment industry. from writing to storyboarding to cgi to film and all that has to do with it. an organization by sw fans for sw fans!! a way to come up and not need no one but ourselves to make it happen. if we took all the talent that is in the group of people that will read this letter and put it together in a serious way your talking american zoetrope to the tenth power. your talking about possibly the next wave of great filmmakers. a way for me to give back. i felt an obligation to do this. if i don't win this contest i want everyone who reads this to know how i feel about everything that has been going on around us in the sw society as an extremely concerned fan. i think that everyone i have ever met at the conventions and the midnight showings and the weekends at disney have been the greatest, greatest group of people this world has to offer, and i am so greateful that i'm a part of it. may the force be with you all. thomas costabile uscwannabe;15 April 2006;10;['lead', 'just', 'ged', 'real', 'multiple', 'good', 'damn', 'few', 'well', 'scary', 'beloved', 'first', 'entire', 'more', 'new', 'great', 'more', 'alive', 'simple', 'more', 'more', 'true', 'multiple', 'disturbing', 'hard', 'personal', 'fair', 'extrordinary', 'more', 'happy', 'enlightened', 'creative', 'early', 'good', 'many', 'more', 'small', 'serious', 'american', 'tenth', 'next', 'great', 'concerned', 'great', 'great', 'greateful'];0.2760389610389611
752;Evil_Chihuahua;as we already know, sequels are rubbish. they are nothing more than someone taking the characters from the original and putting them into a new setting that no one really cares about (see men in black 2, neverending story 2, etc). but every so often a sequel comes along that is just as good, if not better than the original, such as aliens, termenator 2, x-men 2 and indiana jones and the last crusade. but the empire strikes back is the greastest sequel in film history. empire may not be as flashy as the original, nor does it have as much action, but it has one thing lucus has neglected with the prequels: a good, solid story. empire, like any other great film, has a few flaws, such as dragging on with needless information and too little of boba fett, but it makes up for it with fun characters (including news ones like yoda and fett), better sfx and that famous revelation of the truth about darth vader. also, despite what some say, there is character development. for example, in the original, luke skywalker was an innocent teenager who hungered for action, while in empire, he is more mature and serious. in the beginning of empire he is a little like the luke from the original, half way through he becomes more impatient and at the end he is emotionally confused. the film maybe a bit childish, like so many say (but everyone is entitled to their own opinion), but you must remember that the target audiences for star wars, as lucus said, are children. in closing i'll just say empire is a great film to watch while you sit down and relax and, like i said for star wars, is one you must see at least once.;11 January 2006;9;['rubbish', 'more', 'original', 'new', 'black', 'good', 'well', 'original', 'such', 'last', 'flashy', 'original', 'much', 'good', 'solid', 'other', 'great', 'few', 'such', 'needless', 'little', 'fun', 'well', 'famous', 'original', 'innocent', 'mature', 'serious', 'little', 'original', 'half', 'impatient', 'confused', 'childish', 'many', 'own', 'great', 'least'];0.1336675579322637

754;zorchmag;better than star wars. better than return of the jedi. and do you know why? because it spends more time on character development and dramatic buildup than either of its siblings. while the empire strikes back does include its share of space battles and lightsaber duels, the big focus isn't on special effects, but on relationships between characters. the heroes and villains are both developed in interesting ways, plus there's that surprise twist which you probably already know about, but which i won't risk spoiling for you. the special edition of this movie is also the best of the three. except for the dopey, fake-looking wampa-eats-a-tantan-like-a-corncob scene, and the bloodcurdling scream that's been dubbed in when luke throws himself into the bottomless ventilation shaft, most of the added/retouched stuff is pretty good. i was very impressed by what was done with cloud city, and felt that it added greatly to those scenes. darth vader has a somewhat silly-sounding new line, but i liked the way the final chase scene was intercut with him flying back to the star destroyer. definitely not the popcorn-gobbling big-screen videogame that star wars and return of the jedi are, but certainly superior to both in atmosphere, characterization, and execution.;23 May 1999;9;['well', 'more', 'dramatic', 'big', 'special', 'interesting', 'special', 'good', 'dopey', 'fake', 'bloodcurdling', 'bottomless', 'most', 'good', 'impressed', 'silly', 'new', 'final', 'star', 'big', 'superior'];0.2510822510822511

756;theshuttlewoods;although it is argued that 'a new hope' was more original and revolutionary (which it is), i believe that 'empire' is a better film. while the first film touches on luke's destiny, in 'empire' luke begins to see the potential of his power, and also sees the temptation of the dark side. where this film succeeds where the others fail is in the psychology of the film. luke realises that his own worst enemy is himself, not vader. vader too is given far more scope in this film. we see his full range of his powers, his relationships with imperial officers, and more importantly with the emperor. the climax of the film (which i won't give away, just in case you've been living under a rock since 1980), ties up a lot of loose ends and intertwining stories from the film. ultimately it sets up a great start for the final part of the trilogy (unfortunatley it wasn't lived up to). a very solid 9/10;21 January 2001;9;['new', 'original', 'revolutionary', 'well', 'first', 'dark', 'own', 'bad', 'vader', 'more', 'full', 'imperial', 'loose', 'great', 'final', 'solid'];0.17370337995338

761;eddie_olsen;this film was a part of my childhood. therefore, it is especially difficult for me to review it. most people on imdb have seen this film and are therefore familiar with the story. episode v is the darkest in the classic trilogy. i also mean this literally. but most important, this film focus more on dart vader, the ruler of the galaxy, than the other films. he is the dark knight slaughtering everyone who gets in his way. the pace is, like all lucas films, very fast. that is a good thing. after all, there is no food for thought here. even an eight year old will not miss any messages hidden between the lines. casting has never been lucas's strong side. harrison ford is the big exception here. he fits the role as the rough guy who ended up supporting the good side seemingly by chance. his temper, barefaced lines and selfishness prevents our heroes from appearing dull. dart vader is a symbiosis of david prowse doing the physical acting and james earl jones speaking the lines. i wouldn't call the physical acting difficult, but david does his job. the latter person's deep voice is ideal for the dark knight. alec guiness appears just a couple of minutes in the film. as always his acting is flawless. the rest of the cast is a mixed bag. mark hamill looked like a good choice in episode iv when he was a rookie in the space war business. in episode v he just don't manage to depict the main character as a confident jedi knight. carrie fischer as princess leia and billy dee williams as lando act with no credibility. jeremy bulloch depicts the ultra cool bounty hunter boba fett nicely, but like dart vader it is not the hardest thing to do. how can i give the film 9 points after these harsh comments? this is sci-fi. who expects deep meaning, memorable acting or complex drama? most people are more interested in high production values. episode v was by 1980 the best produced film ever. to make space ships, lasers, futuristic building structures and numerous creatures look natural is a challenge even today. star wars episode v is far beyond alien, 2001, star trek, close encounters, etc. the film won an academy award for best sound. how does a space ship sound? you'll find the answer in this film. last but not least, the sound track is great. like a wagner opera each character is given a theme. the effect is fascinating. john williams won international acclaim with the score and it is the only classical sound track music album which went gold until decades later. with star wars john williams created the template for all sci-fi and fantasy film scores. all in all: this is good entertainment. but if you except drama look elsewhere.;9 June 2009;9;['difficult', 'most', 'familiar', 'dark', 'classic', 'important', 'other', 'dark', 'lucas', 'good', 'old', 'strong', 'big', 'rough', 'good', 'dull', 'physical', 'physical', 'difficult', 'latter', 'deep', 'ideal', 'dark', 'flawless', 'mixed', 'good', 'main', 'confident', 'ultra', 'cool', 'hard', 'harsh', 'deep', 'memorable', 'complex', 'most', 'interested', 'high', 'futuristic', 'numerous', 'natural', 'alien', 'close', 'good', 'last', 'least', 'sound', 'great', 'fascinating', 'international', 'only', 'classical', 'good'];0.1733333333333333

767;harveybdickens;this movie is regarded as the textbook example of how to make a good sequel. it is up there with the dark knight, and terminator 2 judgement day, as on of the great sequels of all time, almost all people say it is the greatest star wars movie ever made, while some say it is one of the greatest movies ever made. i don't personally agree with the last one, but i do think this movie, is one of those movies that gets everything right. the idea of a sequel is to build upon the original. to say that this movie does that correctly is an understatement. this movie is much darker than the original (dark by 70s/80s standards), the villainous darth vader is more evil than in the previous film, and one could say it is one of those movies where the bad guys win. the heroes (namely luke skywalker, han solo, and princess leia) are in much more dangerous situations then before (and they are for basically the entire movie.) you get to learn more about the force, see luke learn how to become a jedi (or try to), and get the biggest shock you'll ever get while watching a movie, when you find out the antagonist, is actually the protagonists father. this is an excellent sequel, a fantastic movie in general, and possibly the best star wars movie out there. with that i give it a 9/10;8 December 2015;10;['good', 'dark', 'great', 'great', 'great', 'last', 'right', 'original', 'dark', 'original', 'dark', 'villainous', 'evil', 'previous', 'bad', 'dangerous', 'entire', 'more', 'big', 'excellent', 'fantastic', 'general', 'good'];0.1758658008658009

776;Lucian-4;this movie takes all the great elements of star wars and elevates them to something deeper and more emotionally resonant. sure, there are cool aliens, action sequences, and all, but here the heroes have to deal with things us normal people also deal with. along with helmeted villains, snow monsters and the like, they face sexual tension, identity crisis, spiritual yearning, betrayal, parental issues, separation from loved ones, etc... the pacing is just perfect, although there seems to be a screwed-up sense of time. (luke seems to be with yoda for at least weeks, but the pursuit of the falcon seems to take only a few days.) the film is full of dreamy visuals--- a city in the clouds, a murky swamp planet, kenobi's ghostly appearances, luke's confrontation in the cave on dagobah. and the best part is the uncertain ending. the bad guys seem to have won, and the heroes' fates are up in the air. definitely the best of the series. watch it again and again, it's worth it!;8 November 1999;10;['great', 'deep', 'resonant', 'cool', 'normal', 'helmeted', 'like', 'sexual', 'spiritual', 'parental', 'loved', 'perfect', 'least', 'few', 'full', 'dreamy', 'murky', 'good', 'uncertain', 'bad', 'good', 'worth'];0.29

781;elidirkx;the first time i got to set my eyes on this movie, back in 2000, was on an old tv record that we had somewhere here... i didn't know what to expect. the only thing that i'd ever seen of star wars was a vague memory of yoda that was invoked by the word 'yoga' and i believe a poster of the phantom menace, so i didn't really know much about this franchise. so i placed the record into the vcr and started watching...and i was blown away. i watched the opening crawl before being introduced to my first star destroyers, and i must say...i found this introduction to be pretty interesting. the pacing, overall, was pretty good, especially for the start of a science-fiction film. (even though it's actually a space opera, but who cares...) so i got to see the main character getting into trouble with an ice monster that seemed to be looking for food, and found it..then shots of the other main characters who seemed to be worried about the main character, and were discussing some other business as well... after some of that business, we got to see a pretty large-scale ground battle which had some interesting stop-motion animation which deemed to be pretty effective for a movie of the early '80s, and at times looked rather advanced to execute. the special effects were great, overall, for a movie from around the time of raiders of the lost ark. after a while, the main characters split up and meet differing situations, before eventually both facing peril, both eventually managing to get out of this, but then, near the end of the movie, all being trapped in the same location, just in very different spots. what i really liked about the film, however, was this sense of isolation. an ice planet almost devoid of life, a forest planet with barely anyone to talk to, a lonely cave...i feel that this had an interesting influence on the perception of the interaction between some of the characters. the han/leia romance was one thing that kind of interested me due to the characters being of totally opposite personalities and origins, and the r2-d2/c3po conversations... now the personality of darth vader in this film was also to my liking. he very plainly didn't care how many admirals and captains he killed...after he needed them no further, or felt they had failed him, he disposed of them like they were nothing. what made this a bit funny, however, was how nobody seemed to care much if one of these persons was killed. i guess that's what they were used to. some characters return, some characters are new, and some characters have been disposed of. grand moff tarkin couldn't hold vader to his leash anymore, so vader could do as he wanted to whomever he felt fit, and he held an iron hand within the division of the empire that he controlled. this film also marks the first brief appearance of the personage named 'the emperor' back then, who would later be replaced by a different actor who would play in a few more star wars movies. after finishing this tv record, i eventually got hold of star wars: the phantom menace and the special editions of the original trilogy on vhs. some changes in these versions were crappy, some weren't that bad. however i don't get why some lines had to be replaced in the special editions and the later 2004 special editions. otherwise the only big change in the 1997 special edition seemed to be a more fleshed-out scene of the ice monster somewhere near the beginning of the film. after watching the special edition empire strikes back and the rest of the originals in that version for quite a few years, i kind of went silent on star wars...until the release of revenge of the sith, and then, after that, again.. then in 2007 i got a box of the original trilogy for christmas.. and the alterations in that box were a bit more than i could bear. they replaced the conversation between darth vader and the emperor with the actor that acted as the emperor in the later movies, which sounded pretty consistent to do, but the make-up and lighting of that version was screwed up, they changed the dialog for some reason.. the original emperor's projection had a face that was kept in the dark, and the 2004 dvd version's face was partially kept in the light and leaning backwards. also, colouring issues were present at certain times. well...after that i got the soundtracks and then the force unleashed, somewhere during 2008. and then i found the original version of this movie on dvd, as well as star wars and return of the jedi...and i decided to buy those versions, because i was tired of seeing an altered version of a classic that made it look as though it wasn't made in the '80s, when in fact it was. it would seem i prefer the unaltered version over any others, no matter how badly they try to soup it up. thank you, george lucas, for helping me turn back and look for the original version.;31 January 2009;10;['first', 'old', 'only', 'vague', 'phantom', 'much', 'first', 'interesting', 'good', 'main', 'other', 'main', 'worried', 'main', 'other', 'large', 'interesting', 'effective', 'early', 'advanced', 'special', 'great', 'main', 'same', 'different', 'devoid', 'lonely', 'interesting', 'interested', 'opposite', 'many', 'funny', 'new', 'fit', 'first', 'brief', 'different', 'few', 'more', 'phantom', 'special', 'original', 'crappy', 'bad', 'special', 'later', 'special', 'only', 'big', 'special', 'fleshed', 'special', 'few', 'silent', 'original', 'more', 'later', 'consistent', 'original', 'present', 'certain', 'original', 'tired', 'altered', 'unaltered', 'original'];0.1793010150768771

797;saml0921;"(spoilers ahead) even if you don't like war movies with violence, don't miss this film. it deserves to be in the top 10 films of all time in my opinion. unlike most star wars films, this one doesn't all focus on shooting and killing. much of it is centered on luke training to be a jedi and han and leia's romance. one of the first scenes in the movie is the best war scene that'll probably ever be made. the empire deploys ""imperial walkers"" to lumber slowly towards the rebel base to destroy the shield generator so that the imperial fleet can invade the rebel base. luke and company try to bring down the walkers in ""snowspeeders"", in one of the most enjoyable battle scenes to watch in the trilogy. the scene directly after that one is probably one of the best as well. han, leia, chewbacca, and c-3p0 are attempting to escape from the rebel base in the falcon, but run into two problems: the falcon's hyperdrive is damaged, making it impossible to go into lightspeed. secondly, the imperial fleet is right on top of them. in a brilliantly-thought-of scene, han escapes the tie fighters in an asteroid field and finds ""shelter"" in a big asteroid. those two scenes alone make this movie one of the best made ever. mark hamill, harrison ford, and carrie fisher return from the original film to play their parts even better (ford had a dramatic improvement from the first one) and billy dee williams played well as lando calrissian. a must see for anybody, even those who weren't huge fans of the series. my highest recommendations: ***** out of *****";29 September 2002;10;['top', 'most', 'much', 'luke', 'first', 'good', 'imperial', 'rebel', 'imperial', 'rebel', 'enjoyable', 'good', 'rebel', 'impossible', 'imperial', 'big', 'original', 'dramatic', 'first', 'huge', 'high'];0.2453571428571428
798;tom_owens_182;"i am sure that it goes without saying, but the empire strikes back is quite simply the best film in the star wars franchise. if not, one of the best films ever made. simply because it does not try to be flashy, it is film-making done at it's finest. the film has been out since 1980 so if you haven't seen it then you have either being living under a rock, or in a galaxy far far away. therefore i shall not discuss the plot too much. in short, the films picks up about a year after the first film. the empire has recovered from the defeat it suffered at the end of 'a new hope' and is back to crush the rebels. and they are succeeding, the rebels are forced back to the planet of hoth as it is one of their last outposts. (*not that it matters, but this entire battle scene is supposed to reflect the battle of stalingrad during the second world war*). having lost, the rebels split and so does the story. han solo and princess leia are forced to run from the empire and attempt to escape whilst luke must seek out yoda, a mysterious jedi master who will train luke in the ways of the force. the bulk of the film is these two stories being played out next to each other. the two stories ultimately rejoin in cloud city, on the planet of bespin. here, han solo and co. are captured by the empire after being betrayed by han's lifelong friend, lando calrissian. lando claims that he had no choice into his betrayal as the empire threatened his home world. han solo is frozen and taken away by boba fett (a bounty hunter). luke meanwhile senses this and abruptly ends his training to go to his friends needs. and attempting to rescue them, luke faces vader for the first time. the result is one the most epic battles in movie history that is heavy on atmosphere and one that the audience knows luke cannot win (after being told by yoda). the fight finishes with vader beating luke, cutting off his right hand and delivers one of the most immortal lines in movie history: ""no luke, i am your father"". although i am sure that everyone knows of this line now, back when the films as released, it must have been such a dramatic twist. this entire scene in cloud city is a true testament to how good film can be. the entire film is built up to this one scene and it delivers it so well. the film then pieces together towards the end and results in lando and chewbacca going to look for han solo, and luke comforting leia. it goes without saying, but all the basics of film making are covered perfectly. the story never lets up on the always impending danger of the empire. the characters all change like normal human beings during the film and by this point in the franchise, we care deeply about them having seen what they are going through. the tension is built up to a dramatic peak and is delivered all at once. if i were to pick one problem in this film (and that wasn't easy) it would be that it provides too much of a problem for the characters to overcome in the final part of the trilogy. the results in too many problems being solved quite quickly in return of the jedi. the most obvious being the death of boba fett. regardless, it acts at the perfect movie for the middle of the franchise with the characters facing their most difficult times and trying to find hope. this movie truly is a shining example of how films of all genres can be done extremely well. science fiction can be just as good as drama. awesome. 9/10";25 May 2010;9;['sure', 'good', 'good', 'flashy', 'fine', 'short', 'first', 'new', 'last', 'entire', 'second', 'mysterious', 'other', 'lifelong', 'frozen', 'first', 'epic', 'heavy', 'right', 'immortal', 'sure', 'dramatic', 'entire', 'true', 'good', 'entire', 'comforting', 'impending', 'normal', 'human', 'dramatic', 'easy', 'much', 'final', 'many', 'obvious', 'perfect', 'difficult', 'good', 'awesome'];0.1822974644403215

803;zafarbg;this film is sheer excellence. in my opinion, it's the best film of all time and the best film of the entire saga created by the visionary george lucas. i mean, where do i start? it has everything a star wars fan could ask for. from the masterful battle of hoth to the unexpected twist at the end, from sweet-talking lando and cult classic boba fett to iconic yoda, it's truly a masterpiece. as for the aspects, the story is the darkest of the trilogy, the screenplay is the best of the bunch, the direction is commendable, the score, as always, by john williams remains the best ever, special effects are top-notch and the characters and performances are fantastic. the opening crawl followed by the hoth sequences, especially the battle, is really enjoyable as it takes up most of the first act. its end shows luke, the protagonist flying with r2-d2 to dagobah, to find yoda while han, leia, c-3po and chewie escape from the imperial troops. the training sequences at dagobah are one of my favorites since yoda is such an interesting character who frank oz voiced humorously. as for the rest of the gang, the scenes inside the monster were funny and romantic courtesy of the one and only han solo. the escape to cloud city where they meet lando, han's old friend, and the cgi there is fantastic. lando's sweet-talking was one of the film's best bits along with harrison ford's charisma. meanwhile, the mysterious emperor reveals to darth vader that luke is anakin skywalker's son and luke decides to stop his stop his training and go to cloud city, to save han and leia,who might be in danger. after that, the third act is legendary. the duel between and darth vader and luke skywalker is one of the sagas's best moments, not to forget han's epic 'i know' response to leia's 'i love you' the pacing is ok, but might feel a bit slow if noticed or bored, which is impossible. also, the fun and light tone of the previous film is completely lacking compared but is expertly replaced by the suspenseful plot line. however, the ending may be a bit daft due to the fact that it isn't a complete conclusion and is kind of a cliff-hangar ending. as for the performances, james earl jones and frank oz's voice acting for vader and yoda respectively is really good, carrie fisher and mark hamill were satisfactory, anthony daniels was hilarious as c-3po.but the best of all was harrison ford as han solo, the epitome of cool, whose charisma and rugged good looks enough to make girls swoon were some of few great qualities that made him the film's best character and performer. he remains my favorite character in the whole saga. overall, the empire strikes back is the perfect movie with all the qualities a masterpiece should possess and packs a perfect sci-fi punch. the empire of george lucas truly struck back with a marvelous effort. score-10 grade-a+;23 January 2016;10;['sheer', 'good', 'good', 'entire', 'visionary', 'masterful', 'unexpected', 'sweet', 'classic', 'dark', 'good', 'commendable', 'good', 'special', 'top', 'fantastic', 'hoth', 'enjoyable', 'most', 'first', 'imperial', 'interesting', 'funny', 'romantic', 'old', 'fantastic', 'sweet', 'good', 'mysterious', 'third', 'legendary', 'good', 'epic', 'ok', 'slow', 'bored', 'impossible', 'light', 'previous', 'suspenseful', 'complete', 'good', 'satisfactory', 'hilarious', 'good', 'rugged', 'good', 'enough', 'few', 'great', 'good', 'favorite', 'whole', 'perfect', 'perfect', 'marvelous'];0.3568095238095237

817;r_scott73;it is not always possible for a sequel to re-capture the peculiar magic of an original film. 'the empire strikes back' manages to do so by being less of a sequel than it is a new film on its own. the story begun in 'star wars' is advanced, the characters & their relationships with one another are deepened and the film itself abandons much of the easy spirit of the first film in favour of a darker and more uncertain tone. if the first film was largely about heroism, the second is largely concerned with struggle. the main characters are soundly tested in this film and for the most part, they come up short. this is also the film that transforms darth vader into one of the screen's great villains. vader was interesting in 'star wars,' but he is iconic in 'the empire strikes back' and he rightfully takes his place as not only a great villain, but a great character. in spite of the despair that runs through the film, the visuals and imagination so apparent in 'star wars' returns here, as well. the film is littered with awesome action sequences and more than enough 'coolness' to measure up to its predecessor. again, the original (1980) version is the one to see - if given the option - although the enhancements made to this film are somewhat less invasive than those applied to 'star wars.' still, the film is more charming and more polished its original release. it is considerably less delightful than its predecessor, but it is every bit as good of a film, if not even slightly superior to 'star wars.';17 March 2012;10;['possible', 'peculiar', 'original', 'less', 'new', 'own', 'advanced', 'much', 'easy', 'first', 'dark', 'uncertain', 'first', 'second', 'concerned', 'main', 'most', 'short', 'great', 'interesting', 'iconic', 'great', 'great', 'apparent', 'awesome', 'more', 'enough', 'original', 'invasive', 'charming', 'original', 'delightful', 'good', 'superior'];0.3998171368861023

819;PeterPPK;the first star wars movie, is a sci-fi and cinematic masterpiece. but where star wars capitalized, empire strikes back took it to the next level. here's what i think of the movie: story - i'm pretty sure we all know the story of star wars. a galactic empire is empowering the galaxy, and a rebel alliance tries to stop it. today, it's sort of a cliche plot but back then, it was imagination skyrocketing into the heavens. now, thats the plot of star wars. the story spans from a battle on the frigid planet of hoth, to a space dogfight in an asteroid field, to cloud city where the greatest plot twist in the history of cinema, is reveled. the film ends on a cliffhanger which leads to return of the jedi. i'm not going to spoil it, but i don't think i would need to because i'm willing to bet that about 99.99% of people have already seen this movie anyway(to that .01%, where the hell have you been?). -rating 10/10 characters - the characters from the original movie are back, including luke, han, leia, c3p0 and r2d2, and of course, darth vader. but the films also introduces some new characters as well, including lando, the emperor, boba fett, and yoda. the emperor doesn't really play a big part in the movie(i think he only has like, 10 lines) and boba's name is never really mentioned. however, yoda plays a big part by teaching luke the ways of the force, and lando, who is han's old pal, plays a big part by betraying our heroes and giving them to vader. of course, he's still a good guy, he had to hand them over. overall, i'd say the characters are still great. <ul><li>rating 10/10 </li></ul> visuals - this was back when star wars movies didn't rape the fabric of cgi. so what you see in the movie were real things. the walkers, asteroids, x-wings, tie fighters, everything. the original star wars set the standards for special effects with the light sabers, death stars blowing up and everything. empire strikes back isn't any different. the effects are still awesome and look great. -rating 10/10 music - the star wars theme is (of course) still here and it's one of the most recognized themes in cinema. you only need to hear a second of the star wars theme, and you'll know what it is. like any other star wars film, the music is composed by john williams, so everything is played by an orchestra. even though it's great the here the star wars theme in all it's nostalgic glory, the music thats played is still just as great. -rating 10/10 overall - empire strikes back is my favorite star wars film and is one of my favorite movies. if i had to make a top 10 list of my favorite movies, about 15 movies would be tied for the #1 spot, and this would be one of them. everything about it is just perfect. final rating : 10/10 -peterppk;26 October 2009;10;['first', 'cinematic', 'next', 'sure', 'galactic', 'rebel', 'frigid', 'great', 'willing', 'original', 'new', 'big', 'big', 'old', 'big', 'good', 'great', 'real', 'original', 'special', 'light', 'different', 'awesome', 'great', 'other', 'great', 'nostalgic', 'great', 'overall', 'favorite', 'favorite', 'top', 'favorite', 'perfect', 'final'];0.3158127029220778

821;moronicfables;"back in the 80's, people were very excited for the release of the empire strikes back, the much-awaited sequel to the phenomenal star wars. but, i can imagine, they were also wondering if it would be as good as star wars. no, it's not. it's much better. there's more action, the characters become richer and we are introduced to new ones. thankfully, lucas backed down in directing and/or writing the film. considered as the best film among the trilogy, the empire strikes back starts with the whole gang staying at a rebel base in the ice planet of hoth. after almost getting mauled by a wampa beast, luke gets a message from obi-wan kenobi to go to the planet of dagobah and look for a jedi master named yoda. the imperial army arrives and tries to destroy the base, but the rebels have already escaped, with luke accompanied by r2-d2 goes to dagobah. the battle of hoth is easily my favorite action scene in the whole trilogy. while han, leia and chewbacca are hiding from the imperial army that's chasing them, luke meets the 800 year-old jedi master yoda. full of wisdom and a funny way of talking, yoda trains luke to be a real jedi and teaches him the ways of a jedi. almost nothing happens in the middle of the film, except for great character development and lots of intelligent dialogue. it manages to keep us interested and excited without having too many action scenes. we get to know more about all the characters, including the villains and new characters that we are introduced to. we then meet lando calrissian who lives in bespin, a city that floats among the clouds. lucas hardly touched this masterpiece, but he still added some more striking visuals, most of which aren't unnecessary. more windows are added to the buildings in bespin, adding lot more light and life to the settings. the visuals added aren't a bother anymore, and for once probably made a scene look better. han and leia don't trust lando, to which we soon find out that they were right about their feelings toward him. luke forsees that they're in trouble and goes to make sure that they're all right. as han solo is about to be frozen, leia finally admits to han that she loves her. to which han replies with, ""i know."" it's an incredibly touching and emotional scene, where things are just about to get worse. as luke arrives at bespin, he encounters darth vader, to which father and son fight. quite possibly the best lightsaber fight in all the star wars films, the scene is filled with so much emotion and a shocking revelation. luke sacrifices his own life rather than join the dark side, and is saved by leia and chewbacca, along with lando, after much threats from chewy. the film ends on such a downbeat note, keeping a cliffhanger for the final movie in the trilogy. the characters have yet to face another adventure, and learn more from each other as the imperial is yet to be beaten and solo to be rescued. it's not a happy ending, or should i say, a beginning for the characters as what the future holds from them is yet to be known. it shouldn't be a suprrise from anyone that the empire strikes back is considered by many as the best of the trilogy, because the film is a great stepping-stone for the characters we've grown to love in the first film and introduces us to new ones that we easily grow to love and care for. that's what makes star wars a great trilogy in the first place: it's the characters we remember. not the visuals. 10";13 November 2004;10;['excited', 'phenomenal', 'good', 'well', 'more', 'rich', 'new', 'good', 'whole', 'rebel', 'imperial', 'favorite', 'whole', 'imperial', 'old', 'full', 'funny', 'real', 'great', 'intelligent', 'interested', 'excited', 'many', 'more', 'new', 'striking', 'most', 'unnecessary', 'more', 'more', 'well', 'right', 'sure', 'right', 'about', 'touching', 'emotional', 'about', 'bad', 'good', 'much', 'shocking', 'own', 'dark', 'much', 'downbeat', 'final', 'more', 'other', 'solo', 'happy', 'many', 'good', 'great', 'first', 'new', 'great', 'first'];0.3378833932025422

827;erikoksman;as someone who didn't watch any of the original star wars movies until early 2010's, i've had an indifferent relationship with them. i have always wanted to really like them but i never really could do to some of my issues with the films. concerning star wars: episode v - the empire strikes back(1980) it was probably my least favourite of the three alongside return of the jedi. i'm still not quite sure whether i like it as much as a new hope, but i learned to appreciate it more than before. i'm going to be comparing this movie quite a lot to its predecessor as its a direct sequel and makes the writing easier for me. this movie didn't have as many stunning visuals as a new hope did. a few shots that stand out for me are shots of the imperial fleet and also some shots of the cloud city. on the other hand i feel like with the help of nice camerawork and more interesting locations and sets the visuals are overall more pleasing than in new hope. dagobah and the set of lukes and darth vaders stand off especially impressed me. however, i feel like there was a lot more stop motion animation here and it was awfully distracting for me. the scene where luke flings himself to the at-at and the scene where luke falls to the carbon freezing chamber and then jumps out before darth vader could even realize are examples of scenes that are supposed to be tense but i find them really funny due to how ridiculous it looks. some times the matte paintings also stood out quite badly but that i could deal with. explosions looked much better than in a new hope. the sound design remained awesome. also some really nice additions to the score especially the ever so famous: the imperial march. the first half of the first act of this movie is about luke getting rescued from the wampa/snowstorm. while it adds some important things to the overarching story like han willing to risk his life for a friend and reminding the viewer that luke is in fact capable of using the force, i feel like like it's quite wasteful writing. it sort of feels like a too long prologue for me. after that the imperials attack hoth and some rebels die in the process of trying to slow them down. we get some reaction shots of luke when they die but we never really have time to feel any emotion for them. this makes me care less about the rebels as our main characters don't seem to care all that much. other than that the battle on hoth is quite fun. the second act is split into following leia, han solo, 3-cpo, r2-d2 and chewbacca trying to escape the imperials in the millenium falcon and following luke pursue his own path trying to become a jedi. other than a few nice chase sequences between the imperials and the falcon and the chemistry between 3-cpo and han, i wasn't all too invested. on the other hand everything related to luke was some of the most enjoyable cinema i have ever seen. dagobah as a location, literally everything about yoda, lukes struggles... i just wish we would have seen more of lukes training instead of imperials chasing the falcon. luke decides to, what may initially look like an act of selflessness, very selfishly try to save his friends putting everyone in the rebel alliance under danger. the third act is pretty interesting altogether. finally the relationship between leia and han the whole movie has worked on pays off. leia finally admits to loving han as he is frozen in carbonate. after that we get iconic first meeting between luke and darth vader. apart from a few nitpicks, this scene is pretty much flawless to me. i kind of wish luke didn't survive in such a stupid fashion although i understand it was necessary for him to believe he was killing himself and that he had to survive. we end lukes arc in such an interesting state. he is healing from the fact his whole vision of the universe has shattered (also physically in the form of a new hand) as he always looked up to his father as an inspiration only for the face of evil to be revealed to him as his true father. he learns that his actions have consequences and that he was lucky he even survived. now he knows he must be able to truly control the force if he wants to defeat vader. this movie introduced two very welcome characters to the universe. let's start off with yoda. he is first introduced as a truly hilarious comic relief later for the viewer to discover he was only playing with lukes patience. everything yoda says and the way he says it is always perfect. one of the greatest and most iconic characters ever. then there is the friend of han solo, lando calrissian who resembles han solo (at least before this movie) : he is charismatic and on the thin line between good and evil. the difference between lando and han is that in a serious situation han puts others ahead of his own greed whereas lando initially doesn't. after lando learns that he can't negotiate with vader he risks everything and redeems himself. whereas i feel like this movie has the highest highs in the trilogy so far i feel like the structure of the story lacks consistency required for me to give it 8/10 at the moment. so, i will give it a very strong 7/10 instead.;2

840;bimpsonbimpson;"the empire strikes back is the second film in the star wars original trilogy, released three years after the unexpected successor, star wars. directed by irvin kershner and seeing the return of mark hamill, harrison ford and carrie fisher, the empire strikes back is considered by many to be the greatest film in the star wars saga, me included, and here is why i myself love it. right away we are thrown back into the mix, not all too long after where we left off at the end of star wars, darth vader is determined to find luke and, even after a huge defeat, their huge power is still apparent as the empire's stretch reaches all corners of the galaxy. the title is very fitting for a film like this, the enemy are going to get their revenge with everything they get. the dark side has never been as threatening as it was in this film. one of best parts about this film is how dark it is, after a fairly safe first episode we get to see our heroes pushed to their limit and put in very dark places. they separate, they are tricked and by the end of the film you could say they were defeated. this is what makes empire strikes back so emotionally investing and powerful. one thing i didn't like about star wars were the visuals and colour pallet, don't get me wrong the special effects and models were fantastic but i just didn't like how it looked as a whole, but i have to say this film looked gorgeous, the dark blacks and blues that symbolise the dark side's influence and the film's tone in general. the model and effects work again was absolutely stunning, the battle of hoth is still mind-blowing to this day. cloud city looks moody yet beautiful displaying how even a place as gorgeous as this isn't safe. the final confrontation between luke and vader with the strong colours and the dark lighting made for one of the best looking scenes in the entire saga. the previously mediocre acting evolved into some convincing and excellent performances this time around. the characters were now a lot more attached to each other leading to a better chemistry between them and some great scenes ranging from emotional, funny and action packed. every line is memorable and brilliantly delivered, making the already fantastic dialogue even better. the scenes on dagobah with yoda are magical, beautiful yet dark, hopeful yet brooding. the dialogues and monologues are at its highest points here, lines like ""luminous beings are we, not this crude matter"" and ""what's in there?"" ""only what you take with you"" are the kind of memorable lines that stay with you for life. yoda himself is a wonder of puppetry, being so emotive with such an extraordinary personality while only being a rubber puppet is real feat and they pull it off expertly, making one of the most classic characters in the entirety of cinema. overall the empire strikes back is not only the best star wars film but one of the best sci-fi films of all time, dark and beautiful, the heroes are pushed and tested right to their breaking point and pretty much being the loser by the end of this film was a really bold move and it paid off. its dark atmosphere made for some tense moments of conflict both personal relationships and large scale battles that will have you on the edge of your seat as you become completely captivated in such a unique and interesting universe that seems to have no end to what could be in store. constant twists and turns and rises and falls make for one hell of a ride. if you had to watch one star wars film ever, make it this one.";22 January 2016;9;['second', 'original', 'unexpected', 'carrie', 'many', 'great', 'determined', 'huge', 'huge', 'apparent', 'fitting', 'dark', 'good', 'dark', 'safe', 'first', 'dark', 'powerful', 'wrong', 'special', 'fantastic', 'gorgeous', 'dark', 'dark', 'general', 'stunning', 'moody', 'beautiful', 'gorgeous', 'safe', 'final', 'strong', 'dark', 'good', 'entire', 'mediocre', 'convincing', 'excellent', 'attached', 'other', 'well', 'great', 'emotional', 'funny', 'memorable', 'fantastic', 'magical', 'beautiful', 'dark', 'hopeful', 'high', 'luminous', 'crude', 'memorable', 'emotive', 'extraordinary', 'real', 'classic', 'good', 'good', 'dark', 'beautiful', 'bold', 'dark', 'tense', 'personal', 'large', 'unique', 'interesting', 'constant'];0.2667720530835284
841;NegativeReviewBot;sadly , i did not heed my instincts after watching star wars and decided to follow up with what the fans call the greatest chapter of this saga. it certainly makes for a good bookend. after blowing up a giant floating orange and being given a medal (for that?!?) , our farm boy finds him self not in kansas anymore . in fact not even northern canada gets this cold. now the rebels are hiding on a planet with plenty of available ice for cocktails. and you the viewer will need it. han and leia are in love? when did this happen? how can a politically driven woman like that suddenly chair the committee of lousy lover oversight. then again this woman did kiss her own brother. after the dripping sap of exchanges between these two you will probably want to kiss a wookie yourself. and the farm boy he decides that with the entire imperial fleet looking for him it's time for an episode of national geographic. most people don't need to be hit by a meteor to figure out that riding alone on planet thats average high is about 2 is a bad idea. does that bit of common sense stop our hero nope. how ever a ten foot cave beast does the job just as well. after performing a few magic tricks and slicing the beast in to a bored submission our hero decides he'll have better chances in the whiteout styled blizzard outside. his chances ? 725 to 1. r2 has been wrong before though. particularly on the 3,720 to 1 odds that han solo is in a lovers quarrel and not thinking clearly. our hero with the aid of han survives . all so he can face the empire . i would say at this point that the rebels choked on their ground fight , but the choking admiral ozzell received should have been directed at the effects team ( i can see the fishing wire moving the walkers, really i can see it) after the abysmal turn of events on hoth our farm boy hero decides nearly freezing to death on an ice planet was so last episode and proceeds to strand him self on a world of endless jungle at the advice of his dead jedi friend. one would think seeing dead people is enough but no. along with seeing and talking to dead folks we also follow the wise tutelage of talking green puppets ( honestly is yoda what kermit will look like in the year 2689?) i wish it was over but there is more hot air to come. while learning how to poison sith with bad cooking (himself the guinea pig) the farm boy has a vision of his two friends being tortured by darth vader. its not as bad as your torture however. as we wander around the endless hallways that seem replete with a single image of clouds everywhere. we ask ourselves was there maybe something more exciting we could use as a background in cloud city? no matter how many times this metal balloon went around the world it could not avoid darth vader. han is captured and frozen for later review. lando the city's leader and han's friend (guess relations cooled after that incident. he really didn't forget) stands around looking dazed as vader runs amuck. then of course our hero shows up. he is warned that it is a trap.he keeps going . he knowingly steps over the door rise , that his droid can't use its thrusters to get over for reasons episode ll or it being 1980 can't readily explain. to no ones surprise he comes face to face with darth vader. after a brilliant round of laser fencing and one of the single greatest bat swings in light saber fight history , our hero is unhanded. then the most unbelievable scene of the entire film . darth vader is the father of our hero. im supposed to believe a machine fathered a normal humanoid. next you'll tell me the only difference between mt. dew and mello yello is bromanated vegetable oil and carob bean gum. will this train wreck story line ever end. the droids are horrible actors . c3po s performance alone fell to pieces. not even hiring a stand in director saved this. i m certain it was nice to shift the bulls eye however.;16 May 2017;1;['great', 'good', 'giant', 'northern', 'cold', 'available', 'lousy', 'own', 'dripping', 'entire', 'imperial', 'most', 'average', 'high', 'bad', 'common', 'few', 'magic', 'bored', 'well', 'wrong', 'admiral', 'abysmal', 'last', 'endless', 'dead', 'dead', 'enough', 'dead', 'wise', 'green', 'hot', 'bad', 'bad', 'endless', 'replete', 'single', 'exciting', 'many', 'later', 'brilliant', 'single', 'great', 'light', 'unhanded', 'unbelievable', 'entire', 'normal', 'only', 'vegetable', 'horrible', 'certain', 'nice'];0.0268506493506493

848;asu_tbone;say what you like about a new hope, return of the jedi, or the phantom menace. for sheer emotional power, this one has got them all blown out of the water. the first time i saw any of the star wars movies was when i was laid up at home after having my wisdom teeth removed the summer before my senior year in high school. the movies just blew me away, but not having time to get overly attached to any of them, i decided that the empire strikes back was the best, for many reasons. we get more plot in this movie than in any of the other three. there isn't necessarily as much action as the more exciting return of the jedi, nor is it all as new and visually exciting as a new hope, but the story is more important here than all that extra stuff. when the original star wars came out, people were so blown away by the special effects that no one really noticed what a bad movie it was. not that it was a terrible movie, but the dialogue was terrible, the acting was atrocious, and the direction was, well, choppy. it was a great movie, but very badly made. does this ring a bell? sounds almost exactly like what we have been hearing about the phantom menace, doesn't it? return of the jedi was a much better movie than a new hope. all the actors had gotten a little better. it was a very different cast than in the original. the action was more intense, the story was wrapping up, and we got one final titanic battle with the empire. special effects technology had gotten better as well. the biggest problem with the movie was how long-winded it was. how many ways can the emperor phrase the same statement? you'll have to watch it to find out. which brings me to the empire strikes back. the action wasn't as intense, the acting wasn't a whole lot better, and loyal star wars fans got ticked off at how cute yoda was. there's really no pleasing some people, you know? they reacted the exact same way with the ewoks and jar jar binks. amazing. anyway, with all these problems, why go see the movie? the answer: here is where the plot thickens. just when it seemed that the rebellion had gotten the empire on the run, the empire comes back and just about crushes their best hopes. we get the shocking truth about darth vader's identity (well, it was shocking when the movie came out...i don't think anyone who has even heard of star wars doesn't know it by now). we get crucial hints to the relationship between luke and leia. you get murder, betrayal, and a truly terrifying encounter in the swamps of dagobah (hint: not yoda). there is so much more to this movie than to any of the others. that's the reason i consider it to be the best so far. i'm ready for episode ii.;24 October 2000;9;['new', 'phantom', 'sheer', 'emotional', 'first', 'senior', 'high', 'good', 'many', 'more', 'other', 'much', 'exciting', 'new', 'exciting', 'new', 'important', 'extra', 'original', 'special', 'bad', 'terrible', 'terrible', 'atrocious', 'choppy', 'great', 'phantom', 'well', 'new', 'little', 'well', 'different', 'original', 'intense', 'final', 'titanic', 'special', 'well', 'big', 'many', 'same', 'intense', 'whole', 'loyal', 'cute', 'pleasing', 'exact', 'same', 'amazing', 'good', 'shocking', 'shocking', 'crucial', 'terrifying', 'more', 'good', 'ready'];0.0810536165223665

861;johnmmxii;"i saw the empire strikes back (tesb) when i was 13 or 14, and i didn't like it back then. i've seen it many times since, and in my later views i really wanted to like it, but i ended up disliking it even more. the first sign of silliness in my eyes was the snow-speeders equipped with harpoons and towing cables. why should anyone install a harpoon to a flying machine? it turns out to topple at-ats. but how did they know they'd fight against walking moto-quadrupeds? well, they didn't. it dawned on me that that was nothing more than lazy storytelling. create the outcome first (tackle walking machines), invent how to generate it (using cables) later. and do it again, this time with luke. why did luke flee the cave into the cold snow storm instead of killing the wampa? because he had to come to the brink of death. and why is that? because just before passing out he needs to see obi-wan's ghost. and what's it doing there? obi-wan's spirit is there to tell luke where to find yoda. sorry but this is nonsense. first, the flow of the story is backwards, because at the time luke leaves the cave, he has no reason to do so; he should have killed the wampa and stayed inside. second, this part of the story must be about setting our main character in motion. luke needs a motivation to pursue his jedi training. one may argue that this must be the natural outcome of the first film. but still, mr lucas owes the viewer a decent sequence showing how luke discovers where yoda lives. the way luke is informed of dagobah in tesb is simply bad storytelling. that also leads to a hollow first act. the action in there has nothing to do with luke's storyline. the battle of hoth is completely pointless. the first act must be all about sending luke to dagobah. luke will go there anyway with or without this useless battle. but instead of watching luke discover yoda and dagobah, we have to watch some silly battle. as a consequence, we have a first act disjointed from the rest of the film. the action is isolated from, and not related to, the further events. you can start watching the film 35 minutes into it, when luke gives r2 the coordinates of the dagobah system. there's nothing that makes sense before, explaining why luke wants to finish his training, or how he knows where to go. for further study, compare this to how the story unfolds in a new hope. things don't go well in the second act either. the story forks, and i have the feeling that mr lucas didn't know what to do with han solo and leia, and decided to hide them inside the stomach of a giant space eel. luke in dagobah scenes don't fare better. luke is a pilot and is supposed to be top physical form. why all the physical training? and it contradicts with what yoda says: luminous beings are we, not this crude matter. actually the problem is deeper. jedi training is obviously not well thought of. it may look impressive on paper, with stream of consciousness and the like, but all we see on screen is a guy running with a backpack full of rocks, or trying to levitate things around him. the film is sort of alright 75 minutes into it, after yoda moves luke's x-wing out of the swamp. but not enough to make it more than 4 stars out of 10. don't forget that some of the things the fans pan in return of the jedi and in the prequels are present in tesb some way, though not as pronounced as in the prequels. i have to come back to that but the first act of the empire strikes back is a disaster. i've tried to make objective points anyone could check for themselves, you like this film or not. if you think that tesb is flawless, please think twice.";7 May 2014;4;['many', 'later', 'first', 'more', 'lazy', 'cold', 'main', 'jedi', 'natural', 'first', 'decent', 'bad', 'hollow', 'first', 'pointless', 'first', 'useless', 'silly', 'first', 'further', 'further', 'new', 'second', 'giant', 'top', 'physical', 'physical', 'luminous', 'crude', 'deep', 'impressive', 'like', 'full', 'enough', 'more', 'present', 'first', 'objective', 'flawless'];0.0783249158249158

'imperial march' is one of the best movie themes i've ever heard. the sets are bigger and much more exotic. all the actors are doing pretty good job. irvin kershner is doing a good job, but i was disappointed that lucas didn't direct. one of the reasons i liked this movie better than the original is because, that now, we get to know the characters feelings and thoughts. in the original we only got the know the characters. the love between han and leia, the wisdom of yoda and of course the father relationshp between darth vader and luke.;5 May 2005;10;['first', 'original', 'many', 'visual', 'well', 'long', 'well', 'imperial', 'good', 'big', 'exotic', 'good', 'good', 'disappointed'];0.2659090909090909
865;firefalcoln-927-427092;empire is an entertaining film and a terrific setup for the finale. the battle and setup at hoth is entertaining. the exchanges between han and lea are entertaining. the droids are quite funny in this one, but don't belittle the drama. the development of darth vader and the empire is vicious and well placed. the end a real cliff hanger and a surprise the first time through. so why not 10 stars? my main complaint of the film is the middle act isn't exciting. just think for a second about all the fun action in the middle of a new hope compared to empire. in a new hope they get on the falcon, luke trains in the force, a planet is destroyed, they encounter the death star, they hide from the troops, they save the princess, obi-wan fights vader and dies, they fight off a ton of troops to get back to the falcon and they fight some tie fighters in the air to escape the death star. in empire strikes back han, lea and company try to escape the empire before eventually getting caught. darth vader and the empire decide to try to convert luke, and luke learns from yoda before eventually leaving against yoda's will to save his friends. sorry empire, but in comparison, that isn't a lot of excitement especially if you have already seen the film before. how could the middle act have been better you might ask? i say increase the pace of everything, especially yoda and luke's first meeting. maybe han could have had chewy and/or lea firing at the tie fighters and bombers from the gunner position while on the run. there also could have been a space fight with cloud city with lando saving the falcon crew at the last moment. all i'm saying is that there's a real excitement void in the middle act of the movie which everyone seems to gloss over. and i think this shortcoming is more than enough to make empire the worst, rather than the best of the original trilogy. it's still a solid film, but i like return of the jedi and a new hope more. and i'm bewildered by the masses who proclaim empire to be the best star wars movie or one of the best movies ever.;2 August 2015;7;['entertaining', 'terrific', 'entertaining', 'entertaining', 'funny', 'vicious', 'real', 'first', 'main', 'middle', 'exciting', 'fun', 'new', 'new', 'luke', 'sorry', 'middle', 'well', 'first', 'last', 'real', 'void', 'middle', 'more', 'enough', 'bad', 'good', 'original', 'solid', 'new', 'good', 'good'];0.1616341991341991

881;MrScotsman;"the empire strikes back is the last star wars property ever made that i genuinely love. it marked an early peak for the franchise and unfortunately it all went down hill from here (with some minor spikes later on). i genuinely have difficulty finding things wrong with this film, even in the special edition versions. the pacing is slower, yet more methodical and introspective. the character work is more well done, and the acting has gone up a couple notches. this is also the film that made darth vader iconic. though star wars was his first appearance, he had much more screen time here and was much more of a threat. of course there is the infamous ""no, i am your father"" twist that changed our perspective of the events of both this film and the previous one. there was a genuine effort to continue and expand the story and setting of this universe. this movie is not interested with fan-pandering and retreading the same water, but breaking new ground and the result is a different, but superior sequel. the empire strikes back is a darker and more mature film than its predecessor. there is less hopeful triumph and more loss and consequences. there is less black and white and much more grey. it continued the simple plot of the original, but made it just a bit more complicated and a lot more interesting. the best part of star wars was its structure and pacing, whereas empire's greatest strength is its character work and themes. i should also mention that this was the film that introduced yoda and further explained what the force really is. that vague, poetic description that he gave was all we really needed. it was a plot device that enriched the mythos of the franchise. luke, the main character was good in the original, but like most aspects of this film, he is expanded upon and improved as a result. his struggle is with his own impulsiveness and over reliance on strength and power, which is what he needs to work on if he is to become a true jedi. he deliberately goes against the wishes of his master to save his friends, but fails and loses a hand as a result. he learns the truth that neither obi-wan, nor yoda ever told him, which gives their actions and words (or the lack thereof) a different meaning in this context. the jedi masters are not without their flaws after all. the empire strikes back is a movie about facing the consequences for your actions, whether they be good or evil. it is realistic and grounded in that sense. it presents the audience with a story about struggle and failure and is not afraid to shy away from the more difficult aspects of life personified in this film if i said much more about empire, i would consider it an essay so i should wrap up. as a whole, this movie is incredible and thought provoking. there is not a single bad or tedious moment in this movie and hits all the right beats. the only problem with this film is that it ends and the franchise never reaches these heights again. not even close. i give the empire strikes back a 10/10 with the title of ""outstanding!""";27 December 2021;10;['last', 'early', 'minor', 'wrong', 'special', 'slow', 'methodical', 'introspective', 'first', 'more', 'more', 'infamous', 'previous', 'genuine', 'interested', 'same', 'new', 'different', 'superior', 'dark', 'mature', 'hopeful', 'more', 'black', 'white', 'more', 'simple', 'original', 'complicated', 'interesting', 'good', 'great', 'vague', 'poetic', 'main', 'good', 'original', 'most', 'own', 'true', 'different', 'good', 'evil', 'realistic', 'afraid', 'difficult', 'more', 'incredible', 'single', 'bad', 'tedious', 'right', 'only', 'close', 'outstanding'];0.1290743570155335

891;KlinePatsy;star wars is a saturday morning breakfast serial, with the upbeat 'let's have an olympic medal ceremony' ending...empire discards the fluffiness and moves away from its simplistic predecessor's obvious appeal to the child fanbase, without scaring everybody away in the process. the 2nd star wars film takes the original cast and subjects them to 2 hours of major discomfort...a forbidding icy planet replete with nasty creatures. there are ugly bounty hunters, monsters hiding out in the depths of asteroid fields, and luke's foray into the black swamp of the degobah system. it's a more taut, curiously downbeat film that slows almost to a halt in places, as luke meets the jedi master who will teach him the ways of the force. the set pieces more than make up for the lack of pace...the opening battle on the ice planet is a visually effective affair, and the stormtroopers have never looked as cool when they don their winter outfits. the asteroid chase and cloud city sequence are visual treats, that take you into the mysterious heart of the star wars universe. the character development glues everything together. luke's maturing process in the darkness of degobah..han and leia's romantic chemistry, the droids comic relief and interplay with chewbacca solidifies the group together and establishes a team spirit that was coming together at the end of episode iv. the centrepiece of the film is the epic showdown between luke and vader,with that massive revelation, which inevitably ranks as one of cinema's all time memorable moments. and it's a great sequence, from vader's sobering welcome 'the force is with you young skywalker, but you are not a jedi yet' to the almost surreal climax. the forces of darkness loom large at every turn of the film...you get the feeling that the rebels are just slightly out of their depth. there is an underlying menace at work that heightens the dramatic tension..vader is never as beautifully evil as he is in empire. we finally see just why he is (emperor aside) the top dog in the galaxy, as he lays waste to his own generals in ruthless fashion. we get some great new characters...han's old buddy lando calrissien (sp?) is the slimy administrator of cloud city, who finds himself in a no-win situation, and there's the legendary boba fett..bounty hunter with balls of steel, and an outfit so cool it instantly establishes him as a star wars icon. and of course, the emperor rears his ugly head, and we get a taster of his malevolance. any faults? it's hard to find much complaint. some of the dialogue strays into cheeseland, the pace is interrupted with the curious but necessary degobah scenes, but all in all, the sum of the parts adds up to a supremely effective, tightly woven sci-fi drama, the most deliciously dark of all star wars movies, and the most mature. classic entertainment, stuck in a time capsule of its own, with enough memorable moments to ensure its place in the higher echelons of cinema history.;5 August 2007;10;['olympic', 'simplistic', 'obvious', 'original', 'major', 'nasty', 'ugly', 'black', 'taut', 'downbeat', 'effective', 'cool', 'visual', 'mysterious', 'romantic', 'comic', 'epic', 'massive', 'memorable', 'great', 'young', 'surreal', 'large', 'underlying', 'dramatic', 'evil', 'top', 'own', 'ruthless', 'great', 'new', 'old', 'slimy', 'legendary', 'cool', 'ugly', 'hard', 'much', 'curious', 'necessary', 'effective', 'mature', 'classic', 'own', 'enough', 'memorable', 'high'];0.0810524231865695

893;King_of_IMDB;"in 1977 star wars episode iv, the revolutionary sci-fi fantasy film, played on screens all over the world and changed the word cinema as we know it today. star wars gave new meaning to visual appeal and opened an entire galaxy of aliens, heroes, villains, soldiers, and legends to everyone everywhere. with inflation accounted for, star wars still stands as the best box office hit ever. but despite all the accomplishments of star wars episode iv without the success of episode v: the empire strikes back the star wars series would never have reached the longevity and greatness it has today. we all know the story. luke is the last (as portrayed then) hope for a struggling rebel alliance trying to put a stop to the harsh, tyrannical rule of the galactic empire. along with a bizarre group of companions (chewbacca, han solo, leia, obi-wan kenobi, c3po, and r2d2) luke goes from a typical poor farmer boy to blowing up the biggest space station in the empire. the empire strikes back elaborates. with obi-wan having been killed by the mysterious darth vader luke meets the isolated and nearly deranged jedi master yoda. han solo and leia make shelter at the city in the clouds only to be betrayed by lando, han's old friend who is the proprietor of the city. with his friends in captivity with the empire, luke abandons his training with yoda prematurely and goes to save them. luke and vader confront one another giving the world the first great lightsaber duel and a true look at the power of the 'force' and its manifestations. vader tells luke the notorious ""i am your father"" line and the biggest twist in cinema history is sealed. they all escape (save solo), luke minus a hand chopped off by vader. han solo is frozen in carbonite. needless to say there is no definite ending, which is okay for a 2nd of 3 movies. what makes the empire strikes back so great cannot be cornered to one portion or aspect. -creator george lucas already had the story which obviously helps. many sequels fail because they lack freshness and creativity. lucas had the stories for 12 episodes before even releasing episode iv. -yoda and lando were the only new characters and frank oz and billy dee williams both had firm grips on the story and their roles in the plot. -the revelation that luke's father was actually very alive and in fact darth vader was one of the most anticipated but yet not surely known twists ever. -the visuals in episode v kept par and passed episode iv. the ice planet hoth, the city in the clouds, dagobah, and the asteroid monster were all amazing eye candy in 1980. -irvin kershner also did a brilliant job directing, much better than lucas himself did in any of the prequels or episode iv. he made the original encounter with yoda perfect. it was as not only was luke meeting yoda, but so were you. -and of course, john williams served up another score of brilliance. he's the best composer to ever work in film. what the empire strikes back truly does is save the star wars series. if this movie was some half-attempted low rent film that coasted off the success of the original like almost every other sequel out there we would not be here now talking about the prequels and the return of the jedi would have been some movie that topped the box-office for one weekend before falling into oblivion. this movie maintained the greatness of the original and then some. the perfect sequel for the perfect trilogy, this movie, it is.";10 June 2005;10;['revolutionary', 'new', 'visual', 'entire', 'good', 'last', 'harsh', 'tyrannical', 'galactic', 'bizarre', 'typical', 'poor', 'big', 'isolated', 'old', 'first', 'great', 'true', 'notorious', 'big', 'needless', 'definite', 'okay', 'great', 'many', 'only', 'new', 'frank', 'firm', 'alive', 'anticipated', 'amazing', 'brilliant', 'well', 'original', 'perfect', 'good', 'low', 'original', 'other', 'original', 'perfect', 'perfect'];0.2716017316017316

895;jamie-wire;for me, the empire strikes back is one of the best films i have seen. it is the best of the five star wars films, though perhaps that is down to director irvin kershner who tweaked george lucas's original vision into something darker than the original and infinitely bleaker than the follow-up return of the jedi. lucas reportedly hated 'empire' upon seeing what kershner had done to his film and put together another cut that he later conceded was inferior, and kershner's vision made it to screens around the world. ***spoilers*** the empire strikes back serves as an interesting bridge between a new hope and 'jedi', introducing force masters yoda and the emperor (the latter not yet played by the magnificent ian mcdiarmid who took on the role in return of the jedi three years later), while at the same time taking the original gang of characters and splitting them up in different directions, a scenario copied to the point of tedium by the expanded universe books. based upon the 'classic trilogy', darth vader is one of cinema's greatest villains and perhaps it will take until the release of the sixth film in 2005 to be sure what effect the prequels will have had on that image. in 'a new hope' we are introduced to a near-merciless killer and his evil nature seems to have grown by the time of 'empire'. one by one, incompetent underlings make their way to the super star destroyer morgue as the sith lord searches for his prize. it isn't until 'jedi' that we feel vader to be human at all, despite the famous cliffhanger end to this film. it's hard to define what this film means to me, other than alot. hopefully the dvd is not be lightyears away. 10/10;16 June 2003;10;['good', 'good', 'original', 'dark', 'original', 'bleaker', 'inferior', 'interesting', 'new', 'latter', 'magnificent', 'same', 'original', 'different', 'classic', 'great', 'sixth', 'sure', 'new', 'near', 'evil', 'incompetent', 'super', 'human', 'famous', 'hard', 'other'];0.1992108585858586

903;sawaat;"have you ever loved something so much, that when you sat down to discuss what exactly it is about it that you adore, you could not find the words? that is how i feel about the empire strikes back: and i haven't a clue how i am going to express myself in less than 1000 words, but by god i will try. these days, it's tough to find a movie sequel that is worth watching. it's the kind of thing that causes critics and casual fans alike to roll their eyes and say: ""really? another one??"" and it's true, sequels are usually the victims of poor script, less than decent acting and ugly visual effects. but don't lose hope my friends, if you are sick and tired of the sequels of the 21st century, i present to you star wars: the empire strikes back (1980), directed by irvin kershner and written by lawrence kasdan. the sequel to the astronomically (haw) successful film ""star wars"" (1977). arguably the best star wars film ever made, and definitely one of the best films ever made of the 20th century, tesb surprised and astounded audiences of all ages. who knew it could get any better than blown up death stars and garbage compactors? to begin, the film is relentlessly suspenseful right off the bat. not even ten minutes in, and our main heroes are already in a spot of trouble. something the last film accomplished but not to the same degree. and then, just when we think everyone is back together and all is well, a great snow battle ensues between the rebel alliance and the galactic empire. i would say that this is the jist of the plot of the film, but that's taking it way too lightly. what kershner does so well is he takes the characters that you have grown to love and pits them up against their darkest, most sinister fears. everyone is broken up, vulnerable, misguided and tortured (mentally and physically). and yet...the film can be quite humorous at times. while it does delve into deep, dark places, it never goes so far that you start to feel depressed with our heroes situation. it is still an extremely fun ride no matter which scene you're watching. one of the most enjoyable aspects of tesb is frank oz's incredible puppet yoda, or rather, his incredible portrayal of yoda, because at the end of the day, the little green creature is another character in the story. now when i saw this film when i was younger, i of course believed that yoda was a real thing. i didn't really know how movies were made back then. now of course, seeing it through adult eyes, now i know how the film makers operated yoda and brought him to life, but the whimsy is still there, he still feels completely real in every shot he is in. and i always feel like a kid again whenever he starts talking. the performances in esb are so much better, no doubt because of the stronger script and stronger direction. also that these actors have had three whole years to get to know their characters a bit better. mark hamill in particular, who may have rushed a few of his lines, or sounded maybe just a pitch too whiny in the previous film, has become such a grown character, not fully grown, but you can see a maturity there that simply didn't exist before. to hamill's credit, he is also a big reason why we can believe the existence of the non-human characters such as r2-d2 and master yoda. harrison ford and carrie fisher have perfect chemistry and none of their romantic scenes ever felt out of place. and lastly, although i have decided not to spoil anything, i will say that the ending to tesb is so incredibly unique and different to anything we have seen before, and we will never see anything like it again. the group is divided, characters have been injured, they aren't in the best of shape, but what do they do? they move on...they keep their optimism and hope. their situation is not perfect, but they are able to find a small shimmer of light in the growing shadows. and that's what makes this film so incredibly moving, what a perfect lesson for movie goers of all age demographics. that no matter how hopeless a situation is, somewhere there is an answer. therefore i give the empire strikes back a 10 out of 10. i struggled to find any faults with this movie, and was pleased that i could think of none. so i hope you go out and enjoy it as much as i have, and will continue to do so. may the force be with you!";27 November 2015;10;['much', 'less', 'tough', 'worth', 'casual', 'true', 'poor', 'less', 'decent', 'ugly', 'visual', 'sick', 'tired', 'successful', 'good', 'good', 'astounded', 'well', 'suspenseful', 'main', 'last', 'same', 'great', 'rebel', 'galactic', 'dark', 'sinister', 'vulnerable', 'misguided', 'tortured', 'humorous', 'deep', 'dark', 'depressed', 'fun', 'enjoyable', 'frank', 'incredible', 'incredible', 'little', 'green', 'young', 'real', 'real', 'well', 'strong', 'strong', 'whole', 'particular', 'few', 'whiny', 'previous', 'grown', 'big', 'non', 'human', 'such', 'perfect', 'romantic', 'unique', 'different', 'good', 'perfect', 'able', 'small', 'perfect', 'hopeless', 'pleased'];0.1509621144055106

914;connormurf;straight up, this movie is just so enjoyable to watch. i couldn't tell you the amount of quotable moments or movie influence this film has had at the time of its release. the characters, as if they weren't good enough already, are thrown into completely different scenarios to what they were presented with in 'a new hope', and it's because of that, we as the audience only grow to love them more. han solo's character in this film has changed significantly from the last film, and we are now presented with this half rebel, half scoundrel character that is trying to become a better person and leave his life of smuggling behind, only for him to be chased by the galactic empire across the galaxy alongside leia, chewbacca and c-3po. luke skywalker begins training to become a jedi, but still has this reckless trait about him that ultimately leads to his defeat in an impulsive and deadly duel against darth vader, who reveals to luke in one of the most memorable parts of the movie that he is luke's father. combined with breathtaking special effects and immersive storytelling, this film has risen to become one of the most influential films of all time, inspiring captivating and exciting storytelling and giving birth to the modern cliffhanger ending that many blockbuster films utilise to this very day. it is without any doubt, that star wars episode v: the empire strikes back, is an iconic piece of cinema that continues to be treasured and adored by many, and a film many would agree to be one of the greatest of all time.;16 September 2021;10;['enjoyable', 'quotable', 'good', 'different', 'new', 'last', 'half', 'rebel', 'well', 'galactic', 'reckless', 'impulsive', 'deadly', 'memorable', 'breathtaking', 'special', 'immersive', 'influential', 'exciting', 'modern', 'many', 'blockbuster', 'very', 'iconic', 'many', 'many', 'great'];0.4048024891774892

916;jmanhomer2007;a masterpiece. one of the greatest achievements in cinema history. this is the best episode in the epic star wars saga. i recall as a child to being bored with this one. the scene with luke is fighting vader involving a dream sequence was the first glimpse i ever saw of any star wars film. looking back makes me realize that this particular movie is special and personal to my heart. i grew up with all 6 movies. episodes 4,5, and 6 on vhs and episodes 1, 2 and 3 in theaters. let me explain why the empire strikes back is the pot of gold: the movie takes place in between a new hope and return of the jedi. the story is quite dark and leaves you hanging for the final showdown. yoda makes his first appearance on film and what a great one it is. han solo reveals another side of him and woos princess leia. who'd a thought that would happen? lando calrissian, another great new character to the star wars story. boba fett, a cult favorite. even though he appears on screen for 5 minutes, let's face it, he's a baddass no matter what! the #1 reason this film makes the top of the list is when the whole star wars tale goes awry. in which darth vader reveals he is luke skywalker's father. there will never be a roller coaster ride like this. it focuses on the continuing story, and still gives us some visually astounding action sequences all within 2 hours. the directing of the late irvin kershner is spot on along with the writing of george lucas. i recommend this film to any film student, sci fi fan or movie buff whether you are a star wars fan or not.;1 March 2011;10;['great', 'good', 'epic', 'bored', 'first', 'particular', 'special', 'personal', 'new', 'dark', 'final', 'first', 'great', 'great', 'new', 'favorite', 'whole', 'awry', 'astounding', 'late'];0.2550808840282524
917;netroach;"everyone ""knows"" that sequels are never as good as the original. the empire strikes back is not only better than the original sw, it is much better. characters who, in the original, had the depth of a puddle here develop and become human (or whatever). incidents contribute to a well-rounded whole instead of being cool stuff stuck in simply because it would be cool. even the far-too-obvious revelation (""i am your father, luke"") comes at a time and in a way that humanizes the until then mechanically evil vader. true, lucas' patented blend of bland mysticism with portentous pronouncements is still present, now represented by a muppet rather than alec guinness: but even that has been turned to the service of the story. the training of the hero has become more than a blend of fortune-cookie wisdom and how to hold your weapon; we see it as the difficult, painful, and frustrating thing it _must_ be, and in so seeing, we see luke as a potential hero and not the dumb hick he was throughout the first film.

959;kingsleyoafus;the empire strikes back is the ultimate sequel to the first (or fourth) film in the star wars saga, and also the best film. the reason for this is because of the darker tone, the new characters and irvin kershner as the director, so george lucas could concentrate on writing and producing the film. this film also has a better script that isn't as cheesy as a new hope or the prequel films. the story this time round has the empire recovering from their defeat at the rebels, and darth vader looking for their secret base. he sends out probes that find the rebel base on the ice world of hoth. on hoth, luke skywalker is out on patrol, when he is attacked by a wampa, a big snow creature, and han solo goes out looking for him. luke, who in the four years since a new hope has been training himself in the ways of the jedi, manages to defeat the wampa with his lightsaber. luke runs away from the wampa's cave and after a while, he collapses in the snow and sees a vision of obi-wan, now a ghost. he tells luke to complete his training with jedi master yoda on dagobah. then han solo arrives and they are rescued by a rebel scout in a snowspeeder. the empire arrives on hoth in their terrifying at-ats (all terrain attack transport) and the battle of hoth begins. this is one of the best moments of the original trilogy. after the battle, han solo, chewbacca, princess leia and c-3po go in the millennium falcon trying to outrun the empire, whilst luke and r2-d2 head to dagobah in their x-wing. on dagobah, we meet yoda. yoda is wise, strong and powerful. everything a jedi should be. he appears to be weak and old. we judge him by how small he is and so does luke. then we have that iconic moment when yoda lifts luke's x-wing out of the swamp. meanwhile, darth vader hires several bounty hunters to capture han solo and the millennium falcon. it is here when we are introduced to legendary bounty hunter boba fett (unless you watch attack of the clones before this or the special edition version of a new hope from 1997). han decides to go to the planet bespin, where his old friend lando calrissian, who is the administrator of cloud city, lives. but lando has had to sell han out to vader, who is already in cloud city because boba fett has been tracking the millennium falcon in his ship, slave 1. luke senses his friends are in danger and decides to leave, but yoda tells him he isn't ready and that it is a trap to lure him there. luke leaves anyway. back on bespin, vader uses a carbonite freezing chamber to freeze han solo, so that boba fett can deliver him to jabba the hutt. lando explains to leia and chewbacca that he had to sell them out in order for cloud city to be safe from the empire. they understand (maybe not chewbacca) and they try to free han, but they fail. luke arrives and has an epic lightsaber duel with him that ends in a shocking revelation....(not so shocking if you've seen the prequels before hand) the addition of yoda and lando are great and vader gets a larger role. as always, john williams' soundtrack is great and there are some breathtaking visuals.;3 August 2016;10;['ultimate', 'first', 'fourth', 'good', 'dark', 'new', 'well', 'cheesy', 'new', 'prequel', 'secret', 'rebel', 'big', 'new', 'rebel', 'terrifying', 'good', 'original', 'wing', 'wise', 'strong', 'powerful', 'weak', 'old', 'small', 'iconic', 'several', 'legendary', 'special', 'new', 'old', 'ready', 'carbonite', 'safe', 'epic', 'shocking', 'shocking', 'great', 'large', 'great'];0.1176534250063661

966;Ken L.;"the empire strikes back has remained one of my favorite films since i saw it as a seven year old in a theater on the ocean city boardwalk (nj). it was the first movie i really cared about--its offbeat and dark atmosphere is still a treat--and it introduced me to a wide range of cinema. few blockbuster movies are as unconventional and audacious. unlike the other two star wars movies, esb can be taken seriously or not taken seriously at all and still be thoroughly enjoyed. empire is the only movie of the series in which the acting is uniformly solid. despite their individual flaws, all three lead actors give convincing (if not quite oscar caliber) performances. irvin kershner, the man who directed this second chapter of the star wars trilogy, was a much better director of actors than either george lucas or richard marquand. the script, penned by the late, great leigh brackett (the big sleep, rio bravo) and lawrence kasdan (body heat, raiders of the lost ark) is the best written and most nuanced of the entire series. with kershner's help, the two screenwriters deepen the motivations of the movie's characters. the effect of this is two edged: han, leia, luke and the other characters in the series move closer to us and become mythic heroes at the same time. in esb, simple facial expressions convey a lot more about the characters than a ton of deadweight dialogue in star wars and return of the jedi. empire's pacing is brilliant. kershner unleashes the excitement early with two unforgettable action sequences, slows the movie down with a beautiful legato middle act, and then picks up the pace again with a moving and fast paced climax. the movie's editing and cinematography are nearly flawless. like pauline kael once said, empire's cascading and visceral images stay with the viewer long after he or she has finished watching the movie. the empire strikes back has a soulfulness and emotional richness that the other two star wars movies lack. every frame is packed with beautiful, flowing visuals. the picture is a precise, yet heartfelt piece of moviemaking---something that children and adults can appreciate and love. empire strikes back carries most of the emotional load of the star wars trilogy, yet does so with such subtlety and grace that it is often overlooked in the greater scheme of the ""star wars myth"". in fact, i would go so far as to say that what transpired in this middle chapter of the series allowed the series to gain ""mythic"" resonance with the public. and after all of that it's still ripping good fun.";21 December 1998;10;['favorite', 'old', 'first', 'offbeat', 'dark', 'wide', 'few', 'blockbuster', 'unconventional', 'audacious', 'other', 'only', 'solid', 'individual', 'lead', 'convincing', 'second', 'well', 'late', 'great', 'leigh', 'big', 'nuanced', 'entire', 'other', 'mythic', 'same', 'simple', 'facial', 'more', 'brilliant', 'unforgettable', 'beautiful', 'flawless', 'visceral', 'emotional', 'other', 'beautiful', 'precise', 'heartfelt', 'most', 'emotional', 'such', 'great', 'middle', 'mythic', 'good'];0.2114864864864864
967;Pinkfish-2;the empire strikes back is the second film in the renowned star wars trilogy. being the second part in a three part saga, it was naturally the darkest of the films. but, that does not make it any less a part of film history. it was one of the most successful sequels ever, continuing the story of luke skywalker, princess leia, and han solo. it also included many key points in the story. in this film, luke skywalker truly begins his jedi training, and cuts it short, something that will plague him for years to come. luke also confronts darth vader, and finds out that vader is his father, the most dramatic moment in the film, and when he loses his hand. princess leia and han solo finally fall in love, only to be captured and separated when han is frozen in carbonite. leia is driven by her love for han for the next year, unable to let him go. han is frozen, unable to move, in the clutches of jabba the hutt. this is the beginning of a wonderful romance. this movie has done a superb job of continuing the star wars saga, and deserves every ounce of praise that has been thrown at it. then again, i'm probably a little partial.;15 October 1998;10;['second', 'renowned', 'second', 'dark', 'successful', 'many', 'key', 'jedi', 'short', 'dramatic', 'next', 'unable', 'unable', 'wonderful', 'superb', 'little', 'partial'];0.0919444444444444

975;Mr. Brown-7;george lucas has inspired all of us star wars lovers with star wars: episode iv - a new hope in 1977, in 1980 he then brought us star wars: episode v - the empire strikes back. the empire strikes back (second in the star wars trilogy) is a much darker film, with more drama, romance and evil. being a more dramatic film is actually quite heart warming at times, john william's fantastic musical score and the actors of the film have helped a lot to make the dramatic scenes...dramatic. we see a lot more of luke skywalker's (well acted by mark hamill) development as a jedi knight and education of the force. a new character is introduced in this film and his name is...yoda who is a great jedi master, one of the most interesting characters in the holy trilogy. yoda grabs the eye of the audience with his short and funny appearance and astonishing jedi powers. the elements of the force in this film are much more interesting and inspiring than what we see in the other two star wars movies, with uplifting scenes like luke's education of the force from yoda. one of the many highlights of the empire strikes back is the blossoming romance between han solo (amazingly performed by harrison ford) and princess leia (played sweetly by carrie fisher). leia's sweet, innocent yet tough personality mixes well with han's scoundrellish style. the empire strikes back being the darker film of the trilogy, has more evil within, which means there is more of the dark lord of the sith...darth vader (played by david prowse and the voice of james earl jones). vader uses his powers much more effectively here, he dominates the movie and shows no mercy. another good mention is the special effects, they are actually a little more dazzling than the effects in the first film, the empire strikes back won a special oscar for the visual effects. if you haven't seen the empire strikes back i suggest you have a look at it and see what you think, i think anyone who's anyone should enjoy it, but if you haven't seen star wars: episode iv - a new hope, i strongly suggest you see that before star wars: episode v - the empire strikes back. the empire strikes back is easily the best in the holy trilogy and one of the best movies ever made, well that's what i think anyway... i rate it a 10/10! bye kids...;11 December 2000;10;['new', 'dark', 'more', 'dramatic', 'quite', 'fantastic', 'musical', 'dramatic', 'dramatic', 'more', 'new', 'great', 'interesting', 'short', 'funny', 'astonishing', 'interesting', 'inspiring', 'other', 'uplifting', 'many', 'sweet', 'innocent', 'tough', 'scoundrellish', 'dark', 'more', 'evil', 'more', 'dark', 'good', 'special', 'dazzling', 'first', 'special', 'visual', 'new', 'good', 'holy', 'good'];0.2155413259579926
976;no23rdbull;empire strikes back is the best of the star wars saga hands down. and if phantom menace is any indication, it will remain the best once george lucas completes the other two prequels. lucas needs to step back and take a look at the elements that made empire strikes back not only a great sequel but a classic film on its own. he should hand over the story of the following prequels to another screenwriter as he did with empire strikes back, and the directing chores to someone who has a pulse on today's audience. that's the only way the prequels can live up to empire strikes back, the second best sequel of all time behind aliens, and before godfather ii and road warrior.;27 August 2000;10;['good', 'phantom', 'good', 'other', 'great', 'classic', 'own', 'only', 'second', 'good'];0.3935185185185185

1003;wirrn;in my opinion, the empire strikes back is the greatest movie ever made. the pacing of the story is excellent to the extent that the viewer is never bored as the action just keeps on coming. the content of this film appears to be of a far more adult nature than any of the other star wars films.in this film the characters seem to come alive in a way that other science fiction films are simply unable to match. in no other star wars film does the audience learn more about the main characters then in the empire strikes back.it should be mentioned that yoda in particular is a remarkable creation as he is very interesting as a character as well as being very original in design. in empire, the direction is first rate as is the acting which is a complement that one cannot honestly pay any of the other star wars films. in the empire strikes back, the audience not only gets the usual dose of action that is expected in a star wars film but also a healthy dose of romance and spiritualism as well. if you are after a film which has great action, a dark atmosphere, great characters and an excellent plot, then watch the empire strikes back. i would give the empire strikes back 10/10.;18 February 2003;10;['great', 'excellent', 'bored', 'more', 'other', 'alive', 'other', 'unable', 'other', 'more', 'main', 'particular', 'remarkable', 'interesting', 'original', 'first', 'other', 'usual', 'healthy', 'great', 'dark', 'great', 'excellent'];0.2742753623188405

""i am your father"". over the years, star wars hasn't become only the most wonderful saga ever. it has become a whole universe, in which every single character, as unimportant as they can be, has his own complete life and history. empire may be the best movie in history, it is also part of a world with a story much more interesting than ours!";13 April 2004;10;['favorite', 'great', 'great', 'great', 'full', 'great', 'special', 'big', 'wonderful', 'whole', 'single', 'unimportant', 'own', 'complete', 'good', 'interesting'];0.4397321428571428
1006;ArtisticHate;"the empire strikes back, from this point on to be referred to as empire, is truly the greatest film i have ever seen. why? i could give many reasons, most of which would have been said before. however, this film really does have a completely different feel to it compared to episodes iv and vi. people say it's dark, and it is, but there is a lot more to it. there is this transitional feel about the characters and the movie, something which shows how our intrepid heroes are being forced into darkness. luke skywalker, is learning about his past and the powers that he has inherited from his estranged father. this also introduces yoda into the saga. han solo and leia are falling in love, this changes solo's character from the out and out space cowboy, so to speak, that we know from episode iv. he has mellowed and found different priorities in his life. this is definitely the middle ground for the development of this character. i never liked what he became in episode vi, his role in the movie was poor and he had changed a lot from the loveable ""rogue"" that we saw in episode iv. leia's character had changed from a slightly stuck up ""princess"" in episode iv to a more ""lets get down to it"" action character who was not afraid to get stuck in, fix equipment and shoot a blaster. then we have all the obvious plot developments. seriously, a great film. for me harrison ford, aka han solo, is the star of the film. his character was a whiny, annoying kid (like we see from his father in episodes i and ii) in episode iv but in empire we see the beginnings of the man he becomes. there is so much about this film, and the characters, that make it no #1! add all this in and is it any surprise that this is the film where george lucas didn't write any of the script, or direct it? his only contribution was to write the story. a lot of people would see this and hope that lucas doesn't direct or write the script for the highly anticipated episode iii. unfortunately, i'm one of them.";24 December 2002;10;['great', 'many', 'most', 'different', 'dark', 'more', 'transitional', 'intrepid', 'estranged', 'out', 'different', 'middle', 'poor', 'loveable', 'stuck', 'afraid', 'obvious', 'great', 'whiny', 'annoying', 'much', 'only'];0.0821428571428571

1010;MustafaDilek;the story (if you can speak of one)in this movie is very boring. there isn't any tension-building or climax whatsoever. the movie just stops after 2 hours. there is hardly any character building, and to my opinion there aren't many strong personalities. the only character that has won my sympathy is han solo,(harrison ford) but after being frozen he just disappears out of the movie, and no one seems to care about him anymore. luke skywalker is a w***er who is supposed to be a jedi knight, but instead he needs to be rescued all the time. i wouldn't have cared less if he had crashed in his plane, had been eaten by that snowmonster, had frozen to death, he got shot by the atats, if his father had killed him, or he had fallen of that tower. the music score is well composed, though i think a classical symphony isn't very suitable for a sci-fi movie. i believe they should have used synthetic music to create the right atmosphere. on the other hand the effects and sceneries are very impressive. unbelieve what effort george and his guys have done!;5 December 2016;6;['boring', 'many', 'strong', 'only', 'frozen', 'jedi', 'classical', 'suitable', 'synthetic', 'right', 'other', 'impressive'];0.1826719576719576
1011;walker-rise;this is the sequel to the original star wars (1977) and is the best film in the entire saga. it brings back all of the things people loved about the original and added more action and more great characters. this film and the original or considered some of the best movies of all time, and while this film did not receive as much critical acclaim as the first, most fans of the star wars saga will agree that this one is the best. the film begins in the rebel base on the ice planet hoth. the whole hoth sequence is my favorite of the whole series. we see our hero luke skywalker get attacked by a yeti like monster and have to use the force to escape. the battle with the empire's at-ats and the rebels is the coolest scene in the movie. the at-ats are giant walking machines that are almost impenetrable so luke and the other rebel pilots have to come up with a way to stop them because their guns won't stop them. luke devises a plan where they circle the legs with a towing line to trip them. it is a really really cool scene. the empire does shut down the bases power though our heroes must flee. instead of joining han, chewy, and leia, luke goes to the dagobah system because of a vision he received from the ghost of his former master obi-wan kenobi. on dagobah luke meets yoda. yoda is one of the most iconic star wars characters. he is the most powerful jedi warrior even though he is only about a foot tall and green. yoda trains luke to become the ultimate jedi warrior. meanwhile han and the millennium falcon are being chased by the empire through asteroid fields. they decide to go to cloud city to enlist the help of han's old friend lando, billy dee williams. it ends up being a trap and darth vader captures han, chewy, and leia. sensing that his friends are in trouble luke abandons his training to go rescue them. the result is one of the most iconic endings to any film. including perhaps the biggest twist in cinema history up to this point. i won't say it here and spoil it, but it is so iconic you probably know about it even if you haven't seen the film. this film is star wars at its best! i love all the movies, but this is the one where they really did it right. it has tons of awesome action, and really expands the star wars universe. this is the kind of movie that i could watch at any time and would just as in to it! 10/10;14 July 2015;10;['original', 'good', 'entire', 'original', 'more', 'great', 'original', 'good', 'much', 'critical', 'first', 'most', 'good', 'rebel', 'whole', 'hoth', 'whole', 'cool', 'giant', 'impenetrable', 'other', 'rebel', 'towing', 'cool', 'former', 'iconic', 'powerful', 'tall', 'green', 'ultimate', 'old', 'iconic', 'big', 'iconic', 'good', 'right', 'awesome'];0.3311904761904761
1012;parrycallum;"for me this is one of the most important movies in history. this movie had to live up to the movie that changed how movies were made and filmed and exceeded it in every way. the empire strikes back is the second movie in the original star wars trilogy directed by george lucas. straight away this movie had a darker feel than the first one as we are introduced to a new planet known as hoth. the opening sequence is brilliant with luke being captured by the the ice creature, and is shortly followed by the riveting battle of hoth. the plot of the movie is that of the title. the empire wants to get revenge on the rebels for destroying the death star in the previous movie. although there is a deeper meaning to the plot. darth vader is after luke skywalker as he realises that he is the last threat to the empire. instead of trying to kill him he want's him by his side for him to rule along side him. in this movie we are introduced to yoda who is an old jedi master who luke has summoned in the hope that he would train him to become a jedi knight. he showed that jedi come in all shapes and sizes and proved that to luke when he lifted an all but seamless sunken x wing from the deep waters of dagobah. yoda was maybe the best new character in this movie as he came across as funny but at the same time very wise and was one with the force. han and princess leia travel to the cloud city where they are greeted by one of han's former allies lando. although shortly after they arrive they find out that they has struck a deal with darth vader who holds them hostage, using them as bait knowing luke would come to them. for them what followed shower what a great story teller george lucas was at the time and how much he cared about the characters and how they had develop from the last movie. han solo is frozen in carbonite and sold to a bounty hunter bobba fett, who would take him to jabba the hutt. while this scene is taking place harrison ford says one of the best improvised lines in movie history. princess leia tells him that she loves him and he replies"" i know"". apparently harrison ford thought that line would be better than what was originally planned. when luke finally get's to vader an epic light saber duel takes place. vader is toying with luke and trying to get him to use his anger and slowly turn to the dark side of the force as he knows it's the only way he can defeat him. eventually vader overpowers luke and chops off his arm leaving luke defenseless. once again the movie proves why it's one of the greatest of all time when vader tells luke that he is his father, taking everybody by shock. luke cannot believe it and tries to commit suicide by letting himself fall down a huge drop as he believes he has nothing to live for. leia and chewbacca pick up luke and fly off into light speed escaping the empire. the film ends with a glimmer of hope as luke and leila are looking into a bright star which identifies there is still hope for them yet. overall this film is a masterpiece. it provides everything a great sequel needs. a great plot, great characters, a menacing villain and humour when needed. all of this was done correctly by george lucas who didn't just create one the most iconic film trilogies of all time he created a whole universe of different stories and characters thanks to these three great movies. in my opinion though this one is the best of the lot.";29 October 2015;10;['important', 'second', 'original', 'dark', 'first', 'new', 'hoth', 'brilliant', 'riveting', 'previous', 'deep', 'last', 'old', 'jedi', 'seamless', 'sunken', 'deep', 'good', 'new', 'funny', 'same', 'wise', 'former', 'great', 'last', 'good', 'well', 'epic', 'light', 'dark', 'only', 'great', 'huge', 'light', 'bright', 'great', 'great', 'great', 'iconic', 'whole', 'different', 'great', 'good'];0.3328477078477079

1032;morgsapplar;"to me, ""empire"" is the perfect illustration of a b-series movie state of grace. not only this one is the best of all in the ""star wars"" anthology, even better than the lucas's ones, in all respects, but it is a true lesson of cinema. i use to say that it is ""casablanca"" in space. (look at the poster !) kershner - a clever, pragmatic, director - has done the best work ever in history of science fiction / fantasy / fantastic series, for ""empire"" is one of the most achieved films in dramatic writing, special effects credibility, light, editing and rhythm, estetics, philosophy, and even on the subject of love stories (all the others segments of love stories in the star wars anthology are... just fake). the only movie i remember that can be compared to this achievement, and particularly in the ""classic special effects era"" (before 1983) is ridley's scott's ""blade runner"". think about that. ""empire"" has changed a lot of things in the fantastic genre. the very subtle psychology of such characters like darth vader or han solo was a whole new intention in the b-movies in 1980, and has been imitated a lot since then, until ""pirates of the caribbean 2"" last year. think about that, too. on a personal point of view, i think ""empire"" is a totally mastered work, a work that suffered, but that acquired a true soul. remember kersh wanting to be dropped on the top of an ice mountain to conceive the fact to be cold, really cold - and the helicopter that couldn't take him back to the base... that's the way true movies were done, a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away... raphael zamochnikoff nice, france";8 November 2007;10;['perfect', 'good', 'well', 'true', 'clever', 'pragmatic', 'good', 'fantastic', 'dramatic', 'special', 'fake', 'only', 'classic', 'special', 'fantastic', 'subtle', 'such', 'whole', 'new', 'last', 'personal', 'mastered', 'true', 'cold', 'cold', 'true', 'long'];0.1298881673881673

1035;Carlos_2;"because practically everything has been said about this movie, i am going to make a commentary out of the ordinary, in which i am going to criticize only a very important aspect of its script which i don't like. as every true geek knows, george lucas liked the book ""the hero with a thousand faces"" by joseph campbell so much that he incorporated many influences from it into the star wars script. campbell studied myths and religions from around the world and he realized that there is a story that is repeated insistently in many cultures because it seems to convey a very important knowledge about the human soul. it is what has been called the ""hero's journey"" or ""monomyth"". so lucas wrote the star wars script following the steps of this mythical story. luke enters the death star, just as theseus entered the labyrinth of the minotaur (a labyrinth that could well symbolize the intricacies of the human mind). when luke finally confronts the ""dragon"" darth vader, he discovers that he is his father, and luke is afraid that vader's evil could also potentially be inside him. if his father fell into the dark side, perhaps he could do so as well. thus, for example, siegfried became cursed after killing the dragon fafnir, because he kept the ring of power that the beast kept in his cave. the hero's journey is, in short, an inner psychological travel to learn more about the good and the bad within a person. the jedi are so skilled in this self-knowledge and their wisdom about the force is so great that they can have premonitions about the future. that is, because they know themselves very well, they also believe they know what other individuals in the universe are like, so they will be able to predict their future behaviors. the failure that seems to me to have the monomyth, and thus the star wars saga, is that a man, by introspection, can know himself, but not those who are different of him. it is very unlikely that a moral human being can predict the behavior of a psychopath who has no conscience and feels no remorse when he commits perverse acts. on the contrary, this technique can lead him to make fatal mistakes in predicting the future behavior of individuals who are psychopaths. a person capable of empathy will hardly understand the personality of a conscienceless egoist who only seeks his own interest, regardless of the people he has to destroy to achieve it. so the jedi have a more complicated job than they think to know all the sith and predict their selfish and evil future moves. is luke as similar to his father as he seems to think? could he go from being a defender of freedom to becoming an evil galactic dictator? or is he so different from his father that he would be incapable of join the dark side? probably only a genetic expert could answer these questions. there is no doubt that we should enjoy the impressive visual spectacle that george lucas has created with his galactic saga, but i think we should always keep in mind that the monomyth has a very weak point and is not the answer to all the questions about the human being. introspection is useful for a person to understand himself, but not to understand those who are different. believing the opposite, can be a very dangerous thing. so it seems to me that the jedi and george lucas need to consider that knowing the galaxy and the people who live in it is much more complicated than they assume. some sith can be far more cold-hearted and villainous than a good jedi can imagine.";7 July 2021;6;['ordinary', 'important', 'true', 'many', 'many', 'important', 'human', 'mythical', 'human', 'afraid', 'dark', 'cursed', 'short', 'inner', 'psychological', 'more', 'bad', 'skilled', 'great', 'other', 'like', 'able', 'future', 'different', 'unlikely', 'moral', 'human', 'perverse', 'fatal', 'future', 'capable', 'conscienceless', 'own', 'complicated', 'selfish', 'evil', 'future', 'similar', 'evil', 'galactic', 'different', 'incapable', 'dark', 'genetic', 'impressive', 'visual', 'galactic', 'weak', 'human', 'useful', 'different', 'dangerous', 'complicated', 'cold', 'hearted', 'villainous', 'good'];-0.0066666666666666

1040;puissancedelune;star wars: episode v - the empire strikes back (1980). the perfect sequel to star wars. included in the movie, we see the introduction of three characters. each playing important roles that lead to the events of the end of the empire strikes back to return of the jedi. first, we see the debut of yoda. a small hermit like creature who happens to be a former wise jedi master who helps luke advance as a jedi and (not knowing) to prepare him for his clash between the sinister darth vader. throughout the movie, we also see the appearance of lando calrissian. an old friend of han who is the administrator of the cloud city of bespin. with the introduction of lando, comes the clash of luke and vader and the mercenary, boba fett. although he boba plays only plays a short roll throughout the movie, he does bring sense of unknown and interest. boba fett's actions have importance which further continues into star wars: episode vi - return of the jedi. we also see a range of new planets including my personal favorite bespin, hoth and dagobah. with the addition of the new characters and planets, the empire strikes back is really the best star wars film to watch for those who are new to the franchise. even though it lacks some elements that the original had done better, i still recommend it. but i do encourage you watch the first film before you watch the empire strikes back so the story makes more sense. with the movie only earning one oscar, it is the best of the lot. star wars is definitely up there for being one of the greatest franchises in cinema history.;14 December 2019;10;['perfect', 'important', 'small', 'former', 'wise', 'luke', 'sinister', 'lando', 'old', 'short', 'unknown', 'new', 'personal', 'favorite', 'new', 'good', 'new', 'first', 'more', 'good', 'great'];0.2741626794258373

1086;chowderhound;"this may contain spoilers. it has amazed me for 25 years or so that people consider empire to be the best of the star wars movies. for me, it was perhaps the biggest disappointment of my youth. i will never forget walking out of the theatre in 1980 and remarking to my best friend: ""we waited 3 years for that?!?!?"" so what's so wrong with empire? i could go on at length, but essentially it boils down to 3 major problems. (1) yoda. yoda is the single most annoying character in the star wars trilogy (yes, that does include the awful jar jar binks), and after a weak start on hoth, the entire movie goes down the toilet when yoda appears on screen. yoda looks like a puppet (big surprise -- he is a puppet), and sounds like every other frank oz character; i kept waiting for him to say ""whacka whacka"" like fozzie bear (i love fozzie, in case you're wondering). the entire sequence on yoda's home turf, which is crucial to the movie, just plain doesn't work. it doesn't look otherworldly, it just looks like a poorly lit set. (2) lando. if we place jar jar as the 2nd most annoying character, then lando is clearly a very close #3. billy dee williams may be a decent actor, but you'd certainly never know it from watching this ham-fisted performance. i have difficulty believing lando is a living entity, much less a swashbuckling former-pirate. (3) the movie has no ending; it just sort-of stops and leaves you wondering why it wasn't better. i expected, i don't know, some sort of interesting plot resolution, not just a shot of the characters looking out the window. and, yes, i know ""luke, i am your father"" was supposed to be the climax. be honest, is there anybody out there who didn't see this one coming at least an hour before it happens? i was only 14 when i saw the movie, and my reaction was ""yeah, no kidding."" other low points: the wretched ""ice monster"" effect, the hand-puppet asteroid monster, nearly all of the acting (these are the characters we loved in star wars?), and especially the directing. high points: well, the effects are mostly amazing, particularly the asteroid sequence (other than the hand puppet). the music is great too. i have tried for years to like this movie, convinced that i need to get over my disappointment as a teenager. it never works.";11 August 2006;4;['good', 'big', 'good', 'wrong', 'major', 'single', 'annoying', 'awful', 'weak', 'entire', 'big', 'other', 'frank', 'entire', 'crucial', 'annoying', 'close', 'decent', 'less', 'swashbuckling', 'former', 'of', 'well', 'interesting', 'honest', 'least', 'other', 'low', 'wretched', 'high', 'amazing', 'other', 'great'];-0.0036640211640211

1100;slidepiece;i always ask others which star wars movie was their favorite. most say return of the jedi because of its climactic ending, and although i can't argue with them at all, my pick is empire strikes back. this movie accurately conveys the power the empire has over the rebellion and the many daring and courageous feats the rebellion must be forced to go through in order to achieve not just victory, but survival. the acting again in this movie is second to no other space drama, very mature and makes you feel the realism in the story. the battles depicted are somewhat futile for the rebels as you feel throughout the story that the mighty empire is just closing in on our beloved characters, culminating in the loss of han and luke's hand. the maturity continues in the relationships between han and leia, luke and yoda and darth vader. the comical love/hate relationship han and leia have blossoms into this yearning leia has for han to be more and this yearning for han for leia to love him for who he is. it becomes evident that although they don't share their feelings for each, there is a connection there that builds into a longing to see them together. the master and the student relationship between yoda and luke builds on the teachings of obi-wan and the luke's recklessness as all students at one point or another show. and finally the relationship between darth vader and the viewer. whereas once you found yourself hating this figure, cheering and laughing watching him helplessly corkscrew off into space after han saves luke during luke's death star run, to cringing at his ugly, scarred head in his chamber, you suddenly found yourself intrigued at the cliffhanger this movie leaves you in. he is evil personified, but suddenly flawed and you find yourself wondering what will become of him. it's such a dark movie. the good guy doesn't win here. there is no celebration at the end. it leaves you in agony. for me, having to wait another 3 years to find out what will become of everyone. will or can the rebels really win? by the end of this movie, i wasn't really sure. enough can't be said about the soundtrack for the movie. the way john williams made you feel with the different themes used and the background of each scene. you felt the imperial walkers in the music. the swashbuckling sounds of the millenium falcon in the asteroid field. darth vader's theme expresses that military might that only a superpower can embody and yoda's theme makes you feel and understand the spirituality of the force. all brilliantly wrapped up in the main theme and expressed beautifully in the end credits. this is my favorite star wars movie of all time. i can't say that jedi isn't a close second, but the way this movie made me feel way back when and the edge of my seat longing for the 3rd movie to tell me what the hell will happen to everybody will always make me feel that this was without a doubt the best sequel of all time.;23 April 2021;10;['favorite', 'most', 'climactic', 'many', 'daring', 'courageous', 'second', 'other', 'mature', 'futile', 'mighty', 'beloved', 'comical', 'more', 'evident', 'ugly', 'scarred', 'flawed', 'dark', 'good', 'sure', 'enough', 'different', 'imperial', 'main', 'favorite', 'close', 'good'];0.2400793650793651

1130;j-dinarescouto;"not getting old. the immortality of a genuine argument is probably what is most looked for by directors and producers. this movie in my opinion is unarguably the clearest representation of filmographic imperishability. in this one george lucas gathers a virtuously designed nexus between the fifth and the 6th movie of the saga. however, this movie is by no means fault of action or memorable moments. here we discover the relationship that lies between luke and darth vader. george places us in front a very decisive moral dilemma: will young luke grow prey of fear and hate like his father? or by the contrary, will he become a jedi?;or in other words: will he save the day and defeat darth vader? or will he join him and palpatine, screwing it all up? i was glad to see that in this movie, the hard challenge to which the actors were subjected was passed by all of them flawlessly. i was specially thrilled by the way mark hamill succeeds in showing us with great sophistication the metamorphosis luke is undergoing, evolving from an ignorant crybaby, into a mighty and wiser jedi. the way his motifs become more altruistic and less egocentric in such an adverse situation makes us watch a man handling a light saber and no longer a boy. this simply broadens the range of ages that will be adhered to this particular movie. carrie fisher and harrison ford excel at their role and add the necessary spice to the film. resorting to the child-pleasing comedy provided by c3po or r2d2 was thankfully not a major concern in this movie. as i expressed, in my opinion the dialog is more adult-compelling. nonetheless(and i see this as a positive thing) we don't have to deal with insufferable doses of complex political debates which were a constant in the first trilogy, were the rise to power of palpatine was explained.the empire strikes back was more of a character- based movie. here we are more concerned about the growing affection between han and leia and the evolution of luke and his understanding of the force, than we are concerned about the oppression of the republic on the rebel forces. with this movie, one can notice that a family is beginning to be forged. we can feel this through the fears and preoccupations of the troop as each particular character confronts successive threats (e.g when han is frozen into carbonate) visuals in this movie are breathtaking. i was impressed when i watched the arrival of the millennium falcon to cloud city or where han and his cohort were escaping the clone offensive (near the start of the movie). the cg textures were noticeably polished from the previous movie. this film was able to isolate me from the real world and to induce me to a thrilling utopia. the 'epicnes' of the music and sound effects cannot be exaggerated, but as lord sith said, ""i had fore-seen this"". music is always topnotch in the saga. the argument was inventive and unpredictable all along. the movie broke free from fantasy films monotony and did not end with a ""happily ever after"".this felt very refreshing for me. this only leaves me to add: congratulations george! you're the best at what you do! and thank you for providing me with a world were my mind can teleport to to find true joy every once in a while. without a doubt i give this movie a 10 out of 10!";25 October 2011;10;['old', 'genuine', 'clear', 'filmographic', 'fifth', 'memorable', 'decisive', 'moral', 'young', 'other', 'glad', 'hard', 'great', 'ignorant', 'mighty', 'wise', 'altruistic', 'egocentric', 'adverse', 'light', 'particular', 'necessary', 'pleasing', 'major', 'compelling', 'positive', 'insufferable', 'complex', 'political', 'first', 'more', 'concerned', 'concerned', 'rebel', 'particular', 'successive', 'impressed', 'polished', 'previous', 'able', 'real', 'thrilling', 'inventive', 'unpredictable', 'free', 'refreshing', 'good', 'true'];0.2711547291092745

1133;henriquemarques0409;"after being abruptly evicted from his death star digs, darth vader seeks out the young rebel warrior responsible, luke skywalker. he has plans for the boy. skywalker, meanwhile, leaves his friends in the middle of an imperial invasion for a crash course in jedi knighthood amid a desolate swamp world with only a faultfinding green gnome for company. can luke complete his training before darth reels him in? well, no, actually. that's not the only way this middle installment of the ""star wars"" trilogy leaves things on a decidedly more discordant note than the previous, joyous ""star wars."" people call this the darkest of the original three films because it is, but ""empire"" is the only one with an adult orientation. the characters are deepened, and our investment in them from the first film challenged by events that leave them exposed to the sort of cruelties we wrongly assumed them safe from. george lucas deserves major praise for putting such a film together, using his well-earned profits from the first film. in essence, he was literally giving the fans back some dividends for their box office proceeds. he also took chances in terms of leaving them less happy this time, knowing the emotional payoff would have to come a film later. ""empire strikes back"" is thus a richer film than ""star wars"" emotionally, and in other ways, too. instead of confining most of the action to the desert planet tatoonie, the action bounces around from an ice planet to a swamp planet to the most marvelous creation of all, a city hovering high in the clouds of a gas giant, where the action culminates. lucas adds some interesting new characters, particularly yoda, the swamp creature luke goes to for help, who articulates much of the philosophy and provides much of the fun in this film as voiced by frank oz, the guy behind (or under) miss piggy and later, a talented director in his own right. there's also billy dee williams as lando calrissian, the operator of cloud city who provides much of the needed moral shading in the film as the stars from the previous movie are all full-blown heroes now. williams has fun schmoozing up leia and trying to find his feet as his slick machinations leave him in ever-hotter water. the best performance in this film is mark hamill's as luke. hamill had to work harder here than he did in ""star wars,"" sharing all his big scenes with a muppet and a guy with a bucket on his head. but hamill finds the essence of a character more interesting than the naive farm boy we saw in the first film, playing luke as confused, fearful, impetuous, and flawed in a way that makes him more likable, rather than less so. how hamill never hit it big after his great work here is an injustice on par with cleavon little's lack of work after ""blazing saddles."" what else about this is great? the score by john williams, introducing the recognizable ""imperial march"" theme music as well as some rousing material during the final confrontation between luke and darth. the interaction between vader and his subordinates is chokingly funny, in a way that only adds to the suspense and dread. the opening battle around the ice planet is marvelously intense, especially as witnessed from the cockpits of rebel fighters taking on thickly-armored imperial walkers. the returning cast except for hamill doesn't seem as sharp this time, especially carrie fisher's princess leia, so charming in ""star wars,"" gaunt and miserable here. much of the whole middle section of the film is draggy and woolly, like the various silly ways the millennium falcon escapes imperial pursuit and the scene in the ""cave"" that goes on much longer than it should. even luke's scenes with yoda become slow and tedious with multiple viewings. the enthusiasm that makes ""empire strikes back"" so beloved today is understandable. it turned ""star wars"" from a great film into an enjoyable franchise. but it doesn't really have the same stand-alone quality ""star wars"" has, needing both that earlier film and the later ""return of the jedi"" to make it as great as it is.";30 October 2013;9;['young', 'rebel', 'responsible', 'imperial', 'desolate', 'faultfinding', 'green', 'only', 'middle', 'discordant', 'previous', 'joyous', 'dark', 'original', 'only', 'first', 'safe', 'major', 'first', 'happy', 'emotional', 'rich', 'other', 'most', 'swamp', 'marvelous', 'interesting', 'new', 'swamp', 'much', 'much', 'talented', 'own', 'much', 'moral', 'previous', 'slick', 'good', 'big', 'interesting', 'naive', 'first', 'confused', 'fearful', 'impetuous', 'likable', 'big', 'great', 'little', 'great', 'recognizable', 'imperial', 'final', 'funny', 'intense', 'rebel', 'armored', 'imperial', 'sharp', 'charming', 'miserable', 'much', 'whole', 'middle', 'draggy', 'various', 'silly', 'imperial', 'long', 'slow', 'tedious', 'multiple', 'beloved', 'understandable', 'great', 'enjoyable', 'same', 'early', 'later', 'great'];0.151300505050505

1143;vinny-vincoli;star wars has always and will always be my favorite movie saga of all time. not only does it capture my imagination like no other series but it also has one of the greatest story lines of all time. episode v: the empire strikes back is one of my favorites of the six. it seriously emphasizes the idea of the archetypal hero with luke meeting the great yoda who trains him to be able to fulfill his destiny by confronting vader. another favorite aspect is the legendary scene when vader tells luke he is his father. episode v has many legendary movie moments that are known by pretty much everyone. it also greatly shows the connection between both vader and luke the many differences and similarities. anakin was mainly full of anger and fear, both characteristics appear in luke, but the feelings of knowing what is right and the discipline that luke shows when he confronts his father is definitely a characteristic of his mother. we never really were able to put that together until the 3 prequels were made. episode v will always be in the top numbers of legendary movies in america full of unforgettable classic movie moments and fun.;13 June 2013;10;['favorite', 'other', 'great', 'archetypal', 'great', 'able', 'favorite', 'legendary', 'many', 'legendary', 'many', 'full', 'right', 'able', 'top', 'legendary', 'full', 'unforgettable', 'classic'];0.5515211640211639

1159;JRKITE;when talking about the empire strikes back many people have commented on how dark it is in comparison to the other two films from the original trilogy. however as was expected by star wars fans, revenge of the sith without a doubt took the title of darkest star wars movie from empire's mantle. given the galactic scale of tragedy in the final prequel, empire's personal tragedy reveals itself to be a little self-absorbed. in the post-prequel star wars paradigm, we should be able to see the light at the end of the tunnel in the final revelations of empire. with the issue of darkness settled, the star wars audience and the movie-going public should now be able to see the empire strikes back for what it is. the best star wars movie. and not only is it a great star wars movie, but it is a great movie. the direction, the writing, and even the performances come together to make it a complete movie. watching the movies that george lucas has directed, specifically star wars: episodes i-iv, you can tell he is not a student of the craft of acting. the result is that actors are left developing the emotional life of the characters on their own. some actors are able to survive and even thrive in this environment. harrison ford and alec guinness give inspired performances in the original star wars that make some of the other performances in the movie appear worse than they actually were. george lucas responsibly tapped his professor from film school, irvin kershner, to direct the empire strikes back, and the difference is palpable. star wars is without a doubt the most revolutionary in terms of special effects of the original trilogy. but in terms of quality movie-making, editing, cinematography, etc., emipire takes the cake. and all the while putting together great shot after great shot, he managed to pull good performances out of most the cast. not a single one of the primaries are flat or perform an unbelievable moment. hamill's performance is so good you actually believe for at least a few minutes that he might stand a chance against darth vader. but the quality of film-making and the emotional life of the characters would not have mattered, nor could they have possibly existed without brilliant writing. in empire lucas is at his myth-making best (han's metaphoric descent into hell and luke's journey into the dark cave are brilliant), and the screenplay by leigh brackett and lawrence kasden is sharp, well-paced, and energetic. as a result of this three-part collaboration, you have the rough and romantic flirtations of han solo and princess leia (in which you can hear the voice of both brackett's earlier work, the big sleep and el dorado, and kasden's later work, the big chill and the accidental tourist). also you have yoda-speech when it was genuinely profound in a confucian way, before it devolved into the gimmicky and painful form it takes in the prequels. on the whole there is no denying that star wars: a new hope is the most influential movie of the series, quite possibly of the last quarter of the twentieth century (although it would have to fight with jaws for that title). and with the fall of anakin skywalker in revenge of the sith, it no longer can be called the darkest of the star wars saga. but it is, with little doubt the best movie of the series.;26 May 2005;10;['many', 'dark', 'other', 'original', 'dark', 'galactic', 'final', 'prequel', 'personal', 'little', 'post', 'prequel', 'able', 'final', 'able', 'good', 'great', 'great', 'complete', 'emotional', 'own', 'able', 'original', 'other', 'bad', 'palpable', 'revolutionary', 'special', 'original', 'great', 'great', 'good', 'most', 'single', 'flat', 'unbelievable', 'good', 'least', 'few', 'emotional', 'brilliant', 'metaphoric', 'dark', 'brilliant', 'leigh', 'sharp', 'energetic', 'rough', 'romantic', 'early', 'big', 'later', 'big', 'accidental', 'profound', 'confucian', 'gimmicky', 'painful', 'new', 'influential', 'last', 'twentieth', 'dark', 'little', 'good'];0.1741742825076158
1160;batishwaheed123;"considered the darkest of the original trilogy, irvin kershner not only created a wonder for generations to come, but made cinematic history with a film that was originally released to mixed receptions. everything about this film is fantastic, with the great qualities that defined its predecessor being apparent in all corners of this film, with an added flare that is so normal of kershner himself. the storytelling is so much more mature, and the soundtrack by the great john williams covers this with darth vader getting his iconic theme that has defined villains in cinema history, and launched him into the centre of what could possibly be the best villain hollywood has ever seen. the grand epic premise of episode iv which led to the destruction of the first death star had us all rooting for the rebels, but surely the empire would 'strike back' and as such the rebels are quashed in amazing fashion that leads the audience enthralled and gaping for more. following a special movie, that had re-defined technology in cinema it would be a daunting task to accede this, but again the technological advancements remained on pace with the cinematography and editing being exquisite. another comparison with a new hope is that of the storytelling which is nothing short of amazing. laurence kasdan did a brilliant job here, giving us not only a better story but a more gritty story whilst retaining some of that humour that defined the relationship of luke, han and leia. on that note, the characters are masterfully executed with han clearly stealing the show as well as the climax of the film presenting us leia's and han's newly found love which had been developing slowly over the course of the film. leia, the strong woman that she is, is as good as she was in episode iv, and luke who was merely an amateur develops into a well rounded jedi though his brashness and selflessness leads him to ignore yoda's plea leading to his epic confrontation with vader. a well choreographed duel to say the least, but luke's apparent frustrations and inexperience leads to his own demise at the hands of vader. what follows next is probably the greatest twist in cinema history. it didn't feel out of place or forced, it just seemed so well done, but that single confrontation and revelation is ""star wars"". luke- our hero - being the son of the embodiment of evil was such a shock, that the anticipation for the sequel was at an all time high. overall, more questions were left than answered, though this can be a recipe for disaster, star wars: episode v did it in such a satisfying way that true star wars fans cannot downgrade it. a further testament to the quality of the film is the fact that the editing doesn't take anything away from the overall quality of the film, which maintains its powerful nature till this very day. with the release of empire strikes back, lucas solidified what would become the most well known series of all time.";10 July 2014;10;['dark', 'original', 'cinematic', 'mixed', 'fantastic', 'great', 'apparent', 'normal', 'mature', 'great', 'iconic', 'good', 'grand', 'epic', 'first', 'amazing', 'more', 'special', 'daunting', 'technological', 'exquisite', 'new', 'short', 'amazing', 'brilliant', 'well', 'gritty', 'strong', 'good', 'rounded', 'epic', 'choreographed', 'least', 'apparent', 'own', 'next', 'great', 'single', 'high', 'more', 'satisfying', 'true', 'further', 'overall', 'powerful', 'very'];0.3168392989124696

1166;vanbuskirk-ryan-m;star wars: episode v the empire strikes back is the heart of the george lucas trilogy, tying together the first movie star wars: episode iv a new hope and the third film star wars: episode vi return of the jedi. in this second installment of the star wars trilogy, the battle between the rebellion and imperial forces are extremely heated after luke skywalker (played by mark hamill) destroys darth vader's (voice over by james earl jones) deathstar in the first film. since then, the imperial forces have driven the rebels to the far away icy planet of hoth in hopes of hiding from darth vader and the attacks from the imperial force. it doesn't take vader long to track down skywalker by using the dark side of the force, an ability that only jedi and jedi-like can use by tapping into the life forces that surround us. upon hearing from his mentor, ben obi-wan kenobi, luke skywalker travels to the desolate planet of dagobah to train with jedi master yoda to become a true jedi knight. he will need this training from the presumed best in order to defeat darth vader if ever given the chance. many characters enlighten us, frighten us, and make us laugh throughout the film. characters like han solo, played by harrison ford, contributes comic relief. princess leia, played by carrie fisher, offers us a hardened shell on the outside, but also shows a softer side with slight romantic quips between her and han solo. other comedic characters include r2-d2, which only beeps and gives somewhat emotional squeals to add a human effect if any. there's also 3cp0, an android robot translator that is fluent in over six million languages through the galaxies across space, who gives more comedic relief as well as advice to han solo and princess leia. there's somewhat of a tug of war between the two robots over who is smarter and the banter that goes back and forth between them is hilarious. the overall theme in the film is the battle between good and evil and the use of the force between the light side and dark side. conflict is constant throughout the film in many scenes between many characters. there is romantic conflict between han and the princess, comedic struggle between r2-d2 and c3p0, and a dark conflict within luke skywalker both internally and externally with darth vader. given the fact that the film was produced and released in 1980, the special effects were mind blowing to go along with the infamous soundtrack that immediately connects you to what is going on in the film, whether it is the good side of the force or the dark side preparing for battle. the special effects that are especially breathtaking takes place when cloud city comes into view. along with light sabers, gigantic at-at walkers, tie fighters that would remind you of fighter jets, and the coolness of the spacecraft that fly through space. this all takes you away from your normal, everyday life to make you a part of the star wars story. in conclusion, star wars makes you laugh, it will put you on the edge of your seat, it will touch your heart with the conflict between han and leia, and most of all, it will make you cheer for the home team in luke skywalker. the intense battle between luke and darth vader will leave you breathless in the end with, what will ultimately be, the most gut punching, thought provoking statement vader will ever tell young luke skywalker. do yourself a favor and watch the legend that is the empire strikes back.;8 February 2015;8;['first', 'new', 'third', 'second', 'imperial', 'heated', 'first', 'imperial', 'imperial', 'long', 'dark', 'desolate', 'true', 'good', 'many', 'comic', 'soft', 'slight', 'romantic', 'other', 'comedic', 'emotional', 'human', 'android', 'fluent', 'more', 'comedic', 'smart', 'hilarious', 'overall', 'good', 'light', 'dark', 'constant', 'many', 'many', 'romantic', 'comedic', 'dark', 'special', 'infamous', 'good', 'dark', 'special', 'light', 'gigantic', 'normal', 'everyday', 'most', 'intense', 'young'];0.1743317099567099
1167;squirtl;star wars changed the game for big budget blockbuster cinema. the empire strikes back took that high bar & raised it further. a very much darker tone to the movie is set out from the start. the opening crawl says 'it is a dark time for the rebellion'. the joy & celebration of victory in the battle of yavin is long in the memory. the empire are on the hunt, hell bent on wiping the rebels out. the rebels plight is highlighted by their new base on an arctic wasteland of a planet with minimal life & less warmth. we get to know more about the characters, their motivations & their demons. luke is struggling with his destiny, his role as a leader & his possible future as a jedi, leia is conflicted by her feelings for both han & luke. han is worried primarily about his own neck & how to save it. this brings us to the films major set piece which at the time was a nightmare to film. firstly the main all action set piece comes in the first act & secondly the film crew were m trying to superimpose multiple moving objects on a white background which was more than tricky. the battle of hoth is immense & massively satisfying even though the rebels take a right pounding. the film very much changes tack as it concentrates on the main protagonists. it becomes very emotionally charged either through the blatant romantic tension between han & leia to the trials of luke during his jedi training where he is trying to learn all of the skills & techniques that he needs to become a jedi whilst trying to conquer his own self doubt & his failures which seem to haunt him. the emotion that is poured into the second act really builds up the suspense. you know that the empire are coming at some point, you know that something is going to happen & it won't be good. we get introduced to key new characters such as yoda, the jedi master & luke's teacher who pushes him to his limits & has no qualms in telling him his limitations & failings. there is also lando who is an acquaintance of han's but there is something not right about him. the third act is just filled with all out action, emotion & revelation including what can only be described as the greatest scene in cinematic history which if made today couldn't be kept a secret like it was back in 1980. it leaves you as the viewer, numb with disbelief as this bomb is dropped in the middle of this super emotional sequence of events & you don't know where it is going. however, there has to be something, something we can hold onto moving forward & you are given just that small amount of hope at the end that there is a way back. throughout the entire film there is one thing that makes it work, as it did with its predecessor & that is the music. john williams is an absolute genius & this is his greatest piece of work ever (how he didn't win at the oscars for it is nothing short of a scandal). he manages to drive the entire mood of the film at every point. he generates tension, sadness, fear, threat, heroism, relief & at the end even hope. the film would not be the same without it. as films go there are probably better written & directed films with better stories but empire was a massive risk. sequels were hard to make & never lived up to the originals. also there was the case that this wouldn't be a standalone film. there would have to be a third instalment to close it out. empire succeeds on all of these levels to such an extent that it is the greatest sequel of all time & it easily surpasses any of the other star wars films. i'm happy to say without hesitation that it's my favourite film of all tine & i would argue my stance that it's the greatest film of all time because it delivers just as much today as it did nearly 40 years ago & not many films can do that. it is the pinnacle of the cinematic experience even when matched against its predecessor (which was wonderful in its own right) & against other masterpiece blockbusters such as the matrix, jurassic park, & avengers infinity war/endgame. you just don't make films better than the empire strikes back.;22 June 2019;10;['big', 'high', 'dark', 'dark', 'long', 'new', 'arctic', 'minimal', 'less', 'more', 'possible', 'own', 'major', 'set', 'main', 'first', 'multiple', 'white', 'more', 'tricky', 'immense', 'main', 'blatant', 'romantic', 'jedi', 'own', 'second', 'good', 'key', 'new', 'such', 'right', 'third', 'great', 'cinematic', 'numb', 'super', 'emotional', 'small', 'entire', 'absolute', 'great', 'short', 'entire', 'same', 'well', 'massive', 'hard', 'standalone', 'third', 'great', 'other', 'happy', 'favourite', 'great', 'much', 'many', 'cinematic', 'wonderful', 'own', 'other', 'such', 'well'];0.1553569424402757

1197;anthonybevinsawb;this was an excellent movie within the star wars franchise. each actor gave their own interpretation towards their chosen character and the way the story line fits in with the previous film was amazing. each scene drew me in and it portrayed the characters well in the franchise. one of the best scenes was luke and the rest of the resistance working together to destroy vader and the death star.;22 August 2017;9;['excellent', 'own', 'previous', 'amazing', 'good', 'luke'];0.5466666666666666
1198;coryalandis;what can i say about this movie that hasn't already been said. episode v is arguably the best in the series. the acting of mark hamill (luke skywalker), harrison ford (han solo), and carrie fisher (princess leia) is superb. for a film from 1980 it still holds up extremely well. perhaps this is due to george lucas' writing, irvin kershner's directing, or john william's score. most likely it's a combination of all three. the empire strikes back is a markedly darker film than its predecessor or its successor. however, this is not a bad thing. the theme of darkness runs though out much of the movie. any film where the bad guys win could easily have this theme just for that reason alone. the empire strikes back does so much more though. through the whole movie han, leia, and crew are on the run from the evil empire. this makes the contrasting burgeoning love between han and leia so much more powerful. two people who find a connection in dark times is a common theme, but in this film, it's not overdone. it's subtle and hints at their connection until the end. luke also has his own darkness. on dagobah, luke trains to become a jedi, like his father before him. however, shortly after finding yoda, luke encounters the cave where he sees and does battle with darth vader if only in his own mind. it turns out that he is facing the darkness in himself. this is really telling of the dark theme of the movie. even the lighting of the movie adds to the theme. there aren't many bright scenes in this movie and even when there is, there is a looming sense of doom. in the beginning during the assault on hoth, the planet may be bright and white, but we quickly find that the empire has found them and will be attacking soon. dagobah is a dark and foggy world full of mystery which matches the mystery behind the jedi well. cloud city on bespin is almost lit like twilight and we learn that it is under the control of the empire. the music and sound also contribute to the dark theme. who can deny that the ominous sound of darth vader's breathing or amazing orchestrated music are responsible for much of the feelings we get in the movie. this film just wouldn't be the same without all of the work done by the sound engineers and music composers. if you still haven't seen this film and are looking at reviews to influence you i can only tell you to stop what you're doing and watch this. it's a masterpiece.;28 July 2017;10;['good', 'superb', 'due', 'dark', 'bad', 'much', 'bad', 'more', 'whole', 'evil', 'contrasting', 'powerful', 'dark', 'common', 'overdone', 'subtle', 'own', 'luke', 'own', 'dark', 'many', 'bright', 'bright', 'white', 'dark', 'foggy', 'full', 'dark', 'ominous', 'amazing', 'orchestrated', 'responsible', 'much', 'same'];0.1169871794871795

1201;Totweiz;luke skywalker is not a virtuoso. he misses the charisma. despite everything, the boy shows great potential. it's undeniable. a potential large enough for the emperor himself to worry about it. this rough diamond luke nevertheless needs to be worked on otherwise it may end up in the wrong hands. and because without technology, power is nothing. the twink needs to break his teeth. that's why obi-wan kenobi sends him to yoda. in contact with yoda, this young cub will learn everything. starting with unlearning. the old master will teach him the basics. to progress, luke must get rid of all his certainties that prevent us from seeing clearly. it becomes a blank page. yoda is not trying to format it, at least not officially. rather, it seeks to empty the mind of all the parasitic caches that consumer society imposes on us. draw a line on all these urban legends. yoda turns out to be a better coach than a psychiatrist. rather than worrying about why, he is more interested in how because it is hyper-pragmatic. his method works because when luke faces his father, he is able to resist his enticing promises of power.;11 February 2022;8;['great', 'undeniable', 'potential', 'large', 'rough', 'wrong', 'young', 'old', 'blank', 'least', 'parasitic', 'urban', 'well', 'interested', 'hyper', 'pragmatic', 'able', 'enticing'];0.0886904761904762

1207;ajbarraclough_512;the empire strikes back is clearly the best of the star wars saga. it has a much deeper plot than the 1st star wars and takes you further into the characters as they struggle for survival. john williams scores a great but dark score for the movie, the most powerful and memorable piece from the movie is 'the imperial march', which serves as a signature piece in the movie. the story goes darker as the imperial star fleet continues to pursue the location of the rebel's secret base. luke skywalker seeks the location of the jedi master yoda while han, leia and chewie take a daring flight through a deadly asteroid field. i would definitely say this is the best movie of all time...;2 January 2006;10;['good', 'deep', 'great', 'dark', 'powerful', 'memorable', 'imperial', 'dark', 'imperial', 'secret', 'daring', 'deadly', 'good'];0.2555555555555556

""the empire strikes back"" gets where ""star wars"" left off. the imperial powers (the trouble makers) have been set back by the demolition of their death star, yet are even more incensed and focused on the destruction of the rebels (the heroes), who are battling for harmony and opportunity in the system. numerous pundits see this as the best of the ""star wars"" set of three of motion pictures, and i won't oppose this idea. the maker/chief, george lucas, had considerably more cash when he shot this motion picture than he improved the situation the past one, and it appears.
