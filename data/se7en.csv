0;MartinHafer;"i think the audience for ""se7en"" is rather self-selecting. if you don't mind an ultra-gory cop film with a lot of expletives, then you will be delighted. if you are looking for something family-friendly or 'nice', then you wouldn't even consider watching this in the first place. while i don't think i'd put myself in either group, i am not really a bit fan of gore and although i can respect the film, it really isn't a film for me. so why did i watch it? well, with well over 17000 reviews and an overall imdb score that places it near the top of all films, then it's natural i'd get to it sooner or later. as for the film, i won't say much--there are already tons of reviews for this one. suffice to say that the plot is exceptional--complex, shocking and worth seeing. the acting also is quite nice all around. the bottom line is that this is a quality production and if it's the sort of thing you'd normally watch, watch away and enjoy.";20 January 2015;9;['ultra', 'gory', 'delighted', 'friendly', 'nice', 'first', 'overall', 'natural', 'much', 'exceptional', 'complex', 'shocking', 'worth', 'nice', 'bottom'];0.1493055555555555
1;TheLittleSongbird;from david fincher, se7en is a compelling and brilliant postmodern film noir. it is grim and disturbing but it is also very intelligent and daring. what i did love about se7en especially is that it is incredibly stylish, beautiful dark cinematography and dazzling landscapes really do add to the atmosphere. very little of the murders are shown but we are appalled and shocked by what we hear of them, the action is tense and the climax is shattering. there is also an intelligent screenplay, a clever plot telling of a vicious serial killer who murders his victims in a gruesome way to atone for the sins(gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy and wrath)he deems them to have committed and excellent direction. the acting is also superb, morgan freeman gives another brilliant performance as the disillusioned detective and brad pitt is great as mills in a more meatier role than he has ever done. gwyneth paltrow makes a small yet significant appearance as mill's uneasy wife, while kevin spacey superbly delivers equally superb dialogue as john doe despite the fact he isn't in the film much. overall, a brilliant film, with adept performances, direction, style and ambition. 10/10 bethany cox;18 May 2010;10;['compelling', 'brilliant', 'postmodern', 'grim', 'disturbing', 'intelligent', 'daring', 'stylish', 'beautiful', 'dark', 'dazzling', 'little', 'appalled', 'tense', 'intelligent', 'clever', 'vicious', 'serial', 'gruesome', 'excellent', 'superb', 'brilliant', 'disillusioned', 'brad', 'great', 'meaty', 'small', 'significant', 'uneasy', 'superb', 'brilliant', 'adept'];0.2568333333333333
2;Leofwine_draca;two very different films about serial killers ruled hollywood in the 1990s: 1991's silence of the lambs, featuring anthony hopkins as the infamous hannibal 'the cannibal' lecter, and this, david fincher's masterpiece about a pair of new york cops tackling a perverted killer inspired by the seven deadly sins. se7en is an extremely stylish film that ended up inspiring dozens of copycats like resurrection and the bone collector: all of the films share a gritty-grimy style with depictions of unflinching violence, seedy backdrops and sleazy characters. whichever way you look at it, se7en is a great movie. it has a pair of sterling performances from relative newcomers brad pitt and morgan freeman, playing stock cliched characters: the young rookie and the older, wiser cop on the verge of retirement. both pitt and freeman overcome their characters' conventions to make them believable people. their quarry is kevin spacey, giving one of his traditionally disturbed portrayals as a sociopath with no inklings of good or evil. much of the film is made up of police procedural elements, with the investigation of crime scenes, the following of leads and at least one fantastic chase sequence halfway through in which fincher's direction is top notch. it's also blessed with a gruesomely dark twist ending which stays in your head forever afterwards. for what it's worth, i'd pick se7en over silence every time.;13 March 2012;8;['different', 'serial', 'infamous', 'perverted', 'deadly', 'stylish', 'gritty', 'seedy', 'sleazy', 'great', 'sterling', 'relative', 'cliched', 'young', 'old', 'wise', 'believable', 'good', 'much', 'procedural', 'fantastic', 'top', 'notch', 'dark', 'worth'];0.259375

4;Hitchcoc;"i was totally taken with this film. it's not the usual suspects, but it is really something. unfortunately, i felt almost sick when i was finished watching it. the madness of the murders and the general philosophical sickness that carries it along put it out of reach for some of us. i can't imagine the world portrayed here. great cast. i really thing brad pitt is excellent; and, of course, morgan freeman is his usual complex self. once again, however, in a relatively brief appearance, kevin spacey steals every scene he's in. it's that unflappable delivery of his. no matter what is said or done, he anticipates it. the murders are hideous. the camera doesn't show the most gory details (which i appreciated), but they are sold to us through outside factors. i missed this the first time through and wanted it to be part of my movie-going experience. i don't think i could ever watch it again.";9 March 2010;8;['usual', 'sick', 'general', 'philosophical', 'great', 'excellent', 'usual', 'complex', 'brief', 'unflappable', 'hideous', 'gory', 'outside', 'first'];0.0071428571428571
5;Horst_In_Translation;"""seven"" or ""se7en"" is an american movie from over 20 years ago already that features four academy award winners playing the main characters: morgan freeman, brad pitt, gwyneth paltrow and kevin spacey, even if none of them had an oscar when this film was made. spacey won the very same year though and it was an amazing 1995 for him. fittingly, these over 2 hours here are at their best in the last half hour when he visibly enters the picture. i am fairly certain that the greatness of these last 30 minutes clouds many people's judgments about this movie. lets be honest. the first 1.5 hours are really solid, but not great. the idea of letting a killer commit his murder in style of the seven deadly sins is a nice one, but the execution in detail left me wanting for more of course. i am not the greatest pitt or paltrow fan, but they play their characters well here. and morgan freeman is a delight as always for sure. i personally believe that if they had managed to keep the first three quarters of the film more essential and possibly kept the movie 15-20 minutes shorter, this may have been an even more rewarding watch. the director is david fincher by the way and after a prolific career of music video direction (and aliens 3), this film here was his big breakthrough that turned him into one of the a-list directors in hollywood, which he still is today. nonetheless, i have to be a bit critical about this film here. imdb has it almost in the top20 films of all time based on the rating and that is very exaggerated. the critics consensus seems more appropriate. it is probably among the 10 best films of 1995, but nowhere near being an all-time great film. as much as i liked the final chapter here, i would need to be very generous already to call it an all-time great ending. still, the film is worth seeing at least once for sure and i recommend it, especially if you like the actors.";23 March 2016;6;['american', 'main', 'same', 'amazing', 'good', 'last', 'half', 'certain', 'last', 'many', 'honest', 'first', 'solid', 'great', 'deadly', 'nice', 'more', 'great', 'sure', 'first', 'essential', 'short', 'rewarding', 'prolific', 'big', 'critical', 'exaggerated', 'appropriate', 'good', 'great', 'final', 'generous', 'great', 'worth', 'least', 'sure'];0.2913419913419914

7;kosmasp;those who try to punish sinners are not saints either of course. the movie who was showing people things that are going wrong with our society, is a showcase of brad pitt. putting morgan freeman next to him was working more than fine. but it's the mystery surrounding the who is behind it all. the journey we take, with a conclusion that will leave you devastated (even those who knew or were able to see where it was going) to say the least. fincher is showing he knows how to direct, edit and set the mood for a film. this is as assured as it gets and one of the best thrillers the 90s produced for the movie business. i won't go into the story, but if you like suspense, you will be more than happy to watch this (some scenes are tough to watch mind you!);11 July 2015;9;['wrong', 'brad', 'fine', 'able', 'least', 'good', 'more', 'happy', 'tough'];0.2159722222222222
8;classicsoncall;"the formula has been used before, an experienced and world weary detective (morgan freeman) is assigned a veritable rookie (brad pitt) as a partner to solve a crime that's about to evolve into a serial murder case. that's pretty much where the similarities end however, as director david fincher takes us on a compelling, if not sordid ride into the belly of a cinematic beast. based on the theme of the seven deadly sins, ""se7en"" is a film you're not likely to forget, even if it's for all the wrong reasons. though the sin of gluttony opens the story with the gruesome imagery provided by a coroner's description of the crime, the horror only builds as detectives somerset (freeman) and mills (pitt) follow the taunting trail of a yet to be identified killer. as the story progresses, the method of the murderer involves some of the most disgusting ways to dispatch a victim, and it's the discomfort the viewer has in imagining these crimes that play such a visceral part of the film's experience. for all of the picture's implied gore and violence, the most riveting sequence of the film takes place after john doe gives himself up, leaving the viewer to wonder how this is all going to play out. i must say, kevin spacey can be a harrowing presence in a film, and the way he portrays the serial killer is a study in implied menace. his demonic influence overpowers the ride out to the field where he's about to unload both barrels on the pair of detectives. his envy of the lawmen's skill compels the final deadly sin of wrath to bring the picture to a gut wrenching conclusion. this film is not for the faint of heart, and definitely not for someone who likes their crime thrillers wrapped up neatly with a bow by the time it's over. somerset certainly knew that ""this isn't going to have a happy ending"", but little could he have expected the twisted result of john doe's final act of desperate, solemn fury.";11 September 2011;9;['experienced', 'weary', 'veritable', 'about', 'serial', 'cinematic', 'deadly', 'likely', 'wrong', 'gruesome', 'disgusting', 'visceral', 'riveting', 'harrowing', 'serial', 'demonic', 'about', 'final', 'deadly', 'happy', 'little', 'twisted', 'final', 'desperate', 'solemn'];-0.1298076923076923

10;gavin6942;"a detective (brad pitt) moves to the big city (possibly new york, but never stated) just as another (morgan freeman) is retiring. for the last seven days of the retiring detective's career, they must track down a serial killer who bases his killings around the seven deadly sins. gwenyth paltrow, r. lee ermey, john c. mcginley, and richard roundtree also appear. this film starts out with an amazing nine inch nails remix of ""closer"" over some spooky credits that will play a part in the film later on (but you probably will not make the connection until your second viewing). this sets the tone for a mid-1990s film of nihilistic, dark despair. unlike another mid-1990s film (""empire records"") that focused on the pop aspects, this film is for all those who saw the dark side of the decade. that nihilism is evident, and really summed up the 1990s for some (and ushered in the peak of tim burton's career, along with industrial music and films like ""the doom generation"". john doe speaks of the general ""apathy"" of the world, which came to the forefront in the 1990s, i think, with marilyn manson and ultimately ending with columbine when we were shocked back to our senses. if the 1990s were a color, it would have been black. visually, the film is stunning, even in the death shots. the gluttony victim, which starts the movie out, is a corpse you will never forget. the acting here is quite good, perhaps among brad pitt's best work. there is an odd moment or two, but overall he is flawless. this is likely the film that solidified his career for the next decade (more than ""thelma and louise"" ever did). morgan freeman is great, but when is he not? his mere presence exudes genius. as far as serial killer dramas go, this one is as well written as possible. another one, ""8mm"", from the same writer, is also pretty good. but i think this one takes the cake. other cop dramas with morgan freeman (""along came a spider"", for example) are also well written. but again, this takes it. the blend of action, humor, dark grisly death and literary intelligence is just superb in its smooth mixture. what other serial killer is using dante and ""paradise lost"" as a guidebook? can i again say the supporting cast is good? paltrow almost never fails to impress, and this is one of her more vulnerable roles -- a dainty flower in a hurricane. ermey is his typical authoritarian self, but more reserved here, to his credit. and roundtree is at the peak of his career, as well -- this may not be ""shaft"", but i think he comes across as a serious actor here in a way he never has before. as anyone will tell you, this film is ranked in the top fifty for a good reason: it is a stellar film. if you do not mind a little blood and plenty of curse words, you will love the intricate and well-woven plot here. i recently watched the film again -- possibly my fifth time now -- and it only grows better with repeat viewings. in short: delightfully sinister!";7 August 2007;9;['big', 'last', 'serial', 'deadly', 'amazing', 'close', 'spooky', 'second', 'nihilistic', 'dark', 'dark', 'evident', 'industrial', 'general', 'apathy', 'black', 'stunning', 'good', 'good', 'odd', 'flawless', 'likely', 'next', 'more', 'thelma', 'great', 'mere', 'serial', 'possible', 'same', 'good', 'other', 'dark', 'grisly', 'literary', 'smooth', 'other', 'serial', 'good', 'vulnerable', 'dainty', 'ermey', 'typical', 'authoritarian', 'reserved', 'serious', 'top', 'good', 'stellar', 'little', 'intricate', 'fifth', 'short', 'sinister'];0.1612938596491228
11;jboothmillard;"from director david fincher (alien, fight club, panic room), i had heard about the film, seen one or two clips, and heard about things go on and the concept, so i was really when i finally watched it. basically two homicide detectives are partnered to investigate a series of homicides. they are soon-to-retire detective lt. william somerset (morgan freeman) and short-tempered but enthusiastic replacement detective david mills (brad pitt), who has recently moved to the city with his wife tracy (gwyneth paltrow). the murders are inspired by the seven deadly sins: gluttony (overindulgence and overconsumption), greed (or avarice, the desire and pursuit of material possessions), sloth (habitual disinclination to exertion, or laziness), pride (or vanity, the irrationally corrupt sense of one's personal value, status or accomplishments), lust (or lechery, intense longing), envy (jealousy for another person's good fortune) and wrath (or anger, uncontrolled feelings of rage, even hatred). a man was forced to eat until his stomach ruptured, representing gluttony, and a defence attorney was killed after a pound of flesh was taken from him, representing greed. clues at the murder scenes lead them to a suspect's apartment, where they find the third victim, a child molester and drug dealer, strapped to bed and starved to death, representing sloth. photographs of the third victim were taken over a year ago, showing that the crimes were planned far in advance. somerset and mills use various literal sources to identify anything related to the seven deadly sins, including john milton's paradise lost and dante's inferno, and through library records they identify a man called jonathan ""john"" doe, and track him to his apartment. does flees as they arrive, mills gives chase, doe holds him at gunpoint for a moment before escaping. after breaking into the apartment, mills and somerset find it contains hundreds of notebooks revealing the psychotic nature of doe, as well as a clue to another murder. the detectives arrive too late to stop a man forced to kill a prostitute by raping her with a custom-made bladed strap-on, representing lust. the following day the fifth victim, a female model is found dead with her face mutilated, doe gave her the choice of calling for help and living disfigured, or committing suicide by taking pills, representing pride. as somerset and mills return to the station, john doe (kevin spacey) turns himself in, covered in the blood of an unidentified victim, he cannot be properly identified, as he has removed his own fingerprints, meaning he literally is ""john doe"" (anonymous). doe offers to take the detectives to the final two victims, but only under specific terms, or he will plead insanity, somerset is wary, but mills agrees. the detectives follow doe's directions to a remote desert location, while a helicopter follows them. soon after their arrival, a delivery van approaches, mills holds doe at gunpoint while somerset stops the van, the driver has been instructed to deliver a box to them. doe taunts mills by telling him how he admires and is jealous of his life with tracy, he himself is representing envy. somerset opens the box, he is shocked by its contents and warns mills to stay back, doe states that he killed tracy, her head is in the box, and he reveals that she was pregnant. despite warning mills that doe will win if he kills him, mills shoots doe, fulfilling the final murder, and himself representing wrath, in the end the devastated mills is taken away. also starring full metal jacket's r. lee ermey as police captain, scrubs' john c. mcginley as the california swat team leader, richard roundtree as district attorney martin talbot, richard schiff as mark swarr, mark boone junior as greasy fbi man, reg e. cathey as dr. santiago and speed's hawthorne james as george the night guard at the library. freeman is great as the dignified and credible detective on the brink of retirement, and he is equally matched by the raw but idealistic pitt, paltrow is alright in her short time, and spacey steals the last few scenes as the psychopathic killer. this is a really clever and sophisticated postmodern movie, the script and narrative is daring, the murders and violence are disturbing, you follow the mystery unfolding, there is a jump or two along the way (the man strapped to the bed thought to be dead suddenly waking is a good one), the use of dark colouring and underlighting adds to the bleakness, and the twist ending is fantastic, it is just a marvellous must see crime thriller. it was nominated the oscar for best film editing, and it was nominated the bafta for best original screenplay. brad pitt was number 15, morgan freeman number 27, and kevin

12;rmax304823;"nicely plotted and well-written script, suitably ominous score, good performances all around. i think the seven deadly sins were codified in the sixth century by pope gregory i. keven spacey, as the serial killer (there seems to be no end of them), takes them seriously enough to track down good examples of each and execute them according to their cardinal traits. for instance, he ties an obese man into a chair and force feeds him until he is the size of the puking man in ""monty python's meaning of life,"" and then kicks him until he explodes. the older i get and the more the flesh sags, the less amusing i find this concept. the murders, by the way, are pretty disgusting, what with the darkness lighted by tiny candles, the flies buzzing around, the mutilated and decomposing corpses, the severed body parts, and all that. particularly horrifying are the last two of the seven killings. one involves an excess of envy and the other of anger. i don't want to give much more away, but they involve spacey himself and one of the two detectives (freeman and pitt). the incident is a most unexpected twist, and a plausible one. that's what i meant in describing this as well written. as an unintended bonus there is an exchange between the detectives, in 1995. freeman has just bribed an fbi man for a list of library records. certain books are flagged and when someone checks them out, the users records are fed into the bureau's data base. pitt: ""wait a minute now. how is this legal?"" freeman: ""legal, illegal, these terms don't apply here."" freeman and pitt are the usual mismatched cops at the beginning, but this is not a mismatched buddy movie by any means. half-way through and their few differences are resolved in a reasonable manner. pitt doesn't do a bad job, and morgan freeman is outstanding as usual. what a fine actor he is. ordinarily he's rock solid but then watch him as a murderous pimp in ""street smart"" to get an idea of his range. and the movie simply would not be all that it is without gwyneth paltrow. she is a gangly blond with features so delicate that a viewer gets the impression that the slightest kiss on her cheek might leave a memorial bruise. that's important, for reasons i won't go into. the scene in the cafe in which she helplessly asks a helpless freeman for advice about her secret pregnancy could have been either cloying or unnecessary if it had been written clumsily, but it was not. we can feel the actors meshing like gear wheels during the conversation. if i had a problem it was with the lights. i wish someone had bothered to turn them on. okay, a murder scene in a shabby apartment could be dark. but why is the precinct station as gloomy as a bohemian bar? i realize this underlighting is fashionable -- damn ""the x files"" -- but it's getting tiresome to see people running around during action scenes carrying flashlights. while i'm complaining i might as well mention that the score, though brooding, is loud, obtrusive, and generic. under the opening credits it passes through the obtrusive barrier into irritating, as are the credits themselves, which are shaky and resemble the deliberate but sloppy scrawl of a kindergardener. every scene is underlined by edgy music except one in which freeman pokes around in the library, when the composer uses the rapturous air on a g string, the most accessible piece bach ever wrote. the very well done library scene reminded me of college one hundred years ago when students had ideals. during exam week the student radio station would play nothing but suitable classical music. you could walk across the quad and hear bach coming from two dozen open windows, a 24.0 sound system. that's a minor carp though. the is a genuinely good example of the genre. another thriller about a serial murderer, but a good example still.";22 January 2006;7;['ominous', 'good', 'deadly', 'sixth', 'serial', 'good', 'cardinal', 'obese', 'monty', 'old', 'amusing', 'disgusting', 'tiny', 'mutilated', 'last', 'other', 'unexpected', 'plausible', 'unintended', 'certain', 'legal', 'legal', 'illegal', 'usual', 'mismatched', 'half', 'few', 'reasonable', 'bad', 'outstanding', 'usual', 'fine', 'solid', 'murderous', 'smart', 'blond', 'delicate', 'slight', 'memorial', 'important', 'helpless', 'secret', 'unnecessary', 'shabby', 'dark', 'precinct', 'gloomy', 'bohemian', 'fashionable', 'tiresome', 'loud', 'obtrusive', 'generic', 'obtrusive', 'shaky', 'deliberate', 'sloppy', 'edgy', 'rapturous', 'accessible', 'suitable', 'classical', 'open', 'minor', 'good', 'serial', 'good'];0.0241341991341991

14;BA_Harrison;i consider david fincher's seven to be a precursor/forerunner of the 'torture porn' phenomenonmore specifically, the saw movies: it utilises the grunge aesthetic that has become synonymous with such films, features a self-righteous villain who delights in playing gruesome games, revels in the extreme nature of its victims' suffering, and delivers an uncompromising and rather preposterous finale that is designed to hit like a kick to the gut. however, despite being the impetus for what has become one the most over-saturated and tiresome of sub-genres (as well as that irritating trend of replacing letters in a title with numbers), i don't resent fincher's film one bit: it's just too good to hold a grudge againsta masterpiece of the macabre that admittedly requires a little suspension of disbelief to be truly effective, but which is so well crafted and so horrific that to do so is both easy and worthwhile. fincher is able to successfully brush off the debacle that was alien 3 and prove himself to be the accomplished movie-maker that many suspected him to be. without studio interference, he successfully delivers his visiona visually stunning chiller that delivers thrills, chills, grisly horror aplenty, without resorting to cheap scares or overtly explicit gore. despite its gruesome subject matter, se7en doesn't rely on relentless splatter to shock: the mere suggestion of what has occurred possesses the power to repel, with brief glimpses of the murder victims' corpses offering just enough grisly detail to satisfy the viewer's morbid curiosity. an ingenious script from andrew kevin walker, impeccable performances from its amazing cast (including a particularly outstanding performance from kevin spacey), and what what has to be one of most harrowing and unsettling endings in cinema, all adds up to one hell of a fine movie.;11 February 2012;9;['synonymous', 'such', 'righteous', 'gruesome', 'extreme', 'preposterous', 'tiresome', 'good', 'little', 'effective', 'horrific', 'easy', 'worthwhile', 'able', 'alien', 'stunning', 'cheap', 'explicit', 'gruesome', 'relentless', 'mere', 'brief', 'grisly', 'ingenious', 'impeccable', 'amazing', 'outstanding', 'harrowing', 'unsettling', 'fine'];0.0581521739130434

the whole production blends together seamlessly to create a truly gripping & absorbing thriller, from the gloomy production design to the terrific acting to the wonderful script & it's character's. it's easy to be drawn into the world of the two leads as they search for a serial killer, freeman's fantastic performance as somerset in particular is great to watch, he is thoughtful, precise, likable & smart in an ordinary bloke sort of way while pitt as mills is his opposite who is naive & immature. together they make a perfect contrast of character's & they feel like real people. the script has some great twists & turns but the big one at the end is a real show stopper, it's a great twist ending that just works on so many levels & is brilliantly executed. se7en has it's seedy, sleazy & gloomy moments but it tries to paint a world where sin is accepted all to freely, there are some great speeches here especially by somerset that indicate all is not lost but it's easy to see that the real world is full of the sin that is punished here & that we also just accept to readily so it even has a strong relevant social message that does have meaning but at the same time but the script still manages to make a terrific dark thriller out of the ideas here. lasting for two hours & not being the most action packed film ever patience is definitely needed but i do think the twists & plot do hold ones attention very well, for me the two hours flew by & it didn't feel that long which is always a great sign & one that the film didn't bore me & maintained my interest throughout right until it's killer twist ending. the film looks great with dark & gloomy production design that suits the downbeat seedy world created in the script. there are some gruesome murder scenes & shots of dead bodies although little in the way of actual on screen violence (the killer is never seen killing or hurting anyone on screen for instance), the special effects as expected are top notch (just look at the obese man's corpse on the autopsy table). people make mention of the fact it's always raining in the city scenes but apparently this had nothing to do with thematics or style or the makers vision but because during the first two days of brad pitt filming it was raining so to avoid any continuity issues the makers decides to make it rain during all pitt's outdoor scenes. apparently the brilliant canadian director david cronenberg was offered the chance to direct but he turned it down, imagine how good this might have been if he had accepted? denzel washington was offered the part of david mills that went to brad pitt while r.e.m.'s michael stipe was considered for the role of the killer. with a supposed budget of about $30,000,000 this was new line cinemas first big budget 'a' film & it made a load at the box-office, filmed in los angeles in california the name of the city where se7en takes place is never actually mentioned on screen. the acting is superb all round, freeman is excellent as is kevin spacey & r. lee ermey while it was nice to see shaft himself richard roundtree. se7en is a terrific serial killer thriller that has a great script, a great twist, super acting, good effects, striking production design & a fair bit of depth. there aren't many films i would call classics but maybe se7en would be one of them.;2 April 2010;8;['veteran', 'first', 'obese', 'dead', 'own', 'obese', 'serial', 'large', 'high', 'deadly', 'moral', 'brutal', 'sure', 'mutilated', 'tortured', 'serial', 'good', 'ordinary', 'whole', 'gripping', 'gloomy', 'terrific', 'wonderful', 'easy', 'serial', 'fantastic', 'particular', 'great', 'thoughtful', 'precise', 'likable', 'smart', 'ordinary', 'naive', 'perfect', 'real', 'great', 'big', 'real', 'great', 'many', 'seedy', 'sleazy', 'gloomy', 'great', 'easy', 'real', 'full', 'strong', 'relevant', 'social', 'same', 'terrific', 'dark', 'most', 'great', 'great', 'dark', 'gloomy', 'downbeat', 'seedy', 'gruesome', 'dead', 'little', 'actual', 'special', 'top', 'notch', 'autopsy', 'first', 'outdoor', 'brilliant', 'canadian', 'good', 'supposed', 'new', 'first', 'big', 'superb', 'round', 'excellent', 'nice', 'terrific', 'serial', 'great', 'great', 'super', 'good', 'fair', 'many'];0.3246653220516857

49;Red-Barracuda;if you simply read about what seven is about you would be forgiven for thinking it sounded an incredibly hackneyed affair. a world weary detective a week from retirement is paired with a young hotshot colleague to work on a new case of grisly murders. they don't get on at first but once they get to know each other they begin to form a bond and prove to be a good team. this synopsis makes seven sound like a generic buddy cop movie. and, to be fair, it is that to a certain extent. but fortunately the truth is in the detail. director david fincher is a visual stylist and it's the look and feel of the movie that helps transcend it to another level. the setting is a nameless, hellish city where it seems to constantly be raining. there is a consistent feeling of impending dread. the visual elements of the film emphasises this. it goes for a dark neo-noir look, what with the rain and the shadowy interiors. the buildings all look like they are from a bygone era, while the men seem to dress like they are from a 40's film-noir - hats and trench coats are the order of the day, despite this clothing being completely out of fashion in the 90's. it's this attention to detail that gives seven such an interesting look and feel. then we have the serial killings themselves. they have been staged to represent the seven deadly sins from the bible. each horrible death is targeted against someone who breaches one of the sins and their punishment is an elaborate and violent lesson against their transgression. it's a great set of crimes to base a detective film around. the mystery narrative progresses at first in a fairly traditional way but towards the end the rug is pulled out from under us and we enter unexpected territory. it's this unpredictability also that makes this a fine unconventional thriller. the principal actors are all very good, with a particular standout turn from kevin spacey towards the end. spacey is very adept a doing 'cold' and here he is pitch perfect. the story arc winds its way intelligently to an unforgettably nihilistic climax and seven ultimately has to be considered one of the best serial killer films out there.;16 October 2013;9;['hackneyed', 'weary', 'young', 'new', 'grisly', 'other', 'good', 'generic', 'fair', 'certain', 'visual', 'hellish', 'consistent', 'visual', 'dark', 'shadowy', 'bygone', 'interesting', 'serial', 'deadly', 'horrible', 'elaborate', 'violent', 'great', 'traditional', 'unexpected', 'fine', 'unconventional', 'principal', 'good', 'particular', 'adept', 'cold', 'perfect', 'nihilistic', 'good', 'serial'];0.1963593073593074

53;sddavis63;"this journey through the mind of a religiously motivated serial killer who kills his victims based on his interpretation of the seven deadly sins is a bit uneven in places, but builds very nicely to its ultimate climax, and i found that the last 20-30 minutes of the movie were very effective as a closure. the open question as the movie came to its end was how the murders depicting envy and wrath were going to be committed. that's done in a quite shocking and horrific way. i can't say it was a surprise - i guessed what was in the box addressed to mills as soon as the box was introduced - but still it was a grand finale (if one can call it that) to a pretty decent movie. the performances from morgan freeman as detective somerset and kevin spacey as ""john doe"" were especially effective - which they should have been, since both were pretty standard characters for the actors. somerset was the experienced, street-wise detective who dispensed advice freely, and spacey was the - well - kind of spacey, quirky character that he pulls off so well in so many movies. brad pitt was less effective as the young detective mills - somerset's partner. he wasn't bad, but somehow neither his performance nor the character connected with me. gwyneth paltrow was underused as an actress, although her character (if not paltrow herself) plays a central role in the end. the movie seemed to have a bit of a ""silence of the lambs"" feel to it, with the serial killer angle and the mind games being played with the police, and the real attention getter through most of the movie was to find out how the deadly sins were going to be represented by the murders that were being committed. i was a little concerned that this had the potential to turn into little more than a gore-fest, but that didn't happen. there are some gruesome shots of the victims, but for the most part the focus was on the psychological dimensions of the story. all in all i thought this was a very good movie; ""seven"" gets a 7 from me.";18 June 2008;7;['serial', 'deadly', 'uneven', 'ultimate', 'last', 'effective', 'open', 'shocking', 'horrific', 'grand', 'decent', 'effective', 'standard', 'experienced', 'wise', 'well', 'quirky', 'many', 'brad', 'effective', 'young', 'bad', 'central', 'serial', 'real', 'most', 'deadly', 'little', 'concerned', 'little', 'more', 'f', 'gruesome', 'most', 'psychological', 'good'];0.1015432098765432
54;Lejink;"david fincher's searing, cop v serial killer thriller ushered in a slew of movies with themed killers and their grisly doings, variations on which are still being produced today. the original is undoubtedly the best however, helped by the imaginative plotting, fine lead acting and most of all taut direction here, as the john doe killer, the now-disgraced kevin spacey, works his way through the seven deadly sins, inveigling into his nefarious plans the two detectives on his trail, leading to a fittingly shocking and heart-pounding climax. the two detectives are old-hand morgan freeman, in his last week of active duty and brad pitt as the brash new 'tec on the block. you can be forgiven for thinking that early on, director fincher is padding out his story with cliched buddy-stuff between them, especially when pitt's wife paltrow comes into the picture but his methodology becomes clear as he leads us inexorably to the intense conclusion. notable for the gruesome detail of the murders depicted, a great on-foot chase through the rain-soaked city streets between pitt and spacey and of course the ""what's in the box"" culmination in the middle of nowhere, filmed in a dark, rainy greyish colour scheme, up until the broad daylight ending that is, with a brooding soundtrack and camera-work which mixes up extreme close-ups, vivid hand-held shots, urban detail and pre-drone landscape shooting, it's close to a masterclass in creating suspense and excitement.";30 July 2021;8;['serial', 'themed', 'grisly', 'good', 'imaginative', 'fine', 'most', 'deadly', 'nefarious', 'shocking', 'old', 'last', 'active', 'new', 'tec', 'cliched', 'clear', 'intense', 'notable', 'gruesome', 'great', 'dark', 'rainy', 'greyish', 'broad', 'extreme', 'close', 'vivid', 'urban', 'pre', 'drone', 'close'];0.0816098484848485
55;ElMaruecan82;"""se7en"" is one of these cinematic rarities that elevate themselves to unsuspected levels of depth after each viewing, in the greatest tradition of film noir and detective mysteries. like ""chinatown"", it reinvented the noir genre with its own particular atmosphere, both were and are still atypical for their time, and both end with a case solved, yet a puzzling conclusion. ""se7en"" is less about the series of crimes committed than the two men who lead the investigation, and the way their relationship evolves and highlights their respective approach to life, to death, to the world they live in, with an implicitness that respects our intelligence enough so we can respect the film in return. this intelligence (or subtlety) is not immediately palpable, and the opening scene can mislead some viewers by falsely establishing the sort of odd couple we'd expect in a cop team: the wise veteran and the hot-headed youngster. of course, you can trust david fincher's directing and the cleverness of the script because there's much more to say about morgan freeman and brad pitt in these two roles, among the best of their careers. morgan freeman is sommerset, a cop in his last week before retirement but not the typical cop about to retire, (as a matter of fact, nothing is typical in ""se7en""), he's a law enforcer who never fired in 34 years of service and never got shot either, quite an achievement for someone who doesn't work in the most secure neighborhood. sommerset incarnates the typical noir protagonist, whose optimism was eroded by years and years of facing and fighting the most sordid crimes. although he's not the most likely to have faith in humanity, he's not cynical because he still respects his job. however, he's lucid about one thing, as long as there will be men, there will be rapists, killers, and criminals of the worst species. sommerset is lucid and competent, he's like a spotlight of hope in a gloomy darkness, and that's enough to gain our respect, he's calm even when facing the most horrific and gruesome crimes, like the poor obese man forced to eat to death. this opening crime is spectacular and graphic, but fincher restrains himself because the horror is sometimes more efficient when it's suggested. the horrific aspect of the first crime is also distracted by the first interactions with mills, brad pitt, as the replacing detective. mills is not a rookie, he's got his share of thrills and he knows his business. the problem is his temper: too cocky, too hot-headed, too sure of himself, he can't stand sommerset's patronizing attitude. the progress of the investigation depends on the partnership between mills and sommerset, so they do their best to accommodate each other but it's only when sommerset is invited to dinner by mills' wife tracy, that the ice is broken. tracy here is essential, and not just as a simple plot device, she's a sweet and caring housewife, beautifully played by gwyneth paltrow. tracy loves her husband and provides the extra level of depth needed to appreciate mills' character who's more one-dimensional in contrast with sommerset. tracy is the emotional connection between the viewers and mills, and consequently between mills and sommerset, she's the heart of the film, and plays like an efficient counterpart to the gloomy atmosphere we're plunged in since the very start, it's no wonder that she 'hates the place', she embodies hope, family, marriage, loyalty, the best in humanity. and that's the most brilliant aspect of ""se7en"", especially from a 29-year old director: david fincher, with a remarkable craftsmanship, establishes all the elements of the puzzle in the first half-hour, setting the atmosphere: a rainy, dark and totally unappealing little town. it's a hellish, nightmarish world where we're plunged, where only feeble spotlights can penetrate a nightmarish darkness, it's one of these places, you're afraid to walk like in a dark room where you can accidentally put your foot on a sleeping cockroach. talk about a hostile atmosphere. but this atmosphere is perfect because it fits the nature of the crimes committed, and creates the disturbing urge to establish a peaceful relationship between mills and sommerset, which coincides with the discovery of the first two murder's links: a fat man is killed by eating, a successful lawyer forced to trade parts of his body to (temporarily) spare his live, two words written in various parts: gluttony, greed an obvious 'to be continued' message to the cops. so, everything leads to the conclusion that the crimes are related to the seven deadly sins, and this time, it's not a killer who kills, but, as states sommerset: a killer who preaches. but mills calls a spade a spade, and by labeling the unknown man as 'demented' and 'crazy', he lamentably clouds his judgment while sommerset is more rational and tries to think like the killer. mills is all about emotional reactions, sommerset thinks before he acts, impulses and reason, interestingly, it's the former who believes in love and family, as if 'passion' could work like a double-edged sword. the atypical nature of the crimes and their author elevate the film, sommerset goes to library to try to find out hints in saint-augustin's books, dante's inferno and other medieval and metaphysical classics. though ""se7en"" doesn't necessarily go deeper in the subject but it touched them enough to carry a sort of pedagogical value. we might not read all these books after, but i'm sure many of us, would question their approach to some crucial religious notions like faith, forgiveness, innocence and passion. on that level, the film is not just a cat-and-mouse thriller; it's also a descent into the most hellish aspects of humanity, incarnated by the villain's face, what's more with a perfect conclusion, leaving us with a truly awkward and uncomfortable sensation, free enough to see the half-full or half-empty glass. again, ""se7en"" is a film that respects the viewer's intelligence.";11 June 2012;10;['cinematic', 'unsuspected', 'great', 'own', 'particular', 'atypical', 'less', 'respective',

57;Robert_duder;"se7en defines a cult classic. it is a film that was created intrinsically to haunt you for years after you've seen it. i've seen it a handful of times and in watching it again just now i realized how brilliantly it was built. it might be one of the finest handcrafted films ever made. it was like each and every shot and moment and scene was made to let you see something different each and every time or unpack the film for years to come. if you look at fan theories and things you think is true that have nothing to do with the actual film you'll understand how deep the movie goes. it is definitely a cinephile's dream in that you can find so much about the film to explore. but even at a base level, the tension is unbelievable. with each character and moment you can't help but feel like the next moment will be someone's last. the dark, brooding city they create (unnamed and always raining) is haunting. the film holds this true film noire feel and the style of the characters and the office is something from a 1940's detective film and yet the film clearly is modern times. each time i watch it i want to know more about the world they exist in and yet we never will but watching each time gives you something new. both brad pitt and morgan freeman should have been given oscars. it might be one of the best detective teamings in film history. freeman is the epitome of world weary, ready to retire but haunted by the past cop. brad pitt is the idealistic young detective with the beautiful family just building his life and world and sinking his passion into his work. both men believe they understand the person they're chasing and yet both underestimate the killer greatly. you're watching this mystery unfold through both men's eyes in different ways and then in the end they both end up on the receiving end of a wicked sense of justice. the killer (i literally refuse to say who it is in case someone hasn't seen this nor knows the twists) is brilliantly played by a well known hollywood actor. he also should have been given an oscar. they keep his name from the opening credits and it makes it all the more impactful when he is revealed. he is hands down one of the best ""villains"" or killers in hollywood history in my opinion. the final scene with the three of them in the field is easily a classic moment. gwyneth paltrow has a small but impactful and well played role as pitt's young wife. her and freeman forge an unlikely friendship that works very well. i never liked fight club...it's true...judge me. but david fincher is still an american hollywood icon. some of his other films just literally hit 10's for me easily, probably more than any other director other than maybe spielberg. but fincher's style is dark and cuts right through to our very core of what makes us human. call it horror or noire or thriller but somehow he gets these scripts and creates twists and turns you can barely handle and then gets actors to absolutely knock it out of the park. gone girl, girl with the dragon tattoo, se7en, the game, the social network, these are films that are stylistic and character driven and in every case puts you in the middle of the action and makes you feel everything. se7en is the definitely of a modern day classic and if you love crime films this will be your mother ship calling you home. this will forever by one of my favourite films for a myriad of reasons and i think anyone could sit around and talk about it for years to come. 10/10";24 September 2017;10;['fine', 'handcrafted', 'different', 'true', 'actual', 'deep', 'much', 'unbelievable', 'next', 'last', 'dark', 'unnamed', 'true', 'modern', 'more', 'new', 'good', 'weary', 'ready', 'past', 'idealistic', 'young', 'beautiful', 'different', 'wicked', 'impactful', 'good', 'final', 'classic', 'small', 'impactful', 'young', 'unlikely', 'true', 'american', 'other', 'more', 'other', 'other', 'dark', 'very', 'human', 'social', 'stylistic', 'modern', 'favourite'];0.1122294372294372

62;CuriosityKilledShawn;"after the abysmal failure of alien 3, david fincher held his breath for three years and made a new start with se7en. his signature style of direction is all over it. se7en is filthier than a dead stray dog at the bottom of a new jersey toxic waste dump. it looks so miserable that people nailed to crosses seem happier. the plot explores the extreme pitch-black side of the human psyche and was entirely the creation of one writer. andrew kevin walker, a former tower records employee, conceived, in hell, a heinous story of a serial killer who offs his victims in the style of the seven deadly sins. what was he smoking when he came up with that idea? brad pitt plays david mills, an arrogant, over-confident, semi-experienced detective who is way ahead of himself. he uproots from a decent precinct, dragging his suffering wife (gwyneth paltrow) with him, to transfer to the worst in town - an unnamed, rainier-than-glasgow los angeles - for no other reason than ""to make a difference"". good luck. morgan freeman is william somerset, the most jaded and world-weary cop on the force. he only has a few days with mills before retiring to a simple life in the country. mills could learn a lot from him, and if he had any sense, he would. sadly, this does not happen. in fight club, fincher exposed the rotten underbelly of a free society, the seedy flipside of american culture that most people pretend doesn't exist. somerset says the only way to deal with a world this bad is to be apathetic, the polar opposite to mill's belief that he can make the world a better place. few scripts make for good reading, but andrew kevin walker's writing is one of the film's many strengths. he explored dark, character-driven horror/drama in shockers such as brainscan and 8mm, but this is the meanest. the irony of each victims' death is made entirely justified by the killer's logic behind the madness. of course, he does not believe he is insane. just the world he lives in. haven't you ever felt like that? it is important for such movies to have an atmosphere and se7en is so rank that you can smell it. pitt and freeman deliver great performances, although pitt should learn to breathe through his nose and not have constantly pursed lips. it becomes quite annoying. se7en is definitely the film that kick-started fincher's career. had he made the game right after alien 3, there would have been no fight club, panic room, or social network. for that tiny minority who knows nothing of the film it's high time you checked it out. even if you don't enjoy, you cannot deny its power and effect.";30 September 2006;8;['abysmal', 'new', 'filthy', 'dead', 'stray', 'toxic', 'miserable', 'happy', 'extreme', 'black', 'human', 'former', 'heinous', 'serial', 'deadly', 'confident', 'semi', 'experienced', 'decent', 'bad', 'unnamed', 'other', 'good', 'jaded', 'weary', 'few', 'simple', 'free', 'seedy', 'american', 'most', 'only', 'bad', 'apathetic', 'polar', 'well', 'few', 'good', 'many', 'dark', 'such', 'brainscan', 'mean', 'insane', 'important', 'such', 'rank', 'great', 'annoying', 'social', 'tiny', 'high'];-0.0201614832535885

71;The-Sarkologist;'for the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life in christ jesus our lord' romans 6:23. i have seen this movie before and i knew that this was a good movie but i did not realise how good it was until i watched it again recently, and it is not just the outstanding performances of brad pitt, morgan freeman, and kevin spacey, that make this movie brilliant. in fact, just because you load up a movie with talented actors does not mean that the movie itself will be any good, but rather the it is essence and soul of the movie that will inevitability make it stand out from the many other offerings that we are bombarded with on an almost weekly basis. the movie is set in a city, and it could be any city. some people have tried to determine what it is but it is clear that the location of the film is not important, but rather the content of what the film is about. the city is where people congregate and it is the place where all of the filth of society ends up. whenever we squeeze fallen humanity into a place that is so crowded we are always going to end up seeing the worst of it. i now live in a city, and the one thing that i can say about the city is that it sprawls, both outward and upward, and in this city people do not stand out. it does not matter whether you are a freak or a different, because you are in the city and people in the city simply do not care. this movie is also about sin and not only about how sin destroys, but how people do not care about sin, and even if you were to do something about it, the effect upon the city as a whole would be so minute that it would hardly change anything. in fact i suspect very few people walked out of this movie thinking, 'hey, sin is serious, i better stop doing it'. i don't think that this was the film's purpose of it though, but rather to open our eyes to the idea of what it around, but to also confront ourselves with the powerlessness to do anything about it. take for instance what freeman says about the job of a police officer. it is not to catch bad guys, in fact that very rarely happens. instead, it is to collect evidence and to store it away in the hope that maybe one day it will be used to convict somebody. then we consider the discussion in the car near the end of the film, where brad pitt confronts kevin spacey with the meaninglessness of what he is doing. he asks him whether he is sent by somebody, and what he intends to do by killing innocent people, and while it may be a media sensation for a couple of weeks, people will end up forgetting about it and will end up going about their own business. let us now consider the murders and how they relate to the sins that these people commit. we have the glutton who gorges himself on food to the point that he becomes so obese that he cannot even leave his house. he was going to die anyway, however spacey simply sped it up by forcing him to eat himself to dead. simply somebody who was that fat was doomed to live a short life anyway. as for the lawyer and the model, they were already dead on the inside, as spacey indicates. while she went about continually making herself beautiful in an outward sense, inside she was rotting away and dying. the lawyer may have lived a wealthy and comfortable life, but it was through keeping murders out of gaol and on the street. he had no heart and no soul, he simply did not care about what he was doing, only the money that he was making doing it. while i would disagree with that to an extent, that is not the purpose of the movie. finally, there is the idea about the lust, in that it was not just the prostitute who died, but the man purchasing the services that died to. he was forced, at gun point, to kill this woman, and this is going to be with him for the rest of his life. the woman sells her body, and he succumbs to his lust by buying the services, and neither of them see to far ahead to realise that it will destroy them, if not physically, but mentally as well. however, the real crook, seemed to be the pimp, that simply did not care about who came into his establishment 'lot's of people come in with backpacks, it could be anyone'. does this movie make you think? probably not, but i suspect that the whole point of the movie is that it sits in the back of our mind, and it is the type of movie that we will come back to again and again. maybe it shows us that there is no hope in the world, no way of making a difference, but in the end, this world is a world without a god, and in that sense, is as far from reality as we could get.;16 November 2012;9;['eternal', 'good', 'good', 'outstanding', 'brad', 'brilliant', 'talented', 'good', 'many', 'other', 'weekly', 'clear', 'important', 'fallen', 'crowded', 'bad', 'outward', 'different', 'few', 'serious', 'bad', 'innocent', 'own', 'obese', 'dead', 'short', 'dead', 'beautiful', 'outward', 'wealthy', 'comfortable', 'real', 'whole'];0.245486111111111

75;tomgillespie2002;"after his calamitous experience working on his debut film alien 3 (1992), david fincher took on a small genre picture that, little did he know, would revitalise his career and become one of the greatest films of the 1990's. se7en appears to begin as your typical detective neo- noir, with the cynical veteran and the naive rookie taking on an elusive serial killer seemed hell-bent on turning the sin against the sinner. but, set in an unnamed and permanently drizzly american city, se7en is a meditation on evil and a pessimist's depiction on the modern world, climaxing in one of the bravest and most memorable endings in hollywood history. detective somerset (morgan freeman) is on the verge of retirement, where he plans to leave his inner-city life behind him after years of fighting on the side of good. his replacement is the brash detective mills (brad pitt), an optimistic young recruit eager to learn, who somerset takes under his wing. their first homicide investigation involves an obese man who has been fed at gunpoint to the point of causing his stomach to rupture. with somerset ready to leave the force, mills takes on his first solo case in the murder of a rich attorney, a man forced to cut a pound of flesh from his own body. the murder scene has the words 'greed' written in blood. somerset eventually finds the word 'gluttony' etched in grease in the apartment of the first victim, and he becomes convinced the murders are connected, and that the killer is murdering under the guidance of the seven deadly sins. the genius of se7en is rooted in the way the movie keeps the audience as clueless as the detectives. normally in genre pictures such as this, we either know who the killer is and eagerly wait for the investigators to put the pieces together, or we have a line-up of suspects and red herrings to decide from. here, apart from brief glimpses during a thrilling chase scene, we are devoid of clues. the killer is always one step ahead of somerset and mills, alluding to the idea that the mysterious 'john doe' is indeed having his work guided by a higher power. of course, he is not, he is merely a man, but this helps gives se7en dramatic weight, rather than it becoming a nihilistic exercise in cruelty. when, three-quarters of the movie in, the killer hands himself in, the movie becomes a masterclass in writing, slowly building into one of the greatest climaxes in film. somerset, a decent man who has devoted his life to the side of good but has had the fight slowly drained out of him, meets his nemesis in john doe (kevin spacey). but as they talk, doe's reasoning becomes clear and, shockingly, almost sympathetic. ""wanting people to listen, you can't just tap them on the shoulder anymore, you have to hit them with a sledgehammer,"" he says. it's about a world gone to s**t, a view shared by mills' wife tracy (gwyneth paltrow), who talks to somerset in a diner about allowing a baby to be born into the world after discovering she is pregnant. cerebral and gothic, se7en transcends the genre on so many levels thanks to some bleak yet stylish direction by fincher, and it still manages to astound after almost 20 years of repeat viewings. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com";1 March 2014;10;['calamitous', 'small', 'little', 'great', 'typical', 'cynical', 'naive', 'elusive', 'serial', 'bent', 'unnamed', 'modern', 'brave', 'memorable', 'inner', 'brash', 'optimistic', 'young', 'eager', 'first', 'obese', 'ready', 'first', 'rich', 'own', 'first', 'convinced', 'deadly', 'clueless', 'such', 'red', 'brief', 'devoid', 'mysterious', 'high', 'dramatic', 'nihilistic', 'great', 'decent', 'good', 'clear', 'sympathetic', 'pregnant', 'gothic', 'many', 'bleak', 'stylish'];0.1327857142857142

77;zkonedog;"in 2004, the movie ""saw"" vaulted to the top of many ""psychological thriller"" lists via its gritty depiction of violence and insights into the criminal mind. nearly ten years earlier, ""se7en"" covered similar material and, barring one slip-up, could have stolen saw's thunder. for a basic plot summary, ""se7en"" focuses on a series of brutal crimes revolving around the seven deadly sins of religious lore. investigators mills (brad pitt) & somerset (morgan freeman) are assigned to the case, each bringing a unique perspective (in keeping with their general film personas) to the strange murders. as they near the end of the case, the detectives discover that the man they are pursuing has ideas about human nature that, while sadistic, might just cut to the core of what makes us all fallible. there are two reasons why this movie works as well as it does... first, the overall storyline is just very well-crafted. director david fincher has proved time and time again that he knows how to construct a solid motion picture, and this one is no different. by the end of the movie, you'll be questioning your very beliefs on what you just saw, making this a very cerebral experience. also, fincher does not shy away from portraying the re-enactments of the seven deadly sins in their graphic detail. some people would probably view this as overkill or gross-out film-making, but fincher realized that it had to be this way for such a dark, gritty film to work. in terms of acting, pitt & freeman turn in their usual solid performances. the character arcs seemed a bit forced (pitt as the ""eager rookie"", freeman as the ""grizzled vet""), but the physical acting itself (as well as the way it all comes together in the end) more than makes up for that. the only reason i can't give this film a full five stars (and also the same reason why i can't say it is as good as saw)? to me, the real ""meat"" of the story is when the two detectives finally confront the villain (played to perfection by kevin spacey). whereas in saw, the ""jigsaw"" killer is given as much backstory & screen time as the protagonists, ""se7en"" only focuses on spacey's character for the last portion of the film. everything leading up the that is a procedural cop story (albeit a graphic & disturbing one). thus, i consider ""se7en"" to be a groundbreaking effort in the psychological thriller department, paving the way for later efforts like ""saw"". it isn't perfect, but it did (at least at the time) tread new ground. unless you are overly squeamish, this movie will keep you engaged from its shocking beginning to its even more shocking finale!";10 March 2017;7;['many', 'psychological', 'gritty', 'criminal', 'similar', 'basic', 'brutal', 'deadly', 'religious', 'unique', 'general', 'strange', 'human', 'sadistic', 'fallible', 'overall', 'solid', 'different', 'very', 'cerebral', 'deadly', 'graphic', 'gross', 'dark', 'gritty', 'usual', 'solid', 'forced', 'eager', 'physical', 'only', 'full', 'same', 'good', 'real', 'much', 'last', 'procedural', 'groundbreaking', 'psychological', 'later', 'perfect', 'least', 'new', 'squeamish', 'shocking', 'shocking'];-0.0281565656565656
78;filipemanuelneto;in this film, two detectives have to work together in order to catch a psychopathic killer obsessed with the seven sins. directed by david fincher, with a script by andrew kevin walker, this film has morgan freeman and brad pitt as protagonists. this film approaches, several times, the grotesque. its far from appealing to everyone but it will, almost certainly, please any fan of thrillers or police movies. the killer is a madman who seems obsessed with a naturally awkward topic: the seven deadly sins, well known to anyone who has attended sunday school. the film never speaks openly of religion, but we deduce that this crazy killer is probably christian, which may displease the practitioners of that faith and even catholics. in fact, religious fanaticism is quite implicit in the history, and the scenery. like it or not, its an excellent idea for a movie and gave rise to a great plot, capable of holding the public until the end, despite several disgusting scenes, able to make any popcorn-eater throw in the bag. yes, this is an alert for the teenagers and the faint hearted: this film is, indeed, visually shocking. the way the main characters were developed is very reasonable. they are two detectives, very different personally and professionally, almost the antithesis of each other until they need to form a true partnership. brad pitt gives life to a young cop, active, impulsive, passionate, naturally clashing against the thoughtful and prudent manners of the character played by morgan freeman, who only want to do the job well done and go home at the end of the day... until he understands (and he does it quickly) that this killer will not stop easily and is different from anything they thought before. the work of the actors is good, especially freeman, who incorporate his character easily. pitt also shone, but his character it's hard to like up to half of the film. the film is exceptionally heavy. the picture is dark, most of the scenes takes place in low light or at night (the most notable exception is the police station, plenty of bright and light colors). the crime scenes are usually dark and have black elements (in one of them is the furniture, for example). there are religious elements evident throughout the film also. the soundtrack is interesting, contributing decisively to densify the tension with the constant repetition of high and long chords. in short, this movie is deep, psychologically challenging, shocking and promises to leave no one indifferent. a great story of suspense, from start to finish.;11 July 2016;9;['psychopathic', 'several', 'awkward', 'deadly', 'known', 'crazy', 'christian', 'religious', 'implicit', 'excellent', 'great', 'capable', 'several', 'disgusting', 'able', 'faint', 'shocking', 'main', 'reasonable', 'different', 'other', 'true', 'brad', 'young', 'active', 'impulsive', 'passionate', 'thoughtful', 'prudent', 'different', 'good', 'hard', 'heavy', 'dark', 'most', 'low', 'notable', 'bright', 'light', 'dark', 'black', 'religious', 'evident', 'interesting', 'constant', 'high', 'long', 'short', 'deep', 'challenging', 'shocking', 'great'];0.0545652173913043

83;BaronBl00d;incredibly gritty, very fluid, and most disturbing are all ways that one might describe david fincher's seven, a film, as all of these reviews on here will attest to, is about a serial killer-maniac killing people based on the seven deadly sins. there is little need to rehash the plot here then but what makes seven such a good film and one of the best thrillers of the last few decades? 1). two strong, key performances by brad pitt and, in particular, morgan freeman as new york police detectives just united as one, pitt is coming, and the other is about to retire. freeman and pitt have some chemistry between them and let's face it - freeman is just plain good at just about any role he assays. add to this strong supporting work from paltrow and r. lee ermey and especially kevein spacey as the killer. spacey's voice and looks sent chills down my spine each time he was on screen. 2)david fincher knows how to direct. this film is gross and really is selling a very seedy product as something more. fincher makes that happen with the crisp dialog between freeman and pitt, the very low lighting effects throughout, the quick pacing of the film, and the depth of characterization that he allows his characters to have. 3) the story is well-conceived, well-written, and just crazy enough to be believable. the film has many scenes which are shocking and designed to be so - they succeed. but behind all that blood and seedy atmosphere lies a chess game between two police detectives - each good at what he does in a different manner - and one crazy but brilliant sociopath killer. the journey they take us on is one scary ride.;2 March 2008;9;['gritty', 'fluid', 'disturbing', 'serial', 'deadly', 'little', 'good', 'good', 'last', 'few', 'strong', 'key', 'brad', 'particular', 'united', 'other', 'about', 'good', 'strong', 'gross', 'seedy', 'more', 'crisp', 'low', 'quick', 'crazy', 'believable', 'many', 'shocking', 'seedy', 'good', 'different', 'crazy', 'brilliant', 'scary'];0.1108630952380952

""se7en"" is the kind of movie you can't stop watching. since the opening sequence you know you are into a slick, atmospheric experience that is backed up by excellent acting, a solid plot, great dialogs, and suspense. you won't get a more interesting plot in a serial killer film. but it's not everything about the killer known as john doe. the story behind the life of the rookie detective and his relationship with the veteran cop that is about to retire is excellent. they make the perfect on-screen duo of the 90's horror/thriller genre. i enjoyed big time the accurate criminology and criminlastic facts such as techniques, theories, and more detailed situations. we have the chance to experience the film through the killer's eyes and understand his bizarre motives. sure, the whole serial killer investigation is interesting enough to keep you watching, but also the personal situation between the young couple is what carries the film on it's back. the movie is not for those who have a weak stomach as the killer's motives are very explicit when shown. we have access to them via post-murder scenes when our heroes investigate them. the direction is excellent. the movie is atmospheric but elegant at the same time. when big budgets are squeezed, you get great movies like this. the cinematography and art direction are outstanding and truly create an insecure place where you can actually feel there's a serial killer on the loose. the acting is superb. morgan freeman is one of those versatile actors who can master emotions and control the pace of the whole film. he's great and delivers plenty of emotions. brad pitt demonstrates he's not only a good looking guy but also a fine actor. gwyneth paltrow convinced me as the tender young wife who supports her husband's dangerous work. r. lee ermey is always a delight to watch! the ending is truly shocking. it will leave you sad, mad, shocked, and probably scared. i will remember ""se7en"" for these scenes: the opening murder scenario, when both detectives meet on a rainy day, the shocking ending, paltrow's conversation in the cafeteria with freeman, john doe's introduction in the police station, the shaking apartment, etc. this is one of the best 90's movies. no doubt about it.";23 April 2010;10;['second', 'good', 'serial', 'first', 'multi', 'third', 'serial', 'slick', 'atmospheric', 'excellent', 'solid', 'great', 'interesting', 'serial', 'veteran', 'about', 'excellent', 'perfect', 'big', 'accurate', 'criminlastic', 'such', 'detailed', 'bizarre', 'whole', 'serial', 'interesting', 'personal', 'young', 'weak', 'explicit', 'post', 'murder', 'excellent', 'atmospheric', 'elegant', 'same', 'big', 'great', 'outstanding', 'insecure', 'serial', 'superb', 'versatile', 'whole', 'great', 'good', 'fine', 'tender', 'young', 'dangerous', 'shocking', 'sad', 'mad', 'shocked', 'scared', 'rainy', 'shocking', 'good'];0.1912878787878787
86;Movie_Muse_Reviews;"murder mysteries don't often indulge their audience's intellectual capacity. they generally believe they can get by on suspense, intrigue and our inherent and insatiable need to find out 'whodunit.' but ""se7en"" is a philosophical thriller that addresses a much bigger part of our nature - the age old question of whether or not humans are inherently evil. as gripping as it is the way it turns gears in your head in search of any way to get mentally one step ahead of the plot, ""se7en"" is a first-rate crime thriller because of the ideas fueling the story and a director in david fincher who perfectly understands them. more than a story of two detectives on the trail of a serial killer committing murders based on the seven deadly sins, ""se7en"" wants to be something bigger. it wants you to take a breather from figuring it out and chew on something a little more sophisticated, like say, human nature. the contemplative script by andrew kevin walker gives us plenty of time for this as retiring lt. somerset (freeman) and det. mills (pitt) bicker over the killer's motives together or even have dinner at mills' apartment. it's not just about the mystery and what psychology or ideals drive the killer -- those ideas echo throughout the film and even in these basic conversational scenes. none of that would be communicated well, however, without fincher (""alien 3""). ""se7en"" takes place in an unnamed rundown city, presumably in modern day, and that locational flexibility allows fincher and whoever scouted locations the ability to film the movie in places that would better tell this story about human nature. the murder scenes take place in seedy, decrepit apartments -- all usually dark -- in attempt to tell a story of humanity in its darkest place, at it's very worst. constant use of on-screen lights (e.g characters holding flashlights, red lamps, etc) give the film its signature while also extending the metaphor. it's the work of a director who understands the script through and through and has command of his vision. the characters are also extremely sophisticated and believable as are the performances of the actors playing them. freeman comes fresh off his oscar-winning performance in ""the shawshank redemption"" and absolutely dominates the pacing of the film. we take our cues on when to relax, when to get more curious and when to get passionate from his performance. on the verge of retirement, we see perfectly how this one life-changing case challenges his hardened world view. even pitt's mills, in his impatience, naivety and quick-tempered rebellious perspective, goes quickly from characteristics that feel a little forced to monumentally epiphanic near the climax. pitt's taken on numerous roles in his career where we think we're getting the shells of a character role but we end up getting something meaningful after all. that's sort of the way ""se7en"" works on the whole. before you can even realize it, you suddenly realize you've been watching a thoughtful two-hour sermon about mankind's true nature and its inclination toward evil with a large order of murder mystery on the side. few thrillers give us the pleasure of meditating on such important ideas, in this case a question at the center of philosophy for hundreds if not thousands of years. ~steven c visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com";4 October 2009;9;['intellectual', 'inherent', 'insatiable', 'philosophical', 'big', 'old', 'evil', 'first', 'more', 'serial', 'deadly', 'big', 'sophisticated', 'human', 'contemplative', 'basic', 'conversational', 'alien', 'unnamed', 'modern', 'locational', 'human', 'seedy', 'decrepit', 'dark', 'dark', 'bad', 'constant', 'red', 'sophisticated', 'believable', 'fresh', 'curious', 'passionate', 'hardened', 'rebellious', 'little', 'forced', 'epiphanic', 'numerous', 'meaningful', 'thoughtful', 'true', 'large', 'few', 'such', 'important'];0.0566701680672268

92;jzappa;a bleak, gruesome, horrific and clever thriller, and filmmaking of a distinguished kind, it tells the tale of two detectives, one all set to retire, the other at the outset of his career, and their efforts to catch a jaundiced but cunning serial killer using the seven deadly sins as his narrative. as the film begins, we meet somerset, a painstaking veteran cop who lives a lonesome bachelor's life in what seems like a furnished room. then he meets mills, an impetuous young cop who indeed requested to be transferred to somerset's district. the two men probe an exceptionally grisly murder, an obese man having been hog-tied and force-fed to death. his sin was gluttony. shortly somerset and mills are examining similarly creative murders concerning greed, sloth, lust and the like. in each circumstance, the murderous means is fitting, and revolting. somerset deduces that the murderer, john doe, is using his crimes to sermonize. the look of this pulp meditation is vital to its achievement. this is a very sinister film, the murk regularly diffused only by police flashlights. even when all the lights are on in the victims' apartments, they shed merely ashen, despondent puddles of illumination. while the story is present-tense, the set design evokes the 1940s. gary wissner, the art director, uses dark blacks and browns, cavernous shadows, lights of sickly yellow, and a lot of dark wood furnishings. and it virtually always rains. in this cutthroat world of darkness, somerset and mills move with increasing fear. somerset perceives that the killer is using ancient literature as a muse, and researches dante, milton and chaucer for clues. mills opts for cliff notes. a leg up comes with somerset's feeling that john doe must have a library card. but the stiffs amass, in bitter thickset detail, as terrifyingly vivid as one sees in commercial films. the few twinkles of soul and hopefulness come from mills' wife one of the most skillfully and innovatively edited contemporary american films, perhaps its most beautiful montage features somerset in the library researching the seven deadly sins while his friends, the library custodians and guards, share their boys'-night-out loft ritual, with an unexpected blackly comic punch line: when the sequence ends, fincher hard-cuts to mills losing his temper at these confounding research materials. the contrast between somerset's reservedness and erudition and mills' man-this-sucks horse sense and youthful dopeyness starts to make pretty broad strokes, but there is some charming buddy-cop undercurrent that works without a glitch into the glass sheen of the film's atmospheric tone. it's because andrew kevin walker's script and freeman and pitt's chemistry that the film is so moving. for instance, the chasing of john doe through the streets gives mills the till-now belated chance to show his bones as an impressive, dedicated cop. the material independently could've been managed through numerous approach, but david fincher pinpoints suggestive atmosphere, and walker writes dialogue that especially for morgan freeman is judicious, learned and lyrical. ultimately, it sinks in that the killer's sermon is being urged directly to the two investigators, and that to appreciate it, they may have to imperil their hearts and their psyches. fincher's fatalistic noir ballad is distinctive in bringing the killer on screen with half an hour left, and gives him a speaking role. rather than just being the game of a hunt, he's exposed as a warped yet eloquent enemy, having contrived a hideous plan for finishing his sermon.;7 September 2011;8;['bleak', 'gruesome', 'horrific', 'clever', 'distinguished', 'other', 'jaundiced', 'cunning', 'serial', 'deadly', 'painstaking', 'lonesome', 'furnished', 'impetuous', 'young', 'grisly', 'obese', 'creative', 'like', 'murderous', 'fitting', 'vital', 'sinister', 'despondent', 'present', 'tense', 'dark', 'cavernous', 'yellow', 'dark', 'cutthroat', 'ancient', 'bitter', 'thickset', 'vivid', 'commercial', 'few', 'contemporary', 'american', 'beautiful', 'deadly', 'unexpected', 'blackly', 'comic', 'fincher', 'hard', 'youthful', 'broad', 'charming', 'atmospheric', 'impressive', 'dedicated', 'numerous', 'suggestive', 'judicious', 'lyrical', 'fatalistic', 'distinctive', 'left', 'warped', 'eloquent', 'hideous'];-0.0130050505050505

96;elshikh4;"i know, all of the previous comments told you all. but i want to say something of my own. this great thriller will live longer than its likes, for a lot of reasons. the one that i want to talk about is the strong focusing on the characterization firstly in this script. because this is something really rare in any of the american thrillers nowadays. here, you have 2 point of views that come from 2 different generations, or simply 2 kinds of human beings. the first is (david mills), played by (brad pitt), who is so rash, tense, running mostly after his sensations, and always relies on the photos, the shape of things. but despite his true zeal, courage, and idealism he is so unwise, very impetuous, and can easily hurt or lose himself. he is too weak to wait justice, so he goes and gets it by his hand, because he is a slave for his excitability.. his emotionality. the other one (william somerset), played by (morgan freeman) is an earlier generation, who has all the goodness and rationality. he is discreet and cold proficient expert, who relies on the books. this one is not perfect either. he is too feeble to stand love, its pain, responsibilities, or loss. so there is no joyful thing about his life, nor lasting thing in it! both of them make together one perfect unit; so they succeed in pursuit the killer. but hey, it's not (lethal weapon). so you'll have them both at variance, too contradictory, and the only clear medial between them is the first's wife. therefore, when she died, and (mills) killed the killer; the borderline already ended, and there was no medial anymore. so separation became the fate. they are 2 very irreconcilable ways, persons, or feelings: the love which kills the fear; so (mills) lost his life. and the love which is killed by fear; so (somerset) is losing his own. and as for (john doe), played by (kevin spacey), the limit went to extremes; so he had his fear, or his love, or maybe both, killed too long ago. he despised the extremism of the human lusts, because he wasn't a human himself. he lost his humanity completely. hence, he became a killing machine, a loose madness, or the extremism itself. balance between your love and your fear or you'll be the killer and the victim. that's one premise which will make this film live for so many upcoming generations.";20 July 2007;8;['previous', 'own', 'great', 'strong', 'rare', 'american', 'different', 'human', 'first', 'rash', 'tense', 'true', 'unwise', 'impetuous', 'weak', 'other', 'early', 'discreet', 'cold', 'perfect', 'feeble', 'joyful', 'lasting', 'perfect', 'lethal', 'contradictory', 'only', 'clear', 'first', 'irreconcilable', 'own', 'human', 'human', 'loose', 'many', 'upcoming'];0.1520892687559354
97;dee.reid;i must admit that when this film came out, i totally ignored it, probably because i was only 9 nears old and i didn't care much for movies when back then. now, after reading several reviews, i finally decided to take a chance with it. the story is set from what i understand is supposed to be new york city. it is always dark and it is always raining. detective william somerset(morgan freeman) is an elderly, burned out homicide detective who is about to retire. detective david mills(brad pitt) is the brash, young detective who is set to replace somerset at the end of the week. but before somerset can retire, he must tackle one last important case. the two detectives arrive at the house of a obese man who was found with his face in a bowl of spaghetti. the second victim they find, a defense attorney, was forced to cut off a pound of his flesh. as further investigation into the murders continues, they soon learn that they were the first and second in a series of ritualistic killings in which the victims will be killed in accordance with the seven deadly sins: gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, wrath and envy. i won't go any further than that. kevin spacey, of american beauty fame, plays john doe with perfection. i didn't even know who he was until i saw this film. his role as john doe is probably one of the creepiest i have ever seen. morgan freeman and brad pitt play their roles to perfection also. seven's ending really surprised me because it was very unexpected and there were no clues to hint it. i also like this film because it was directed by david fincher. i liked because he succeeds in always creating dark and suspenseful atmospheres in his films like alien 3, fight club, and the game. now i'm a very big fan of serial killer films. i've seen most of the major ones the silence of the lambs, the bone collector, and this film. **spoilers** there is one something that i want to make very clear. resurrection, another serial killer film starring christopher lambert is not a seven rip-off. although the two films do share the same qualities, they are two totally different films. now that is cleared up seven a very chilling film and has a terrifying ending. 9/10;21 January 2001;10;['old', 'several', 'dark', 'elderly', 'about', 'young', 'last', 'important', 'obese', 'second', 'further', 'first', 'second', 'ritualistic', 'deadly', 'american', 'unexpected', 'dark', 'suspenseful', 'big', 'serial', 'most', 'major', 'clear', 'serial', 'same', 'different', 'chilling', 'terrifying'];-0.0085227272727272
98;ackstasis;"after years of experiencing dull, formulaic, cliched so-called thrillers, it's always satisfying when a genuinely great movie comes along. i have absolutely no hesitation in proclaiming 'se7en' to be such a film, with director david fincher after achieving a somewhat mixed result in his cinematic debut, 'alien' firmly proclaiming his place as one of the 1990's most promising new talents. it's somewhat surprising that the movie had managed to elude me for so long, since i'd been wanting to see it for a while, and it was only last week that i managed to get my hands on a dvd copy. and so, without further ado, i invited over a friend, who has an equal partiality towards good thrillers, and enthusiastically promised him one of the best of its decade. 'se7en' didn't disappoint. the film takes place in a dark, gritty, unnamed metropolis, where it is always raining and danger looms ominously from every alleyway. reserved and hardened detective lt. william somerset (morgan freeman) has seen it all in his lifetime, and is finally preparing to retire to the country, away from the madness of the city. his replacement, impulsive detective david mills (brad pitt), has transferred here at his own request, and is eager to make his mark, even though his career choice could be harming the wellbeing of his lonely and vulnerable wife, tracy (gwyneth paltrow). both detectives are soon drawn into the case of a serial killer, john doe, who is ritualistically murdering his victims according to the seven deadly sins: gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy and wrath. as the murders begin piling up, the two detectives' investigation becomes an obsession, and the inevitable outcome will drastically change the lives of both. throughout the film, brad pitt provides most of the comic relief, none of which detracts at all from the horrors we are witnessing on screen. david fincher has a unique visual style that is simply thrilling to watch. despite the thematically dark tone of the story, the film itself is positively brimming with invigorating and vibrantly-contrasted colour and lighting. the graphic murder scenes appear to splash out of the screen, before our very eyes, enhancing the feelings of dread and repulsion that accompany john doe's horrific acts of murder. the rich, highly-stylised use of colour also helps create a memorable atmosphere of sheer foreboding; the imagery is sure to stay with you for many years to come. even as 'se7en' abandons the gritty setting of the city for the final act shifting the action to a starkly-lit open field beside a trail of electric power-lines the film loses none of its potency, the isolation of the climactic arena seemingly leaving our main protagonists even more helpless and vulnerable than before. our villain is anonymously titled john doe, and is played with delightful creepiness by kevin spacey, who only agreed to the part under the condition that he remain unbilled in the promotion and opening credits of the film. unlike your typical serial killer, john doe is not a crazy, impulsive and stupid mad-man, but something rather more terrifying: he is intelligent, patient and methodical. in one particularly ghastly crime, he keeps a convicted drug dealer chained to his bed for an entire year, removing his hands and his tongue, and regularly paying his rent so as to not arouse any suspicions. john doe's entire life has been dedicated to mankind's obsession with committing sin, and, through orchestrating his crimes, he wishes to preach to the society of their transgressions. john doe, rather uniquely, is given a large portion of the film's final half-hour, and so he becomes a character that we come to know very well, as opposed to the half-constructed serial killers who usually turn up in the final five minutes only to be shot by the hero. spacey is very good in the role, though i can't help but feel that his performance would have been even more effective had i not been familiar with much of his later film work. the most exciting scene in the film is undoubtedly the hectic foot-chase that ensues when john doe arrives home to his apartment, only to find detectives somerset and mills waiting patiently outside his door. however, the film's climax is also well worth mentioning: though many interpretations have been floating around, my view is that the final two victims are john doe himself (""envy"") and david mills (""wrath""). in order to prevent himself from being labeled a hypocrite, as mills had suggested during the car-ride, doe allowed his own deadly sin - envy - to result in the death of tracy, and so enticed mills to shoot him, simultaneously becoming the sixth victim and prompting mills to commit the seventh sin. some have argued that, since mills didn't die, he can't be perceived as one of doe's victims, but is being left alive in these circumstances perhaps even a more diabolical punishment?";15 September 2007;9;['dull', 'formulaic', 'great', 'mixed', 'cinematic', 'alien', 'promising', 'new', 'surprising', 'last', 'further', 'equal', 'good', 'good', 'dark', 'gritty', 'unnamed', 'impulsive', 'own', 'eager', 'lonely', 'vulnerable', 'serial', 'deadly', 'inevitable', 'most', 'comic', 'unique', 'visual', 'dark', 'graphic', 'very', 'horrific', 'rich', 'memorable', 'sheer', 'sure', 'many', 'gritty', 'final', 'open', 'electric', 'climactic', 'main', 'helpless', 'vulnerable', 'delightful', 'unbilled', 'typical', 'serial', 'crazy', 'impulsive', 'stupid', 'mad', 'terrifying', 'intelligent', 'patient', 'methodical', 'ghastly', 'entire', 'entire', 'large', 'final', 'half', 'serial', 'final', 'good', 'effective', 'familiar', 'much', 'later', 'exciting', 'hectic', 'worth', 'many', 'final', 'own', 'deadly', 'enticed', 'sixth', 'seventh', 'alive', 'diabolical'];0.0982346888084592

102;MaxBorg89;"1991: jonathan demme's the silence of the lambs shocks the world, gets almost unanimous praise from critics and audiences alike, and wins five oscars, proving serial killer flicks can be more than just a sub-category of the thriller/horror genre. 1995: david fincher, still scarred by the mixed reactions to his first film, the underrated alien 3, unleashes se7en. the latter wins no academy awards, but people are so impressed/disgusted/terrified by the ferocity and bleakness of fincher's vision it actually manages to make demme's work seem rather tame. so uncompromising it is occasionally hard to watch, se7en paints a disturbing portrait of madness no other film has been able to match. ironically, none of the gruesome murders in the film occur on screen: what we are shown is merely the aftermath, which is more than enough to upset the weak of stomach. it sure as hell upsets william somerset (morgan freeman), a police officer who is about to retire but has to solve this last, horrific case. helping him with the investigation is the edgy david mills (brad pitt), a young hothead who wants to put the killer behind bars and make sure he suffers as much as the victims (the killings are based on the seven capital sins). unfortunately for them, this guy is not someone you catch that easily: john doe (a name usually given to unidentified corpses) is a cold-blooded, calculating psychopath, and once he unveils his big project, nothing but pain can derive from it. what distances se7en from most hollywood thrillers is the consistently dark, nerve-cracking mood: while the average shocker has some kind of redeeming trait in the end, fincher decides to go all the way with his unflinching study of the human psyche, leaving no room for hope or salvation. as repulsive as they may look, doe's murders are actually little more than the premise: the really bad stuff happens after-wards, and even the most skeptical viewers will probably gasp in horror as the film reaches its almost unbearably bleak conclusion (the kind of ending late-night pub discussions were created for). the unsettling atmosphere is also due to the performances, freeman's understated sadness being the ideal counterbalance to pitt's brooding rage (a side the actor took to sublime levels in his other collaboration with fincher, the splendid fight club). but it is kevin spacey (there's no use in not mentioning him, since by now everyone knows he is in the movie before they have even seen it) who truly leaves a mark, in the role that, alongside his oscar-winning turn in the usual suspects, set the bar for every other villain to have been created since. he may not be on screen for much time, but then again, neither was anthony hopkins when he played hannibal lecter for the first time. the difference is, john doe is so merciless and sadistic even lecter would probably be afraid of running into him. in the end, some people might not be able to watch this film; some might even refuse after reading a summary. but those able to stomach it will see not only a very cruel thriller, but also a compelling example of everything that's generally missing in hollywood nowadays: film-making has seldom been so bold and fearless.";17 May 2007;10;['unanimous', 'serial', 'more', 'mixed', 'first', 'underrated', 'latter', 'impressed', 'tame', 'hard', 'disturbing', 'other', 'able', 'gruesome', 'more', 'enough', 'sure', 'about', 'last', 'horrific', 'young', 'sure', 'unidentified', 'cold', 'blooded', 'big', 'most', 'dark', 'average', 'human', 'repulsive', 'little', 'more', 'bad', 'skeptical', 'bleak', 'late', 'unsettling', 'due', 'understated', 'ideal', 'sublime', 'other', 'splendid', 'usual', 'other', 'much', 'hannibal', 'first', 'merciless', 'sadistic', 'afraid', 'able', 'able', 'cruel', 'compelling', 'bold', 'fearless'];-0.0321557971014492

107;aidanratesmovies;a tight, sophisticated, and often grim thriller- seven may not always work at times, but it is more impressive than not, and as it goes on, truly proves itself to be a worthy mystery to follow. the film is very well acted, most notably by kevin spacey who gives another great performance in the film as john doe. morgan freeman and brad pitt also truly embrace their characters to surreal effects, and you begin to think of them as people rather than simply actors playing a character. the beginning of the film can be a bit cliche, especially in terms of set up in the situations at hand, and the execution for the film can be a bit slow at times- especially towards the beginning. besides these flaws and the slight predictability of the film, it is very tightly bound, and for the most part, very smart. david fincher provides excellent work as the director, proving himself to be one of my favorite directors in the film business today. the atmosphere and tone of the film is also very well executed, as well as the cinematography to go with it, and make for its awfully grim, but darkly beautiful nature. in the end, seven is not a great detective film, nor is it fincher's best, but it is quite an impressive one at that, and one that shines greater than it may begin to lead on. my rating: 9/10;16 June 2020;9;['tight', 'sophisticated', 'impressive', 'worthy', 'great', 'surreal', 'slow', 'slight', 'most', 'smart', 'excellent', 'favorite', 'grim', 'beautiful', 'great', 'good', 'impressive', 'great'];0.4223544973544973

116;Jonny_Numb;"some cinephiles give praise at the altar of hitchock; others worship kubrick or scorsese. personally, i'm a david fincher fan, and see him picking up where they left off. easily one of the most distinctive and talented young directors to come out of the 1990s, he still remains something of a 'cult' filmmaker, in spite of the $100-million box office take of ""seven,"" possibly the best, most intelligent serial-killer thriller ever unleashed on unassuming film patrons. what fincher pulls off--and pulls off brilliantly--is a straight-faced, serious approach to a concept that could have easily devolved into camp or slasher-flick excess. on initial glance, the notion of a serial killer who picks his victims according to the seven deadly sins seems like the type of tongue-in-cheek fodder for a low-budget '70s or '80s exploitation item; even the tag line (""seven deadly sins--seven ways to die"") sets the tone for a straightforward, mainstream thriller. what a surprise, then, that ""seven"" is the type of smart, suspenseful, brilliantly-designed and -acted thriller that is nearly one-of-a-kind (""the silence of the lambs"" follows close behind). even more surprising is how the film stormed into the public imagination after ""alien3"" (1992), fincher's sour--and quickly forgotten--directorial debut. i hadn't seen a former music-video director operate with such authority in the realm of mainstream cinema (and, come to think of it, i haven't seen one since). nor have i seen a director take as many commercially-averse risks within such a short career--""fight club"" (1999), despite a short theatrical run and polarized reviews, has become to young-adults of today what ""easy rider"" was to the flower children in '69. granted, the amount of respect i've given ""seven"" has fluctuated over the years, and it seems that only now do i see it as being a near-flawless masterpiece. at 15 years of age, it was just a cool-looking 'horror' film--i couldn't latch on to morgan freeman's dialog, and found brad pitt's cocky go-getter to be more easily relatable; at 25 years, the deeply-entrenched realism of the script, mixed with fincher's grimy, urban-life-as-hell visuals and the jaw-dropping performances (not just from the principals--when was the last time you saw notorious scenery chewer r. lee ermey in a small yet serious role?). while brad pitt's performance might inspire hoots of derision from some, he is actually pitch-perfect as the young, idealistic detective mills--this isn't brad mugging the camera with his good looks for 2 hours; on the contrary, his counterpoint to morgan freeman's worldly, jaded, and cynical somerset makes the movie. and once the killer is captured, these 3 characters share an entrancing conversation within the confines of an unmarked police car; sure, we get to hear the killer's explanation for his crimes, but it is in the tones and reactions to what is said that the sequence conveys a disturbingly chilling power. (it may seem moot at this juncture, but i will say nothing of the killer's identity, save that it was a choice casting decision that paid off wonderfully.) even gwyneth paltrow, then a fresh-faced, relatively unknown starlet, delivers a small yet poignant performance as mills' long-suffering wife; her scene in the diner with morgan freeman is painful, culminating in advice that seems especially dismal, considering what we've come to expect in the way of hollywood happy endings. which brings me to one of the most surprising--and refreshing--aspects of ""seven"": the way in which it relentlessly plays against audience expectation. like the murderer's motive, this is not a film of happy endings but lessons learned (in the harshest way possible). to those who have seen the film--love it or hate it, that incredibly subtle yet wholly grisly final scene is unforgettable, and truly shows that, contrary to current horror trends, ""less is more"" (notice that all but one murder happens off-screen). while i could gush at even further length about ""seven,"" i think i've made my fanfare more than clear. it's an introspective, compelling film that manages to mine terror and pathos from those daily transgressions we all view as ""common."" and it established david fincher as a director of great (and continued) promise. kudos.";16 November 2006;9;['scorsese', 'distinctive', 'talented', 'young', 'good', 'intelligent', 'serial', 'unassuming', 'serious', 'initial', 'serial', 'deadly', 'low', 'deadly', 'straightforward', 'smart', 'suspenseful', 'surprising', 'public', 'sour', 'directorial', 'former', 'such', 'many', 'averse', 'short', 'short', 'theatrical', 'young', 'easy', 'flawless', 'cocky', 'relatable', 'grimy', 'urban', 'last', 'notorious', 'small', 'serious', 'perfect', 'young', 'idealistic', 'good', 'worldly', 'cynical', 'entrancing', 'unmarked', 'chilling', 'moot', 'faced', 'unknown', 'small', 'poignant', 'painful', 'dismal', 'happy', 'surprising', 'refreshing', 'happy', 'harsh', 'possible', 'subtle', 'final', 'unforgettable', 'contrary', 'current', 'less', 'more', 'furth', 'clear', 'introspective', 'compelling', 'daily', 'common', 'great'];0.1567160826594789

127;PredragReviews;"seven is a very disturbing thriller about a serial killer,john doe (kevin spacey), killing people via examples of the seven deadly sins - gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy and wrath. the story begins with detective mills (brad pitt) being assigned to detective somerset (morgan freeman). detective somerset is due to retire at the end of the week, and detective mills is moving up in the world, and is to take somerset's place. this is a very disturbing movie. it will keep you enthralled and glued to your seat for the entire 127 minutes. indeed, i was staggered that i never once lost concentration or was bored with this movie.this is a movie with an unexpected ending that is absolutely unpredictable and which is not at all a ""hollywood"" style ending. ""seven"" is symbolic of several things in this film: of course, the seven deadly sins (gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy, wrath) are the killer's inspiration; somerset has only seven days to retirement and he was given this assignment as his final investigation; seven is the also the amount of days that transpire between the beginning and the ending of this case; and seven are the amount of victims that are at john doe's mercy in that time span. gwyneth paltrow portrays mills' wife tracey, and there is a certain sadness to her character, something she reveals to somerset one day while they are having breakfast in a diner. even though her role is not one that is major throughout this movie, she is a crucial element that plays itself out in the climax of the film. one of the most haunting ironies i find in walker's script well portrayed by fincher's cast is the uncanny similarities between john doe, the antagonist and somerset, the protagonist. if you watch that one scene in the car, you will realize that somerset agrees with doe, yet although realizing that their consensus does not justify doe's irrational, yet seemingly rational killings. with doe's philosophy explaining his intolerance for the prevalence and trivialization of the deadly sins, somerset's continuous argument that we are becoming too apathetic of a society, only motivated by such things such as our temptations and self-indulgence, there is admittedly a strong parallel that exists between the two characters. yet, they stand opposed to one another, because while somerset, although discouraged, managed to keep his faith in mankind, doe did not, and could not tolerate the injustice any longer. the film has some gory and graphic scenes that might turn some weak stomachs, but it has everything you'd want from a thriller: mystery, suspense, a great plot, great acting and a great, shocking and surprising ending. overall rating: 9 out of 10.";13 June 2016;9;['disturbing', 'serial', 'deadly', 'somerset', 'due', 'disturbing', 'entire', 'bored', 'unexpected', 'unpredictable', 'symbolic', 'several', 'deadly', 'final', 'certain', 'major', 'crucial', 'uncanny', 'irrational', 'rational', 'deadly', 'continuous', 'apathetic', 'such', 'such', 'strong', 'opposed', 'gory', 'graphic', 'weak', 'great', 'great', 'great', 'shocking', 'surprising', 'overall'];-0.0060210622710622

129;winner55;"despite cliches, and a very depressing finale, this is one of the best-made films of its era and genre. the strengths of the film include an odd relationship between the two lead cops, who seem loosely based on the two lead cops of the ""lethal weapon"" series, but who (thankfully) never play for laughs, and never really become ""buddies"" - the young cop is too arrogant, and the older cop has too much experience, which the young cop refuses to acknowledge. the two characters are also brilliantly acted by morgan freeman and brad pitt (probably his best performance). there's one odd flaw in the film - about half-way through, i found that i had learned to ""expect the unexpected"" from the film, which meant that the rest of the film was predictable in a bizarre way - simply decide where the expected move would be, and then expect the unexpected move instead. the most obvious instance of this is in the finale itself, which could be guessed at least 5 minutes ahead of time. normally, this would be a formula for disaster - but fortunately, the high quality of the film-making twists the film into an edge-of-the-seat suspenseful waiting game as we watch with horror the one cop's encounter with the insanity of pure evil. i didn't want to admire this film (to be honest, i dislike brad pitt something fierce), but i'm afraid i must - very professionally made, it delivers its promised suspense all the way.";14 October 2007;9;['depressing', 'odd', 'lethal', 'young', 'arrogant', 'old', 'much', 'young', 'good', 'odd', 'half', 'unexpected', 'predictable', 'bizarre', 'unexpected', 'obvious', 'high', 'suspenseful', 'pure', 'honest', 'fierce', 'afraid', 'promised'];0.0374603174603174
130;arungeorge13;a rewatch many years later, se7en still proves to be a very intense and benchmark psychological crime thriller. the buddy-cop chemistry that morgan freeman and brad pitt share is built over several scenes in between the procedurals. fincher, working off andrew kevin walker's script, adds neo-noir visual flourishes (the use of climate, be it sun or rain, is superbly effective) and crafts elaborate scenes that allow emotions to sink in. gwyneth paltrow isn't as prominent a presence as the other two, but she adds the much needed sensitive heft. the crimes (or the crime scenes) themselves are gruesomely portrayed, not toning down their visceral nature one bit. se7en isn't throwing these barbaric ideas at you just for the sake of cheap shocks - it gives the antagonist (played by kevin spacey) an arc of his own, and also lets viewers in on his ideologies in that intriguing pre-climactic car scene. freeman and pitt are excellent, fitting their respective roles to the t. somerset never showcases weakness, and this is attributed to all the years he spent in the city's most dangerous precinct, mostly by himself. he's well-read too, a trait that actually helps the duo get closer to the offender. mills, on the other hand, is hot-headed and racy. he doesn't care about the depths of the crime - he simply wants to nab the bad guy and put him away. they play each other off perfectly. and spacey, as much as he's despised now, embodies evil in a way that very few actors could. that he won the academy award (for his performance in the usual suspects, released earlier that year) makes all the sense in the world now. what prompted me to revisit se7en is the latest instalment in the saw franchise - spiral. the films share more similarities than i possibly imagined. in fact, i'd even go on to say that spiral borrows more from se7en than the saw series itself. put john doe and john kramer in a room and they'd make great conversationalists. the little things, the 2021 denzel-malek-leto starter, is another film that immediately comes to mind. both spiral and the little things are inferior pieces, but i'm glad filmmakers are still interested in exploring the genre further.;4 June 2021;8;['many', 'intense', 'benchmark', 'psychological', 'several', 'noir', 'visual', 'effective', 'prominent', 'other', 'much', 'sensitive', 'visceral', 'barbaric', 'cheap', 'own', 'intriguing', 'pre', 'climactic', 'excellent', 'respective', 'dangerous', 'close', 'other', 'headed', 'bad', 'other', 'few', 'usual', 'late', 'more', 'spiral', 'more', 'saw', 'great', 'little', 'denzel', 'spiral', 'little', 'inferior', 'glad', 'interested'];0.1410714285714285

132;brando647;"i think just about everyone who has seen alien 3 can agree, it's pretty crappy. we should all be thankful that hollywood had the foresight to realize that it's director david fincher managed to show considerable talent and saved it from the ultimate train wreck it's long, problematic development meant it should have been. after throwing himself under the bus to complete alien 3, fincher was given the chance to prove what he was really capable of with se7en. the film is a modern classic and most people will agree. i love a good serial killer story, and se7en is right up there at the top of the list with the best of them. thanks to it's gripping story, talented performances, and an ending that will go down as one of the most memorable, se7en is an excellent movie well-deserving of the long-term attention it's gotten and the status it helped to build for fincher. in the film, detective william somerset is one week from his retirement and begins training his replacement, the younger and more naive detective david mills. mills is a hotshot with an impatient attitude, recently transferred from a small town to the big city where he hopes to make a difference. mills' first case, and somerset's supposed final, turns into something larger than your average homicide. a new serial killer has come to light and he is using torture and murder to preach against the seven deadly sins to his victims (e.g. an obese man is forced to eat himself to death at gunpoint). this is a dark, twisted movie. from the very beginning we open with a warped credits sequence and a glimpse into the methods of the yet-unknown serial killer to the remixed sound of nine inch nails' ""closer"". and it only gets more twisted from there. we never actually see the murderer (with the inconspicuous name john doe) in action as the audience. instead, we see the aftermath as somerset and mills arrive on the scene and each crime scene is more brutal than the last. john doe is a psychopath and uses his victims to preach his message in the worst way possible. se7en is the most gripping serial killer/thriller since the silence of the lambs and even now, almost twenty years since it's release, is just as powerful as always. while there may not be any brutal violence occurring on screen, i would still recommend discretion for audience members who don't care for the darker subject matter. despite the fact the movie was released in 1995, i'll try to remain spoiler-free when discussing the movie just in case, but the end of this movie has been parodied and paid homage countless times since. it's a strong ending and i'm glad it didn't cop out and go the usual route where the killer is stopped before his crimes can escalate and the story ends on a high note. not here; it's a bittersweet ending where you could even go so far as to say the villain triumphs over the heroes. every element of this movie contributes to its strength. the cinematography from darius khondji is amazing. the visual style of this movie is just as prominent as any performance. the high contrast, abundance of low lighting, overcast weather and sharp instances of source lighting (i really loved the red neon cross in doe's apartment) gives this movie an overwhelming feeling of gloom that coincides with detective somerset's view on life in the city. i would love to get my hands on the screenplay from andrew kevin walker for this one, as it's incredibly well written and was perfectly suited for the talents of someone as visually strong as director fincher. the cast in this movie, again inspired. the only real important characters in the film are somerset (morgan freeman), mills (brad pitt), and the killer john doe (who i won't spoil here on the off chance that someone reading this has not seen the movie and somehow avoided any and all revelations about doe). morgan freeman is the kind of actor where you expect a powerful performance, and he delivers just that. somerset is a jaded detective who's spent years on the force and seen it all (until doe came along); he's tired and he's ready to find a simpler life. i've also got to give pitt some great credit here because se7en was the movie that helped me realize pitt was more talented than i'd believed and more than just a hollywood pretty boy (further solidified in fight club, another awesome fincher film). and finally, the actor portraying john doe is excellent. doe is a cold, calculating killer who truly believes in what he is doing and the actor gives one of the best eerie performances. all together, this all combines to create one of the best films of the 90s and almost guaranteed to become a favorite.";16 March 2012;9;['alien', 'crappy', 'thankful', 'considerable', 'ultimate', 'long', 'problematic', 'alien', 'capable', 'modern', 'most', 'good', 'serial', 'good', 'talented', 'memorable', 'excellent', 'long', 'young', 'naive', 'impatient', 'small', 'big', 'first', 'final', 'large', 'average', 'new', 'serial', 'deadly', 'obese', 'dark', 'twisted', 'very', 'warped', 'unknown', 'serial', 'remixed', 'close', 'twisted', 'inconspicuous', 'somerset', 'brutal', 'last', 'bad', 'possible', 'gripping', 'serial', 'powerful', 'brutal', 'dark', 'free', 'countless', 'strong', 'glad', 'usual', 'high', 'bittersweet', 'amazing', 'visual', 'prominent', 'high', 'low', 'overcast', 'sharp', 'overwhelming', 'suited', 'strong', 'only', 'important', 'off', 'powerful', 'jaded', 'tired', 'ready', 'simple', 'great', 'talented', 'more', 'pretty', 'awesome', 'fincher', 'excellent', 'cold', 'good', 'eerie', 'good'];0.1340046473134708

134;Sergeant_Tibbs;"in 1995 david fincher released a perfectly constructed modern masterpiece; se7en. one of the most exhilarating experiences of all-time and a classic to come. a cop; detective david mills (brad pitt) has just moved into the city with his wife, tracy (gwyneth paltrow) in hope of finally settling down. mills will take over the job of detective lt. william somerset (morgan freeman) an old cop who has seven days until his retirement begins. both are dedicated to the badge. they are put together on the case of an obesity murder, in which a man has been forced to 'eat till he bursts'. this then leads to another murder scene in which a lawyer has bled to death, although the murderer didn't actually use the knife; he made the lawyer do it. this is just the beginning of a mass murder masterpiece crafted by the insane john doe, brilliantly played by kevin spacey. whatever you do while watching it, do not see it as hollow. se7en is far from it. many scenes study civilisation; present civilisation. and its evil. our society isn't a pleasant one. the film concentrates mainly on the cops search; when it comes to the mystery part in finding the killer, we discover the policemen's differences in methods, and how the most obvious one does not actually work. of course, its somerset, the one with the most experience who has the best way. he tries to find out why. why some man is killing these people using a specific punishment. while mills tries, unsuccessfully, to find out how; by studying the crime scene for clues. he ends up bored. with the help of the library, somerset gets closer to the murderer. it may seem as though the role of tracey is a pointless part, but she is more important than anything. she is the one who brings the men to being more personal with each other. notice how in the dinner scene she is the one to introduce them by name. all making the climax tense and difficult. mills is the kind of guy to pull his gun out before his torch. he has an arrogant sense of things though is 'by the book' and works. somerset has never even fired his weapon. he sees the evil round him. and he wants to leave it. though he is a cop so he has the permission to do something about it. but the problem is, he isn't doing anything about it. john doe is. the reason why society is evil is because we are allowed to sin. there is now nothing stopping us. it has become a common factor of life. and there should be. that is why john doe thinks his behaviour is ok. but the problem is he is being stopped instead of the crime out there. this is the harsh reality we live in. there are seven deadly sins. gluttony. greed. sloth. pride. lust. envy. wrath. and seven ways to die. kevin spacey is amazing as john doe, portraying insanity perfectly. one of the greatest supporting performances of all-time already. and he's only in it for half an hour. brad pitt delivers a kind of forced performance which adds to the hollywood effect of the film though i couldn't imagine anyone else for the part. morgan freeman played his role with the greatest concentration. throughout he needed a look of woe on his face. and he did just that. the writing is extraordinary. the genius, andrew kevin walker took an interesting subject and created an instant classic. but most credit has to go to fincher. who took aspects you wouldn't even think of looking at and filming it. together they project a deep film on our screens that no-one should miss. in one scene near the end, he makes it so when a word is spoken we cut to a character as that gives us clues to their fate. a feast for the brain. one of the most imaginative scripts of the 90s. fincher also knows exactly how to shoot the film. whether it be steady-cam for the slow and easy parts or the hand-held camera for the adrenalin pumping scenes. the cinematography is what makes this an excellent movie. everything is dark. the world out there is rough, raw, grim and gritty. it does just that. the effect it makes is astounding and truly works. the sinister music that is added keeps the heart pounding throughout and keeps the audience uncomfortable, in a good way. as that's what the film tries to achieve. the opening credits are upon the greatest segment of film i have ever seen. the jumpiness makes you feel uneasy yet intrigued to keep watching. every scene, due to the effort put in it, is masterful and is what makes the film a joy to watch and observe. se7en reveals the best glimpse we have seen of the disturbing underworld. one of my favourites and always will be. 10/10";10 March 2007;10;['modern', 'exhilarating', 'old', 'mass', 'hollow', 'many', 'present', 'pleasant', 'obvious', 'most', 'good', 'specific', 'bored', 'close', 'pointless', 'important', 'personal', 'other', 'tense', 'difficult', 'arrogant', 'evil', 'evil', 'common', 'ok', 'harsh', 'deadly', 'amazing', 'great', 'brad', 'hollywood', 'great', 'extraordinary', 'interesting', 'instant', 'most', 'deep', 'imaginative', 'steady', 'slow', 'easy', 'excellent', 'dark', 'rough', 'raw', 'grim', 'gritty', 'astounding', 'sinister', 'uncomfortable', 'good', 'great', 'uneasy', 'masterful', 'good', 'disturbing'];0.1281135531135531

143;sme_no_densetsu;"david fincher's ""seven"" has become something of a modern classic since its release nearly 15 years ago. the film focuses on a pair of detectives tracking a serial killer who has drawn his inspiration from the seven deadly sins: gluttony, greed, sloth, envy, wrath, pride & lust. the cast is a pretty good one. morgan freeman is excellent in the role of a burnt-out cop on his way out the door as soon as he trains in his replacement (brad pitt). pitt does a good job as a brash young detective itching for a shot at a big-time case. gwyneth paltrow, as pitt's wife, delivers a solid performance and the rest of the cast is about average. it should also be noted that the (oscar-winning) actor who plays the killer isn't listed in the opening credits, so that's a bit of a surprise for the audience. the screenplay is quite clever but that cleverness almost seems at odds with the film's gritty realism. the killer's intricate plans are the sort of thing that you only encounter in the movies. the characters are somewhat cliched and freeman is handed a few well-worn lines that i think only he could have pulled off. given this shortcoming, the ending succeeds more through shock value than in creating a response based on our attachment to the characters. fincher's direction is well-handled throughout and merges with the cinematography and editing to create a unique, atmospheric look. while there may be a bit of an emphasis on style over substance the director manages to keep from going overboard. the soundtrack also contributes greatly to the atmosphere, mixing contemporary music and an effective score from howard shore.

145;Screen_Blitz;david fincher has been one of most thoughtful directors in hollywood for many years, and his ingenious filmmaking all started in the mid- 1990s with this grim, but intelligently crafted psychological thriller. this film follows david mills (played by brad pitt), a newly transferred police detective in an unnamed crime-ridden metropolitan city, who is partner with an old veteran detective william somerset (played by morgan freeman) who is on the verge of retirement, to investigate a string of gruesome murders all around the city. these murders happen to correlate with the seven deadly sins which include: gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy, and wrath. mills and somerset take in matters in their own hands to hunt down the sadistic serial killer (played by an actor who i'm gonna keep a secret) responsible for the grisly murders, only to be faced with a scarring truth about his intentions. this david fincher masterpiece is not a horror film, but it certainly sits directly at the borderline of one. complete with eerie visuals and near non-stop suspense from start to finish, this film pulls audience into an unflinchingly grim atmosphere that leaves shivers down their spine and rarely lightens up. to add more to the dark tone, it rain in nearly every scene taking place outside to give them a more somber look. as the plot progresses, the audience are treated with nauseating afterviews of the serial killer's murder. but instead of having the camera linger over the gory details of the victims, we are giving heavy implications of how they particularly occurred. these scenes do just enough without the suspenseful music score to leave viewers at the edge of their seats. then there is the serial killer himself who is portrayed as very sadistic, almost lecter hannibul-like, and creepy in appearance. his way of outwitting the main characters are quite shocking. the actor who plays him does an incredible job on his portrayal. as the story continues on, it builds up to one of the most haunting conclusions ever put to film, an ending that really pushes the boundaries. ultimately, it works pretty well. se7en is one of the well-crafted and twisted thrillers i've ever seen and one of the spine-chilling films hollywood has to offer, thanks to the incredible camera-work, brilliant direction by david fincher and fantastic script by andrew kevin walker. brad pitt and morgan freeman who play the main characters show amazing chemistry on screen together and their performances work pretty well. while the film is really great, it is definitely not recommended for the faint of heart.;20 November 2015;10;['most', 'thoughtful', 'many', 'ingenious', 'grim', 'psychological', 'unnamed', 'metropolitan', 'old', 'veteran', 'gruesome', 'deadly', 'own', 'sadistic', 'serial', 'responsible', 'grisly', 'complete', 'eerie', 'non', 'stop', 'grim', 'more', 'dark', 'somber', 'serial', 'gory', 'heavy', 'suspenseful', 'serial', 'sadistic', 'lecter', 'like', 'main', 'shocking', 'incredible', 'twisted', 'incredible', 'brilliant', 'fantastic', 'main', 'amazing', 'great'];0.082183908045977

148;TheUnknown837-1;"of course, thrillers and horrors, which ""se7en"" is top of the line, are not everybody's cup of tea. and many people probably would find a film such as this just simply too gory, too violent, and too graphically realistic to find appealing or even compelling. ""se7en"" was not intended to be a movie for the soft-stomached, and maybe even made to twist knots in the strong-stomached. whatever the case, it is exactly what it was intended to be: a horrifying and hair-raising thriller. but what it also possesses is excellent craftsmanship and creativity. all of the traits needed for a great film are present in ""se7en"". i'll admit that the first time i saw it, i couldn't get some of the scenes out of my head. not just because they were so brilliantly shot, but also for being so disturbing. but this did not make me dislike the film any. sure, i got chills up my spine, but i saw it as an excellent example of film-making. ""se7en"" utilizes the basic concept of most cop movies. two detectives, quite different from one another, try to track down a serial killer and bring him to justice. but ""se7en"" takes this basic plot idea and expands it a little further to give all of the characters a purpose. brad pitt and morgan freeman were both magnificently flawless in their performances and gave us the impression that we were looking at real cops, not just two popular actors performing on screen. that's what i really look for in a movie with big stars on the cast list. i see if the characters are used to create good performances and characters, not just to lure people into the theater. and the serial killer, whose identity and performer i will keep anonymous for those who have never seen ""se7en"" turned out to be one of the most brutal and above all, cunning serial killers and what's more, his actions had a purpose in the film. instead of just simply murdering people for the fun of it or even having a personal problem with them, he bases his attacks on victims who he feels have committed a crime that society does not feel is worthy of a penalty. the effect of limiting his screen time helped to increase the effect of his initial appearance, very much like the shark from ""jaws"". the set designs in the film are amazing. we are never told on screen where exactly this city is located. maybe it's los angeles or new york city, but whatever the case, the city is displayed as one of the most grimy and dirty cities you'd expect. we seldomly, if ever, see a clear blue sky while under the tall skyscrapers. there's smoke in the air, it's raining almost all of the time to give enhance the appearance of such a dirty environment. and then we think about the characters, one of whom has lived almost all, if not all of his life in such a place and wonder how he stayed so long. ""se7en"" is a magnficent example of 90s film-making. perhaps it is a bit flawed in a few aspects, such as too much dialogue sequences that seem to drag on for a while longer than they should. but it works out as a thriller and horror film on an epic scale. some people will find it too disturbing for them, but for me, it's a very well-done film with an unexpected and brilliant climax.

150;fernandoschiavi;"written by andrew kevin walker (who comes on the scene quickly as the first corpse we see in the film), se7en is set in an oppressive, gray and harrowing world that seems determined to constantly remind its occupants that life is cruel, unfair and without sense. it is in this context that we are introduced to detective somerset (freeman), who, a week before retirement, faces yet another murder scene with resignation and exhaustion, leading his day with melancholy until he can return to the solitude of his empty apartment at night, when, to get to sleep, he activates a metronome whose oscillating tick gradually drowns out the chaos of urban noises that invaded his room. with the credits closed, se7en returns us to the never-identified metropolis that hosts the story and which is built by the exceptional sound design of ren klyce (fincher's usual partner) as an absurdly hostile place: scattered throughout virtually every scene, sirens blare, neighbors arguing or dogs barking, in addition to the constant fall of rain (which highlights the claustrophobic atmosphere) and thunder. in fact, the sheer lack of silence ends up representing a touch of chaos in the characters' lives: here we can hear water running in the distance; there, the whistle that indicates the reverse of a truck. meanwhile, the soundtrack composed by howard shore hammers the tension through ""themes"" (if they can be called that) that invest in the repetition of bass chords and their crescendo - this when the film employs the soundtrack, which is much rarer over the projection of what we might expect in similar projects (in addition, shore's choice is also appropriate given his stunning work on the silence of the lambs four years earlier). we also have the almost omnipresence of rain in the sound of the film and it is inevitable to see how this is associated with production design to convert se7en's world into a pit of sadness and melancholy: in addition to the gray, desaturated palette that runs through the narrative, the designer arthur max certainly worked alongside richard schuler, responsible for the location research, to make sure that the exteriors would always bring the presence of iron railings and fences that would complement the pattern of the interiors, which would also invest in these elements - and in others similar ones employing vertical lines - to create the impression that those people are trapped in their terrible daily lives (until we get, of course, to the expressive use of car grilles in the final sequence). none of these elements would be possible, however, without the brilliant script by andrew kevin walker, whose structure is absolutely flawless. adopting the strategy of building the plot around a double countdown (the seven crimes and the seven days remaining before somerset retires), walker punctuates the advance of time by marking each new day on the screen, adding to the tension simply by remembering the spectator that the week is passing. furthermore, he uses the dialogues intelligently and cost-effectively to mark the hostility of the universe he has created (such as bringing in somerset explaining that rape victims should shout ""fire!"" instead of ""help!"") and in developing his characters, for mills constantly makes jokes and comments that indicate his immaturity and explosive nature, contrasting it with the cautious and sober way in which his companion expresses himself. what's more: when john doe first appears on the scene disguised as a photographer, the screenwriter disguises his importance by leading somerset to explain that journalists pay well for information such as crime scenes - which, in turn, is also relevant when he returns in a later speech by the assassin when he exposes how he discovered mills' address (""it's disturbing, the ease with which a member of the press can buy information in your district.""). and what about the seemingly casual moment when walker not only brings up a conversation between the two detectives in which they discuss their worldviews but also warns the viewer about the story's ending (""this isn't going to have a happy ending,"" he says. somerset)? from a purely structural point of view, it is difficult not to admire the progression of the plot and the understanding we have about the magnitude of the villain's plans, as the first victim is tortured for 12 hours, the second, for a whole weekend and the third... for a year. (which, by the way, indicates that doc planned to have them discovered in the opposite order of their deaths.) avoiding one of the most common mistakes in movies that revolve around serial killers (giving excessive importance to crimes and ignoring the characters), the script offers actors more than enough material to create complex individuals - and the cast put together by fincher doesn't miss the opportunity: newly elevated to the top of hollywood's most-in-demand actors list after starring opposite tom cruise in interview with the vampire the year before (when he also starred in his first heart-throb vehicle, legends of the passion), brad pitt here was still groping in search of a definitive direction for his career. demonstrating an ambition beyond just being the heartthrob the studios wanted to make him, he turned 1995 into a significant year by starting his partnership with fincher in this se7en and accepting a supporting role in the 12 monkeys to work with terry gilliam, where he offered a good performance full of tics and mannerisms. the dynamic between these two men, of course, becomes one of the main dramatic arcs of the script: initially uncomfortable with each other's style, they are upset with the partnership until - in one of the key scenes of the film - tracy invites somerset to dinner, leading to an unexpected moment of lightness when they laugh at the discomfort caused by the subway that shakes the apartment. from there mills and somerset build a growing complicity and share difficult memories and opinions about the world, maintaining, even so, the initial postures of a cynical veteran and an optimistic young man. freeman's character, in particular, soon establishes himself as the spectator's reference in the plot - and when he says he's never seen anything like those crimes, we understand the seriousness of the situation. the detective played by pitt, even when confronted with the actions of john doe, insists on believing that there is a purpose behind everything and that he will be able to make a difference - beliefs that the film will soon be responsible for destroying by proving that the his colleague's pessimism was justified (yet, it is shocking to see how even somerset sinks into john doe's actions to the point that even his metronome no longer helps him fall asleep). in addition to this duo, fincher delivers shocking and bloodthirsty scenes, mounting a growing tension that has long become one of his trademarks. murder after murder, terror amplified in the face of physical gore, making it impossible not to question the limits and true motives behind the mysterious lunatic. this feature only stands out for the director's full awareness and control, who does not surrender to sheer gratuitous violence (sometimes even sparing the viewer, as in the masterful final scene) and knowing how to take advantage of the greatest asset of these moments: the connection of deaths with the seven deadly sins, it is a precious thing to unveil the way in which the script and direction relate each victim to their respective immorality (such as the defense attorney convicted of his avarice and the drug dealer ""judged"" by laziness, for example). in addition, the director uses every element at his disposal to bring out the suspense, from the flashlight flashing in mill's hands as he searches through john doe's apartment to the energetic montage that, through quick cuts showing detailed plans of the preparations from the police, already makes the spectator anxious when the detectives go to preguica's apartment. to top it off, fincher pays a brief tribute to blade runner during the rain chase, also taking the opportunity to portray john doe as an authentic monster out of the shadows by revealing his reflection in a pool of water and keeping it out of focus when the pipe of his gun seems to stretch toward mills (in reality, the villain appears as a faceless blur for most of the sequence). concluding his strategy of establishing patterns only to break them suddenly, the director still adopts a double break in the last act of the film: besides finally bringing sunlight into the narrative after almost two hours of continuous rain (as if the characters were finally emerging from the charged atmosphere created by john doe - a false hope), fincher does something even more revealing by avoiding showing any acts of violence taking place on screen (we only see the results of the assassin's actions) only to make a single exception in the instant of the confrontation between mills and the villain, shocking the viewer with the unexpected approach. many regard se7en as the definitive david fincher film to date. it's hard to say something like that, but the film is certainly a complete work to provide the best tension experience possible. se7en is a miracle of the seventh art and will remain so for decades and decades. david fincher's work is a detective thriller that certainly enters the group of the best in the genre, showing much of the cruelty that dominates the world in which we live. and so it's hard not to agree with the phrase uttered by one of the characters at the end: ""ernest hemingway once wrote 'the world is a good place, and its worth fighting for'."" i agree with the second part.""";25 December 2021;10;['first', 'oppressive', 'gray', 'harrowing', 'determined', 'cruel', 'unfair', 'somerset', 'empty', 'urban', 'exceptional', 'usual', 'hostile', 'constant', 'sheer', 'rare', 'similar', 'appropriate', 'stunning', 'inevitable', 'melancholy', 'gray', 'responsible', 'sure', 'similar', 'vertical', 'terrible', 'daily', 'expressive', 'final', 'possible', 'brilliant', 'flawless', 'double', 'new', 'such', 'explosive', 'cautious', 'sober', 'more', 'such', 'relevant', 'later', 'disturbing', 'casual', 'happy', 'structural', 'difficult', 'first', 'whole', 'third', 'opposite', 'common', 'serial', 'excessive', 'more', 'enough', 'complex', 'elevated', 'opposite', 'first', 'definitive', 'significant', 'good', 'full', 'main', 'dramatic', 'uncomfortable', 'other', 'upset', 'key', 'unexpected', 'difficult', 'initial', 'cynical', 'optimistic', 'young', 'particular', 'able', 'responsible', 'shocking', 'shocking', 'bloodthirsty', 'physical', 'impossible', 'true', 'mysterious', 'full', 'sheer', 'gratuitous', 'masterful', 'final', 'great', 'deadly', 'precious', 'respective', 'such', 'energetic', 'quick', 'detailed', 'anxious', 'brief', 'authentic', 'most', 'double', 'last', 'continuous', 'false', 'revealing', 'single', 'unexpected', 'many', 'definitive', 'hard', 'complete', 'good', 'possible', 'seventh', 'good', 'much', 'hard', 'good', 'worth', 'second'];0.0734151986627234

153;emasterslake;one of the few thriller movies i liked so far next to the shining and hitchcock's movies. seven is about brad pitt playing a young detective and morgan freeman playing a much older detective. they're both involved in a twisted murder case that is linked to the seven deadly sins. envy, sloth, lust, gluttney, wrath, greed and pride. the victims of these murders are linked to those sins. the murder behind these killings is a sick and obsess catholic who's been planing to do this for quite sometime. our 2 detectives must find the killer and who'll end up being the last few victims of this scheme. i rarely make good reviews for thriller movies cause the ones today are full of sh*t. i think this movie is way better than the ring or saw movies. not obsess with brad pitt but morgan freeman was great with his role. i think this movie is worth buying if you like mystery/thriller/murder movies. this is a rare treat for a good thriller movie.;14 May 2006;7;['few', 'brad', 'young', 'old', 'twisted', 'deadly', 'sick', 'catholic', 'last', 'few', 'good', 'full', 'well', 'brad', 'great', 'worth', 'rare', 'good'];0.1239795918367346

155;classicalsteve;"what does dante's ""divine comedy"", christopher marlowe's ""the tragical history of doctor faustus"", john milton's ""paradise lost"", and the film ""seven"" have in common? they all reference the ""seven deadly sins"". the seven deadly sins, also known as the capital vices or cardinal sins, is a classification of vices propagated by the early christian church as being the most objectionable and immoral. they fit within st augustine's rhetoric in terms of fallen humanity's tendency to sin. the list consists of gluttony, greed, sloth, pride, lust, envy, and wrath. ""seven"" incorporates the literary references of the ""seven deadly sins"" into a compelling but shocking serial killer story. brad pit, in one of his best performances, plays a rookie detective, david mills, teamed with veteran and soon-to-be-retiring detective william somerset, played by morgan freeman in one of the best roles of his unequaled career. they are investigating a series of ghastly homicides in an american urban center that seems a helluva lot like chicago. the veteran detective has seen almost everything an urban cop can endure during an average career before the beginning of the story. however, as events transpire, they reveal things even he, after decades on the force, hasn't experienced. the rookie has no idea what's in store for him, and by movie's end he will have sustained the most horrific experience of a police detective coming-of-age ever shot on film. we get the sense all rookie detectives go through a kind of ""baptism of fire"" but nothing which would prepare a newbie to the force something as simultaneously horrific and devastating as that presented in ""seven"". unlike the usual street crime, these murders have a disturbing combination of dreadful horror coupled with high literary intelligence. the killer incorporates religious and literary symbolism into his acts of unspeakable violence and murder. each act and victim reference a different ""deadly sin"". the killer may be mad but he is an highly intelligent madman, who could probably quote dante while loading a magnum 44. the well-known actor who plays the killer/religious fanatic who reveals himself toward the end is perfect casting. hollywood rarely produces films with such a combination of horror and high intelligence. the closest comparable film is ""silence of the lambs"" whose character hannibal lecter is strikingly similar to the fiend in this film, although their motivations are entirely different. both of these characters, the killer of ""seven"" and hannibal lecter, are homicidal sociopaths of uncommon literary knowledge, which communicate disturbing overtones of higher purpose. they are the type who would probably view the act of crucifixion as an artistic statement. this is an incredible film both in its dreadfulness and its cerebral content, but definitely not for the feint of heart or the squeamish. as for myself, this is probably the limit in terms of the disturbing meter--worse than this would be out of bounds. despite the gruesome subject matter, this film has enough compelling elements, from the literary references to the relationship between pitt and freeman, that it does work as a masterpiece of the serial killer genre. and the ending is one of the most compelling and original conclusions i have ever witnessed in this type of film, but don't expect the main characters to be celebrating with beers at the end. there are very subtle hints during the film which point to how the movie's ending will unfold, but like most movie-goers during my initial viewing, the ending erupts like a dragon flying straight out of hell.";11 July 2010;10;['divine', 'tragical', 'common', 'deadly', 'deadly', 'cardinal', 'early', 'christian', 'objectionable', 'immoral', 'literary', 'deadly', 'compelling', 'shocking', 'serial', 'good', 'good', 'unequaled', 'american', 'urban', 'helluva', 'veteran', 'urban', 'average', 'horrific', 'horrific', 'devastating', 'usual', 'disturbing', 'dreadful', 'high', 'literary', 'religious', 'literary', 'unspeakable', 'different', 'deadly', 'mad', 'intelligent', 'magnum', 'religious', 'perfect', 'high', 'close', 'comparable', 'hannibal', 'similar', 'different', 'hannibal', 'uncommon', 'literary', 'disturbing', 'high', 'artistic', 'incredible', 'cerebral', 'disturbing', 'bad', 'gruesome', 'enough', 'compelling', 'literary', 'serial', 'compelling', 'original', 'main', 'subtle', 'most', 'initial'];-0.0360666666666666
156;hall895;in a dark, gloomy city where the rain never stops and the signs of urban decay are everywhere you look two detectives hunt down a serial killer. the first detective is william somerset, about to retire and desperately looking forward to a quiet life in the country away from all the urban misery. the second is young hotshot david mills. he is to be somerset's replacement and he can't wait to get started. he actually asked for this assignment. he relishes the opportunity to deal with the worst of the worst in this hellish city. of course he has no idea what he's in for. somerset knows. or at least he thinks he does. because not even wise, old somerset could possibly anticipate the events which are about to unfold. these two detectives, one on the way in and one on the way out, will be forced into a reluctant partnership as they work one chilling case. the dead bodies begin to pile up and somerset and mills get more than they ever could have bargained for. and quite possibly more than they can bear. somerset and mills find themselves investigating a bizarre and horrifying series of murders. by the time the second body turns up it is clear that an obviously deranged, though also obviously intelligent, killer is planning on murdering one victim to represent each of the seven deadly sins. a morbidly obese man is forced to eat himself to death. gluttony. a rich attorney is forced to cut off a pound of his own flesh. greed. and so on. the killings are gruesome. the killer, dubbed john doe, is a man clearly capable of unimaginably monstrous things. and somehow somerset and mills have to stop him before he completes his set. before he completes his deranged sermon to the world. it all makes for one morbidly fascinating movie. and one with a unique twist. serial killer movies generally go one of two ways. either they show you the killer all the way through as you watch him do his bloody work. or they keep the killer invisible and focus solely on those pursuing him. this movie leads you in one direction and then whips you around and turns everything on its head. rather brilliant stuff. as we watch somerset and mills do the old cop/young cop routine we've seen in so many other movies the contrasts between the two are exceedingly obvious. these are two very different men, attacking the john doe case from two very different perspectives. somerset is calm, collected, a thinking man. and morgan freeman, with his quiet dignity, portrays this perfectly. mills is a man more about action than thought. he's brash, emotional and a little immature. you get the sense early on that this is a man who may not be ready for what he is going to have to face. in playing this part brad pitt has his ups and downs. it's not a bad performance by any means but there are moments where the character's words and actions don't really ring true. mills comes off as being a little too insecure, and at times downright childish. the contrast between mills and somerset is supposed to be obvious, and supposed to be a major theme of the film. but at times the contrast is just a little too stark to be believable. even in the incredibly tense, drama-packed finale pitt's mills comes across as much too whiny and immature. his reactions to what he is confronted with just don't seem to fit. perhaps pitt went just a touch too far in displaying all of the insecurities and personality quirks which make up detective mills. but it's nothing bad enough to really detract from the overall movie-watching experience. director david fincher crafted something rather special here. so much more than just another serial killer movie. it's smart, it's riveting, and in the end it's quite jaw-dropping. maybe pitt is just adequate. but freeman is brilliant. and one other performer is even better than that. but that final, perfectly fitted piece to this puzzle you have to discover for yourself.;15 January 2011;8;['dark', 'gloomy', 'urban', 'serial', 'first', 'about', 'quiet', 'urban', 'second', 'young', 'bad', 'bad', 'hellish', 'least', 'wise', 'old', 'about', 'reluctant', 'chilling', 'dead', 'more', 'more', 'bizarre', 'horrifying', 'second', 'clear', 'intelligent', 'deadly', 'obese', 'rich', 'own', 'gruesome', 'capable', 'monstrous', 'fascinating', 'unique', 'serial', 'bloody', 'invisible', 'brilliant', 'old', 'young', 'routine', 'many', 'other', 'obvious', 'different', 'different', 'calm', 'quiet', 'more', 'brash', 'emotional', 'little', 'ready', 'bad', 'true', 'little', 'insecure', 'childish', 'obvious', 'major', 'little', 'stark', 'believable', 'tense', 'much', 'whiny', 'bad', 'overall', 'special', 'more', 'serial', 'smart', 'adequate', 'brilliant', 'other', 'well', 'final'];0.0403296703296703

158;one9eighty;"voluntarily transferring in to a crime hotspot in an unnamed city of america, det. david mills (brad pitt) is a rookie detective on the rise. he's teamed up with det. william somerset (morgan freeman) who's not far away from retirement. they end up on a case investigating murders that follow a pattern and are inspired by the seven deadly sins from dante's ""the devine comedy"". somerset is an expert in hunting down criminals and does things the old-fashioned way through years of working hard, due to looming retirement and a desire to stay alive he doesn't want to get involved too heavily - his years and the weariness they have brought him suggest that there is more going on than just another killer on the loose. mills on the other hand wants to make a name for himself and pushes the case and his involvement. they fall out a little, it takes a meeting with tracy mill (gwyneth paltrow - pitt's film wife) to convince somerset that he has to be involved, if nothing else than to guide and protect mills. thus they pursue the murder, john doe (kevin spacey) who has planned a shock for the detectives. directed by david fincher and wonderfully written by andrew kevin walker, this is a fantastic intelligent and gripping film, a real cult classic and one of the iconic films of the 90's. it's dark and dirty with a fantastic atmosphere. the unnamed american city is a real hive of filth and degradation, it's always raining, and even when you are away from the rain the colour palette is muted, dark and dirty. the acting is top class all the way across the board. while having a new rogue cop and one close to retirement isn't a new set-up it works particularly well in this and pitt and freeman end up bouncing off each other beautifully. the score to the movie is great and really helps to build up the atmosphere and bring in a level of tension that chills. editing techniques used are both new and existing, some a direct homage to absolute greats of horror movies, in particularly the hidden cell insertion (a-la ""the exorcist"" for example) - a frame or picture hidden in the visual reel and only displayed for a fraction of a moment. the look and feel of the film harp back to noir classics or even graphic novel comic books the way it's all dark and gloomy, and while it's set as an action/suspense/thriller there are nods to horror too, both psychologically and physically, with the manner of killings which take place adding a grizzly and raw element. well-paced and almost metronomal, this film will keep you entertained throughout - in fact the most peaceful time the film allows is when the detectives themselves are having a break from action. this is a feature of the film, it stays on track and focussed throughout and unlike conventional hollywood films it never strays from it plot and purpose. the audience plays a part in the film as the third detective, in that they are kept in the dark throughout and only really learn things as the detectives learn, which allows for an intense ride and lifts the finale onto a pedestal. not your typical cops and robbers' film this will take you out of your comfort zone and take you into a brutal world, and who knows, you might end up questioning your morality and empathising or sympathising with the killer's motives. this film didn't win half as many awards as it should have done - but thankfully its cult status and fan recognition have kept it alive in film history consciousness. 9 out of 10 from me.";17 August 2018;9;['unnamed', 'deadly', 'old', 'fashioned', 'alive', 'other', 'little', 'fantastic', 'intelligent', 'gripping', 'real', 'iconic', 'dark', 'dirty', 'fantastic', 'unnamed', 'american', 'real', 'dark', 'dirty', 'top', 'new', 'new', 'other', 'great', 'new', 'existing', 'direct', 'absolute', 'la', 'visual', 'graphic', 'novel', 'comic', 'dark', 'gloomy', 'raw', 'metronomal', 'peaceful', 'conventional', 'third', 'intense', 'typical', 'brutal', 'many', 'alive'];0.0794656533942248

161;Stampsfightclub;"two detectives try to hunt down a serial killer who seems to be attacking his victims using the seven deadly sins. david fincher at the time of se7en's release was the man known only as the director who destroyed the alien franchise, and quite right. apart from a stunning final that showed his potential there was simply a collection of medium shots with none of that vintage scene stealing fast montages and flashes that would become so effective in his future release fight club and panic room. so there was a bit of pressure on here as casting renowned star freeman and most recognized newcomer brad pitt about a delicate and interesting topic, and he didn't disappoint many. seven is now renowned as one of the finest horrors ever made. starting off with a detective retiring and an ambitious but naive new cop surprise surprise we have tension. this has been handled in so many films it is ridiculous and if you're expecting anything different in terms of this pairing, think again. the tension between the pair is obvious, the predictable gung-ho attitude by pitt's mills is soft and morgan's law-abiding somerset is simply boring. so here we have 'drama' and as both are on the hunt for a serial killer we have 'crime' and the mystery man is attacking his victims with the deadly sins and so we have horrible murders that would label this as 'horror'. when reading descriptions i noticed this was labelled as one of the scariest films ever. i however didn't seem to find what was so scary. sure the concept would have been scary if the murders had been effectively established but the pair of detectives hardly seemed bothered. they were mere happenings that stumbled in their way. this is a shame as this is a debatable topic that questions religion, social class and humanity. apart from blood messages, you won't be jumping behind the sofa any time soon. so se7en simply tries to tackle too much. horror, crime and drama are all encoded and seemingly not enough; the inclusion of the rain drenched city places it in noir too, as does gwyneth paltrow's flat protagonist. impressive scene settings and costume design but when there is no plot there is no give, no adrenaline to match the mood. there is also a lack of action in this 1995 picture. a full hour had passed before my head was inclined to be entertained. then the final climax was finally worth watching. heart stopping and well acted by all involved made se7en moderately interesting. but despite this heavily debated climax and odd twists, it is not worth the whole waiting around";14 April 2009;5;['serial', 'deadly', 'alien', 'right', 'stunning', 'medium', 'vintage', 'fast', 'effective', 'future', 'renowned', 'delicate', 'interesting', 'many', 'fine', 'ambitious', 'naive', 'new', 'many', 'ridiculous', 'different', 'obvious', 'predictable', 'gung', 'soft', 'boring', 'serial', 'deadly', 'horrible', 'scary', 'scary', 'scary', 'mere', 'debatable', 'social', 'much', 'flat', 'impressive', 'full', 'final', 'worth', 'interesting', 'odd', 'worth', 'whole'];0.0313450834879406
162;Mister-6;"a movie as dark, disturbing and heavily wrought with despair as ""se7en"" can hardly be called entertainment. this is a motion-picture statement. and not an encouraging one. but a statement all the same. not to say that it's a bad movie. quite the opposite. in a tale where a retiring police detective (freeman) takes one last case along with his replacement (pitt), only to find that their investigation leads them down through a very first testament eye-for-an-eye lesson in the seven deadly sins, you cannot expect a merry romp down the yellow brick road. as the victims have all been felled by such vices as gluttony, vanity, sloth, sex and such, freeman and pitt slowly realize that they are dealing not only with a sicko but one who means to follow his lesson on to the bitter end. and that's it. i won't tell another bit of the plot; this is the kind of movie that has to be witnessed first-hand. i'll be the first to admit that it's definitely not a movie for anybody. certainly most people will be turned off almost immediately by the gore and downbeat intensity of the whole situation. as freeman so lucidly observes, ""this isn't going to have a happy ending."" - well, how could it? freeman is, of course, a sound center to the film and without him as a grounding wire, the whole film would have suffered through its grunge and blood and rainy days and nights. much has been said of pitt's ineffectual stance in his role, but i think that's the whole point: he's the common man who just sees this killer as another wacko to lock up. his eventual transformation is almost un-noticeable as he turns from a deadened, i've-seen-it-all type into someone who can't quite believe that such debased evil actually exists until.. well, that would be telling; suffice it to say that it's gradual and sudden all at once - and makes perfect sense, in context. gwyneth paltrow plays pitt's wife about as well as can be expected under the circumstances. r. lee ermey plays a more sedate version of the drill sergeant he made so vivid in ""full metal jacket"". and as for john doe... it's a credit to his performance that he makes himself so eerily believable as someone who believes this is the only way to make people listen to what he has to say. and, in some sick way, he may be right. but the people aren't the stars here, and neither is fincher's dark, foreboding direction - it's the story and where it leads to, it's the talks you'll have afterwards about what happens at the end, it's about sin and death and what really has to be done to make some people aware of what sin is around them and how dead we've all become towards it. maybe ""se7en"" is more about how we react to the eventual lesson taught and how it's presented than the actors, the gore and the literary quotes. if you can stomach the gore and your heart can take some pretty wrenching scenes, this may be a movie for you to watch, think about and, possibly, learn from. i watched it and, myself, learned a pretty important lesson. of course, every movie teaches its own different lesson to different people. see ""se7en"" yourself and draw your own conclusion. eight stars for ""se7en"". powerful: yes. disturbing: definitely. unforgettable: absolutely.";8 May 2000;8;['dark', 'disturbing', 'wrought', 'encouraging', 'same', 'bad', 'last', 'first', 'deadly', 'yellow', 'such', 'such', 'bitter', 'first', 'first', 'most', 'downbeat', 'whole', 'happy', 'sound', 'whole', 'rainy', 'much', 'ineffectual', 'whole', 'common', 'eventual', 'noticeable', 'such', 'gradual', 'sudden', 'perfect', 'sedate', 'vivid', 'full', 'believable', 'only', 'sick', 'right', 'dark', 'aware', 'dead', 'more', 'eventual', 'literary', 'important', 'own', 'different', 'different', 'own', 'powerful', 'unforgettable'];0.1523519163763066

164;stamper;this is one of the best thrillers i've seen and i've seen quite a few. you might say i'm an actual serial killer freak. this one sure is one of the best, it ranks right up there with other thrillers like scream, the texas chainsaw massacre, the blair witch project, copycat, arlington road and fight club (if you miss silence of the lambs, well i can't remember that film so good so i just left it out). the only film that is actually relevant here, because of the serial killer content is of course copycat. i wouldn't say these two films are even (considering quality), hell no se7en is better, but hey i must mention copycat here, because that film featuring sigourney weaver was released in 1995 also and i feel it has been neglected or maybe just overlooked by some due to the big success se7en was. if you like se7en you'll like copycat, because it is about a killer, who well copy's famous serial killers. now finally on to the film in question. i feel like there is nothing much to be said about this film that already someone said or has written on this page. still i must comment on it. for one thing i must do so, because this film features some of the best actors there are today and it also is original. first the actors, we have of course heart throb brad pitt as you might call him, well i call him one of the best actors of our time. he has done some really good films and by that i don't mean his older ones like legends of the fall or a river runs through it, no i mean this one, fight club (very good, very underrated) and maybe thelma & louise. in this film he delivers a good performance nothing too fancy but good. especially in the ending i must say, for that part was his hardest. good acting but not oscar stuff. then of course there is morgan freeman (see the shawshank redemption, kiss the girls and outbreak), who is good too, as most of the time, when there is a job to be done he does it. and now for the best one yet, kevin spacey (whose best films are outbreak, the usual suspects, a time to kill, the negotiator, american beauty and maybe the ref), who is not that much on screen but if he is, damn. what a great actor. you might not think this when watching the film the first time except maybe at the very end. but if you watch the film a second time and have remembered the ending (you are probably asking yourselves if can you forget it, well i've done so once but now i've seen it three times and i'll never forget i think) you have to listen closely to the conversation in the car. the way spacey talks and what he says, it makes so much more 'sense' when you know the ending. he is just so confident and already teasing men who don't think he is superior when he knows he is, for he has all the aces right up his sleeve. this brings me right up to the originality of this film actually. it is not only that the films story is very original, because never have i seen somebody kill people in connection with the 7 deadly sins. it is also original in the way they are carried out and that is what makes this film really special. the killings are not only brutal, but they are well prepared, so we are dealing with a genius of a madman, something that becomes very clear at the end and not until then, maybe. i think that you actually have to like this movie you must like it unless maybe it is too gory for you. if it isn't you'll like it, trust me. 8 out of 10;27 August 2000;8;['good', 'few', 'actual', 'serial', 'good', 'other', 'good', 'only', 'relevant', 'serial', 'well', 'due', 'big', 'famous', 'serial', 'much', 'good', 'original', 'good', 'good', 'old', 'good', 'underrated', 'good', 'fancy', 'good', 'hard', 'good', 'oscar', 'good', 'most', 'good', 'good', 'outbreak', 'usual', 'american', 'much', 'great', 'first', 'very', 'second', 'more', 'confident', 'superior', 'original', 'deadly', 'original', 'special', 'brutal', 'prepared', 'clear', 'gory'];0.3221916971916971

166;juliankennedy23;seven (1995) 9 out of 10: david fincher's premiere film as a feature film director after years of making music videos is a masterpiece. meticulously detailed and layered to the point that multiple viewings give even greater pleasures and currently occupying a spot in the imdb top 20 movies of all time. hold on someone has their hand up in the back... what's that? alien 3? ... there was no alien 3. there were only two alien movies: alien and aliens. if you recall, at the end of aliens ripley, bishop, newt and hicks all escape and live happily ever after. so obviously seven is david fincher's first film. understood. the good: this is truly finely crafted film and like an onion has many layers. to dissect the onion will simply destroy it and leave everyone crying so to preserve what i can of writer andrew kevin walker mystery let me tell you my pet theory. i think the movie takes place in purgatory. it is truly a dark dirty miserable place (even for the mid-nineties). every location seems flawed in some way, never to be properly clean and lit. the characters are also flawed. brad pitt is quick to violence and quite the obnoxious hot head in some scenes. morgan freeman seems to be playing the same character he has been playing the last twenty -five years. but there is hidden depth in this one. some regrets and some cold calculations. he is seven days from retirement but this being purgatory the real fear is not he will be killed like every single movie cop seven days from retirement in the entire history of movies. no, the real fear is he will never be able to retire at all and one day will simply blend into another. both leads do a bang-up job with characters that seem like they fit exactly in their wheelhouse but as i note above with freeman have a little more depth than it appears at first glance (or even first viewing of the film.) seven has a deliberate pace that can lull one without ever seeming boring. while the cycle of downtime and investigation seems fairly well set there are a couple of surprises that topple the apple cart and keep the audience on its toes. the calm deliberate pace, of course, make the surprises all that more effective. our bad guy like many of the surprises in the film are well known at this time. the movie does do a great job hiding him, however (though his killing a drug dealer because he was also a pederast gets a second glance nowadays considering.) the big bads plan involving the seven deadly sins (gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath, pride, lust, and envy for those keeping score at home) may seem overdone to modern audiences but it was fresh stuff when this movie came out. movies like the saw series crib heavily from seven. the mediocre: there is nothing really bad in seven. there are some things however that are mediocre. i like gwyneth paltrow but despite a significant amount of screen time she never makes an impression. she is just kind of there saying her lines. there is no emotional connection to the audience. in other words, she is ingrid bergman in casablanca. a couple of sins get short shrift in the movie. pride, in particular, seems truncated and sloth's victim seems... well unslothful. (i mean the guy is both a scummy drug dealer and a pederast? he is multitasking over here. why not get someone who marathons those judge shows on daytime television and then orders takeout.) the ugly: having a number in the middle of your name was stupid in 1995, it is stupid in 2019 and there has never been a time outside of those dates where it wasn't stupid. as weird al yankovic says in that holiday classic word crimes. you should never write words using numbers unless you're seven or your name is prince hold on a second maybe he meant the movie seven in those lyrics instead of the age seven as we all assumed all along... omg, my mind is blown. in conclusion: if you have never seen it and especially if you have managed not to have it spoiled go check out seven. in addition, you haven't seen it since the nineties i also recommend giving it another spin. it holds up really well and is better than you remember it.;11 September 2019;9;['premiere', 'detailed', 'multiple', 'great', 'top', 'alien', 'alien', 'alien', 'alien', 'first', 'many', 'dark', 'dirty', 'miserable', 'flawed', 'clean', 'flawed', 'brad', 'quick', 'obnoxious', 'hot', 'same', 'last', 'hidden', 'cold', 'purgatory', 'real', 'single', 'entire', 'real', 'able', 'little', 'more', 'first', 'first', 'deliberate', 'calm', 'deliberate', 'effective', 'bad', 'many', 'great', 'second', 'big', 'deadly', 'modern', 'fresh', 'saw', 'bad', 'mediocre', 'significant', 'emotional', 'other', 'ingrid', 'short', 'particular', 'truncated', 'unslothful', 'scummy', 'daytime', 'ugly', 'stupid', 'stupid', 'stupid', 'weird', 'classic', 'second', 'well'];-0.0361149267399267

171;jrarichards;"this high-class thriller from david fincher is well done, tense and rather gory; and achieves a great deal with its high-quality camera-work, primarily (though not quite solely) in hammering home the overriding message over a great chunk of the film that new york is the new sodom and gomorrah and possibly even hell on earth. it rains there and is grey all the time, plenty of sin is committed, and even formerly-good people are ground down by it, turned to evil or at best becoming apathetic as the only other possible defence. this kind of apathy is also at least to some extent afflicting our key character, william somerset, a detective on the verge of retiring played by morgan freeman. nevertheless, this character is not especially popular among fellow cops, given that he asks more questions than they do, is more thoughtful (and far better-read), and he still tries that bit harder. still less jaded and jaundiced is what will soon come to be somerset's new partner, if only for a short period, the newly-arrived detective mills, as played by brad pitt, who has decided to bring with him from upstate a couple of dogs and a still-untainted wife played by gwyneth paltrow. they are now living in an apartment they were conned into buying by being invited to view and visit between the times at which subway trains go thundering by, shaking the dwelling to its very foundations. rather quickly, somerset and mills come up against a methodically cunning and well-read psychopathic killer bent on putting paid to ny's sinners, turning their sins against them in the grossest and most sadistic of ways, but also in a manner that he considers entirely right and appropriate. while 5 sins are demonstrated and avenged in the big apple, the last two shift out to a quite non-new york-looking out-of-town locality, in which the sun is suddenly shining. this seems a somewhat surprising tactic, given what had gone before. what is more (and unlike in most films of this kind you have ever seen) the last part takes place with the killer in handcuffs in front of our eyes, and thus revealed to us as ""john doe"" (yes, really), played in the slightly spaced-out way that only kevin spacey can quite manage. furthermore, the detectives and forensic guys have already taken we the audience on a tour through doe's roomy if cluttered and weirder-than-weird apartment, hence that traditional element of such films we already have well behind us. while much or most of the story summed up as above may sound a bit fantastic, enigmatic, apocalyptic horror-like or even sci fi-ish in tone, the greater part of the film looks (pretty much or at least ostensibly) like a conventional enough cop movie-cum-crime shocker, which leaves the in-your-face ending more of a surprise. in fact, ""surprise"" is the wrong word, since we might indeed have anticipated what we get, but presumably just felt that no film maker is actually going to do this to us ... and then he does. this defying of convention established for hundreds of movies of this kind over decades has an amazingly disarming effect, and one is left a little speechless. this is only delivered more strongly by (freeman's exquisite acting of) somerset's behaviour at this point. suffice it to say that the usual circumstance of the villain realising ""it's all over"" is utterly turned on its head here. but... while this approach may indeed seem shocking, innovative and even high art, the impact is so great that it does actually spoil the film a bit, at least for this very seasoned cinema-goer and film-watcher. a spring pulled beyond its ability to rebound ceases to function as a spring, and maybe here we have destroyed the cop-thriller genre by stretching it too far out of shape. personally speaking, i found myself asking what the point of what had gone before had really been, especially where certain slightly-less-grim scenes had been concerned. added to that is the uncomfortable idea - put into words by doe himself - that he is somehow fighting back against omnipresent sin and evil (of course by doing still-greater evil himself). while i am usually pretty merciless with spoilers, i have - as is pretty clear - eschewed giving too much away here, because those with a reasonably strong stomach are certainly advised to give this film a go, in the unlikely event that anybody interested out there has not already done so. but the piece ""only"" gets a 9 here from me, because maybe there are some things you just can't do with a film genre, at least without having to pay some price for doing so...";24 October 2016;9;['high', 'tense', 'great', 'high', 'great', 'new', 'you', 'good', 'good', 'apathetic', 'only', 'other', 'possible', 'apathy', 'least', 'key', 'popular', 'fellow', 'more', 'thoughtful', 'jaded', 'new', 'short', 'brad', 'upstate', 'untainted', 'very', 'cunning', 'psychopathic', 'gross', 'sadistic', 'right', 'appropriate', 'big', 'last', 'non', 'new', 'surprising', 'more', 'most', 'last', 'forensic', 'cluttered', 'weird', 'weird', 'traditional', 'such', 'much', 'most', 'fantastic', 'enigmatic', 'apocalyptic', 'great', 'least', 'conventional', 'enough', 'more', 'wrong', 'little', 'exquisite', 'usual', 'shocking', 'innovative', 'high', 'great', 'least', 'seasoned', 'certain', 'grim', 'uncomfortable', 'great', 'pretty', 'merciless', 'strong', 'unlikely', 'interested', 'least'];0.1185857994464551

175;msbreviews;"if you enjoy reading my spoiler-free reviews, please follow my blog :) i've never written or even thought about my favorite movies of all-time. i don't believe in having a definite top10 or top20 of every film i've ever seen. however, if i had to write this special list, i have no doubts that se7en would be there. obviously, this is a rewatch of the classic movie that impacted filmmaking and launched david fincher's remarkable career (i also ignore the fact that alien 3 is connected to fincher due to the known production issues). with his next film, mank, coming up on netflix in a few weeks, i decided to go through part of his filmography. se7en will be the first out of five fincher's movies that i will be able to revisit throughout this week. i've seen this film countless times, but to be completely honest, i haven't seen it in so long that i didn't remember exactly some important plot points and a key component about the ending. this helped me experience se7en in a fascinating way once again. andrew kevin walker's screenplay has one of the most intriguing, mysterious, captivating narratives i've ever witnessed, still to this day. from the very beginning to the last second, i'm constantly at the edge of my seat (in this case, my couch) with severe anxiety levels and feeling incredibly tense. biting my nails, moving my leg up and down, changing positions... it's so mesmerizing that i'm only writing about it more than twenty-four hours after i watched it. one of the most impressive aspects is how fincher is able to leave the viewer uncomfortable with showing only a single death on-screen. this is an extremely dark, gory, blood-soaked, gruesome flick, packed with horrible displays of dead bodies, but never the actual murder scene. with just a simple photo or a straight line of dialogue, fincher lets the viewer's imagination do the work, and it's undoubtedly as or more effective than a visually horrific killing sequence. as the premise implies, the serial killer is inspired by the ""seven deadly sins"", and he goes after the respective sinners, killing them (or letting them kill themselves) in an innovative fashion, turning the sin against the sinner. the gluttony and sloth cases are visually brutal, but the lust murder is the one that keeps haunting my memory. the latter is also the less explicit, left to open-minded people to imagine the despicable act. in 1995, a movie with such a dismal environment and dark story couldn't be well-received, and se7en got its fair share of negative reviews stating that it was too obscure, sinister, overly violent and that the ending was absolutely unacceptable. over time, it found its success, it gained fans all around the world, and it's now considered by many as one of the greatest films ever made, myself included. from the outstanding cast to the astonishingly enthralling detective work, the third act stands out as one of the most shocking endings of all-time. i'm keeping this review spoiler-free because i don't want readers who have not seen this movie to have such a magnificent piece of cinema ruined for them. that's why i'm also hiding a certain actor from the starring section, just like the marketing team did at the original date of release (i'll get there). fincher's third act is simply flawless. everything displayed on-screen in the last twenty minutes is filmmaking perfection. from the impressively suspenseful build-up to that jaw-dropping climactic moment, passing through a mind-blowing revelation, se7en's conclusion is and will remain as one of the most brutally shocking endings in the history of cinema. morgan freeman and brad pitt share fantastic chemistry, portraying two iconic characters that couldn't be more different than one another. somerset is a notable detective with extreme attention to detail, knowledgeable, and always curious about the case at hand. freeman incorporates this character effortlessly, delivering a subtle yet powerful performance. pitt portrays mills, a childish, unfocused, immature replacement to the previous detective about to retire. despite its apparent lack of work ethics, mills is clever, relentless in finding the killer, and desperately wants to prove himself. pitt, just like freeman, embodies this persona seamlessly and also gives an outstanding interpretation. technically, where should i begin? from the haunting score of howard shore to the documentary-like cinematography (darius khondji) that offers a tremendously realistic atmosphere, it's the phenomenal production design that stands out. fincher really wanted the dirty, rainy, depressing city to feel authentic and as real as possible. the first dialogues of the film are meant to point out the bleakness and awfulness of the city, but even without these conversations, any viewer will be able to acknowledge the absence of color, joyfulness, and life in this unknown location. fincher's filmmaking techniques are demonstrated in plain splendor for everyone to see, and this was just his beginning. movies like se7en are impossible to be made today, period. it would never be conceivable to completely hide one of the main actors from the press tour and/or trailers. we live in a time where the promotion of a film must have everything and everyone. nowadays, trailers show way too much, and this isn't news to anyone. the ending was forced by pitt and fincher since the studio wanted a more mainstream conclusion. today, filmmakers may have more freedom, but there are still countless cases of executive producers changing a movie without the director's will and/or permission. se7en was a film released in a time where it should have never been released in the first place. fortunately, it was. se7en might be the best director's sophomore movie in the history of cinema, and it's undoubtedly one of my favorite films of all-time. david fincher's classic possesses one of the most captivating screenplays i've ever witnessed, marked by an extremely dark, somber, violent, gruesome story that ends with one of the most emotionally shocking conclusions to a movie, ever. the lack of on-screen death scenes is both the most surprising and effectively powerful element of the whole film, leaving the unpleasant work of imagining a specific type of murder to the viewer's mind. morgan freeman and brad pitt are extraordinary as the now iconic detectives, delivering two truly brilliant performances. fincher's trademark filmmaking style started here, as every technical aspect contributes to the movie's incredible realism. from the simple, documentary-like camera work to the ominous score, it's the authentic production design that sets the depressing tone, the bleak atmosphere, and the rainy, colorless, lifeless city. overall, it's a technically flawless piece of art. one of the greatest films ever made.... i can't recommend it more. rating: a+";21 November 2020;10;['free', 'favorite', 'definite', 'special', 'classic', 'remarkable', 'alien', 'next', 'few', 'first', 'able', 'countless', 'honest', 'important', 'key', 'fascinating', 'intriguing', 'mysterious', 'very', 'last', 'severe', 'tense', 'mesmerizing', 'more', 'impressive', 'able', 'uncomfortable', 'single', 'dark', 'gruesome', 'horrible', 'dead', 'actual', 'simple', 'straight', 'effective', 'horrific', 'serial', 'deadly', 'respective', 'innovative', 'brutal', 'explicit', 'open', 'minded', 'despicable', 'dismal', 'dark', 'fair', 'negative', 'obscure', 'sinister', 'violent', 'unacceptable', 'many', 'great', 'outstanding', 'enthralling', 'third', 'shocking', 'free', 'magnificent', 'certain', 'original', 'third', 'flawless', 'last', 'suspenseful', 'climactic', 'shocking', 'fantastic', 'iconic', 'different', 'notable', 'extreme', 'knowledgeable', 'curious', 'subtle', 'powerful', 'childish', 'unfocused', 'immature', 'previous', 'apparent', 'clever', 'relentless', 'outstanding', 'like', 'realistic', 'phenomenal', 'dirty', 'rainy', 'authentic', 'real', 'possible', 'first', 'able', 'unknown', 'plain', 'impossible', 'conceivable', 'main', 'much', 'mainstream', 'more', 'countless', 'executive', 'first', 'good', 'favorite', 'classic', 'captivating', 'dark', 'somber', 'violent', 'gruesome', 'shocking', 'surprising', 'powerful', 'whole', 'unpleasant', 'specific', 'brad', 'extraordinary', 'iconic', 'brilliant', 'technical', 'incredible', 'simple', 'like', 'ominous', 'authentic', 'depressing', 'bleak', 'rainy', 'colorless', 'lifeless', 'flawless', 'great', 'more'];0.094047619047619

177;Pedro_H;two cops - one young, one old - chase a serial killer that is leaving a paper trail. this is actually one of the best films that i have seen that i have only wanted to watch one. the reason being that while it has an interesting plot, plenty of action and a great twist it also has a horrible aftertaste. like spending too long trying to clear a blocked drain. hollywood has, for far too long, glamorised crime and the chasing criminal so it is surprising to see a film maker going the other way. this is a dark, decrepit and cold world where everything is falling apart and unkept. this seems a deliberate policy move that features in many of david fincher's films. interesting - in that is different - but strangely alienating and depressing - and these are emotions i don't want to wish upon myself. the serial killer and the criminal that leaves clues are nothing new, but the way the plot develops is. if you know the twist the movie will be cut in half and thank god i saw it without knowing the pay-off- although i knew there was going to be one. this is a movie after all. brad pitt never convinces as a professional of any type. here he seems to have become a cop overnight and without much training. morgan freeman does his usual quiet-but-logical act that has bought him fame so late in life. he is nearing retirement (in the film), but i thought all cops were about to retire in movies - i took that as read! this is very involving stuff and we are drawn to grandstand finish that we will remember forever - but what is se7en in longterm reflection? a horrible world in which horrible people carry out horrible acts for reasons of self-gratification? serial killers have existed since the dawn of time, but america is home to half of the world's population of them. why is this? maybe it is the last chance to make a mark on a society where being in the media and being in the spotlight are prized? when you have killed someone you are interesting, when you haven't you are not. simple.;15 February 2004;7;['young', 'old', 'serial', 'good', 'interesting', 'great', 'horrible', 'long', 'surprising', 'other', 'dark', 'decrepit', 'cold', 'unkept', 'deliberate', 'many', 'interesting', 'different', 'depressing', 'serial', 'new', 'half', 'much', 'usual', 'quiet', 'logical', 'about', 'longterm', 'horrible', 'horrible', 'horrible', 'serial', 'last', 'interesting', 'simple'];-0.0444347319347319

182;anselmdaniel;this review contains spoilers. seven premiered in 1995 and, is directed by david fincher. the movie is written by andrew kevin walker and stars brad pitt and morgan freeman. the movie is about a pair of police detectives that are tracking down a serial killer using the seven deadly sins as a modus operandi. seven is an incredibly engaging movie. the movie's 127 minutes of running time moves at an incredible pace as it is bolstered by the tight directing by david fincher. this movie is absolutely well-directed. david fincher arranges every scene well and executes it well. the direction aids in the delivery of how each of the seven deadly sins are shown. nothing as held back with the display of the deadly sins. david fincher is able to show the audience the utter disgust represented by the sins. the investigator perspective is also clear and understood well. both brad pitt and morgan freeman play detectives in the police named david mills and william somerset respectively. both of these actors portray their characters well. morgan freeman as william somerset is a soon to retire detective that is jaded by his experiences. david mills is idealistic but and naive to the horrors in his job. these two characters play off of each other well and serve to take the audience along with them to solve the mystery. it is a pleasure trying to follow along with the detectives. the villain john doe steals the show. kevin spacey plays the serial killer and it was awesome. the entire time from when he is introduced to the mystery being solved serves as the movie's climax. it is here that kevin spacey portrays the creepy serial killer and delivers chilling dialogue to the audience. the villain is helped greatly by the writing and serves to make the reveal of john doe even more frightening. the movie does not introduce him until some of the other victims are already shown. this helps with the reveal as it finally shows this normal looking man as being truly psychotic. i would recommend se7en. the movie is a solid crime thriller and is a great early david fincher movie. grade: b;31 December 2018;8;['serial', 'deadly', 'engaging', 'incredible', 'tight', 'deadly', 'deadly', 'able', 'utter', 'clear', 'idealistic', 'naive', 'other', 'serial', 'awesome', 'entire', 'creepy', 'serial', 'chilling', 'frightening', 'other', 'normal', 'psychotic', 'solid', 'great', 'early'];0.0642857142857143

185;elicopperman;although alien 3 was filmmaker david fincher's directorial debut, i think he'd prefer to call this film his real debut any day of the week. released in 1995, seven (or se7en) went on to gain critical acclaim, huge box-office revenue, and helped kickstart new beginnings for the director. to this very day, it remains by many as a highly graphic and disturbing neo-noir flick with a highly engaging premise and finale. after seeing the film in its entirety myself, i could not agree more. the film tells the story of two new york detectives named william somerset (morgan freeman) and david mills (brad pitt) who track down a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins in his murders. what really holds the movie together are the two leads, as pitt and freeman display excellent chemistry with each other. both of their characters have their own desires in life, with somerset on the brink of retirement and mills just starting at his position. their performances are so sharp and realistic that it's hard to see the actors rather than the actual characters. considering how disgusting their murder case is, it's only fitting that they do the necessary reacting and analyzing. in addition to strong leads, some of the supporting cast are quite memorable in their own regard. mills' wife tracy (gwyneth paltrow), faces certain struggles upon moving to a new city and certain complications about her personal life. whenever she's with somerset, you can just feel her devastation, making her arguably the most sympathetic character in the whole feature. however, the serial killer himself, john doe (kevin spacey), is one who could really send shivers down anyone's spine. alongside all of his murders being horrific yet well thought out, he's actually smarter than one might assume, and he practically wrote the third act he's so clever albeit evil (no spoilers). i'm not too familiar with david fincher's directing style, but this film really displays new york in a graphic setting. even when it's a calm rainy day or even sunny, there's always a sense of danger lurking about. the editing is also very well paced, especially during a particularly suspenseful chase scene of mills and john doe through an apartment complex which must've went through lots of trial and error to get right. the grim tone helps give the viewers a glimpse of the horrors in the world, so when we know more about john doe, you'd only wish you could never meet someone like that again. isn't it great how a filmmaker's career can really get off the ground when they make an original film of their liking as opposed to some lame hollywoodized sequel? after 23 years, seven stills holds up as a modern classic that dares to tackle life's harsh realities, the depiction of two detectives investigation solving a horrific case, and the darkest realms that the human soul offers. if you're in to very gothic, psychological thrillers that talk about themes like the aforementioned, definitely give this a watch when you can. fincher has since gone on to make more worthwhile films that still inspire many to this day, so it looks like i've got quite a gold mine ahead of me.;17 August 2018;9;['alien', 'directorial', 'real', 'critical', 'huge', 'new', 'very', 'many', 'graphic', 'disturbing', 'neo', 'noir', 'engaging', 'more', 'serial', 'deadly', 'excellent', 'other', 'own', 'sharp', 'realistic', 'hard', 'actual', 'disgusting', 'fitting', 'necessary', 'strong', 'memorable', 'own', 'certain', 'new', 'certain', 'personal', 'sympathetic', 'whole', 'serial', 'horrific', 'smart', 'third', 'clever', 'evil', 'familiar', 'graphic', 'calm', 'rainy', 'sunny', 'suspenseful', 'right', 'grim', 'more', 'great', 'original', 'lame', 'modern', 'harsh', 'horrific', 'dark', 'human', 'gothic', 'psychological', 'aforementioned', 'more', 'worthwhile', 'many'];0.0891754471943151

187;garethcrook;i don't think i've seen this more than twice. once when it was released and once when i bought the dvd, back when i bought dvds. it's been over 20 years. se7en was always great, right from the get go. watching it now, it instantly feels like a classic. now time will do that, but only if it's truly worthy. freeman is at the top of his game. pitt rides his coattails admirably. even paltrow can't undo it or the oh so 90s industrial grunge titles with nin & bowie. spacey too absolutely nails the deranged creep role... not that that's surprising now i guess. fincher wastes no time in getting to it. somerset (freeman) and mills (pitt) are homicide cops in the rainiest town in america. somerset is the soon to retire meticulous expert. mills, the young buck full of energy and enthusiasm. this film works, as much for the string of crimes they're about to get embroiled in as for their relationship with one another. details are fun, gripping, but it's people, characters that make stories and films tick. don't get me wrong though. details are important here. we're invited to the investigation alongside s&m and the joy in se7en, if that's the right word, is the slow methodical release of those details, to the cops and to us. i suppose what makes se7en so widely loved though is it's easy. somerset holds our hand through it all. he's the brain cracking the leads, reading the books on the seven deadly sins. despite his weariness, this invigorates him and us. there's an understood structure here. we know there'll be seven murders. we know we won't be done until that happens. even with a flurry of hope right before sloth, our detective buddies are casting doubt. they've studied this guy, they know they're being lead, as we are, step by step, murder by murder. now i don't usually like gore and make no mistake se7en has it in spades. it's one grotesque scene after another. it works because of the strength of the narrative, but damn i struggle with sloth. probably because he's still alive. i remember watching that dvd commentary about the casting of michael reid mackay as the body for sloth, chosen in part because he was skinny. when it came to filming though, he turned up having lost even more weight feeling it would be more convincing. that somehow makes it feel even more terrifying. sloth is of course our first glimpse of the killer. a little tease that alludes the first time viewer. although not for long, se7en doesn't really make you work that hard. it's the perfect creepy crime thriller, but i think i'd forgotten how brutal it is. sloth, lust, all i can say is thank goodness for somerset and mills' theological conversations, they're the respite from this dark, cold and wet, dirty dangerous world. the pacing is perfect, the tone rides the slick production with the gritty visuals well. pitt is a little cartoony, but 25 years on it still packs a punch... and it's got a killer finale.;13 January 2021;10;['great', 'worthy', 'industrial', 'creep', 'surprising', 'rainiest', 'meticulous', 'young', 'full', 'much', 'about', 'fun', 'wrong', 'important', 'right', 'slow', 'methodical', 'easy', 'deadly', 'lead', 'grotesque', 'alive', 'skinny', 'more', 'convincing', 'terrifying', 'first', 'little', 'first', 'long', 'perfect', 'brutal', 'thank', 'theological', 'dark', 'cold', 'wet', 'dirty', 'dangerous', 'perfect', 'slick', 'gritty', 'little'];0.0409812409812409
188;Bogmeister;"this picture wants a piece of all of us and it gets it. it's relentless in what it depicts and i think it's one of those cases when the overall result somehow surpasses the original intent of the filmmakers, however great that intent was. it's an unflattering depiction of our society, a picture of the world which happens to be the point of view of a serial killer. his world is dark, but made so by the so-called human beings infesting it - all the banality, the apathy, the self-interest of our species is on full display here. the city in this film is in a state of perpetual decay; all we seem to see are rotting walls and buildings on the verge of crumbling. but this is just a surface corrosion, a reflection of what really ails all of us, which is the corruption of our souls. the serial killer is just a natural extension of society here. it comes as no surprise that he exists. we've made our hell on earth and the killer is just one of the elements existing to fall neatly into place in the center of it all. under the guise of a police procedural, director fincher and the screenwriter unveil this grim world for us. this was not a reworked draft which fell into the common pitfalls of a standard chase at the end or a last minute rescue. no, none of that same old hollywood stuff here. the nasty foreboding probably surfaces around the time we get to know a little about young detective mills (pitt) and his pretty wife (paltrow), through the eyes of hardened veteran detective somerset (freeman). it's hinted that the young couple have recently moved into the big city from a more rural area, into the typical squalid apartment lifestyle prevalent in this grimy city. maybe some alarm bells go off in the back of the audience's mind by this point: we don't think this couple should be in this city. what in the blazes are they really doing in this hellhole? why didn't they stay where they belonged, close by that high school where they met? pitt is pretty good as the less experienced cop, not too intelligent but struggling anxiously to be in the big leagues. he does ok, but the film belongs to freeman, who cannot strike a wrong note as the older weary policeman. this becomes the essential freeman role, that of a man who perhaps has seen too much in his lifetime, but his keen intelligence cannot allow him to simply give up and throw in the towel, no matter how close he gets to that point. freeman manages to convey a poetic disposition towards decency and civilization, as with most of his roles, but it's never more effective than here, when the entire world assails him with barbarism and anarchy. it's little surprise that much of the style of this film was copied over the next few years, including even the unusual credits sequence. the bulk of the film details the serial killer's masterpiece of murder, a pattern following the seven deadly sins. while interesting in itself and grisly in the depiction of murder as an artistic creation, we realize by the climax that it was all simply a preparation for the truly horrific crowning achievement of killer john doe's final act. it's a shock at the end which still sends shivers down my spine no matter how many times i watch it. perhaps meant for repeat viewings after the initial shock, the film serves to remind us we live (or just exist) in that chaotic charnel house we usually try not to think about. when all the surface gloss is peeled away and we gaze with unfiltered eyes at the unpleasant truth laid bare before us, we see john doe smirking at us, holding a box.";5 February 2006;10;['relentless', 'overall', 'original', 'great', 'unflattering', 'serial', 'dark', 'human', 'apathy', 'full', 'perpetual', 'serial', 'natural', 'grim', 'common', 'standard', 'last', 'same', 'old', 'nasty', 'little', 'young', 'pretty', 'young', 'big', 'rural', 'typical', 'squalid', 'grimy', 'close', 'high', 'good', 'experienced', 'intelligent', 'big', 'wrong', 'old', 'weary', 'essential', 'much', 'keen', 'close', 'poetic', 'most', 'effective', 'entire', 'little', 'much', 'next', 'few', 'unusual', 'serial', 'deadly', 'interesting', 'artistic', 'horrific', 'final', 'many', 'initial', 'chaotic', 'unfiltered', 'unpleasant', 'bare'];0.0576449275362318

192;david-meldrum;"jaws - a film that is often credited with launching what we now know as the summer blockbuster phenomenon - is justly famous for many things. it's a masterpiece of slowly building fear, in part because the shark itself is unseen by the viewer for a long, long time. david fincher's 1994 serial killer thriller takes inspiration from spielberg's game-changer in that respect; we don't see the face of the killer until 30 minutes before the film's end, at a moment of revelation of his own choosing. neither do we see the murders take place; in the film's memorable rain-sodden foot chase we only see his back; his face remains out of focus even when he's pointing a gun in brad pitt's face, deciding his fate. david fincher knows what most good horror films and thrillers have made apparent over the years: the unseen is more threatening and frightening than the known. rewatching this film for the first time in years in 2019, i'm struck especially by how normal the abnormal events it portrays are made to seem. a serial killer who bases his work on the seven deadly sins of christian tradition is nothing especially original; religious references are a familiar serial killer trope. fincher places this killing spree in the hands of an apparently ordinary figure - one who goes by the name of john doe (the name given by american police to an unidentified deceased male). as john doe himself says, as the film's unforgettable ending hoves into view: ""i'm not special; i've never been exceptional ... it's more comfortable for you to label me insane"". it's dangerous to quote the words of a killer as if they contain some kind of truthfulness, but this is the heart of the film: that evil is ubiquitous; it's in all of us. in each of the serial killer's victims, in the police chasing him, in the killer himself. in an age where the mass shootings that still stalk america are so routinely passed off as committed by someone with 'mental health problems', personal responsibility is avoided. the truth is we're all to blame; se7en holds a mirror up to us, and it's not a pleasant sight. to summarise what john doe says near the conclusion, we tolerate sin in ourselves and others because it's normal. it's this, it seems, that as the credits roll and those involved are left to live with the terrible consequences of their actions, that drives morgan freeman to utter the film's final words in voice over: ""ernest hemingway once wrote, 'the world is a fine place and worth fighting for.' i agree with the second part."" it's a brutal way to leave the story, and one which the makers of the film fought the studio to keep in, and no less powerful for it; though now, having seen many more films than i had on seeing se7en in the cinema, it seemed a tad too much of tell as opposed to show. this seems bleak - and it is, if we conclude that the fight of which hemingway is speaking is fruitless. for those who believe following jesus is worthwhile and eternally meaningful, it's a profoundly hopeful place to be; the world may not be as fine a place, as was intended; but there is a better way; and that better way will, eventually, be seen by all. it is a battle, though, and in the meantime many suffer. as long as any of us - like john doe in this film - take matters in to our hands, take the judging as something for us to execute, then there will be casualties. not least ourselves, but also those unfortunate enough to be in our orbit. all of which leads us to the kevin spacey question. with the revelations about his alleged sexual harassments and assaults, the question remains: should we watch his films? i have no easy answer here. i have been bullied to the point of suicide by someone who used to speak on big conference stages; i know how painful it was to see that person lauded by thousands when i knew different; i have forgiven the person, but still my stomach lurches with nausea and i'm wracked with anxiety if i see his name alluded to in a social media feed. i was sexually and physically abused as an adult by an adult; if i were to see her in a public role, it would be very hard to take. so i argue that spacey's victims must be given much consideration here; i would want the same for myself. with that in mind, i rewatched se7en for the first time since these allegations came out. as i reflected on the film's themes of the ubiquity of evil i found myself asking uncomfortable questions. if spacey's past work is not to be considered any more; if my bully's speaking is no longer to be listened to; if my abuser is never to have a relationship ... then what of me? i have not done any of these things - but if i believe sin and evil are ubiquitous (and i do), then that means i'm as guilty of sin as anyone else. i hope i own my sins and seek forgiveness, in large part through the regular discipline of confession; but i also know i am prone to err. let he who is without sin ... i do not have an answer, at least not yet. certainly it seems to me that spacey, and those like him, should not be widely spoken of or employed in the public eye - at the very least until fault has been admitted, responsibility taken and justice served. fittingly for this film, for now i remain with this tension unresolved. what remains true is that it's still a beautifully constructed, chilling and gripping thriller that haunts and shocks even after all these years; even when i know the point to which the story is heading. more culturally significant films still lay ahead of fincher, not least fight club; many would cite zodiac (2006) as his best film; the social network (2010) tells at least part of the story of one of the era's dominant themes. of course, we don't know what more is to come from him. se7en sets the template for his best work: morally complex, darkly thrilling, and directed with a flair that fits the story and the theme. if not quite as dynamic as i remember, it's still a film to be reckoned with, that ultimately asks us to choose between despair and hope.";9 April 2019;8;['famous', 'many', 'unseen', 'long', 'long', 'serial', 'own', 'memorable', 'sodden', 'good', 'apparent', 'unseen', 'threatening', 'frightening', 'first', 'normal', 'abnormal', 'serial', 'deadly', 'christian', 'original', 'religious', 'familiar', 'serial', 'ordinary', 'american', 'unidentified', 'deceased', 'unforgettable', 'special', 'exceptional', 'comfortable', 'insane', 'dangerous', 'ubiquitous', 'serial', 'mass', 'mental', 'personal', 'pleasant', 'normal', 'terrible', 'final', 'fine', 'worth', 'second', 'brutal', 'powerful', 'many', 'more', 'much', 'bleak', 'fruitless', 'worthwhile', 'meaningful', 'hopeful', 'fine', 'well', 'well', 'many', 'like', 'least', 'unfortunate', 'sexual', 'easy', 'big', 'painful', 'different', 'social', 'public', 'hard', 'much', 'same', 'first', 'uncomfortable', 'past', 'more', 'long', 'ubiquitous', 'guilty', 'large', 'regular', 'prone', 'least', 'public', 'least', 'unresolved', 'true', 'chilling', 'significant', 'many', 'good', 'social', 'least', 'dominant', 'more', 'good', 'complex', 'thrilling', 'dynamic'];0.0821746031746031

201;ronakkotian;david fincher's se7en isn't just your ordinary detective investigating murders and trying to catch the killer film. it's much more than that. what makes this movie really stand out from the rest is the impeccible direction by fincher and unpredicable nature of andrew kevin walker's script. se7en is the story of two detectives who investigate murders committed by a serial killer who uses each of the seven deadly sins to kill his victims. after alien 3, which fincher doesn't consider as his film, fincher creates a film that's jarring, disturbing and leaves a bad feeling in your stomach. his use of dark, ugly colours uplifts the depressing tone and the sound design makes se7en feel as close as possible to reality. this film isn't one to forget easily. what sticks with you is the film's underlying message about the sadistic and violent nature of our world. how crime is rampant within each city. all of this is shown visually which makes me admire the way david fincher helmed the movie. i loved how far se7en went in terms of its content. the aftermath of the murders are disgusting and give you the feeling of throwing up. the filmmakers didn't shy away from all the gore and this made me appreciate the film even more. in spite of the investigation taking up most of the film, there are some great character building moments as well. the scene taking place at a bar and the dinner scene strengthens the bond between our two leads and help us learn more about their personalities. these scenes made me genuinely care about pitt and freeman and that feeling made the ending seem even more shocking than what it originally was. aside from the aesthetics, the acting here is simply superb. morgan freeman and brad pitt create wonders together. their acting seems really believable and elevates every scene they're in. the killer, i won't mention who, surprised me when he showed up and for the short amount of time he's in the film, he steals the show. his motivation is well realised and well though out which makes his character fleshed out and someone who'll make you think deeply regarding the cruel state of the world. se7en is a total winner and one of the best mystery thrillers to have ever been made. everything is done to perfection and it wouldn't have been done without the direction, acting and screenplay. se7en will get under your skin and stay there for a really long time.;4 October 2019;10;['ordinary', 'more', 'impeccible', 'unpredicable', 'serial', 'deadly', 'alien', 'jarring', 'bad', 'dark', 'ugly', 'depressing', 'close', 'possible', 'underlying', 'sadistic', 'violent', 'rampant', 'disgusting', 'most', 'great', 'more', 'shocking', 'superb', 'believable', 'short', 'cruel', 'total', 'good', 'long'];-0.0952380952380952

203;braddugg;"calling this film 'terrific' would still be an understatement. engaging right from the word go, and shocking at the end, this film is an epitome of writing and shows that if a well-written script is directed well, then everything becomes great. david fincher was not a great well-known when he was making this. his first film alien 3 was supposedly panned by most people. then, he took on directing this cold blooded murder mystery film, and boy he did the job extremely well. the dialogues are extremely important and they have a lot of weight. it's rare to see a thriller filled with such nuances and have a deep meaning to words. the action is minimal and yet has a very high impact. the culmination or finale is a shocker. to say the least, the last 30 minutes are riveting and spine chilling. the nearly 130 minutes film becomes highly action packed after 90 minutes. in the last 40 minutes, actually, there is a lot of dialogue that's very provocative than action. yet. it's so very engaging that it takes me to the edge of seat each time i see this film thus, i call it as action-packed. i must say, i have seen this film multiple times, with multiple people as my viewing partners, and each time i like it more. so this film just keeps growing on me. the cinematography is amazing and so is the editing. these two departments technically are supreme. other departments did their job well too. of all, it's the direction that mattered. fincher gave us a glimpse what he is capable of with this supreme film, his next one was ""the fight club"" which is a cult in itself. it's a 5/5 for a great film that surpasses time to stand out as a classic thriller. i have not named the actual supreme character in this film, so go and find out who it is and what he does.";8 September 2016;10;['terrific', 'great', 'great', 'first', 'most', 'cold', 'blooded', 'important', 'rare', 'such', 'deep', 'minimal', 'high', 'least', 'last', 'riveting', 'spine', 'last', 'provocative', 'engaging', 'multiple', 'multiple', 'amazing', 'supreme', 'other', 'capable', 'next', 'great', 'classic', 'actual'];0.1827564102564102

211;Cinemaniac1984;se7en (also known as seven) is one of the best thrillers that everyone still talks about. it's certainly not a cliched movie nor does it use a recycled plot. it is well written with an original plot and the cast is brilliant. the entire movie is suspenseful and dark with its shock value added to keep audiences engaged. brad pitt, morgan freeman, gwyneth paltrow, r. lee ermey, john c. mcginley and kevin spacey are excellent. set in an unnamed city which rains for most of the movie, se7en is about a serial killer who's m.o. is based around the seven deadly sins. the seven deadly sins are gluttony, greed, sloth, envy, wrath, pride and lust. morgan freeman is detective lieutenant william somerset, a worn out homicide detective on the verge on retirement. somerset is partnered with newly transferred detective david mills played by brad pitt, an idealistic yet brash and hot headed police detective. somerset and mills are tasked with the investigation as the gruesome murders pile up one at a time. the serial killer who calls himself john doe, played by kevin spacey, leaves inconspicuous clues on the next victim as well as his identity. meanwhile david mills' wife tracy is unhappy with the move to the city and confides to somerset that she is miserable here. somerset and mills must race against time to find john doe as well as any further victims. brad pitt shows that he is a versatile actor and not just a pretty face as the brash detective david mills. morgan freeman is tailor made as the world weary detective lieutenant william somerset who wants to solve this case before his retirement. gwyneth paltrow makes her mark as david's wife tracy, who reluctantly agrees to transfer to the city with her husband. kevin spacey is chilling as the calculating john doe. kevin spacey's john doe earns a spot as one of the best villains of all time. r. lee ermey, famous for his role as gunnery sergeant hartman in full metal jacket, does a good job as the unnamed police captain. john c. mcginley also does a good job as the hard charging swat team leader california. se7en is notable for putting director david fincher on the map, making critics and audiences stand up and take notice that he is a force to be reckoned with. after his disastrous debut with alien 3 (1992), david fincher does a brilliant job with se7en. david fincher would later go on and direct further movies that would cement his reputation as a brilliant director with movies such as the game (1997), fight club (1999), panic room (2002), zodiac (2007), the curious case of benjamin button (2008), the social network (2010), the girl with the dragon tattoo (2011), and gone girl (2014). david fincher, along with writer andrew kevin walker and cinematographer darius khondji should be commended on a job well done for bringing to the screen a dark, gratuitous and grim thriller. the entire movie does not let up for one moment, and the shocking ending just smacks you in the face. the best part is that the ending is unexpected and nobody could tell you that they saw it coming. if anyone says that they could see it coming, they are full of it. the shocking ending in se7en is one that will stay with you for days, and it certainly did when i first saw it many years ago. although se7en is a grisly and gory movie that is certainly not for the faint hearted, it rightfully earns its spot as one of the best thrillers of all time, and definitely one of the most popular movies of the 1990's. 10/10.;18 March 2015;10;['good', 'cliched', 'recycled', 'original', 'brilliant', 'entire', 'suspenseful', 'dark', 'brad', 'excellent', 'unnamed', 'most', 'serial', 'deadly', 'deadly', 'worn', 'idealistic', 'brash', 'hot', 'headed', 'gruesome', 'serial', 'inconspicuous', 'next', 'unhappy', 'miserable', 'further', 'versatile', 'pretty', 'brash', 'weary', 'chilling', 'good', 'famous', 'full', 'good', 'unnamed', 'good', 'hard', 'notable', 'disastrous', 'alien', 'brilliant', 'further', 'brilliant', 'such', 'curious', 'social', 'dark', 'gratuitous', 'grim', 'entire', 'shocking', 'good', 'unexpected', 'full', 'shocking', 'many', 'grisly', 'faint', 'good', 'popular'];0.0609929078014184

214;lathe-of-heaven;"first off, i know that i'm gonna get grief and derision from most here because, i'm sorry, but i don't really think this film is the be all, end all that everyone thinks it is. yes, it is well made, directed, and acted; and the lighting is sharp which fits the nihilistic 'noir'ish mood. and, yes, it was indeed pretty much the first of it's kind which set a gritty, dark tone for crime films to come. fine... i really have no specific negatives about the movie. however... at the end of the day did i personally really find it that entertaining...? not really... yes, the unexpected ending is both shocking and dramatic, but does it honestly make sense...? ***spoilers keven spacey clearly and explicitly states the reasons why he has committed these murders: that people are doing all these very bad things everywhere all the time and people just don't care; so, he is setting 'the example' of what people should be doing to punish these 'sinners'. okay... now we are supposed to believe then that out of the blue he kills a completely innocent woman (who is also pregnant) which to me the sole purpose is for an (admittedly extremely dramatic and shocking) plot device to set up mills to kill him...??? come on... i don't buy it. it is totally contrary to the very motivation of kevin spacey's character. but yeah, what an ending, sure... *** end spoilers anyway, the question is, what do we find truly entertaining about a film? putting stylistic touches or technical competence aside (such as visual effects, special or moody lighting, excellent cinematography, sound design, etc.) to me it primarily is this: how engaging or absorbing is the plot or story? how does it carry us along as it develops? how involving and complex are the characters and how interesting is the interplay and relationships between them? now, these are just basics for most films. i realize that there are special genres or styles that we enjoy individually simply because we like those types of films (1950's sci fi, slasher horror films, ultra-cheeeeezy kung fu movies, etc.) but, with this film at the end of the day what do we have...? sure, we have this ghoulish, creepy, dark story of a killer who is killing by way of the 7 deadly sins. okay... characters...? well, yes, all the actors concerned do a fine job; no real complaints there. but...! how deep or complex are they? how fascinating are they really? how engaging and intriguing are their interactions? to me personally, i felt that both the plot and character development to be rather shallow and superficial. i mean, what do we really know about them? how deeply are we drawn into their lives and relationships? i'm sorry, but to me i really don't see a whole hell of a lot going on here other than a bunch of neatly lit, dark and somewhat moody scenes with little or no real substance. and the overall 'message' we are left with? the quite trite, common, and ultimately boring 'no one cares because the evil that people do is so arbitrary and horrible, so what's the point?' yeah, real depth there... so, yeah, the film is well put together and there's nothing really 'bad' about it per se; but, i do not feel myself that after all is said and done that you walk away from it with much of anything. there are darker and far more entertaining horror films out there; and there are also dark, gritty, and infinitely more complex and engaging crime films out there. films where afterward you actually feel like you have either been truly entertained by a story that makes you think and guess and wonder and also with characters who make you feel and care much more about them because they are portrayed in a better, fuller, and more complex way. so, do i like dark, ambiguous, moody films? you bet! do i like the dark, even nihilistic overtones of period film noir? absolutely! do i even like films with little substance but have tons of style and mood (a la david lynch, say) yes siree!!! but to me, this film, although of good quality, honestly strikes me as a 'one-note' simplistic film and i just do not quite buy into the ending at all; it is merely a completely nonsensical plot device to give us a slam-bang ending. i mean, just a random example that comes to mind, i've seen sandra bullock's crime film 'murder by numbers' like 3 times and i've fully enjoyed it each time. you have a main character that is extremely complex and engaging; you have antagonists that are thoroughly riveting and with a layered relationship that is completely fascinating. and, you have a story that as it unreels truly draws you into the psyche, feelings, and motivations of the characters. and this is just an off the top, fairly above average example; nothing earth shaking or anything, but just a simple example of what a movie is supposed to be. entertaining... but, i will say this though... it has to have probably the best opening credit sequence and background song ever!!! for this film though, i seriously doubt that i would ever really have the desire to sit down and watch it again... *** edit (2015.02.14) heh, i'm actually thinking about giving this another chance and watching it again... :) i'm curious if my impressions will still be the same...";15 August 2012;6;['sorry', 'sharp', 'nihilistic', 'first', 'kind', 'gritty', 'dark', 'fine', 'specific', 'unexpected', 'shocking', 'dramatic', 'bad', 'innocent', 'pregnant', 'sole', 'dramatic', 'shocking', 'contrary', 'very', 'sure', 'entertaining', 'stylistic', 'technical', 'such', 'visual', 'special', 'moody', 'excellent', 'engaging', 'complex', 'interesting', 'most', 'special', 'ultra', 'cheeeeezy', 'ghoulish', 'creepy', 'dark', 'deadly', 'fine', 'real', 'deep', 'complex', 'fascinating', 'engaging', 'intriguing', 'shallow', 'superficial', 'sorry', 'whole', 'other', 'dark', 'moody', 'little', 'real', 'overall', 'trite', 'common', 'boring', 'arbitrary', 'horrible', 'real', 'bad', 'much', 'dark', 'entertaining', 'dark', 'gritty', 'complex', 'more', 'well', 'complex', 'dark', 'ambiguous', 'moody', 'dark', 'nihilistic', 'little', 'siree', 'good', 'simplistic', 'nonsensical', 'random', 'main', 'complex', 'engaging', 'riveting', 'layered', 'fascinating', 'average', 'simple', 'good', 'curious', 'same'];-0.0080191798941798

217;lagudafuad;there is no crazier movie in the 90s that can cause to feel uneasy like the way se7en did. seven used imagery and your ability to imagine the insanity level of the perpetuator, to thrill you. the whole idea of using a gore scene to take majority of the movie's screen time and then satisfy the weird nature of some viewers was totally eliminated and the movie just focused mostly on character development which many may see as boring but it (the movie) still carried on to be a masterpiece. when you see the way the co-stars interact you will just bow in respect to their mastery of acting. morgan freeman played the old father figure and a detective who has seen too much of the streets and is so eager to retire and leave it all behind, while brad pitt played the younger cop, who is full of energy and is ready to jump off roof tops and chase down bad guys. the movie also made use of an array of supporting actors that are very good on their own to star in a film, actors like gwyneth paltrow, r. lee ermey, and kevin spacey, were also onboard in this thriller. seven features the newly transferred david mills (brad pitt) and the soon to retire william somerset (morgan freeman) as homicide detectives who become deeply involved in a case about a sadistic serial killer whose accurately planned murders corresponding to the seven deadly sins: gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath, pride, lust, and envy. the movie's name is seven but it is mostly characterized by se7en and it is a most see in many levels. the thrill that the movie brings and the chemistry of the co-stars is one that you will not just find lying around in any movie. seven became the first of 3 films that director david fincher and actor brad pitt did together (that is as of now 2013) the others were the fight club (1999) and the curious case of benjamin button (2008). the movie was a massive hit in the 90s and it was a both a critical and a commercial success as the 30 million budget brought in over 327 million in the box office. andrew kevin walker received a bafta award nomination for best original screenplay and the editor richard francis-bruce was nominated for an academy award for film editing. seven won the mtv movie award as the best film in its year. if you haven't seen seven before or you are in the mood of another fun thrilling ride as we chase down kevin spacey, then make time to see this movie again. www.lagsreviews.com;14 May 2013;7;['uneasy', 'whole', 'weird', 'many', 'boring', 'old', 'much', 'eager', 'young', 'full', 'ready', 'bad', 'good', 'own', 'involved', 'sadistic', 'serial', 'deadly', 'many', 'first', 'curious', 'massive', 'critical', 'commercial', 'good', 'original', 'good', 'fun'];0.1579545454545454

224;ivanmessimilos;seven is a movie that made fincher break into the hollywood elite and become a top director. but it was not easy to come by. before that, he only recorded music videos and then got the dream opportunity, to shoot alien 3, continuing the great franchise and succeeding two legendary directors: ridley scott and james cameron. however, he did not get his hands free for the movie, his studio got too involved in his work and failed to make the movie as he had imagined it. fortunately for him, but also for us movie lovers, the movie seven shot the way he envisioned it and as a result we got one of the best thrillers of the 90s. in this film, we see the director's clear signature, and he uses it in almost every subsequent movie, which is an atmosphere and an unexpected twist. the shop takes place in a nameless city, the atmosphere is gloomy, pessimistic, dark, the rain is constantly falling and the sun is not visible at all. the city is a complete replica of this kind of weather, this is a city where a woman is taught to shout a fire not help, where a robber stabs a victim in both eyes after a robbery, as we learn from the conversation of the protagonist. the lead roles are interpreted by the brilliant duo freeman and pitt as two detectives who are complete opposites. the first is an experienced elderly detective with no family, just before he retires and wants to leave this city. the other is a younger detective, married, confident and just moving out of a smaller town. what is one last case before retirement, the other is the first case in a new city. this is a very difficult, complicated and brutal case. we have a serial killer who tortures and kills a new victim every day who is associated with one of the 7 deadly sins. the killings are extremely bloody and brutal, in addition to the visual imagery, also later when describing their torture. the only breath of positive or optimism in the entire film is in the character of a younger detective's wife. fincher does one brilliant thing, there is no actor in the opening credits who plays the main villain, and we only get to know him after a good hour and a half of film time. in my humble and subjective opinion, all three actors have achieved one of the best roles in their film oeuvre, and given that all three top actors say so much. when this movie just came out it didn't quite get the top reviews, the reason lies in the violence in the movie and the bizarre murders. obviously, it took a certain number of years for this film to sit down and today this film deservedly bears the cult adjective. i also have to pay tribute to director fincher who completed the hattrick, making three perfect films in a row that only a few directors can boast. two years after this movie, the game, his most underrated film, is released, and then two years after that fight club, his perhaps best known movie, is released. seven is one of my favorite and best movies in general, not just a thriller and of course it gets a clean ten from me.;21 April 2020;10;['hollywood', 'top', 'easy', 'alien', 'great', 'legendary', 'free', 'good', 'clear', 'subsequent', 'unexpected', 'gloomy', 'pessimistic', 'dark', 'visible', 'complete', 'brilliant', 'duo', 'complete', 'first', 'experienced', 'elderly', 'other', 'young', 'married', 'confident', 'small', 'last', 'other', 'first', 'new', 'difficult', 'complicated', 'brutal', 'serial', 'new', 'deadly', 'bloody', 'brutal', 'visual', 'only', 'positive', 'entire', 'young', 'brilliant', 'main', 'good', 'humble', 'subjective', 'good', 'top', 'much', 'top', 'bizarre', 'certain', 'adjective', 'perfect', 'few', 'underrated', 'favorite', 'good', 'general', 'clean'];0.1908029878618114

240;GeorgeRoots;"""se7en"" is an exceptional thriller written by andrew kevin walker, and directed by the always more than impressive david fincher. the lack of creative freedom he had with ""alien3"" (1992) turned him off the idea of creating anymore, but the script they sent him managed to garner his enthusiasm. unfortunately they also sent him the script with the original ending they wasn't going to use, leading to fincher and brad pitt fighting for the script. it's a fascinating story i bring up because the film has rumours of many alternate endings, i implore you to do a little research on what might have been. i suppose i should also say if you're a fan of ""csi"" (2000-present), then you must have seen ""se7en"". the newly transferred david mills (brad pitt) and the retiring william somerset (freeman), are homicide detectives who become deeply involved in the case of a sadistic serial killer, whose meticulously planned murders correspond to the seven deadly sins. from the uniquely disturbing title sequence, to the overall shocking scenarios and finale. after watching this movie so many times now, i'm stunned at how engaging and refreshed i am to watch it all again and still find little things in the corners of each frame and shot composition. morgan freeman and brad pitt's chemistry and banter together is still as engaging, and how they haven't appeared in a film together since is beyond me. it was also the time rising star kevin spacey was on the scene, and even with the little screen time he has his presence is so memorable it's crazy. other than that, the brutal crime scenes still have the power to shock and make people feel faint. to me david fincher's work has this kind of style that began with ""se7en"", and over the years he's made it distinctly his own. nowhere is this more prominent than in the long bleak shots of the city in both night and heavy downpour, and for some reason part of me hearkens back to the urban street life painted in ""taxi driver"" (1976). the performances are solid, the set pieces are vivid and the script work and pacing is impeccable. if you haven't already seen it, stop what you're doing and definitely make it you're next viewing experience because it really is one of the 1990's absolute best. final verdict: often mimicked, yet never trumped. in a current wave of never ending shoddy horror movies, ""se7en"" is one of those rare cinematic experiences that will keep you enthralled all the way towards the credits. 10/10.";13 October 2014;10;['exceptional', 'more', 'impressive', 'creative', 'original', 'fascinating', 'many', 'alternate', 'little', 'involved', 'sadistic', 'serial', 'deadly', 'disturbing', 'overall', 'shocking', 'many', 'engaging', 'little', 'brad', 'little', 'memorable', 'crazy', 'other', 'brutal', 'faint', 'own', 'prominent', 'long', 'bleak', 'heavy', 'urban', 'solid', 'set', 'vivid', 'impeccable', 'absolute', 'good', 'final', 'current', 'shoddy', 'rare', 'cinematic'];0.0838963963963964

243;Dockelektro;"** warning some spoilers ahead** all-original serial killer movie with so much twists as a rollercoaster ride, the most remarkable thing about of this movie is being an absolute work of genius from such a young and unexperienced director. using all the old formulas, using all the old paces, using all the old actor's tecniques, the movie reinvents a world of cinema, and establishes an example. john mills, a young homicide detective, is a newcomer to the city where the veteran williams somerset has worked for years. mills is retiring, and he will be substitued by mills. somerset agrees with mills sticking around him for a week, seven days, during which he will supposedly give some tips of the trade to the mills. turns out, this week is also the week when a scarily methodical serial killer purges his obsession. as mills and somerset investigate the death of a titanically obese man, everything leads to the conclusion that it was a homicide. when a famous lawyer is killed and the word ""greed"" is written with his blood, they fear the worst. when they find the word ""gluttony"" written with grease at the obese man's death site, the worst is confirmed: there is a killer which acts according to the seven deadly sins. this will be the ultimate test to both an experienced man and a rookie youngster. and they will find out that everything they think they can foresee is actually wrong. they will find out that the man they are following is actually controlling them. making history, the movie relies on quasi-expressionist ways to transmit an entire mood: the weather never changing, contributing to a depressed view of a depressing world. the violence comes never from actions, but from the pictures, the shots are almost fixed, the time is never rushed, and the movie never gives up on itself, constructing, inventing, inovating, thrilling and scaring. this is not a light-hearted experience. this is an experience in the whole sense of the word. this movie is an unique oeuvre, and will stand the test of time by the way it is inimitable. a test of a director's talent, and a true cult movie which demands multiple viewings.";4 October 2001;10;['original', 'serial', 'much', 'remarkable', 'absolute', 'young', 'unexperienced', 'old', 'old', 'old', 'young', 'methodical', 'serial', 'obese', 'famous', 'bad', 'bad', 'deadly', 'ultimate', 'experienced', 'rookie', 'wrong', 'quasi', 'expressionist', 'entire', 'depressed', 'depressing', 'light', 'hearted', 'whole', 'unique', 'inimitable', 'true', 'multiple'];0.0928571428571428
244;jamesjustice-92;maybe it took me way too long to get to this movie but at least i was well prepared for what was about to come, not fully though. se7en is a story of two detectives, played stupendously by morgan freeman and brad pitt, who lead the investigation of serial murders based on seven deadly sins. for me personally there were never any certain things that are unlawful or forbidden - it is a matter of personal beliefs and values that each individual defines for himself - but this movie has made me look at those from a different point of view. in any case a murder, no matter what its nature and motive are, should not be tolerated and se7en gives you plenty of grains of wisdom to think about while you try and figure out the murderer's nature and motive. although at times very depressive and hard to comprehend the movie showcases a vast variety of emotions the main characters are going through - i'd like to especially point out brad pitt's character who you vouch for and empathize the most - at times it also shows signs of predictability and lazy writing but despite all that se7en is no doubt one of the greatest movies of all times in its genre.;23 April 2020;9;['long', 'least', 'prepared', 'about', 'brad', 'serial', 'deadly', 'certain', 'unlawful', 'personal', 'individual', 'different', 'depressive', 'hard', 'vast', 'main', 'lazy', 'great'];0.0262987012987012

""what's in the box?"" you'll have to watch the movie to find out! 7. it's purely entertaining. why else would i give it 10 stars? the movie is enjoyable and beloved by many! there's my 7 reasons. can you think of 7 reasons to not see it?";18 August 2018;10;['different', 'unique', 'serial', 'deadly', 'fat', 'such', 'favorite', 'critical', 'first', 'full', 'great', 'amazing', 'brad', 'social', 'other', 'entertaining', 'enjoyable', 'many'];0.2722222222222222

259;The_Amazing_Spy_Rises;you really can't say enough about se7en. it may have lacked critical acclaim (how this wasn't at least nominated for best director and best original screenplay is beyond me), but this film is easily in the top 10 films of the 1990's, and one could argue that it is the best. andrew walker pens a marvelous script that is brilliantly realized by david fincher, along with the help of 3 of the greatest actors of their generations. david mills (brad pitt) is a young up and coming detective who's just been transferred. his partner is william somerset (morgan freeman), who's on the verge of retirement. different though they may be, they must track a serial killer who is choosing his victims according to the seven deadly sins (gluttony, sloth, greed, lust, pride, envy, and wrath). what makes se7en so excellent in my mind is how incredibly real it is. there's the gritty feel to the film, and fincher uses great shots and locations to effectively pass on his intentions to us. the film is one of the most suspenseful i've ever seen, and that is also attributed to fincher, not to mention a wonderful musical score. andrew walker's script is fantastic. easily one of the best of all time. it's such a simple concept, but the creation of the characters and the depth and development of each one is one truly remarkable quality of the script. the best quality of course, is the unpredictable, unorthodox, and scary ending that will make your stomach sink like a weight. the cinematography and editing are brilliant as the film is fluid and seamless. technically, this film is perfect. the acting...well, anyone who's ever said brad pitt is for show obviously hasn't seen this or fight club. he's wonderful as the motivated, yet rash and sarcastic david mills. it's a great character arc, and pitt plays the complex character with heart and ease. morgan freeman...what can you say? he's morgan freeman, so he's excellent. once again, a well written character that the actor takes and makes his own. freeman is magnificent again. of course, our 2 detectives are great, but the true stand out of the film is the actor who plays the killer, whose inclusion in the film was kept secret until the day of release. don't worry, i haven't spoiled anything. he gives a magnificent, yet haunting and disturbing performance that will stick with you for day after day. it is one of the best villainous performances of all time. the final confrontation is spectacular because of him. all in all, se7en is a must see if you are a movie fan. it's one of the best films i've ever seen, and you'd be a fool to miss this classic. as terrifying as it is suspenseful, se7en is a thriller that will stick with you, an experience you'll never forget. i cannot recommend this movie more. 10/10 --spy;12 November 2007;10;['enough', 'critical', 'least', 'nominated', 'good', 'good', 'original', 'top', 'good', 'marvelous', 'great', 'young', 'different', 'serial', 'deadly', 'excellent', 'real', 'gritty', 'great', 'suspenseful', 'wonderful', 'musical', 'fantastic', 'good', 'simple', 'remarkable', 'good', 'unpredictable', 'unorthodox', 'scary', 'brilliant', 'fluid', 'seamless', 'perfect', 'wonderful', 'motivated', 'rash', 'great', 'complex', 'excellent', 'own', 'magnificent', 'great', 'true', 'secret', 'magnificent', 'disturbing', 'villainous', 'final', 'spectacular', 'good', 'terrifying', 'suspenseful', 'more'];0.3784420289855073
260;hasosch;"although i agree with the majority of the critics that ""se7en"" (1995) is one of the outstanding horror movies of our time, i still have to warn to overrate it. it is definitely not a masterpiece like, e.g., murnau's ""nosferatu"", where you will remember the first appearance of max schreck in the gate with a far remote camera until your last day. first, i do not understand why it was considered necessary to put a subsidiary story into the main story. ""se7en"" has a default dramaturgy, due to the 7 sins, as, e.g. ""the lodger"" (2007) has a default structure, due to the killings of jack the ripper, not to mention the ""zodiac"" killer movies, etc. why was it necessary to put the character of brad pitt besides the character of morgan freeman? both are in the rank of detectives - the older is a highlight, the younger a zero - the older stands above marriage, the younger is unable to be a good husband and future father and meanwhile enjoys his three of four dogs. but not enough with that: the writer of ""se7en"" considered it also important to build in a cross-relation, when paltrow's character contacts freeman without letting know pitt. this one scene as well as their common gathering for a dinner are without any sense for the story, it is painful for freeman's character - and for the real audience. second, after having watched this movie a second time, it has lost all of its initial effects. this has nothing to do with the fact that the highlights of the killings as well as the killer are known now. movies like ""se7en"" or ""silence of the lambs"", in opposition to, e.g., ""the ring"", have simply not enough glue to stick so in your head so that you can watch enjoy ""nosferatu"", ""it's a wonderful life"", ""my cousin vinnie"", ""as good as it gets"", only to mention so few. what is it that makes a film stick in your head? what is this semiotic glue that makes the film go on in your head when you leave the cinema or take out the dvd from the player? if someone would find the mechanism, it would be easy to construct ideal movies that would guaranteed be block-buster hits.";4 October 2009;10;['outstanding', 'nosferatu', 'first', 'remote', 'last', 'necessary', 'main', 'necessary', 'brad', 'old', 'young', 'old', 'young', 'unable', 'good', 'future', 'enough', 'important', 'know', 'common', 'painful', 'real', 'second', 'initial', 'enough', 'nosferatu', 'wonderful', 'good', 'few', 'semiotic', 'easy', 'ideal'];0.1403846153846153

262;brianberta;this is one of the most horrifying movies ever made. but it doesn't just consist of violence. it has amazing performances, tense scenes, and a nail-biting finale which you won't ever forget for a very long time. 2 detectives try to hunt down a psychopath as he kills people in grotesque ways based around the seven deadly sins. this movie contains several memorable scenes which have the tendency to knock you off guard. besides the ending, another amazing scene is when they investigate the sloth victim. the gore is amazing but we get the jumpscare of our lives in it. i'm not going to spoil it though because otherwise i'll ruin it. many people will agree that the ending is the best part by far. it is tense and suspenseful and it is completely unpredictable. it is one of the most memorable movie endings by far. also, the acting is amazing also. in my opinion, kevin spacey and brad pitt both give one of their best performances yet. morgan freeman's also gives as amazing performance and it is rivaled only by his performance in the shawshank redemption. the acting worked real well because this movie did a great job with its choice of casting. fincher probably looked at previous works of freeman, pitt, and spacey's roles and he knew that they would be perfect for these roles and his casting choices really paid off. as much i want to give this movie a 10, there are a few scenes which i felt carried on a bit too long or were more slower-paced than the rest of the movie. there weren't too much that bothered me too an extensive degree though. however, i do think that this would've been a masterpiece if it weren't for those few scenes. nobody thought much of fincher when he directed alien 3 and he was originally dismissed as just another style over substance director. however, he looked at the mistakes that movie made and he showed moviegoers with this movie that he is a talented director. since then, he has made several more amazing movies (especially fight club) and he is now one of the more appreciated directors working today. in conclusion, se7en is a near perfect movie. sure, the pacing can be a bit slow at times but this is still an amazing crime drama and i think that this is one of the best crime movies ever made. it will keep you on the edge of your seat the entire time and it contains one of the best finales to a movie ever. i understand why some people disliked this movie but none of the reasons affect my opinion of this movie and i think that it is a must-watch for everyone as long as you don't mind realistic violence and gore.;30 August 2015;8;['horrifying', 'amazing', 'tense', 'long', 'grotesque', 'deadly', 'several', 'memorable', 'amazing', 'amazing', 'many', 'good', 'tense', 'suspenseful', 'unpredictable', 'memorable', 'amazing', 'good', 'amazing', 'great', 'previous', 'perfect', 'few', 'long', 'much', 'extensive', 'few', 'much', 'alien', 'talented', 'several', 'amazing', 'appreciated', 'near', 'perfect', 'slow', 'amazing', 'good', 'entire', 'good', 'realistic'];0.2359649122807017

(skillfully played by morgan freeman) and his young upstart sidekick (brad pitt) manage to unravel the case, but at huge personal cost to both. its difficult to know where to start when praising such a brilliant film. but to begin with some of fincher's old alien3 directing habits are carried into this film. most of the story is set in miserable, dank, wet and gloomy places - but this isn't a complaint but only adds to the foreboding that awaits us. you feel as if you're swimming in a pool of slime trying to keep afloat as fincher moves from one scene to another, never letting the viewer, or indeed the main characters time to take a breath. fortunately fincher doesn't go over the top showing us every murder in explicit detail. he knows we are intelligent enough to work out in our own fetid imaginations what the camera doesn't allow us to see. but having said that, the corpses that we do see would make even dirty harry choke! editing & lighting also go hand in hand with the cinematography, so too does the splatter-punk music score that surrounds the start & finish of the film. in fact its like a conspiracy against the audience - all the unit directors of the film crew (art, sound,2nd unit, editing, score etc) have ganged up with fincher to give the viewer a real hard time - a feeling of truly being out there with freeman & pitt. morgan freeman is, as always, a pleasure to watch. he seems to have hit all the right moves these last few years, especially in the underrated shawshank redemption. his character is very slow, methodical, patient...all those things his partner, brad pitt, lacks so glaringly, pitt is perfect for the young brash detective. the two cops remind me of reading a book - freeman plays the cop page by page by page never wanting to cut a corner or skip a detail; while pitt plays his character chapter by chapter, ever moving forward, not having the patience to look at the minute details on each page...and boy does he get the early morning wakeup call at the end of the film!!!! but to my mind, kevin spacey, who plays jon doe, is the real king player here. critically acclaimed in the usual suspects, la confidential & glengarry glen ross), spacey pulls off yet another masterclass act here. he is not a madman or psychopath (as brad pitt feels he is) even though his crimes would make you think otherwise. instead he is just a well-educated citizen who has simply had enough of seeing society fall apart outside his front door, and the police & the courts are seen as being impotent to do anything about it. spacey knows what fincher wants from his character and plays it with relish; similar to john malkovich's mitch leary character in clint eastwood's in the line of fire. this isn't a glamour film that will make you glow & smile when you leave the theatre. this film wants to crush you with the sordid reality of what is actually happening to us all out there - a film that tells it as it is, and not as hollywood wants us to view the world from their glittering perspective. se7en is a film where other detective films should be judged. it's unforgiving & relentless but a visual masterpiece for all that...and as for the ending....well..... *****/*****";18 June 2000;9;['unfortunate', 'alien', 'complex', 'typical', 'average', 'enough', 'present', 'steep', 'deadly', 'grisly', 'young', 'huge', 'personal', 'difficult', 'brilliant', 'old', 'most', 'miserable', 'wet', 'gloomy', 'main', 'explicit', 'intelligent', 'own', 'fetid', 'dirty', 'real', 'hard', 'right', 'last', 'few', 'underrated', 'slow', 'methodical', 'patient', 'perfect', 'young', 'minute', 'early', 'real', 'usual', 'masterclass', 'enough', 'front', 'impotent', 'similar', 'other', 'visual'];-0.0044642857142857

283;GirishGowda;"i didn't know what i was getting into when i sat down to watch this movie along with my friend. he had brought the dvd to my home and as he is a hardcore fan of brad pitt, he has bought almost every major hit movie of pitt and since i am also a fan, we both watched it together. i thought it would be a cool movie like other pitt films, but it was so dark and has so much more than other films of this genre. detective william somerset (morgan freeman) is on his last week in duty and he's all set to retire when the case of a strange death is made his responsibility to solve. though all others think that it was a psycho who was responsible for the death, somerset has his doubts, he thinks that the murderer is simply a clever and disgusted man who is trying to rid the society of evil. in many ways, his and the killer's view about the degrading society is alike, except that somerset wants to leave the city for the country life and the killer is taking action. enter detective david mills (brad pitt), the young and dynamic sleuth who has a positive view on the society, and he is made the partner to somerset. then onwards, there are more disgusting, shocking deaths with the seven sins as its identity. the seven sins are - gluttony, greed, sloth, envy, pride, lust and wrath. while mills believes the killer is an insane person, somerset tells him that he is a very clever, normal man and nowhere near insane with his precise killings and no clues to be found anywhere. the killer is a john doe (played brilliantly in a cameo role by kevin spacey) and it takes every last bit of somerset's and mills willpower to not get carried away by the magnitude of the brutal, methodical killings. tracy mills (gwyneth paltrow) is the wife of mills and they are very much in love. will the detectives be able to stop this killer who claims himself to be a servant of god and who will bear the brunt of this maniac's insanity eventually - the society or the detectives? david fincher is at the helm of this amazing film. this could have been a routine cop-killer story, but he does not even step into the tired and old hollywood cliches and is not afraid to make this a dark, unique and depressing tale about the human life. also, he does so in a very powerful and clever way. i was racking my brains to figure out who the killer was, as in films like these, they would show the killer beforehand. and in the end, it was true; the killer had come in contact with the detectives. morgan plays the old and more worldly wise man, rather in contrast to pitt's character who is a hot-head at times. no matter how insanely talented pitt is, the press always seems to give more importance to his charming looks and relationship with jolie (back then, it was jennifer aniston). tracy is genuinely portrayed by gwyneth paltrow. she played a major part in bringing mills and somerset together. i loved her scene where she introduces each other. though she didn't get enough screen-time to have satisfied me, i got over it as the ending was so emotional and i cried (i am a straight guy and i am not ashamed to say that i cried) when pitt finds out what was in the box. i could see that one coming a couple of minutes before the movie got to it, but it doesn't mean i didn't get emotional at that point. i was hoping against hope that it wasn't what i was thinking. but, it was and i cried. don't see this if you can't handle brutal death scenes (although they show only the aftermath of the death, it is still nauseous) and are easily bored when things are not non-stop action. but, the screenplay is one of the best i have seen in this genre. also, the colouring layout of the movie is dark, everything is subdued and always raining, except save for the climax which is bright and hot, which served as an irony of sorts and it was wonderful. when john doe tells mills to become wrath, i got chills running up and down my spine. i still consider fight club to be the best pitt-fincher movie, but i can't ignore this brilliantly made movie. though not everyone will like this film (case-in-point, my brad pitt fan friend), because of the dark overtone, i loved it as it isn't flashy and predictable like most movies of this genre, and actually was very brilliant. 10/10";2 May 2010;10;['hardcore', 'major', 'cool', 'other', 'dark', 'more', 'other', 'last', 'strange', 'responsible', 'clever', 'disgusted', 'many', 'degrading', 'young', 'dynamic', 'positive', 'disgusting', 'shocking', 'insane', 'clever', 'normal', 'precise', 'cameo', 'last', 'brutal', 'methodical', 'able', 'amazing', 'routine', 'tired', 'old', 'afraid', 'dark', 'unique', 'depressing', 'human', 'powerful', 'clever', 'true', 'old', 'wise', 'hot', 'talented', 'more', 'charming', 'major', 'other', 'enough', 'emotional', 'straight', 'ashamed', 'emotional', 'brutal', 'nauseous', 'bored', 'non', 'stop', 'good', 'dark', 'bright', 'hot', 'wonderful', 'good', 'pitt', 'pitt', 'dark', 'flashy', 'predictable', 'most', 'brilliant'];0.0600378787878787

285;freaky_dave;a depressing yet effective thriller with a completely shocking and disturbing ending that will have you thinking about it for a long time. yes that is the simplest way to explain david fincher's seven. seven is a thinking film that will have one questioning society and life in general. kevin spacey plays john doe, a serial killer, and he is perfect in the role. he chooses each one of the victims because they are guilty of each one of the seven deadly sins which include gluttony, sloth, pride, greed, lust, envy, and wrath. what he does to these people is downright horrible and utterly disgusting, but he believes that he is doing god's work by using passages out of books like dante's inferno and others. we as the viewers are disgusted by what he does, but during his long monoloque near the end we can't help but wonder that what he's doing seems justifiable in a lot of ways. the detectives on the case are detective somerset (morgan freeman) and detective mills (brad pitt). both are also great in their roles. they are hot on john doe's trail. one, mills, the new kid on the block, does his job because he wants to improve things to make the world a safer place. the other, somerset, is much older and has a very cynical outlook on life. somerset's opinion is that he just wants to retire and escape from all the madness because he feels nothing will ever get better. both of their personalities collide, but they continue to work together to solve the case. gwneth paltrow plays tracy mills. she is mill's wife and hates that they have moved to the city. her part in the movie is a small one and a minor role, but it becomes much more important then anybody could've ever suspected. this movie, splendidly directed by david fincher, is dreary, dark, and depressing, but it is a very well made film which has some very strong points that it wants to make. it is well paced and filled with subtle moments that will lead to a very strong impact at the end. i didn't care to much for fincher's alien 3 because of how depressing it was, but that was a franchise that had already been started and was never really expected, in my opinion anyway, to take the darker turn that it does. with seven we are not making a sequel, so it is a whole new ball game, and this time fincher's skill shines through. the ending, as i said above is completely appalling, but it is never completely unexpected, and that is because of the smaller subtleties during the movie's running time which helps prepare us for what happens. i was never caught off guard by what finally happens, and that is why this film doesn't quite get a perfect rating. however, if anybody was to ask me if they should see this movie i would say hell yes. i would also tell them to be prepared for some very nasty scenes which will make your blood run cold.;16 October 2006;9;['depressing', 'effective', 'shocking', 'disturbing', 'long', 'simple', 'general', 'serial', 'perfect', 'guilty', 'deadly', 'horrible', 'disgusting', 'long', 'justifiable', 'somerset', 'great', 'hot', 'new', 'safe', 'other', 'old', 'cynical', 'well', 'small', 'minor', 'important', 'dreary', 'dark', 'depressing', 'strong', 'paced', 'subtle', 'strong', 'much', 'alien', 'depressing', 'dark', 'whole', 'new', 'appalling', 'unexpected', 'small', 'perfect', 'nasty', 'cold'];-0.1018141945773524

298;sandnair87;"se7en is a nerve-jangling thriller, hauntingly shot by visionary director david fincher, who crafts one of the most iconic films of all time. se7en tells the tale of a grisly serial killer who is twisted on delivering a sermon against modern depravity. he murders his victims to atone for the sins he deems them to have committed; his crimes echo the seven deadly sins namely gluttony, greed, sloth, envy, pride, wrath and lust. tracking this gruesome killer (played with a quiet insanity that makes your flesh crawl, by an actor par excellence no spoilers here!) is a cliche pair of cops. there's the jaded veteran detective lieutenant somerset (morgan freeman who brings great depth and dignity to the part) who is in the last week of his employ with the police department. partnering him is a young, eager-to-kick-some-evil-butt cop detective mills (brad pitt whose callowness works perfectly for his character). after killing an overweight man by force-feeding him to death in the name of gluttony and bleeding to death a lawyer for greed, the anonymous killer is now turning his attention to the five remaining deadly sins. as the two men investigate, the gulf between their respective world-views begins to inform everything about how they respond to the savagery of these crimes. it is impossible to deny the potency and artistry with which fincher executes the material. although very little of each murder is shown, the director expertly allows suggestion to lead the appalled viewer towards the truly cataclysmic climax. fincher's sepia-toned gloom successfully lends the film the knock-out punch it intends to. purposely draining his landscapes of color, and setting all the tense action against rain-washed streets and under-lit interiors, fincher evokes an atmosphere of nightmarish proportions as he unfolds a gripping tale of urban horror. se7en is riveting in a gut-twisting way. it plays out at an engaging pace destined to entrance you with its abject horror. the film is as dark and brutal as a film can be, without showing much actual violence. most of the stuff in the film is implied, but it's so damn disturbing that you feel like you actually saw it. and that is the beauty of se7en!";24 March 2015;10;['visionary', 'iconic', 'grisly', 'serial', 'modern', 'deadly', 'gruesome', 'quiet', 'jaded', 'great', 'last', 'young', 'eager', 'evil', 'overweight', 'anonymous', 'deadly', 'respective', 'impossible', 'little', 'cataclysmic', 'tense', 'nightmarish', 'urban', 'abject', 'dark', 'brutal', 'much', 'actual', 'most', 'disturbing'];-0.1451388888888888

300;arthera09;this is a fantastic movie and i cannot really find anything wrong with it, but in the end it is just a crime drama. the one thing that sets it apart from the rest of the crime dramas is the excellent cast and one of the bleakest ending ever caught on film. fincher really did do a fantastic job of putting together a well-paced and surprisingly thought provoking movie. morgan freeman is the constant in the movie that never allows the viewer to lose hope that the situation is not hopeless, while keeping the viewer cynical enough to make the city that they live in a land of misguided hopeless souls. freeman has such brevity that is really just amazing to watch him. pitt on the other hand does a very respectful job of being the young cop with ambitions of saving the world and has places well across from the jaded freeman. spacey of course played his character spot on and when he gives himself on is probably the creepiest thing in the movie because at this point you have no idea what he is up to, but you know that is is in total control of the situation. i love how fincher choose to keep the city raining and lit most of the scenes to emphasize the dark. this matched the darkness nature of the film perfectly. the fact that the last scenes was in the bright day light just made it that more shocking. one can tell that a lot of care when into presenting the world to the viewer in a way that matched the themes perfectly. i think that car ride provided a great forum for us to get to know john doe even though we only spend a few minutes we seems to know him so well. one can see mills going down hill and is losing his footing on the moral high ground. it is extremely well played and i love how summerset comes off as being a match for him. in a way i see summerset and doe as being similar, with the main difference of doe being crazy. i think this is an extremely well done and smart entry of crime dramas that really flips some of the conventions in a way that can be surprising. the fact that they do not catch the killer, but the killer turns himself in and that fact that the cops lose. they do not save anyone's lives and they fall into the trap that doe set up for them. i very much enjoyed this film and it was paced and put together in a very effective way.;4 June 2011;9;['fantastic', 'wrong', 'excellent', 'bleakest', 'fantastic', 'constant', 'hopeless', 'cynical', 'misguided', 'hopeless', 'such', 'amazing', 'other', 'respectful', 'young', 'jaded', 'creepy', 'total', 'most', 'last', 'bright', 'shocking', 'great', 'few', 'moral', 'high', 'similar', 'main', 'crazy', 'smart', 'surprising', 'effective'];0.1228130511463845
301;Camoo;"seven is a classic at this point, but it never started as such. there was a lot of pushback from the studio, from actors who turned down the lead roles, deeming the script 'too dark'; and from the marketers at new line, who understandably didn't know how to sell such a horrific enterprise to the masses. the reality is that this film is no more or less violent than a zillion schlock horror movies that preceded it - it's just that it is so well done, so effective in its narrative, and so psychologically devastating that the resulting film is more horrific in scope than most anything ever made before it, or since. it seems the jury is still out on where this film takes place. new york and chicago have been posited, but there are no discernible landmarks to tie it to either of these cities. philly maybe. i think there's nowhere else such a dark, sordid tale could be taking place other than where they shot it: los angeles, and there are street signs which don't even bother to hide the true location. sure, the film is drenched in perpetual downpour rather than the typical sunny cali atmosphere, but this movie isn't as much about the reality of a location as it is about the evil it documents; something which could only be illustrated with a heightened, dank atmosphere, where the characters seem to all be drowning in an encroaching sorrow. david fincher's early whack as a director produced something original and sublime. the cliche buddy cop film is turned on its head by having seasoned detective somerset (morgan freeman) and his green partner mills (brad pitt) do away with their opposing roles early on, as they simply sink into procedural necessity. the detective characters become equals much faster than is expected, as they are thrown into a task of having to unravel the crimes of a certain john doe (? you all know by now who this is), hopefully before the serial killers 'masterpiece' is concluded, and more victims are tallied. of course, this doesn't happen. what remains most haunting about this film is how uncompromisingly dark it is, how gritty it was allowed to be, how hopelessness is turned into an elegiac statement on evil, loss and death. the score of the film, by howard shore, is less remembered than the opening sequence by trent reznor - which spurred a great collaboration between a director and a musician - but shore's contribution here shouldn't be discounted, as it perfectly captures the mournfulness of this story, and and the inevitably of its conclusion. se7en is the movie which proved david fincher is an exceptional filmmaker. he has made some pretty hardcore films. se7en remains his grittiest, most memorable, most uncompromising. thankfully the studio and marketing guys didn't get their way, or it could have ended up just like a million other detective movies.";9 December 2021;10;['such', 'dark', 'new', 'horrific', 'violent', 'effective', 'devastating', 'horrific', 'most', 'discernible', 'other', 'true', 'perpetual', 'typical', 'sunny', 'much', 'early', 'original', 'sublime', 'green', 'procedural', 'certain', 'serial', 'more', 'haunting', 'dark', 'gritty', 'elegiac', 'remembered', 'trent', 'great', 'inevitably', 'exceptional', 'hardcore', 'gritty', 'memorable', 'uncompromising', 'other'];0.0010687229437229
302;Torgo_Approves;"with this movie and 1999's ""fight club"", david fincher cemented his status as *the* most visually creative director of the 90's, and one of the most original, inventive and compelling storytellers working in hollywood. if ""fight club"" was the ultimate theme park ride for repressed white collar slaves, ""se7en"" is the haunted house. while not a horror movie per say, it is infinitely more frightening, emotionally scarring and disturbing than anything that george a. romero, dario argento or hideo nakata could possibly offer. from its first frame, ""se7en"" sets its tone with fincher's bleak visuals, moody weather and howard shore's slow, atmospheric music (you won't believe this is the guy who would go on to make the unforgettable lord of the rings score). it's a visual masterpiece, throwing you into an anonymous, dark city which seems to be the nirvana of the dregs of society. in the middle of the city's violent everyday chaos an invisible john doe has set a horrible plot in motion, his goal to punish seven unrelated people for their crimes, turning their own sins against them (gluttony, greed, sloth, pride, lust, envy, and wrath). working methodically, patiently and intelligently, doe builds at his murder masterwork, piece by piece, slowly drawing police detectives somerset and mills into the web. somerset (played brilliantly by morgan freeman whom i usually detest) is the hardened, cynical veteran who's about to retire, mills (brad pitt, exceptionally good) is the rookie who's troubled by his own naive personality and hot temper. the ""unlikely partners"" thing might sound cliched by now, but trust me, you won't even notice. what makes the movie so compelling are the fantastic performances from a diverse cast, an utterly unpredictable, frighteningly sadistic plot, intelligent scriptwriting by andrew kevin walker, and david fincher's superb direction, which is unlike anything you've seen before. fincher shows an uncanny ability to keep the viewers at the edge of their seats, creating, through the use of visuals and music alone, an angsty, forceful sense of unease which lasts until the film's shocking climax. anyone who thought brad pitt was all good looks and no talent will have to take it back after seeing him convince beautifully as mills, and freeman's character is, for once, not the sugar-sweet know-it-all he's typecast himself as. gwyneth paltrow is also good as mills' wife. but it is john doe who leaves the lasting impression - the uncredited actor (whose name i won't mention, in tradition with the movie) gives a monotonous yet completely spellbinding performance and you find yourself understanding and sympathizing with his motives far more than you'd want to admit. se7en is grisly, sick and depressing, although most of the horrific violence is only implied, never shown. however, the aftermath of the murders - especially the revoltingly sadistic sloth - is often enough to make you lose your lunch. this is a feel-bad movie and it's proud of it. you cannot watch it expecting another ho-hum, by-the-numbers thriller in the vein of, say, ""the sentinel"". ""se7en"" is depressing, frightening, shocking, fascinating, original, and it features enough talent acting-, direction- and script-wise to fill a hundred sentinels or domestic disturbances. bring some friends with strong stomaches and watch it - if you dare. but make sure you'll be able to sleep with the lights on.";28 December 2006;10;['creative', 'original', 'inventive', 'compelling', 'ultimate', 'white', 'haunted', 'frightening', 'disturbing', 'first', 'bleak', 'moody', 'slow', 'atmospheric', 'unforgettable', 'visual', 'anonymous', 'dark', 'violent', 'everyday', 'invisible', 'horrible', 'unrelated', 'own', 'hardened', 'cynical', 'about', 'good', 'own', 'naive', 'hot', 'unlikely', 'compelling', 'fantastic', 'diverse', 'unpredictable', 'sadistic', 'intelligent', 'superb', 'uncanny', 'forceful', 'shocking', 'good', 'sweet', 'good', 'uncredited', 'monotonous', 'sick', 'depressing', 'most', 'horrific', 'sadistic', 'enough', 'bad', 'proud', 'ho', 'depressing', 'frightening', 'shocking', 'fascinating', 'original', 'enough', 'wise', 'domestic', 'strong', 'sure', 'able'];0.0288919413919413

306;Jamie_Seaton;this film is so beautifully made. it has to probably be the best mystery thriller of all time. director david fincher is nothing short of a magician masterclass behind the camera. he has made other classic masterpieces such as zodiac, fight club, the game, the curious case of benjamin buttons, panic room and the third instalment of the alien series. he really is one of the greatest directors ever and i hope he keeps making gems like these in the future. brad pitt (fight club, inglorious basterds, meet joe black) who is a fincher favourite seeing as though he's been in a few of his films plays a cop who has transferred to take morgan freemans (shawshank redemption, lucky number slevin, million dollar baby, unforgiven) place as he is retiring at the end of the week. but before freeman's hope to end the week nice and quietly comes to a halt when a murder is committed. pitt and freeman both go to investigate and eventually they realise that the killer is murdering his victims based on the seven deadly sins (gluttony, greed, envy, sloth, wrath, lust and pride). the film is so amazingly put together. one little problem with this which isn't really a problem to be honest is that the film should be on longer, its a classic film that really should be on for at least two and a half hours instead of only being on for two. the music and the camera angles are so stunning. some of the scenes are very shocking and will leave you thinking for many days after watching it. the chemistry of morgan freeman and brad pitt is nothing short of remarkable. they both should of won oscars for there roles in this. gwyneth paltrow (a perfect murder) plays a good role as pitts girl. one role that really was breathtaking was kevin spacey (the usual suspects, american beauty, superman returns) as the killer. he should of won an oscar for that role too. the ending to this film has to be one of the most shocking and most powerful i've ever seen. it really hits you like a wave and doesn't let go until the end credits. what a masterpiece this movie is. i'm so glad this film is in the top 30 films of all time because this film is definitely worth it. if you love this film you should try another fincher classic called zodiac. zodiac is one on the greatest serial killer films i've ever seen. this film is going to remembered forever and not many films will surpass its brilliance.......... a masterpiece............ 10/10............j.d seaton;30 October 2009;10;['good', 'short', 'other', 'classic', 'such', 'curious', 'third', 'alien', 'great', 'brad', 'inglorious', 'finch', 'favourite', 'few', 'lucky', 'unforgiven', 'nice', 'deadly', 'little', 'honest', 'classic', 'stunning', 'shocking', 'many', 'brad', 'short', 'remarkable', 'perfect', 'good', 'usual', 'american', 'shocking', 'powerful', 'glad', 'top', 'worth', 'great', 'serial', 'many'];0.2130376344086021

(not the story itself necessarily). the episode in the library, illustrated with classical music - or the invasion of the murderer's home base with its super-dark and sadistic vibe (the led cross on the wall...wow wow wow!) or the worn-down flat of the more dead than alive victor with tons of paper-trees (used for cars and better smell)... these are images that will always stay with me. they really got to my heart. so, again. fincher is a master in telling stories. not necessarily great stories themselves, but also the way he tells them... make them really sublime. after the really intense and complex fightclub, this is my second favorite movie made by fincher. love, love, love.;19 May 2020;9;['many', 'hooked', 'sure', 'least', 'good', 'intense', 'subtle', 'pre', 'certain', 'large', 'most', 'overall', 'powerful', 'slow', 'bodyless', 'shaky', 'high', 'intense', 'criminal', 'predictable', 'classical', 'super', 'dark', 'sadistic', 'dead', 'alive', 'well', 'great', 'sublime', 'intense', 'complex', 'second', 'favorite'];0.1076014109347442

316;Kubris;"imdb top 250: 27 seven, david fincher's first great film, is about two detectives in an unnamed city who hunt down a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his modus operandi. it's an original and clever take on the murder mystery. when those opening credits start to roll, with an awesome remix of nine inch nail's 'closer', the viewer begins to both dread what will come next, but also be unable to wait to see how it unfurls. a very important part of seven is its setting and atmosphere. the city, unnamed intentionally, is a savage, crime-riddled town that no one wants to live in. it sets the perfect landscape for such a bizarre killer. the direction is wonderful: constant rain, dark; this is a sad, dreary place, and no good can possibly come of it. it's one of seven's greatest strengths. another great strength is the three major players. brad pitt and morgan freeman play the rookie and the veteran, and both are very convincing. pitt, a five year veteran elsewhere, comes to the city intentionally with his girlfriend. we feel his unpreparedness, especially early on. he doesn't know what to expect from this dreary place; his reaction to the vomit and him waiting for somerset outside the gluttony murder, in the rain soaking with two coffees proves that. while some criticize pitt's acting at the end, i think he aces it. freeman doesn't have as hard a job, he is the perfect smart and wise character. the last player is the killer, who i will keep a secret. from the killer's entrance to finish, you will be on edge as long as the character is on the screen. the lack of emotion is unsettling. visually, the film stands out: colours are seeped out of the picture, leaving darkness and rain: a great example is in the alley, with cameras facing up the guns barrel into the rain. the last key to seven's success is the plot. full of action, suspense, and a few jumps, you will be engrossed by this story till its intense, shocking finale. each of the killings are well-thought and shown in a gory, visceral matter, but not explicitly so. sloth and lust are absolutely atrocious in a good way, but i think pride could have been fleshed out a little more. that could be the only suggestion i have about the film. the less you know going into seven, the better. one of the 90's best. 9.6/10";11 June 2011;10;['first', 'great', 'unnamed', 'serial', 'deadly', 'original', 'clever', 'awesome', 'close', 'unable', 'important', 'unnamed', 'riddled', 'perfect', 'bizarre', 'wonderful', 'constant', 'dark', 'sad', 'dreary', 'great', 'great', 'major', 'convincing', 'unpreparedness', 'dreary', 'gluttony', 'hard', 'perfect', 'smart', 'wise', 'last', 'unsettling', 'great', 'last', 'full', 'few', 'intense', 'shocking', 'visceral', 'atrocious', 'good', 'little', 'more', 'only', 'well', 'good'];0.2482653061224489

321;Jexxon;to put it simply - seven (i think the 7 in the title looks damn stupid) is the best film i've seen. as far as the pure cinema experience goes, i it shares the number one spot with titanic (yes titanic, no i'm not crazy), but seven is the only flawless film i can think of. the story is pretty straight forward, but when seven came out, the world hadn't yet been flooded with gritty looking, inferior serial killer rip-offs. there's a beauty to the simplicity. the film never takes the cheap way out, and deserves a lot of credit for that. there's a refreshing lack of cliches that makes it all the more easy to watch (just look at r. lee ermey's police captain - normally they only yell and scream at the hero, refusing to believe whatever theory he's got, but in seven he actually listens to, and supports his men). the acting is superb all round, and the chemistry between freeman and pitt is pure magic. the work behind the camera (fincher's fight club may be the flashier one, but this is his masterpiece), and on the sets are equally impressive. the atmosphere and setting really pulls you in to the film, never letting go until the end credits roll. and the ending... the best one ever filmed, period.

323;Morejambo54;i'll start with my negatives about this movie which there are few of : i didn't like how the two main characters had a sort of hatred at the start but after one scene it was all forgotten about, it's not a big deal just a little glitch in the system. some of the dialogue was a bit flat, it had me bored but it was necessary to follow the plot and give subtle hints/clues. the ending was a bit predictable as well but didn't change my reaction to the ending. that's it now onto the positives. the obvious one is how incredibly tense the movie is throughout, after every murder you wait with suspense for the next one wondering what will happen, the story really pushes that feel of anxiousness as it is very well written, every small detail leads to the bigger picture at the end... now the ending, although i predicted what was going to happen it didn't take away how impactful it was, i was clutching onto my seat after the big reveal, and the acting by brad pitt is amazing, his emotions made me sad, angry and nervous all at the same time! the main antagonist as mysterious as he was i found to be a bit disappointing, i didn't enjoy his small reveal when being chased, although i loved how he showed up at the start without me even noticing. when he was finally revealed though i was kind of underwhelmed, he wasn't scary and obviously no longer mysterious besides the fact we don't know his name, albeit he still was incredibly smart and well written into the plot. overall this is a great movie and i would recommend it to many people unless they are a bit squeamish, because there are a few vile scenes, i give it 8.6/10 which rounds up to 9/10;11 January 2021;9;['few', 'main', 'big', 'little', 'flat', 'bored', 'necessary', 'subtle', 'predictable', 'obvious', 'tense', 'throughout', 'next', 'small', 'big', 'impactful', 'big', 'brad', 'amazing', 'sad', 'angry', 'nervous', 'same', 'main', 'mysterious', 'disappointing', 'small', 'scary', 'mysterious', 'smart', 'great', 'many', 'squeamish', 'few', 'vile'];-0.0735016420361247

338;Keemshave;se7en is one of those films that masters it's tone. from the get-go, with its use of imagery and atmosphere, you are thrown into this grimy realistic world. the film never lets go of this razor-sharp tone and doubles-down on its dark themes. the use of rain and dirty city life perpetuates its message to the audience about the world. all of these points are a testament to the immersion of this film. morgan freeman and brad pitt have very good chemistry together as a police duo and set the stage for intense moments in the second half of the film. the other supporting actors also work extremely well and the end of the film has one of the best character reveals in the history of film, but i will not go into detail on that to avoid spoilers. the acting from top to bottom is superb. david fincher is one of my favorite filmmakers and se7en is near the top of the list of his works. the directing is tight, the writing is fierce, and the execution of its themes is as efficient as it comes in film.;22 July 2020;10;['grimy', 'realistic', 'sharp', 'dark', 'dirty', 'brad', 'good', 'intense', 'second', 'other', 'good', 'superb', 'favorite', 'tight', 'fierce', 'efficient'];0.1740079365079365

346;Keyser Soze-12;i have seen my fair share of serial killer movies. and of the ones i've seen, none of them hold a candle to the silence of the lambs.... except seven (or se7en). we all know that lambs is the greatest of all killer movies, and nothing can top it, ever. but seven is most defiantly worthy of a second spot. i love the plot, the acting (who doesn't love morgan freeman?), and not to mention david fincher's great directing. i'm not a big fan of brad pitt, but he's better in this movie than most movies i've seen him in. while this movie really isn't for the faint at heart, it is in no way a gory movie. fincher avoids many grotesque images by showing the facial reactions of the actors looking at the serial killer's work. and the acting, oh the acting. (spoiling starting!) keven spacey is soooo creepy as john doe. not hannibal creepy, but creepy none the less. morgan freeman shines above them all, being the great man that he is. many famous actors are in this movie with little parts. richard roundtree (yes, shaft) is in this, but only for a second or two. gwyneth paltrow is in this movie, but i can't stand her. she is such a little bitch (excuse my language, but she is). i almost laughed at the very end (those of you who have seen the movie know what i'm talkin about). but despite the fact i don't like her, she does a good job in his movie. the thing i love about the plot is it is so untraditional. most serial killer movies have the killer turn out to be a best friend of the good guy or even a fellow detective. not this movie. also, i love the realism. like i said before, this is no silence of the lambs, not even in the realism department. but it's still sooo good anyway. some people might not like this movie and consider it to be a traditional hollywood scream movie, but give it a chance. this is a great find.;7 October 2000;10;['fair', 'serial', 'great', 'worthy', 'second', 'great', 'big', 'brad', 'well', 'most', 'many', 'grotesque', 'facial', 'serial', 'great', 'many', 'famous', 'little', 'second', 'little', 'very', 'talkin', 'good', 'untraditional', 'most', 'serial', 'good', 'good', 'fellow', 'good', 'traditional', 'great'];0.3670138888888889

(in an amusing analogy, samuel l. jackson was on a talk show over a decade ago, i think it was ""vibe"", and he read out loud from those pages and it was great!) so when fincher, who's one of the few to earn the right to be called visionary, makes a movie, it's an event. ""se7en"" is full of vile images, depraved people and an outright hideous aura of urban hell. the desire to help, if you could call what homicide detectives work at help, is at the core of this sin in seven parts picture. morgan freeman is such a commanding actor, you'd believe him in just about any part. here he is, tired, ready to exit the blood soaked carpet of police work, even if his soul will never truly let him walk away from it. he'd be in his den, looking at crime scene photos from some long ago unsolved mystery and put in triple overtime in the unpaid retired police department. brad pitt's character can stand to learn a lot from his senior partner, but he can't settle down or wait unless he absolutely has to. his impetuousness almost gets them in over their heads and john doe (played by you know who) enjoys the sick game he unfurls like some epic serialized saga from the bowels of hell. pitt and the mystery man are on a collision course and something has got to give. this film is so rich visually and it's bizarre to call a tour of the evil human soul yanked out for all to witness ""rich"". try to forget any shot you've ever seen from a fincher picture and it's pretty much impossible. the man's style is like the old masters painting on celluloid.

354;Det_McNulty;"back in '95 david fincher released a film named se7en, following his cruelly underrated '93 box-office-disaster alien3 (view the director's cut and you might understand what i mean). in the sense of the american film industry, se7en was the film which established fincher's talent and from there on in he had more freedom on the films he wanted to create. se7en is a dark tale of morality, depicting two cops who both find themselves stuck inside a deadly game. one of the cops is sommerset (morgan freeman), a man planning to retire from the job and the environment of which he deems unfit and too bleak to live in, a place where he believes ""apathy"" is welcomed. the other cop, mills (brad pitt) has recently required his detective badge and has moved to the city of chicago to help bring ""light"" to the city, while building a ""hero"" reputation. both detectives have different views on the squalid world they are surrounded by and both use different methods when performing a task. the detectives soon find themselves obsessed with capturing a vicious criminal who is terrifying the area with bizarre ""deadly sins"" killings and leaving puzzling and mostly unusable evidence at the scene of the crimes. the narrative which se7en follows is one that is structured with such precision that you become apart of the film. the viewer becomes grasped by the story's compelling nature and the manipulative unanswered questions. yet, here lies one of the few faults with se7en, this being the film's tendency to lose the connectivity of scenes. at times this can detract the viewer, while also making subplots feel cut-off and halted abruptly. although, this is not too significantly noticeable, it is still there and something which stops the film deserving a definitive ""masterpiece"" status. the film still surges with its constant excitement and attention to detail, making it a film of such finesse that it remarkably works as a delicate counter-piece to the horrific story being told. i consider the pivotal scene in se7en to be the chase scene, the scene whereby the viewer captures their first glimpse of john doe (with the exclusion of the infamous opening-credits). it is a scene where my adrenaline started pumping, a scene so expertly thought out with such visceral realism, taking the characters to their most primitive of instincts. this is where the set-pieces come in; the set-pieces in se7en are built with glaring authenticity and unsettling detail, retaining the disturbing exuberance the film follows. se7en is a film that goes leaps and bounds for the modern ""cops vs. criminals"" genre; it provides a level of rarely matched excitement and adrenaline-pumping emotion. it is a film so genuine that by the end of the film you will have built up a bond with the two protagonists. it is remarkable just how exact and precise the film is in its style, atmospherically edited (with the exception of the connectivity) and wonderfully layered offering much analysis for the viewer. one of the film's optimum features are the multi-dimensional characters, the characters of se7en are ones who you care for and are characters who have robust personality to study. it is impossible not to adore the film's appetite for its characters, such as the clashing viewpoints, offering the viewer to make their own personal judgement and also the character's reactions to the repulsive behaviour which has engulfed the city. all this is due to how astonishingly rigorous and convincing the performances are, the actors all develop their own persona and you have to take note of the smaller details to gain a true understanding of the characters. se7en is a film providing sour, surfaced-toned noir to enable the merging of absorbing grittiness and ""lucid"" fantasy, etched with painful realism. the film details every dark corner, capturing a feel of vulnerability and the general taste of fear through highly alluring, yet horribly detached environments, ultimately providing a cold and painfully evocative atmosphere. the cinematography is rigorous, while still being very open in its wonderfully ""edgy"" style. the camera is fixated on the tiniest detail, capturing the emotion on the lens through the exposed characters in wide, yet horribly tight environments. the make-up is just another example of the laborious amount of time and pre-development which was spent on creating the film's ""gothic fairytale"" manner. even with all the technical brilliance, it is still the acting which remains the film's finest feature. more importantly than anything se7en remains one of the finest films in its genre, providing a relief from your typically simplistic hollywood film. instead the film offers a depressing morality tale which motivates the viewer into thinking about what will occur next and giving you taste of the horrific crimes detectives become obsessed with solving. ultimately, few films can succeed in gripping you as much as the inexplicable brilliance of se7en.";12 April 2007;8;['underrated', 'american', 'more', 'dark', 'stuck', 'deadly', 'unfit', 'bleak', 'apathy', 'other', 'light', 'different', 'squalid', 'different', 'vicious', 'bizarre', 'deadly', 'unusable', 'such', 'compelling', 'manipulative', 'unanswered', 'few', 'noticeable', 'definitive', 'constant', 'such', 'delicate', 'horrific', 'pivotal', 'first', 'infamous', 'such', 'visceral', 'primitive', 'glaring', 'unsettling', 'disturbing', 'modern', 'genuine', 'remarkable', 'exact', 'much', 'optimum', 'multi', 'dimensional', 'robust', 'impossible', 'such', 'own', 'personal', 'repulsive', 'due', 'rigorous', 'own', 'small', 'true', 'sour', 'lucid', 'painful', 'dark', 'general', 'alluring', 'cold', 'evocative', 'rigorous', 'open', 'edgy', 'tiny', 'tight', 'laborious', 'technical', 'fine', 'fine', 'simplistic', 'depressing', 'horrific', 'obsessed', 'few', 'inexplicable'];-0.0914369256474519

358;fred-83;i can't believe i haven't commented on this film earlier. this is filmmaking of the highest order. a superb script wonderfully realized. i hope fincher can maintain the high standards he has set for himself here. a future filmmaker can learn a lot from this movie, just in terms of pacing. the way it shifts into high gear is masterful, and it's refreshing to find a director nowadays who knows when and how to move the camera for maximum dramatic effect. howard shore's fine score is unobtrusive and used only when needed. photography, editing, acting- top notch, and i thought brad pitt was just a hollywood pretty boy, how wrong was i? i understand the producers wanted a more upbeat ending, and that morgan freeman and brad pitt deserves credit for helping fincher convince them not to change anything. as we approach the end of the millenium, this is one movie who stands tall above the vast sea of forgettable hollywood movies of the 90s.;15 August 1999;10;['high', 'high', 'future', 'high', 'masterful', 'refreshing', 'maximum', 'dramatic', 'fine', 'unobtrusive', 'pretty', 'wrong', 'upbeat', 'tall', 'vast', 'forgettable'];0.1011111111111111
359;Chuck-149;"you're probably thinking that i am a very harsh guy, comparing ""se7en"" to ""the silence of the lambs"". well let me tell you why i am comparing them. the theme of the movie is pretty much the same as the one in ""the silence of the lambs"". i also once saw on a box that it was written and i quote ""better than the silence of the lambs"". unfortunately, that isn't true. brad pitt and gwyneth paltrow can't give great performances like jodie foster and anthony hopkins gave in ""the silence of the lambs"". however, morgan freeman is a terrific actor and so is kevin spacey and so the two of them together can compensate for pitt's and paltrow's performance. the movie starts off in a house. someone has been murdered. the sin this person had committed was gluttony and it seemed he was killed in this way: someone held a gun against his head and forced him to eat spaghetti until he bursted open. the detective in charge of this case is an experienced detective named william somerset (morgan freeman) and is shortly teamed up with a young detective named david mills (brad pitt). we them have the opening credits and the camera is filming inside the murderer's house. it is filming his hands which are working on a table and you realize how careful the psycho is. he cut off the end of his fingers and put bandages around them simply to be sure the police do not find any finger-prints. the next murder is committed is a person whose sin was greed, then sloth, envy, wrath, pride, and finally lust. the seven sinners all having been murdered, mills assumes that the murderer will not strike again and that he has only to catch him. but that's not what john doe (kevin spacey), the murderer, has in mind. no, instead of hiding out after his seven murders, he turns himself over to the police and has a last surprise for the two detectives, a surprise that will horrify them and allow the viewer which one is able to know when to hold back and which one should be holding back. david fincher does a better job directing this than directing alien. however, i thought there was too much unnecessary gore in the movie. brad pitt does a good job with what he is given and morgan freeman is as excellent a in any other movie. but kevin spacey walks away with the movie and gives probably the best performance as the crazy john doe whose way to describe a murder is as scary as seeing him commit one. it wasn't any surprise he won best villain of the year at the mtv movie awards. i think he didn't get a nomination for best-supporting actor because he already had one in ""the usual suspects"" which he won. the only disappointing part of the movie is truly gwyneth paltrow's performance who seems to be shy in front of the camera. it's a good movie that got a little too much credit but is still worth watching.";27 January 2000;6;['harsh', 'same', 'well', 'true', 'brad', 'great', 'terrific', 'open', 'experienced', 'young', 'careful', 'sure', 'next', 'last', 'able', 'well', 'much', 'unnecessary', 'good', 'excellent', 'other', 'good', 'crazy', 'scary', 'good', 'usual', 'only', 'disappointing', 'shy', 'good', 'little', 'much', 'worth'];0.1316964285714285

362;angelofvic;"disclaimer: i saw this on television; and while there was no written indication that the movie was cut, due to the 2-hour (including commercials) format of movies aired on television, up to 1/4 of this movie may have been cut, which may have colored my opinion of it. this movie shows major flaws in directing, acting, casting, and plot. in the end, to me only the incomparable morgan freeman held it together, plus the dramatic ending gives it a lasting place in one's memory. the whole, however, is riddled with flaws -- from, for example, the silly over-dramatic cinematographic effects (lights flickering on objects just because the director thinks that's cool, and dozens of other annoying and distracting visual fancies), to the heavy-handed extremely over-dramatic and loud music (when all that's happening is that a rather routine crime scene is being investigated). this is the sign of either a poor filmmaker or a thin plot; in this case, it was both. the actors aren't all up to par either. brad pitt is off -- just out of his early sex-god roles in thelma and louise, a river runs through it, and legends of the fall, he hasn't quite entirely got his acting legs to play a serious cop role yet, and although he does fine for the most part, there are several ""off"" moments which spoil the flow and realism of the movie. his inconsistency is distracting. paltrow has not quite got her chops yet either, and this is still the infancy of her career. and kevin spacey seems greatly miscast -- anthony hopkins (hannibal lecter) he is not. i kept seeing k-pax or any number of other cherubic-cheeked sweet-guy spacey roles in this performance, not a serial killer. plus they used a very skinny, nimble, athletic stunt double (who did not look at all like the very stolid, round-cheeked spacey) to play john doe up till the time he is captured and we see his face, which compounds the feeling that spacey is grossly miscast. (if that wasn't a stunt double, then the character was portrayed in two personas too widely different to be totally believable.) but then again, morgan freeman is a rock of gibraltar and can save any movie, even one with as many plot flaws, film-making flaws, acting flaws, and casting flaws as this one. although i found this movie to be a disappointment (silence of the lambs it most definitely was not), in the end it was worth seeing because of freeman and because of the intriguing ending. i'd say, if thrillers/suspense (especially disturbing ones) is your genre, by all means watch seven; if not, you may want to view something else instead.";14 July 2006;5;['major', 'dramatic', 'silly', 'dramatic', 'cinematographic', 'cool', 'other', 'annoying', 'visual', 'handed', 'dramatic', 'loud', 'routine', 'poor', 'thin', 'early', 'serious', 'most', 'several', 'miscast', 'hannibal', 'other', 'sweet', 'serial', 'skinny', 'nimble', 'athletic', 'stolid', 'round', 'cheeked', 'miscast', 'double', 'different', 'believable', 'many', 'worth', 'intriguing', 'disturbing'];-0.0623397435897435

365;AbhiMathews;it is seldom that a movie with such an eerie mood can continue with a continuously building story line and characters who are so dynamic. modernism and beliefs lie at the heart of the movie, and se7en does an exceptional job in executing a great plot with even better acting. most actors would not be capable of filling the roles of two detectives in such a morbid case. the stars morgan freeman and brad pitt act wonderfully in their respective roles, and manage to remain in character and evolve throughout the film. being initially introduced to the two men, both at different stages of life, viewers begin this exhausting journey which neither characters are prepared for. with superb performances, underlying themes and a carefully manipulated script, se7en truly does succeed in encompassing the qualities every great movie should. the numerous connections to religious and social affiliations offer a different view of the world, and share the side of things most do not see. although the acts displayed are corrupt, which is a purely subjective topic, insights into the mind of a killer offer this movie a trait most lack - perspective. the brilliantly written script, including fabrications many people would never even contemplate, puts se7en on a new pedestal. this thought-provoking thriller is one for the ages, and is one that i highly recommend.;23 June 2013;10;['eerie', 'dynamic', 'exceptional', 'great', 'most', 'capable', 'respective', 'different', 'exhausting', 'great', 'numerous', 'religious', 'social', 'different', 'corrupt', 'subjective', 'most', 'many', 'new'];0.152020202020202
366;dienanhtenten;this movie has perfect script, perfect editing, directing... in my opinion, there's only 1 problem with this movie: why john doe decided to choose mills and her wife- those who's just come to this city for a few weeks, for the final victim (wrath) or his big plan, the plan he 's come with for a whole year??? this is not make sense if this man john doe like we imagine, he has remarkable mind, intelligent acts, he can't end his plan (long term) by his envy of mills's life (short term);22 November 2018;7;['perfect', 'perfect', 'few', 'final', 'big', 'whole', 'remarkable', 'intelligent', 'long', 'short'];0.35
367;matlefebvre20;"one: original and well-built story. initially, ""se7en"" is a story about two detectives who investigate on a peculiar serial killer. this murderer gets inspired of the seven deadly sins to choose his victims and their punishment. just a reminder, the seven deadly sins are: gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath, lust, pride and envy. the summary is well enough to convince people about the originality of the story. scenarist andrew kevin walker builds a script that hooks and never exhausts itself during the full two hours that the movie lasts. the movie is full of surprises and plot twists and reaches its paroxysm at the very end with an astounding, exploding and almost-miraculous climax that has already become legendary and which reflects the atmosphere and the ideology of the story in an adequate way. two: the main actors. ""se7en"" also works because of its two main actors. morgan freeman and brad pitt both deliver extraordinary performances. freeman is detective somerset, ready to take his retirement, while pitt is detective mills, who has been hired to take on somerset's job after the latter leaves the homicide section. the most striking aspect about both characters is the chemistry between them. sometimes, we see that they like each other and sometimes, it appears that one of them is about to jump on the other one. pitt is by far the best of both actors with his detective with a boiling and impatient attitude and with methods that are too radical to somerset's taste. if there's another actor that deserves to be mentioned, it's kevin spacey who plays the mysterious killer. he can't prevent himself from saying that he acts for the good side and he pretends to be an example to follow. but he nevertheless remains a sadist and he's one of the most horrifying killers in cinema's history. three: horrible images. for those who love horror movies, they will get well served with the pictures that they'll see. even if none of the murders are portrayed on screen, the aftermath is horrible anyway, mainly because of the nauseating pictures shot by the crew of director david fincher. in fact, the committed murders are so horrible that it's not even necessary to look at the corpses to feel repulsive sensations. the only thing that's needed, it's for somebody to tell the murders and the listener will certainly get grabbed by an impression of terror. four: the cinematography. apart from its images of horrifying murders, ""se7en"" also impresses by its general cinematography. the title sequence is catching and the sinister music that comes along sets the table for the general atmosphere of the film. the lighting belongs without a doubt to a modern-era film noir, putting emphasis on the darkness of the unknown metropolis shown in the movie. five: its vision of the world. ""se7en"" isn't only a movie about a sordid murderer. it's also a movie having a pessimist vision of the world, where nobody is good, nobody is fine and everybody is bad. that's a vision which doesn't look like any other that was seen before in hollywood. the only movie similar to ""se7en"" that i've seen is ""taxi driver"". in the city that is shown, it's always raining, it's always dark and sinners move into the streets. despite the fact that spacey is a sadistic and insane killer, the fact remains that he's the most philosophical character of the lot and he wants to get sure that the viewers don't leave the theater with a smile upon their faces. and it's precisely the movie's objective. and even if the killers gets himself killed at the end of the movie, fincher manages to make it look like it's not an happy ending. this pessimism is also present in ""fight club"", which is better than ""se7en"", but not by far. six: its description of police work. ""se7en"" is also remarkable for its accurate description of the police world, more specifically the homicidal section. pitt and freeman, as well as their colleagues, look like real police officers and not actors. we really could feel that we're in a real investigation instead of a fictitious story. we visit many places and we assist to the use of sophisticated techniques. se7en: redemption for david fincher. overall, ""se7en"" is a powerful movie that charges like a locomotive and it wants to be sure that the viewers don't leave it unscathed. it really is one of the most striking thrillers of the 90s and it's a great example that hollywood isn't necessarily synonymous of censure and respite. it's also a redemption for david fincher who was only known at the time for the disappointing ""alien "". from now on, fincher could show that he was an exceptional filmmaker and he kept going with other masterpieces, such as ""fight club"", ""panic room"" and ""zodiac"".";27 April 2007;9;['original', 'peculiar', 'serial', 'deadly', 'deadly', 'enough', 'scenarist', 'full', 'full', 'very', 'astounding', 'miraculous', 'legendary', 'adequate', 'main', 'main', 'extraordinary', 'ready', 'latter', 'striking', 'other', 'about', 'other', 'good', 'impatient', 'radical', 'mysterious', 'good', 'horrifying', 'horrible', 'horrible', 'committed', 'horrible', 'necessary', 'repulsive', 'only', 'horrifying', 'general', 'sinister', 'general', 'modern', 'unknown', 'good', 'fine', 'bad', 'other', 'only', 'similar', 'dark', 'sadistic', 'insane', 'philosophical', 'sure', 'happy', 'present', 'well', 'remarkable', 'accurate', 'real', 'real', 'fictitious', 'many', 'sophisticated', 'powerful', 'locomotive', 'sure', 'unscathed', 'striking', 'great', 'synonymous', 'disappointing', 'alien', 'exceptional', 'other', 'such'];0.0892690058479532
368;tjsdshpnd;watched a movie after a long time and what a choice for a comeback . se7en is a shocking, disturbing, cold, sinful thriller which takes hold of the audience for the entire length of the movie. the story is about two police cops, one about to retire and one a very young new entry played by freeman and pitt respectively. just before detective somerset (freeman) is about to retire, a strange case of murder comes into picture which introduces the police department to a cold-blooded, patient and deranged serial killer who kills people one after the other on the basis of seven deadly sins mentioned by religion which are subjected to death of the sinner. thus the serial killer aims at killing 7 people, one for each sin respectively. detectives somerset and mills (pitt) are given this case and they both try their different methods to uncover this mystery and catch the killer. a very unique plot, this movie is made even more thrilling by the classic direction of fincher. this movie can be called a milestone in the suspense genre. brad pitt as the young, restless cop mills has done his job pretty well . but there are some scenes where we feel that he is overacting a bit. morgan freeman on the other hand makes us feel that this particular role of detective somerset was written just for him. kevin spacey in a small role as the deranged killer is impressive and makes us feel that he is truly a cold blooded psychopath . overall, a must watch movie rating : 8.5/10;2 June 2009;9;['long', 'shocking', 'disturbing', 'cold', 'sinful', 'entire', 'about', 'young', 'new', 'about', 'strange', 'cold', 'blooded', 'patient', 'serial', 'other', 'deadly', 'serial', 'different', 'unique', 'more', 'classic', 'brad', 'young', 'restless', 'other', 'particular', 'small', 'impressive', 'cold', 'blooded'];-0.074062049062049

376;thesouthfamily2-552-707097;"""seven,"" a dark, grisly, horrifying and intelligent thriller, may be too disturbing for many people, i imagine, although if you can bear to watch, it you will see filmmaking of a high order. it tells the story of two detectives - one ready to retire, the other at the start of his career - and their attempts to capture a perverted serial killer who is using the seven deadly sins as his scenario. the look of ""seven"" is crucial to its effect. this is a very dark film, the gloom often penetrated only by the flashlights of the detectives. even when all the lights are turned on in the apartments of the victims, they cast only wan, hopeless pools of light. the enigma of somerset's character is at the heart of the film, and this is one of morgan freeman's best performances. he embodies authority naturally; i can't recall him ever playing a weak man. here he knows all the lessons a cop might internalize during years spent in what we learn is one of the worst districts of the city. he lives alone, in what looks like a rented apartment, bookshelves on the walls. he puts himself to sleep with a metronome. he never married, although he came close once. he is a lonely man who confronts life with resigned detachment. ""seven"" is not really a very deep or profound film, but it provides the convincing illusion of one. almost all mainstream thrillers seek first to provide entertainment; this one intends to fascinate and appall. the killer obviously intends his elaborate murders as moral statement. he suggests as much after we meet him. when he's told his crimes will soon be forgotten in the daily rush of cruelty, he insists they will be remembered forever. they are his masterpiece. what goes unexplained is how, exactly, he is making a statement. his victims, presumably guilty of their sins, have been convicted and executed by his actions. what's the lesson? let that be a warning to us? the killer, as i said, turns himself in with 30 minutes to go, and dominates the film from that point forward. when ""seven"" was released in 1995 the ads, posters and opening credits didn't mention the name of the actor, and although you may well know it, i don't think i will either. this actor has a big assignment. he embodies evil. like hannibal lecter, his character must be played by a strong actor who projects not merely villainy but twisted psychological complexities. observe his face. smug. self-satisfied. listen to his voice. intelligent. analytical. mark his composure and apparent fearlessness. the film essentially depends on him, and would go astray if the actor faltered. he doesn't. ""seven"" is unique in one detail of its construction; it brings the killer on screen with half an hour to go, and gives him a speaking role. instead of being simply the quarry in a chase, he is revealed as a twisted but articulate antagonist, who has devised a horrible plan for concluding his sermon. (the actor playing the killer is not identified by name in the ads or opening credits, and so i will leave his identity as another of his surprises.) ""seven"" is well-made in its details, and uncompromising in the way it presents the disturbing details of the crimes. it is certainly not for the young or the sensitive.";31 January 2014;10;['dark', 'horrifying', 'intelligent', 'disturbing', 'many', 'high', 'ready', 'other', 'perverted', 'serial', 'deadly', 'crucial', 'dark', 'hopeless', 'good', 'weak', 'bad', 'rented', 'lonely', 'deep', 'profound', 'convincing', 'mainstream', 'elaborate', 'moral', 'much', 'daily', 'unexplained', 'guilty', 'big', 'hannibal', 'strong', 'villainy', 'twisted', 'psychological', 'satisfied', 'intelligent', 'analytical', 'apparent', 'unique', 'twisted', 'articulate', 'horrible', 'disturbing', 'young', 'sensitive'];-0.007095238095238

378;Mitch-25;this is a gritty mind-bending thiller. it is by far my favorite brad pitt movie. the movie is about a killer who uses the seven deadly sins as a method to kill, and the two cops (played by pitt and freeman) who are destined to meet up with him. all of them involve turning the sin against the sinner, and all of the murders are pretty gruesome. a word to the wise: do not let your kids see this movie. it is without a doubt one of the most gruesome movies i have ever seen. but, the gruesomeness of the murders just adds to the movie. the terrific acting of brad pitt and moran freeman (one of my favorite actors) just adds to the overall feel. kevin spacey's much talked about roll is small, but very good and very important to understand the movie. overall, this movie is just about the best horror/suspense movie i have seen.;15 October 2000;10;['gritty', 'favorite', 'deadly', 'gruesome', 'gruesome', 'terrific', 'brad', 'favorite', 'overall', 'small', 'good', 'important', 'good'];0.0499999999999999

381;DVR_Brale;"why is se7en so good? well, one of the reasons is because it was directed by none other than david fincher who is well known for his perfectionism. other reasons include amazing cast and interesting concept with religious main premise. morgan freeman, gwyneth paltrow, brad pitt and one i won't mention because fincher decided to kip him as a surprise all delivered amazing performance. how can you not like freeman's relaxed and gentlemanly attitude (he loves books) as opposed to pitt's sort of angry and action type character (he loves chase)? do you think that people who commit deadly sins deserve to live? of course you do, but this serial killer doesn't. he thinks that the world is better without them. theologically speaking, deadly sins are called deadly because they have been identified as a root cause to other sins and separateness from god. as a result, one who commits one of those, shall find nothing but darkness in his life and will eventually loose capacity to be happy. if one doesn't want to end like that (spiritual death) one has to firstly turn away from his sin, ask god for forgiveness and then expiate his sin. this serial killer is not merciful. he positions himself as a god who doesn't forgive or give chances to turn away from them. since spiritual death is a final result from consistently committing deadly sins, this serial killer delivers physical death by murdering his victims in a way that particular sin harms them. he had given himself a right to deliver justice; but justice without love becomes cruel. after this short theological reflection let me now turn my attention to detectives somerset (freeman) and mills (pitt). as i mentioned earlier, they stand opposed but somehow complement each other. together they discover frightening and bizarre murders and react in a way specific to them. this is important when you consider the ending. everybody knows se7en has one the most shocking ending ever made (other being requiem for a dream). since committing deadly sins influences character as well (not only spirit), carefully watching both detectives actions ads to your understanding of se7en. this movie is not about chase or little evidences analyzed by technology; it's about seeing people behind the mask, the way we truly are. that's at least what i think. so why did i give se7en a symbolic seven? i don't have any particular reason. se7en just lacks that something some other movies have. apart from being shocking, it didn't stick with me. it's predictable as well, but it seems to me that fincher decided to make it that way on purpose. we know what is going to happen and that gives us more ""space"" to focus our attention on characters and the way they'll react and not on story itself. soundtrack could be somewhat better as well. se7en also lacks that noir feeling that would've made it better. so to conclude: se7en is a shocking and cleverly made movie with great cast. underneath the hub is a lot of material for reflection about human nature. those of you more philosophically oriented are surely going to enjoy this one or should i say seven.";7 September 2016;7;['good', 'other', 'known', 'other', 'amazing', 'interesting', 'religious', 'main', 'brad', 'amazing', 'relaxed', 'gentlemanly', 'angry', 'deadly', 'serial', 'well', 'deadly', 'deadly', 'other', 'happy', 'spiritual', 'serial', 'merciful', 'spiritual', 'final', 'deadly', 'serial', 'physical', 'particular', 'cruel', 'short', 'theological', 'opposed', 'other', 'frightening', 'bizarre', 'specific', 'important', 'shocking', 'other', 'deadly', 'little', 'least', 'symbolic', 'particular', 'other', 'shocking', 'predictable', 'more', 'well', 'well', 'shocking', 'great', 'human'];-0.0280405405405405

384;ericjg623;**contains spoilers** perhaps it's the timing. three weeks ago i might have reacted differently to this movie. but right now i just have little tolerance for the way it takes genuine horror and evil and creates a stylish, but ultimately empty, hollywood package out of it. this film is about a sadistic killer who is choosing his victims and methods of death based on the seven deadly sins (hence the title of the movie). on his trail are two detectives, a young hotshot named david mills (brad pitt) and a senior homicide lieutenant, william somerset, (morgan freeman) who has become cynical almost to the point of burnout. the murders are carried out with extreme cruelty, although the violence is not actually shown being committed, it is depicted quite graphically by what the two men discover at each crime scene, as well as in the various photos, coroner's reports, etc., that they examine. to be blunt, this is not for the squeamish, in fact, i'm surprised this film didn't get an nc-17 rating. anyway, the bodies pile up, and despite their best efforts (including a very close encounter by mills), the killer, known only as 'john doe', remains at large. in fact, we don't even see him at all until halfway through the film, and we don't see him close up until near the end. which is, basically, where this otherwise well crafted film falls apart. at this point, five victims have already been discovered. in a strange plot twist, mr. doe turns himself in, them makes a bizarre offer. in return for a full confession, he requests the two detectives accompany him, alone and unarmed, so he can show them the final two victims. obviously he has something really shocking planned as his grand finale, and, given his extremely high level of intelligence shown to date, only a fool would accept such a proposal at face value. yet accepted it is, and all three men end up alone in the desert, the scene set for the final horror. (warning: big spoiler ahead) on the drive out, doe has been taunting mills relentlessly, setting up the big showdown in which somerset is handed a package containing the severed head of mills' wife, played by gwyneth paltrow. at this point, doe springs the trap. with a sneer, he informs mills that the head represents the sin of envy, namely the killer's envy of mills' heretofore charmed life. of course, the sinner will pay for his sin, and in the process bring down the final victim, mills himself, whose sin is wrath. somerset, who understands the situation fully as soon as he opens the box, tries in vain to prevent what he knows is inevitable. mills struggles to fight off his natural desire to kill doe, knowing if he does, the killer wins his twisted game, but in the end he cannot help it. the film ends with mills being driven off, presumably in handcuffs, in the back of a squad car. no matter what happens to him now, his life has been utterly destroyed. much as with the suicide bombers of september 11th, we are left with the sense of the sneering triumph of evil over good, of a twisted life of hate given solely for the purpose of destruction. so, what is the point of this film? there isn't one, as far as i can tell. there's no moral here, only psychosis and brutality artfully rendered. it's an appeal to cynicism, to shock value for its own sake. i suppose we are expected to react by noting that the ending was 'cool' or at the very least, 'original'. yeah, right. and the really disgusting part is that this isn't some low budget slasher flick, but a top quality production with big name stars. a lot of thought, effort and talent went into making this film, but the end result is something that deserves to be flushed down a toilet.;28 September 2001;2;['little', 'genuine', 'stylish', 'empty', 'sadistic', 'deadly', 'young', 'senior', 'cynical', 'extreme', 'various', 'blunt', 'surprised', 'good', 'close', 'large', 'strange', 'bizarre', 'full', 'alone', 'unarmed', 'final', 'shocking', 'planned', 'grand', 'high', 'final', 'big', 'big', 'final', 'inevitable', 'natural', 'twisted', 'squad', 'good', 'twisted', 'moral', 'own', 'cool', 'least', 'original', 'disgusting', 'low', 'top', 'big'];0.0468551587301587

386;cleary-joshua;"i think ""se7en"" is my favourite david fincher film, and given the body of work which the director has so far produced, that was not an easy decision to make. much as i adore the intense character study of ""the social network"", the dark mind-games of ""gone girl"" and the rich storytelling in ""the curious case of benjamin button"", i feel that ""se7en"" is fincher showing off everything he does best. it's a brooding, jet black thriller which makes you look inwardly and consider so many aspects of human nature. in the film, brad pitt and morgan freeman play homicide detectives one recently transferred to a large city, the other getting ready for retirement. on paper, their relationship is a detective cliche, but pitt and freeman's chemistry ensures that it transcends this. the pair start to discover a string of horrific murders, each one linked to one of the seven deadly sins, and attempt to track down the killer. they get closer and closer, and it becomes almost a game as the detectives try to prevent the next murder from occurring. there are twists and turns at every single corner up to the point where the murderer actually hands himself in, and even then you can tell that the game is barely over. it's a film with a very clear process from the beginning, but this is not a bad thing. it takes you along so you feel like you know what's going to happen next, and then subverts your expectation right at the next step. the three lead performances are all brilliant, but the standout performance is that of spacey, whose slow speech and constant calmness turn him into such a convincing psychopath. the greatest scene in the film is in set in a car, towards the end of the film, when spacey explains his reasoning for committing the murders. the terrifying thing about the scene is that you can, in a way, completely understand the murderer's point, and this is cemented greatly by spacey's performance. as is to be expected from fincher, the visuals in the film are incredible, and he doesn't waste a moment when he can shock. each of the portrayals of the seven sins is as shocking as the next, and ""gluttony"" doesn't really kick things off that lightly. but again, fincher's success is in disturbing his audience merely by suggestion rather than explicitly showing them anything. the murder based on ""lust"" isn't even described that graphically, but the very idea that it produces causes it to be one of the most difficult to watch scenes in the movie. in ""se7en"", fincher has created a near-perfect thriller. there is not a bored moment in the entire film, and not even gwyneth paltrow's presence can spoil the atmosphere or enjoyment. pitt, freeman and spacey complement each other perfectly, and help the film to achieve something that is actually relatively rare in movies of this genre it actually makes your heart race.";10 February 2015;10;['favourite', 'easy', 'intense', 'social', 'dark', 'rich', 'curious', 'black', 'many', 'human', 'brad', 'large', 'other', 'ready', 'horrific', 'deadly', 'close', 'close', 'next', 'single', 'clear', 'bad', 'next', 'brilliant', 'slow', 'constant', 'convincing', 'great', 'terrifying', 'incredible', 'shocking', 'next', 'very', 'difficult', 'perfect', 'bored', 'entire', 'other', 'rare'];0.0108193277310924

402;andrewburgereviews;"it is always raining in the city, but people don't seem to mind. at this point, they don't even notice it anymore. it's not ignorance, they are numb. yet they still deal with it in one way or another. detective william somerset puts on his hat and takes his coat while detective david mills just faces it with his hair up. he gets in the car, brushes it off and off to work. there is a killer on the loose, his crimes terrible and the clues barely existent. interestingly enough, there is no mention of what city it is. it could be any big city. bleak, inescapable, apathetic, sad, miserable, industrial and hopeless. somerset (morgan freeman) is close to retirement and mills (brad pitt) is only just beginning his career. he moved in recently with his wife tracy (gwyneth paltrow). the two are expecting but david doesn't know. and maybe is for the better. in the city, excitement and agony can often become one another. besides, the murder victims keep piling up. mills and somerset arrive at the first scene: an obese man, fed to death found face-down in a bowl of spaghetti. the word ""gluttony"" is written on the wall. next scene, a defense attorney, killed after forced to cut a pound of flesh from his body. the word ""greed"" written in blood. despite the fact that this should be obvious to anyone remotely interested in learning, it is somerset who first notices these are two of the seven deadly sins. next up, ""sloth"", ""lust"", ""pride"", ""envy"" and ""wrath"". in aiding his less experienced colleague, somerset does what most people wouldn't do when faced with such a man--he goes to the library and begins studying anything related with the seven deadly sins. at its center, dante alighieri's ""divine comedy"". he points out how the killer is preaching, his acts of murder being symbolic punishments for the victims' sins. but they are also pretty ironic. one think that david fincher never focuses on in his movies is the comedy in various situations. he is a bleak, atmospheric, at times claustrophobic director. but this is for the better. mills points out how the killer is ""urinating in their (the police) faces"". and i couldn't help but think there is also a sense of superiority, jargon and irony in the killer's work--how on-point and also behind the police is to him. it is, indeed, a ""divine comedy"". but as shocking as the crime scenes are, it is the interactions between somerset and the mills family who has the bigger insight--at least until the final scenes. somerset is a loner, and while he is clearly intelligent and has gone through more than he shows, there are still two times when he opens up. once, in a bar, when he has a discussion with mills. fincher and writer andrew kevin walker had made them with such well-defined and opposing personalities that any contradictions and insightful discussions come naturally. somerset and mills discuss about apathy, but they also hint at hypocrisy. mills, who loves the city life, points out somerset's superior nature, but somerset doesn't think any better of himself either. but even more powerful was when tracy asked somerset to meet her in secret and told him she is pregnant. somerset is shocked. tracy is depressed, she hates the city, she hates the apartment which is often rumbled by the noise of the subway passing and she needs someone to talk to. somerset sees in her nothing more than what most people feel. the hate for the city, except she simply hadn't numbed herself yet. like him, but not like david--david loves the city. and while the deep, personal interactions between somerset and tracy are setting up the shocking climax, it is when the killer finally reveals himself that the movie really solidifies its place as a masterpiece. ""se7en"" had such a high build-up that unless the villain is not perfect, the movie collapses. but the villain--john doe--was perfect and the movie did not collapse. from the point he shows himself he is in complete control. his physical movements--minimal. his voice--methodical, intelligent, evil! his presence--demonic. yet his message is blunt enough--sinners, let this be a lesson to you! as he goes on about his motives, you cannot help but look at somerset listening, silent. he makes the sneaky case of not completely disagreeing with doe. this would be scary if somerset hadn't been written and built through the entire movie as a paragon--which he is! are we really all better than criminals, or do we simply--out of either morality, fear of god, or just fear of the law--suppress our darkest thoughts where no one can reach them? i care not for the answer. this movie is great simply because it raises the question. the debate is what will make it linger. and let's remember: somerset doesn't care about the city, he only stretches his job until he will retire somewhere far away. like doe, he knows it's hopeless and that there is ""a deadly sin on every corner"" but it is so common now that there is nothing that can be done about it. it will always rain in the city.";21 August 2020;10;['numb', 'loose', 'terrible', 'existent', 'big', 'bleak', 'inescapable', 'apathetic', 'sad', 'miserable', 'industrial', 'hopeless', 'close', 'well', 'first', 'obese', 'next', 'obvious', 'interested', 'deadly', 'next', 'experienced', 'most', 'deadly', 'divine', 'symbolic', 'ironic', 'various', 'bleak', 'atmospheric', 'well', 'divine', 'shocking', 'big', 'least', 'final', 'intelligent', 'more', 'such', 'insightful', 'apathy', 'superior', 'well', 'powerful', 'pregnant', 'shocked', 'depressed', 'more', 'most', 'deep', 'personal', 'shocking', 'high', 'perfect', 'perfect', 'complete', 'physical', 'minimal', 'methodical', 'intelligent', 'evil', 'demonic', 'blunt', 'silent', 'sneaky', 'scary', 'entire', 'well', 'dark', 'great', 'linger', 'hopeless', 'deadly', 'common'];-0.0190528519099947

405;MadReviewer;"'se7en' is all about harsh style and gruesome substance while it's probably not a film for everyone (particularly the squeamish), it is one of the most moody, memorable films made in recent years. a sense of absolute dread pervades each and every scene, either from the powerful words and deeds of the characters or from the dreary sets and atmosphere created by director david fincher. there's a quote from the film 'the crow' that goes, 'it can't rain all the time' . . . well, in the world of 'se7en', it can and it does. 'se7en' is the story of world-weary police detective william somerset (morgan freeman), a man who's probably seen more terror and sadness in his lifetime than any man should ever be forced to see. partnered with the young cop david mills (brad pitt), somerset is assigned to find the serial killer known only as john doe. the horrific crimes of doe are patterned after the seven deadly sins for gluttony, one victim was literally forced to eat until his internal organs exploded; for another, greed, the victim is forced to cut an actual pound of flesh away from his own body. john doe is a highly literate, intelligent killer; but so is somerset, and an astounding game of cat-and-mouse filled with unexpected twists ensues as the hunt for doe gets underway. andrew kevin walker's script for 'se7en' is absolutely dazzling. it's smart and powerful, and doesn't pull any punches the bodies, maimed and tortured, inexorably begin to pile up in graphic fashion, and somerset and mills aren't allowed to minimize the horrors they're forced to find. each new corpse brings a true feeling of revulsion . . . and of dread, as the realization hits that another body will be forthcoming unless john doe is found. the story is filled with misdirection and red herrings; just as the audience starts to think that the unfolding events of the film are starting to become predictable, the film lurches further into the unknown darkness, keeping the edge of uneasiness that pervades 'se7en' fresh . . . and constant. kudos also to david fincher's stylish direction this may be fincher's best film to date. the entire look of the film is dark and gloomy, almost a suicidal form of 1940s film noir, evoking a despairing atmosphere that never relents or shows a glimmer of optimism. combine that with fincher's knack for turning even the most mundane scene into a nailbiter 'se7en' features a scene with somerset and mills standing together in an empty field, and yet the scene is still incredibly tense and 'se7en' becomes an exceptionally powerful, disturbing film that's difficult to turn away from. the cast? also excellent. pitt is perfect as the cocky young detective mills, mixing together the right amount of bravado and testosterone at the start of the film, and then later tempering that swagger with cynicism and fear as the movie progresses forward. in a way, mills is a surrogate for the audience; he starts out thinking that he knows exactly what's going to happen but as events slowly unfold before his horrified eyes, it starts to dawn on mills that he is mentally unprepared he is for a maniac like john doe. pitt handles the decline of mills from overconfident to completely paranoid with great skill. the killer john doe (i won't reveal his name here; the actor's uncredited in the film, so i won't mention it either on the off chance that you haven't read it elsewhere) is simply great. he's a quiet, intense figure who is machiavellian with his calculated words and actions. many other actors might've just mimicked hannibal lecter to portray john doe . . . but the awesome performance in 'se7en' of the uncredited actor is actually better and more unsettling than lecter himself. the best performance of the film, however, may belong to morgan freeman as somerset. freeman is perhaps the only person capable to tracking down john doe, simply because he has seen so much sadness and horror before. nothing doe does, no matter how vile, is able to derail the detective's efforts. as somerset, freeman imbues the character with a certain tired, weary attitude . . . but still lying somewhere beneath that attitude is hope, and that small glimmer of hope, along with the wisdom of experience, is what prevents 'se7en' from spiraling into complete despair. somerset's hope, small as it is, becomes the audience's hope as well. with the possible exception of the very end of the film for all its daring audacity, fincher chooses to play it a little too safe at the film's conclusion 'se7en' proves to be an uncompromising tour de force of modern horror. if you're not easily bothered by graphic horror and gore, then go watch this film. you certainly won't be disappointed. grade: a";18 May 2001;9;['harsh', 'gruesome', 'moody', 'memorable', 'recent', 'absolute', 'powerful', 'dreary', 'weary', 'more', 'young', 'serial', 'horrific', 'deadly', 'internal', 'actual', 'own', 'literate', 'intelligent', 'astounding', 'unexpected', 'underway', 'dazzling', 'smart', 'powerful', 'graphic', 'new', 'true', 'forthcoming', 'red', 'predictable', 'unknown', 'fresh', 'constant', 'stylish', 'good', 'entire', 'dark', 'gloomy', 'suicidal', 'despairing', 'mundane', 'empty', 'tense', 'powerful', 'disturbing', 'difficult', 'excellent', 'perfect', 'cocky', 'young', 'right', 'horrified', 'unprepared', 'paranoid', 'great', 'uncredited', 'off', 'great', 'quiet', 'intense', 'machiavellian', 'calculated', 'many', 'other', 'hannibal', 'awesome', 'uncredited', 'well', 'unsettling', 'good', 'only', 'capable', 'much', 'vile', 'able', 'certain', 'tired', 'weary', 'small', 'complete', 'small', 'possible', 'very', 'little', 'safe', 'uncompromising', 'modern', 'graphic'];0.145810927353896
406;ToldYaSo;"i've had this discussion with many friends on what the most disturbing film they've ever seen is, and the results have been fairly consistent. the fact is, that ""se7en"" is the most disturbing film i have ever seen in my 28 years and it will likely have a stronghold grip on that title for some time to come. i say this from a male perspective. and while i can appreciate why some of my female friend's opinions that ""silence of the lambs"" holds the ""most disturbing"" title, i have to say that title was lost when ""se7en"" was released. david fincher's dark vision is incredibly creative and harrowing and will likely stay with me for years to come. when i first saw this film with my brother, i was blown away. this film taps into the greatest fear of all men, smashing like a sledgehammer into the weakest, most delicate area of the male psyche. i didn't rise from my seat at the theater not because i couldn't wait to see the credits, but rather to let the feeling in my stomach subside, so that i may walk out properly with some semblance of dignity. being a newly married man, i found the film to be the sheer embodiment of my worst fears which spoiler guidelines prohibit me from elaborating on.

421;donuthaters12;major spoilers below..... have we all gotten so used to it that we have become naive? se7en is david fincher's second film, after his under appreciated take on the alien franchise. this is a film i have watched when i was around 14 and i thought it was excellent, does it hold up now that i am more mature and i have a better understanding of how things work? definitely. the film's screenplay was written by andrew kevin walker and honestly i have no idea what other films he has done aside from 8mm, and i haven't even seen that film yet. so i came into this thinking whether i would still be excited and thrilled in my second viewing. i was not as surprised or excited this time as i knew the major twist and the events leading up towards it. back then, i only really viewed the surface of the film and in subsequent viewing, i discovered the depth of this film and this depth is the reason i remained hooked until the end. the story is an up and coming detective who got transferred to this city where crime is apparent and is hoping to be involved in bigger and more serious cases. he is then paired with a soon to be retired detective to solve a case of murders relating to the seven deadly sins. the screenplay really speaks the abundance and triviality of sin that litters the streets. it gives us these two characters that clearly represents the sins and virtues in catholicism. david mills' character clearly represents a person who is among the people who falls within sin and yet we root for the guy. the character mills throughout the film has fallen within the seven sins that john doe is trying to show, either done subtly or obviously. william somerset on the other hand represents the virtues that counter acts sin. i see this film as a character driven film, you follow both these two detectives to a definitive ending that will not only entertain the audience but also get them thinking. thematically deep but also a surprising thriller. this was my first david fincher, and in my first viewing i found the film to be unsettling due to the themes and tone, granted i was also 14 who loved light and heart-warming films, but as i have gotten older and mature i have become a little more stoic and have gained an interest in cinema. with this interest, i have started to explore different films and such, then i got to a point where i watched a few under fincher's direction and started to enjoy them, especially fight club and alien 3, so i decided to watch se7en again and started to understand his ability as a filmmaker. se7en is definitely a dark film but this was coming off the heels of alien 3, which was also a depressing turn to the alien saga, so it wasn't much of a big change but his direction in this feature was much more controlled and understood. he definitely knew what he wanted to do with this film and knew what he wanted to convey to the audience. fincher's confidence here is not something that is found in his later acclaimed films but he did enough to convince me in his sophomore attempt. i haven't seen the other films that darius khondji have worked in but his photography here is definitely moody. it's appropriate and unsettling. the tone is the major thing i picked up on his photography and it was definitely supported with dominating shadows, icy cold colors, and the overpouring rain. this tone and darkness is something i don't find in a fincher film until the girl with the dragon tattoo. pulsing drums and deep horns fill the score by howard shore. it aided, especially in the third act, in creating that thrilling atmosphere with the rising tension that constantly grasps the audience. i am familiar with shore's work, notably the lord of the rings, the aviator and hugo, so i had a bit of expectation for his take on this film. it was great and can't think of anything that would improve it. the film moves in such a pace that doesn't feel rushed. it takes its time with its character development and tension building. the third act is definitely the coup de grace as it fantastically grips us as it leads to the conclusion that will have you shocked and amazed. as this film, to me, was character driven, it had to have actors who can give great performances. both pitt and freeman give their all and have successfully stamped and defined their characters. pitt, though, is the one i have to give more props to as he played a role that was sympathised but also unlikable. the supporting cast is underplayed to dominate the presence of these two leads but their performances were great. the film has some dark themes and is very unsettling at times but should not be dismissed as it is also an entertaining piece of work and definitely a notable effort in fincher's catalog.;1

433;underfire35;"my first introduction to the work of david fincher was the oft panned alien 3. while i hated this film less than most people, i was impressed by the overall look and the visual style. several years later fincher hit movie audiences in the face with seven, which is a masterpiece of dark creeping atmosphere. seven follows the exploits of detectives sommerset and mills, while on the trail of a killer who is violently acting upon the seven deadly sins (greed, sloth, pride, etc.). when broken down to that simple sentence, the film has the potential to collapse under its' own concept. the way the material is handled, however, shows inspiration and commitment by the film-makers. the movie is brutal and realistic; the murder scenes are unpleasant and not for the squeamish. the make-up effects by rob bottin are quite grotesque, especially the killer's ""prisoner"" who is found chained to a bed. morgan freeman in the lead role finds the right balance between professionalism and frustration as the killer continues to elude him. brad pitt as det. mills, the new kid in town, is layered, with just the right amount of maniacal fervor. this is especially important considering mills' actions during the conclusion of the story. if the character had not been established, the ending could have seemed forced or contrived. the way pitt portrays this smart, but angry man, gives the film the push it needs to pull off the final act. kevin spacey, a third-act inclusion, covers much developmental ground in a short period of time. behind the scenes there dwells much talent: the photography by darius khondj is so good you can almost smell certain scenes, arthur max's prod. design is decaying gothic in nature, and the pounding percussive score by howard shore rattles your nerves (shore later went on to score the lord of the rings films). andrew kevin walker's story is sharp and has an explosive resolution. david fincher's direction cemented him as a film-maker with a distinct style and he has proved this in subsequent projects (although i am in the minority for hating fight club, yet this is mainly because of the story, not fincher's direction). it is true that not every single element of the film works, but i admire seven simply for the scene where sommerset goes to the library(!) to help solve the case, which is something you don't often see in your run-of-the-mill thriller. 10/10 quick trivia: in the published screenplay the ending takes place in a swamp; this actually makes sense considering that the characters are still in close proximity to a city where it rains on a constant basis. it also contains the opening scene that was cut from the film (it was later restored via the special edition dvd). the screenplay, itself, is also a good read, and of interest to fans and film-buffs.";8 March 2003;10;['first', 'less', 'most', 'overall', 'visual', 'several', 'dark', 'deadly', 'simple', 'own', 'brutal', 'realistic', 'unpleasant', 'grotesque', 'lead', 'right', 'new', 'right', 'maniacal', 'important', 'smart', 'angry', 'final', 'third', 'much', 'developmental', 'short', 'much', 'good', 'certain', 'gothic', 'percussive', 'sharp', 'explosive', 'distinct', 'subsequent', 'true', 'single', 'quick', 'close', 'constant', 'special', 'good'];0.085453272217978

440;kelboy10;the seven deadly sins, where do i start? this methodical killer is precise leaving hellacious destruction in his path with sick twisted mind games for the detectives to unfold. each victim has a sin placed beside him/her with reasoning unclear at first sight. each death more sick any twisted by the minute. my reasoning for finally giving this a viewing and rating not only because it was on my to do list however daunting it seemed, was because tomorrow i am viewing matt reeves's the batman whom took influence from se7en. this is my first viewing of se7en which deploys a gritty noir tone whilst maintaining style and letting off a disturbing nature of inhuman intellect. what i would say is once the killer is uncovered there isn't really much of a twist just a fine line between insanity and sanity. this antagonist asks the questions on what makes one so innocent? what makes you so different from me? of course in any homicidal maniac eyes he is never the villain, he believes himself to be doing gods will, a saviour if you like. so let's get to the film, brad pitt was a stand out performance for me as mills reaching a variety of emotions throughout the film. mills feels incapable of giving up on this case and sees the killer john doe as insane, he has no admiration of any action taken by the killer. (morgan freeman) plays somerset who is equally keen to bring john doe down but is wise enough and been in the game long enough to know this isn't gonna end well. why couldn't he have just god damn retire already? i can feel him thinking this in his approach and acting. the world is a dark place for somerset whilst in addition to almost retiring he can see the intellect of the killer and the methods to his madness. somerset knows the killer isn't mentally insane just strategic and evil. morgan does a splendid job alongside pitt as a polar opposite, he is the more composed of the two, the more experienced and logical thinker. kevin spacey brings a very eerie performance of the highest magnitude, he has memorable moments leaving you stunned with mesmerisingly compelling believable acting. (gwyneth paltrow) tracy is mills love interest however she feels alienated in a new city whilst her man is tracking down the killer. tracy feels like she is a burden and can't open up to mills about this whilst he is so busy on duty. i felt her performance too, it really added layers to the script with themes of isolation and loneliness. overall the film as a whole has stylish backdrops and locations with a very noir feel, fantastic acting and deep psychological thinking. different views are explored through a variety of characters.;3 March 2022;9;['deadly', 'methodical', 'precise', 'hellacious', 'sick', 'twisted', 'unclear', 'first', 'sick', 'twisted', 'first', 'gritty', 'disturbing', 'inhuman', 'much', 'fine', 'innocent', 'different', 'brad', 'incapable', 'insane', 'keen', 'wise', 'long', 'dark', 'insane', 'strategic', 'evil', 'splendid', 'polar', 'composed', 'experienced', 'logical', 'eerie', 'high', 'memorable', 'compelling', 'new', 'busy', 'stylish', 'fantastic', 'deep', 'psychological', 'different'];-0.012221797810033

444;lwjoslin;"""se7en"" was the serial killer movie of the week at the time of its release. morgan freeman and brad pitt--apparently representing reason and passion, respectively--are cops on the trail of a serial killer. kevin spacey plays the killer as a hannibal lecter wannabe with a vengeful-angry-god complex: he bumps his victims off in ways that reflect the seven deadly sins. not a new idea; vincent price made two similarly-constructed movies in the '70s: ""the abominable dr. phibes,"" in which the inspiration is the ten curses of pharaoh in the book of exodus; and ""theater of blood,"" in which shakespeare's plays provide the motifs. (""se7en"" makes a nod in the direction of its predecessors by mentioning the ""pound of flesh"" associated with one of the murders.) the difference is that the price movies were jet-black comedies, while ""se7en"" is a straightforward suspense thriller, and a relentlessly grim, gray, dark, rain-soaked one at that. it's technically well-made and unusually literate, drawing themes from dante, milton, shakespeare, and medieval theology. and there's a strong echo of dostoevsky's ""notes from the underground"": when the killer's lair is located, it's found to contain 2000 handwritten notebook journals of 250 pages each. (quibbles: if he writes that much, when does he find time to do anything else... such as plan and execute fiendishly clever crimes? also, we're told that none of the journals or entries are dated. as one who has kept a daily journal for ten years, i find that unlikely, especially since the killer is ultimately revealed to be even more, shall we say, detail-oriented than i am.) the movie's ending (which i won't reveal here) is distressingly downbeat--and surprisingly so, as well. it leaves a nasty aftertaste. it could be argued that anything less would've been a cop-out, but it still was about as entertaining as a sucker punch. ""the silence of the lambs"" left us with lecter on the loose, but at least there was salvation (the girl was rescued), redemption (the lambs were silenced), and retribution (the killer was dispatched without the incidental destruction of anyone else). by contrast, ""se7en,"" which offers none of the above, is easy to admire, but hard to enjoy.";16 May 2003;7;['serial', 'brad', 'serial', 'hannibal', 'vengeful', 'angry', 'deadly', 'new', 'abominable', 'black', 'straightforward', 'grim', 'gray', 'dark', 'literate', 'medieval', 'strong', 'handwritten', 'much', 'such', 'clever', 'daily', 'unlikely', 'more', 'downbeat', 'nasty', 'less', 'entertaining', 'loose', 'least', 'incidental', 'above', 'easy', 'hard'];-0.0765345765345765

447;bhicks56;david fincher's last three movies have been so individually great and unique, they all speak for their own in different categories. what he does here is take a smart, clever, and grisly script by andrew kevin walker, pull down the shades and throw brad pitt and morgan freeman in a cinematic game that will stand with the silence of the lambs as the greatest thriller of the 90s. set in a city that is almost always gray and wet with rain, this movie does have a depressing feel, but watching this film over and over again, i always feel a bit giddy, as i know that freeman's det. somerset isn't going to retire so easily and that pitt's rookie det. mills is going to get one heck of a first case. they are great together from the start. neither one has much of a sense of humor, but it's funny how odd of a couple they are. somerset is patient, intelligent, and raises his voice as much as he reveals a smile. mills look like a young lion as he jumps into enthusiasm when he works, caring more about action than about research. the thing (and flaw) about fincher movies is that there is hardly any women characters in them. gwyneth paltrow is very weak in her role as mills' wife. she is only used for the climax in which the film is going. but the movie is such a distraction from that minor detail, it almost doesn't matter. the best sequence, hands down, is when mills chases john doe in his apartment, out of the window, into another building, onto a ledge, and into the murky streets of the nameless city. one very smart move the movie has is not only revealing the character a good half hour before the movie is over, but giving him a speaking part which portrays him miles high over the usual cliched killers in cliched thrillers. you'll find very new things to watch in this movie, like other fincher masterpieces the game and fight club. if the kids in scream wanted more creative psycho killers, they got one, with murders like methodical and detailed puzzle pieces all coming to a wicked conclusion that puts everything in a bad game of jeopardy.;7 December 1999;10;['last', 'great', 'unique', 'own', 'different', 'smart', 'clever', 'brad', 'cinematic', 'great', 'gray', 'wet', 'depressing', 'giddy', 'first', 'great', 'much', 'funny', 'odd', 'patient', 'intelligent', 'young', 'fincher', 'weak', 'minor', 'good', 'murky', 'smart', 'good', 'half', 'usual', 'cliched', 'cliched', 'new', 'other', 'creative', 'methodical', 'detailed', 'wicked', 'bad'];0.1818368413195999

456;Strider_1978;"this picture takes some considerable constitution to watch, to endure. se7en is not a nice film. the sets and locations are dark, gritty, grimy, nasty and bleak. there are no bright hues, nothing flashy or rosy to welcome the viewer. what grabs us first(perhaps) are the very real homes of det. mills and det. sommerset. there are sound effects of the police sirens passing by. there are the muffled sounds of neighbours through the walls. there is the ticking of various clocks. this looks a lot like 'real' life. it's quite hard for me to put a lot of this into words. the investigation, after the subsequent finding of the first victim takes mills and sommerset, and the film viewer into a dark, seedy world where the crimes performed by the 'killer' are inspired by the seven deadly sins. it's important, i feel to view se7en from time to time, simply to make us feel better about our own life. the score and the sound effects fit the dirty, nasty unforgiving feel of the film. you arn't sure if it's john doe that is the enemy or the world outside. i'm sure as i type in the safety of my own home somebody somewhere is committing an unspeakable crime. maybe they will be caught. maybe they won't. the acting very good from the main characters, and solid from the lessors. the interesting part of me is looking at how mills and sommerset work as a team, being of an entirely different nature. sommerset is calm, collected, intellectual, elloquent, subtle and wise. sommerset is like a sniffer dog released from the pound after a long and tedious stay. grumpy, intolerant, verbally unrefined, impatient, yet with a good heart. all of the crimes shown strike cords within us. some more horrific than others; all thought provoking and psychologically challenging. just how *do* you continue to eat, completely full and unable to swallow another mouthfull . .only there is a gun to your head and the trigger will end your life it you stop .. it's hard to recommend this one to anyone. film fans i.e those who appreciate a well made movie will be on the edge or their seat come the building chase. others will look on in partial disgust, partial intrigue as the camera shows the horrific detail of john doe's methodical skills. what un-nerves me, is to think that out there there is a john doe out here. he's not count dracula, he's not jack the ripper. he is a normal man, perhaps enjoying a simple life. we might see him in the food market or the pharmacy. we might see him and acknowledge him, or we might not. that individual has a darker plan in his mind that you or i or any *good* people could conceive of, and we won't know until something happens. there are no apologies and no compromises. this is a brilliant, bleak, horrific and psychologically damaging look at the darker side of human nature. highly recommended for those of a mature mindset.";23 November 2006;10;['considerable', 'nice', 'dark', 'gritty', 'grimy', 'nasty', 'bleak', 'bright', 'flashy', 'rosy', 'real', 'sound', 'muffled', 'various', 'real', 'hard', 'subsequent', 'first', 'dark', 'seedy', 'deadly', 'important', 'well', 'own', 'dirty', 'nasty', 'unforgiving', 'sure', 'sure', 'own', 'unspeakable', 'good', 'main', 'solid', 'interesting', 'different', 'calm', 'intellectual', 'subtle', 'wise', 'long', 'tedious', 'grumpy', 'intolerant', 'unrefined', 'impatient', 'good', 'horrific', 'challenging', 'full', 'unable', 'hard', 'partial', 'partial', 'horrific', 'methodical', 'normal', 'simple', 'dark', 'good', 'brilliant', 'bleak', 'horrific', 'damaging', 'dark', 'human', 'mature'];-0.0056891025641025
457;dragonshield;"i wasn't so sure what to expect, either a very brutal and a disturbing movie or an intelligent and an exciting thriller. well, it was brutal at parts, disturbing at times, but it still managed to be an intelligent and an exciting thriller all the way through, a true diamond for the thriller -genre. the movie tells about two homicide detectives, an experienced veteran detective somerset who's about to retire from his job and another detective mills, a rookie who's supposed replace somerset after he's retired. they soon team up together when they find out that there's a serial killer who commits his murders by choosing victims who each represent one of the seven deadly sins. a perfect plot for a thriller indeed. i just mentioned about the plot being perfect for a thriller, but does the screenplay manage that perfection? oh yes, it does. the screenplay (written by andrew kevin walker) is absolutely amazing, along with the whole storytelling. the whole movie is exciting and thrilling throughout all the way from the beginning till the end by not making one single stop or telling any irrelevant subplots. it focuses on the main theme, the whole progress of solving a crime in a very detailed way, making it undeniably one of the best thrillers ever made. another thing mentioned above is that it was brutal and disturbing at times, but it still doesn't take it over the top. i could describe those parts as being important for the film itself. by showing these brutal things it makes you alert and sort of scared, and really makes you despise the unnatural murderer who's behind the horrible crimes. you really start to live the movie itself, you want to catch the criminal and make him pay what he has done. that is because the absolutely brilliant storytelling the movie has, also giving it a very good flow which causes the 2 hours go in a blink of an eye. that is what a real flow should all be about, making a 3 hour long massive epic movie seem like only a 30 minute short film. that is what ""se7en"" manages, a flow that's just so good it's a real pleasure for eyes to see. the directing is close to excellence and it is lead by david fincher whose work i will most certainly be observing in the future, as i was so pleased on the result he managed with ""se7en"". fincher sort of follows the whole story as it should, translating the screenplay on the screen in a very successful and an entertaining way. the movie also got nominated for an academy award back in 1996 in the category of best film editing. to be honest, i immediately noticed how detailed it actually was, how it made that flow even better scene after a scene. it makes the whole movie more immense and stirring, backed up by the great cinematography which gives the movie that dark edge it needs. the music's just gorgeous, building up the tension and making your heart beat very fast when there's these highly intensive scenes, giving the whole movie that final touch. it is composed by one of my favourite composers howard shore and to be honest the music is very much like shore. i can't describe it more precisely, but if you're familiar with his work you know what i'm talking about. starring morgan freeman as detective william somerset and brad pitt as detective david mills a thriller couldn't ask more from the lead actors. both role performances are outstanding and both actors are very convenient in their roles. morgan freeman happens to be one of my favourite actors of all time and he's indeed one of those actors you just have to admire because to me the man hasn't done one single bad role performance in his career. freeman is very convincing as detective somerset, giving the character that freeman -edge it needs, being wise and witty, a perfect mentor. i must admit that brad pitt also happens to be one of my favourite actors and as detective mills he does a superb job, making the character what it's all about, the one with the looks, being fierce and serious. both of the characters have this very realistic depth in them. to me morgan freeman and brad pitt were one of the best pair teams i've ever seen on the screen, they just compliment each other's performances so well it just almost makes me shed a tear. ""se7en"" is all in all an amazing movie. surely one of the best thrillers i've ever seen. it's intensive, immense, exciting, detailed and thrilling, just what all thrillers should be like. everything seems to click in this film; brilliant screenplay, directing close to excellence, great characters and even better role performances, intensive cinematography and music that just captures the whole essence of the thriller -genre. despite the fact of it being somewhat brutal at parts it really doesn't matter in the end, it still isn't that tasteless over the top violence the horror -genre seems to have, so you shouldn't even worry about what i said about it. i'm not saying it's a movie suitable for children, i'm saying it's a movie where even the brutal and disturbing scenes are made with a good taste and a classy style. i'd give it a 9.5/10, but as that is impossible it has to satisfy with the more than deserved 9. all this gives you an absolutely guaranteed motion picture experience, it does it smoothly and it does it with style. a thriller among the best.";22 May 2007;9;['sure', 'brutal', 'disturbing', 'intelligent', 'exciting', 'brutal', 'intelligent', 'exciting', 'true', 'experienced', 'veteran', 'about', 'serial', 'deadly', 'perfect', 'perfect', 'amazing', 'whole', 'whole', 'exciting', 'single', 'irrelevant', 'main', 'whole', 'detailed', 'good', 'brutal', 'important', 'brutal', 'scared', 'unnatural', 'horrible', 'brilliant', 'good', 'real', 'long', 'massive', 'epic', 'short', 'good', 'real', 'close', 'lead', 'pleased', 'whole', 'successful', 'entertaining', 'good', 'honest', 'detailed', 'well', 'whole', 'immense', 'stirring', 'great', 'dark', 'gorgeous', 'intensive', 'whole', 'final', 'favourite', 'honest', 'familiar', 'more', 'lead', 'outstanding', 'convenient', 'favourite', 'single', 'bad', 'convincing', 'wise', 'witty', 'perfect', 'favourite', 'superb', 'fierce', 'serious', 'realistic', 'brad', 'good', 'other', 'amazing', 'good', 'intensive', 'immense', 'exciting', 'detailed', 'thrilling', 'brilliant', 'great', 'well', 'intensive', 'whole', 'brutal', 'top', 'suitable', 'brutal', 'disturbing', 'good', 'classy', 'impossible', 'more', 'good'];0.252596098680436

459;ShinKyo81;"six years after seeing the film, ""se7en"" is considered, in my opinion, the best creation of one brilliant director: david fincher. starting his career with george lucas in ""the return of the jedi"" as camera assistant, now he's one of the most acclaimed film directors in the world. his first worldwide known production was ""alien3"", a sequel of the famous alien saga, the worst of all the saga, however. then, in 1995, ""se7en"" was out, and became a total success. the film is a creepy, thriller production with a crew full of stars: brad pitt, morgan freeman, gwyneth palthrow and the awesome 72nd academy award winner kevin spacey (as leading role in american beauty). and the film was also an innovation in using weird and strange openings. this style was followed by several films like ""mimic"", ""arlington road"", ""spawn"", ""fight club"", etc. focusing on the film, ""se7en"" introduces us detectives david mills (brad pitt) and william somerset (morgan freeman) that are investigating several crimes which at first glance with no connection between them. after a deep search, they will find that only one man is behind all the murderers and with a philosophy: the seven capital sins. with this plot, the film seems to be as other productions of the genre, but it's not. there are several points of ""se7en"" that should be mentioned: <ul><li>brilliant atmosphere, one of the most weird and strange sets and places never seen in a film. the fat man's apartment is incredibly created. there are lots of details, like in the sloth victim's house, with hundreds of that fraganced pine trees (you know, that things for the cars) hanging from the ceiling to cover the smell of the body.</li></ul> <ul><li>excellent performance of the acting crew: every character is well performed by its respective actor/actress. special mention to brad pitt.</li></ul> the following films of fincher (""the game"", ""fight club"", etc.) carry on the style created in ""se7en"". i must say that all the thrillers produced after ""se7en"" are just a rough copy of fincher's masterpiece: they have just copied the atmosphere of the film but with no success. ""se7en"" is the best one nowadays, no matter the budget, no matter the crew. david fincher makes the difference.

462;vav-61764;as i was watching se7en, i was both shocked and fascinated, this movie surely can be used as a mirror to other suspense films to show how they should be made. the anxiety and apprehension grows along the film for having such a captivating story, even if some scenes are very disturbing to watch, you can't take your eyes off. another big contributor to make it more hypnotic is the soundtrack, when it's needed does an incredible work to elevate even more the breathtaking feeling. the director, david fincher, did an amazing job in crafting this movie, it's proved how talented he is and something noteworthy is in some particular scenes, how they were shot regarding the style, angles of the camera that make you feel like you're in the scene. the cast, both leading and supporting, did a marvelous work in performing the characters. they're so consistent and believable, we really have the chance to know the identity of every single one in terms of dreams, emotions, regrets. morgan freeman plays an old detective, somerset, who is fed up with his detective's life, because the city and the world as in general are too hateful, the apathy is present in people's everyday life and he can't take any longer this. he's methodic, pragmatic and due to his long career in the police, he's very meticulous in a crime scene. detective mills is played by brad pitt, different from morgan freeman's character is a young detective with a lot of stamina, enthusiasm but he's reckless and very emotional too. the contrast between the characters is pretty perceptible and is very well explored to show a man already marked by a tough and cruel world, somerset, and other still untouched and a bit naive about the cruelty of the society. the murder scenes are so realistic and disgusting, they really make you feel uncomfortable and revulsion witnessing them and passing how sick the serial killer is. the murderer, john doe, is played by kevin spacey. the tension drastically grows when he's speaking, his performance succeeds in portraying a person mentally disordered, a psychopath. no doubt, john doe after such a remarkable acting gained a sit among the most famous psychopaths of the cinema.;12 July 2015;9;['shocked', 'fascinated', 'other', 'disturbing', 'big', 'hypnotic', 'incredible', 'breathtaking', 'amazing', 'talented', 'noteworthy', 'particular', 'marvelous', 'consistent', 'believable', 'single', 'old', 'general', 'hateful', 'present', 'everyday', 'methodic', 'pragmatic', 'long', 'meticulous', 'brad', 'different', 'young', 'reckless', 'emotional', 'perceptible', 'tough', 'cruel', 'other', 'untouched', 'naive', 'realistic', 'disgusting', 'uncomfortable', 'sick', 'serial', 'remarkable', 'famous'];0.0357654889912954

464;TensersFloatingDisk;"i'm sorry for those of you who think that a watered-down pseudo-sadistic murder spree makes for compelling or an intelligent film. it doesn't. let's set aside for the moment the miserable lighting and cinematography in this film -- half the movie is so monochromatic that it's difficult to tell what you're looking at, and the 'artistic' angles compound the problem. let's set aside the absolutely rotten characterizations -- freeman tries hard with his portrayal of the absolutely-cookie-cutter jaded soon-to-retire cop, but there's nothing there, and brad pitt's scenery-chewing over-the-top ""look at me, i'm sooooo mad!"" rookie-detective turn is, frankly, laughably silly. gwyneth paltrow has absolutely nothing to do, and spacey's character is...well, he's not a character. he's a bit of hackneyed dialogue, without motive, without charisma, without even a semi-consistent tone (we're supposed to believe that this infinitely careful killer is also so ramblingly incompetent that he leaves evidence all over his apartment? that he's so confident he knocks off cops' wives, but so easily frazzled he loses his cool under light questioning in the police car? let's instead focus on plot holes so wide you could toss a horse through them. what kind of police department is this? there is not one attempt to answer some of the obvious questions that would be asked in any murder investigation (is there surveillance video of the lawyer's offices (there would be)? where did the killer get his antibiotics (those things are tracked, numbskulls)? why aren't the cops even trying to predict the killer's victim pattern, after they've been given ridiculously explicit hints? most importantly, the entire ending is completely implausible...under no circumstances would any department, anywhere, ever, send two detectives off with the high-profile confessed murderer like that. when spacey proposes his little 'deal,' the cops would have said ""tough. rot in jail, sicko."" i suppose the success of ""se7en"" proves that if you shower an audience with enough slickly-produced gore (not even that imaginatively rendered), they'll buy it, particularly if you layer on some random pseudo-literary quotation to give it a sheen of ""art."" a sad comment on the state of the horror genre.";15 April 2004;2;['sorry', 'sadistic', 'intelligent', 'miserable', 'monochromatic', 'difficult', 'artistic', 'rotten', 'brad', 'mad', 'silly', 'hackneyed', 'semi', 'consistent', 'careful', 'incompetent', 'confident', 'obvious', 'explicit', 'entire', 'implausible', 'high', 'little', 'tough', 'enough', 'random', 'pseudo', 'literary', 'sad'];-0.1504027777777778

472;dreamingescapist;'what's in the box?' is probably one of the most devastating well-known movie quotes of all time. 'se7en' was a groundbreaking thriller upon its release and a lot ahead of its time. today's post-post-modernist, post-truth and, a post-whatever-cynical era we live now, 'se7en' feels as fresh as the newest release. that says a lot about the masterpiece (and perhaps even more about the times we live in). a cruel, gritty and sadistically realistic serial killer movie that's message and motives are as meticulously crafted as the crimes depicted in the movie. david fincher's visual style was perfect to bring such a disturbing story to life. you might not like it what you see on the screen, but you will not be left untouched by it. appalling and disgusting, yet intelligent. the layered screenplay leaves the viewer in doubt about the morality of humans in general, and what is most frightening, doubt in their own morality. because with our deepest and darkest thoughts we agree with everything that john doe says in the end. and we really don't know who to despise - ourselves or, that monster. the two detectives on the case, young and enthusiastic mills, and old stoic somerset (brad pitt and morgan freeman respectively) form a perfect pair. mills is cocky and, thus seems careless, somerset is always calm and, thus seems not to care. they are both smart investigators and somerset seems like mirror image older mills. i heard someone say about this film that, 'se7en' is the 'saw' for the thinking person. i would say that 'se7en' is really messed up (although masterpiece) buddy-cop movie. and how lucky was kevin spacey in 1995 - getting the chance to act out two of the some of the most infamous movie twists aff all-time in the same year.;21 July 2019;9;['devastating', 'groundbreaking', 'post', 'post', 'modernist', 'post', 'post', 'cynical', 'fresh', 'new', 'more', 'cruel', 'gritty', 'realistic', 'serial', 'visual', 'perfect', 'disturbing', 'untouched', 'appalling', 'disgusting', 'intelligent', 'layered', 'general', 'frightening', 'own', 'deep', 'dark', 'young', 'enthusiastic', 'old', 'stoic', 'perfect', 'cocky', 'careless', 'calm', 'smart', 'old', 'lucky', 'infamous', 'same'];2.094679514036233e-05

477;someokiedude;"""ernest hemingway once wrote 'the world is a fine place, and worth fighting for.' i agree with the second part."" in my explorations into evil, i, along with many other people are often faced with the question into how we must face evil in the world. should we face it and attempt to extinguish it or tolerate it and allow it to go on, because of course there's nothing that we can do to stop it. i've found that nihilism is alluring and can be persuasive, but it's the easy way out, a way for people to drown in their misery and pain rather than getting up and attempting to make their lives and the world better. on the one hand, i'm often baffled when i hear people call se7en a nihilistic film, when it's so clearly not the case. indeed, se7en is a film seeped in nihilism, and to the untrained eye it seems to be falling in completely to the traps of nihilistic thought. it is a peak noir, soaked in hard boiled cynicism and a grungy, unpleasant atmosphere that is both off-putting and remarkably fitting for its cold, bleak landscape. fincher is a director who is not afraid to look into the abyss of human depravity and darkness, and se7en shows in full display the true depravities and wickedness that man is capable of. but se7en's nihilism is often ironic in tone, almost challenging the audience to buy into it, before pulling the rug out from under the audience's feet and exploring its true message. se7en is deceptive, it is difficult, both on an emotionally visceral level and on an intellectual level. at first it seems like a standard noir about two detectives, who don't quite agree with each other and bicker from time to time, going after a deranged psychopath who is leading them on a chase until its inevitable, dark conclusion. but se7en is different in its ability to force the audience to engage with it. you're only given the characters, what they believe, what they say vs what they do, and how they change over time, and that i think is the greatest strength of se7en. somerset is the pinnacle jaded detective, a grizzled old timer beaten down by a hostile, depraved world and a laundry list of bad decisions and regrets that eat away at him, every day of his life. he's given up entirely and has sunk into the pits of despair and nihilism, itching for the day of his retirement so that he can get the hell out of this place that's caused him so much misery for so many years. he is the standard noir protagonist, yet unlike more 'tough guy' personalities, freeman plays somerset as a world weary old man, experienced in its ways. he's not overtly tough or badass in any way, but he's hardly a pushover. it is his arc that gives the film most of its meaning, as he goes through a subtle change from a depressed, broken man into a hopeful and reinvigorated one. it is difficult, filled with strife and some of the most horrific imagery that i've ever seen in a film, along with some harrowing implications of what happened, as it's known, what's not shown is often much scarier than that what is. somerset is the film's soul, contradictory and haunted all at once. mills is somerset's foil in some ways, he is more optimistic and hopeful in nature than somerset, quick tempered and spontaneous, and openly challenges somerset in his own assumptions and beliefs. he is probably the most tragic character of the film, as while he chips away at somerset's beliefs and makes him a better man for it, he ends up paying a hefty price for it. he is steadfast and defiant in his beliefs, unable to give up hope even when it seems to be against him, which rubs off on his more cynical, jaded partner and makes him a better man for it. he may lose everything by the end, but his change of somerset is what makes his role so impactful and shows that he did make a difference, even if he personally lost. if somerset is the film's soul, mills is its heart. john doe is not merely the villain of the film, he is a dark foil to somerset. much like somerset, doe is a man who's been completely shattered by the world around him. though unlike somerset, doe decides to take much more extreme and disturbing measures in response to the constant psychological pain that he goes through every day. he ironically becomes the personification of the evil and nihilism that repulses him. unlike somerset, he is a man willing to take action, rather than allowing it to keep existing. like mills, he makes a deep impression on somerset, a sobering reality on what he could have become if he chose to give in to his most carnal desires. he serves as a reminder to somerset on why evil must be vanquished, and why he simply can't give in to apathy and nihilism. if mills had convinced him that humanity was worth the trouble, then doe was the one who hammered it home to somerset why stopping evil matters, why nihilism and apathy are futile, and why the fight for what's good and noble matters. it is to keep the good, innocent people safe, without thanks or a reward. doe is the film's dark underbelly, the personification of everything that it's railing against, but it's also a pointer to who not to become when dealt with pain and adversity. the lesson of se7en, and the lesson that somerset learns, is that despite all of the evil and depravity around us, it doesn't mean that we should lay down and allow it to keep existing. like somerset, we need to understand that to combat evil, we can't just give in and accept its existence, but that we must go out and confront it everyday and do our best to stop it. now we won't go out and magically solve it over night, and we won't always succeed in completely vanquishing evil, but like with all processes, it only takes one day at a time, and exploring the dangers of succumbing to nihilism and how it is unproductive and even harmful. se7en is a perfect modern noir in every sense of the word. it's dark, moody, intensely violent, and atmospheric. but what makes it unique is its subtle, yet deeply profound message about hope and retaining it even in the darkest of spots. indeed it's an odd film to talk about when it comes to hope when it seems so flagrantly against it. but like with all great films, its true message is elusive, and hard to find, but it certainly can be if you look hard enough. so no, i don't believe that se7en is an endorsement of nihilism. in fact, it's a refutation of it.";2 February 2021;10;['fine', 'worth', 'second', 'many', 'other', 'alluring', 'persuasive', 'easy', 'nihilistic', 'untrained', 'nihilistic', 'peak', 'hard', 'unpleasant',

(if you don't want to watch the film, there is a highly readable film script). you can't but admire the tenacity and the complete obsession of john doe with his project. i had him down as an asperger's syndrome guy right away but i was unsure about his priorities. i mean, we can all empathize with getting a pound of flesh back out of a greedy lawyer, but why did the prostitute have to die? she wasn't the one guilty of lust, her johns are and they got away with only a knife dildo strapped to their groin. and why did he think sloth the worst of all the deadly sins? the victim took a whole year to die a particularly slow and nasty death - much worse than jesus in the passion - while the others were dispatched relatively quickly. i still can't take brad pitt seriously, but kevin spacey has surely deserved his place among the screen's worst baddies.;23 July 2007;9;['many', 'commercial', 'free', 'grisly', 'brad', 'good', 'bad', 'major', 'readable', 'complete', 'unsure', 'greedy', 'guilty', 'strapped', 'bad', 'deadly', 'whole', 'slow', 'nasty', 'bad', 'brad', 'bad'];-0.188392857142857
486;Global_Marketing_Pros;in this analysis the number system based on 12 using 7 is analyzed as symbolic under the christian orthodox faith. this case deals with visual-audio signals used by a serial killer professing to be a judge of 7 deadly sins. by his judgment actor kevin spacey plays the role of the executioner. what does 7 really mean from the bible. the 7 churches of ephesus in persia were well known during the time of jesus christ in the middle east. does 7 really have a symbolic notion underlying a meaning that is a numeration of sins recognized by the chatholic faith that are meant have no other judgment but death by the nature of that sin, and carnation. judgement of life questions the essence of spiritual energy that for roman catholics is the holy spirit. as for philosophy of science we are determined to have free will or determination to act. this is the duality of jesus christ where people are utilized due to the essence of the holy spirit from the father for political science and administration of justice. thus, the motives of actor kevin spacey in this film as analyzed by actor morgan freeman as a detective are based on a catalog of environmental stress over time that manifests itself as becoming a good judge of people. the climax ending is the truth to the plot of seven, that actor kevin spacey is his own jesus christ with the above understanding of an orthodox viewpoint and mundane references to numerous accounts of how the number seven is used in the holy bible. i question the plot of this film based on the use of numbers as with other television shows such as the electric company from public broacasting system (pbs), and himitsu setai goranger. as based on natural science theory and philosophy of science as the freemansons utilized history and great minds to create new technology they manipulated numbers. other than for analysis key historic dates were 1717 and 1919. i think an argument can be made as much as why the number seven is a focal point but of little value in the holy bible as numbers are used by freemasons to establish brotherhood, or occult. personally i would like to see the actor morgan freeman and actor james earl jones appear in a film plot as wise men traveling to see the emperial chinese family of the han dynasty for information to save their people. as found by the valuable silk road into africa, where the stars are used with ancient astrology. they in turn exchange stolen information about an egyptian djed.;13 May 2007;7;['symbolic', 'christian', 'orthodox', 'visual', 'serial', 'deadly', 'known', 'symbolic', 'other', 'spiritual', 'roman', 'determined', 'free', 'political', 'environmental', 'good', 'own', 'above', 'orthodox', 'mundane', 'numerous', 'holy', 'other', 'such', 'electric', 'public', 'natural', 'great', 'new', 'other', 'key', 'historic', 'much', 'focal', 'little', 'holy', 'wise', 'emperial', 'chinese', 'valuable', 'ancient', 'egyptian'];0.0854517396184062

(the lust sin in particular). there is a clear vision that is being executed. however, the focus is not all on the violence, but on the setting and the people as well. the characters all have depth and they feel like real people that we have to spend time with. the scene with pitt, paltrow, and freeman having dinner together is an example of one of these scenes we get that are character driven. the setting is constantly shown off through the mise-en-scene. overall, i thought se7en was an amazing movie. i thought it was written well. there were some great dialogue scenes in the middle of the movie as well as the end. the end was really good one of the best parts of the whole movie. the entire third act is pretty insane to be honest. it was very well written and executed; totally had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. the cinematography, writing, acting, and direction were all very well done. the film was disturbing and gritty yet in a way very real which makes it all the more shocking and the climax is one of the best i have seen in a while. i really liked it and i recommend checking it out especially if you're into darker movies.";30 March 2022;9;['serial', 'various', 'dark', 'gruesome', 'deadly', 'filmed', 'realistic', 'serial', 'real', 'extraordinary', 'possible', 'impactful', 'horrific', 'great', 'good', 'interested', 'surprised', 'aesthetic', 'dark', 'gritty', 'murky', 'beautiful', 'sick', 'other', 'particular', 'clear', 'real', 'amazing', 'great', 'good', 'good', 'whole', 'entire', 'third', 'insane', 'honest', 'whole', 'disturbing', 'gritty', 'real', 'shocking', 'good', 'dark'];0.0718837535014006

495;Degree7;se7en is one of those films you watch in between long intervals. for me, this was my third rewatch and my last. i don't think i have the stomach for another. it is essentially a buddy cop flick, but the script touches on deeper issues of the future of human society, sin, apathy, and predestination. the noir trappings are beautiful to behold, the constant rain, squalor, grimy city that feels like every dystopian metropolis combined into one. but it occasionally veers into fantasy with a plot that relies on a few too many gimmicks to make it flawless. the villain is simply an omnipotent being at times with almost magic powers. there are moments of genuine humanity that doesn't make it completely hopeless, but the atmosphere is filled with so much despair and nihilism that the grunge attitude of it does begin to wear as the clock ticks by. and by the time the villain of the piece makes his grand entry, i kept expecting him to appear with a leather mask on his face and gloating evilly about eating a census taker's liver with fava beans and a nice chianti. still, the dynamic between freeman and pitt is still enticing to watch, and the story works as a parable or even sadistic fable at a rudimentary level. but sometimes i wish the story hadn't been so manipulative and fixed just so that it could punish these characters and push them to insane lengths. i felt like character motivations and development were being engaged at the behest of the plot progression, so certain events begin to seem contrived just so it can reach the shocking conclusion. i assume the writer was trying to teach a lesson, albeit in a clumsy fashion. i would call it a minor 90s classic, and the dreamlike, twilight zone-esque environment adds a nice surreal atmosphere. for those willing to ignore plot conveniences and the dingy weather, this film will take you along for a horrific trip into the darkest recesses of what men are capable of.;19 December 2014;8;['long', 'third', 'last', 'deep', 'human', 'apathy', 'noir', 'beautiful', 'constant', 'grimy', 'dystopian', 'few', 'many', 'flawless', 'magic', 'genuine', 'hopeless', 'much', 'grand', 'fava', 'nice', 'parable', 'sadistic', 'rudimentary', 'manipulative', 'certain', 'shocking', 'clumsy', 'minor', 'nice', 'surreal', 'willing', 'dingy', 'horrific', 'dark', 'capable'];0.1297619047619048

506;NEFARlOUS;"seven is the sort of film that takes several formulaic concepts, dresses them up with something trendy (title screens beginning and end, making me wonder if the guy from homicide got paid), uses stock characterisations, piles on the repulsiveness on the excuse of realism, and then watches the money come in. what we have here is the age-old veteran approaching retirement teamed with a young, aggressive rookie. the parts played somewhat predictably by morgan freeman and brad pitt. the killer in this movie plans to murder six people (seven dead in total) according to the seven deadly sins, hence the title. the ways in which this is accomplished in five of these seems to be calculated to be incredibly disgusting, repulsive and downright offensive. the scriptwriters here certainly are no fan of hitchcock, but rather king. the result of which was to basically make me feel slightly ill and disinterested in the film as a whole. now if they had bothered to put as much effort into the characterisation of messrs freeman and pitt, this would have been a far better movie. as it stands, you care very little for either of them as they just do not seem like real people at all.

540;Sonic_Ocean;getting into the film noir genre was probably one of the best things i've done for myself as a person who loves film. deep, moody stories all the while being stylish and evoking a despondent atmosphere are definitely my type of movies. movies that ask important questions of us dealing with our humanity or depicting the ugliest parts of the human psyche that is disturbingly relevant to our modern society shows that movies are more than just mere entertainment. this is everything that makes se7en a great movie, in my opinion. i could go on and on about the film, but first i have got to talk about the atmosphere that makes the movie so effective in many ways. it is just pure grit and grime and i love the film's consistency in its tone. not just through its sets, but also the color tones that were used to enhance every scene makes each scene moody and ominous. these aesthetics definitely make for a lot of great cinematography and there is quite a number of memorable shots in the film. a key scene for me would be all the scenes taking place in the library, which are definitely some of the most beautiful cinematography i have seen in film thus far. what also makes se7en stand on its two feet are definitely great performances from morgan freeman who makes each movie i've seen him in have depth and character. while freeman delivered a performance to compliment the film's story, kevin spacey was definitely the one to steal the show. to deliver such a disturbing performance that elicits just as much fear as watching hannibal lecter on screen was a feat that i didn't even know could be accomplished. i was holding my breath in every scene he spoke to another character. he was that captivating in his acting performance. i don't know what else to say without spoiling this great movie, other than that anyone who is a fan of the noir genre or just a person who enjoys a good story should definitely watch se7en. the film is so good that i had to include this on my personal list of my top favorite movies of all time. a pure classic in every way.;22 July 2013;10;['good', 'deep', 'moody', 'stylish', 'despondent', 'important', 'ugly', 'human', 'relevant', 'modern', 'more', 'mere', 'great', 'effective', 'many', 'pure', 'moody', 'ominous', 'great', 'memorable', 'key', 'beautiful', 'great', 'disturbing', 'much', 'hannibal', 'great', 'other', 'good', 'good', 'personal', 'top', 'favorite', 'pure'];0.3294334975369458
541;james_norman1981;now don't get me wrong, i love fight club and will write a very positive review of that movie sometime soon. however, to me, se7en will forever be the superior film. the plot, if you haven't seen or heard it before, concerns two detectives. one is old and about to retire while the other is new and fresh to the city. detective lt. william somerset (morgan freeman) is as grizzled a veteran as can be imagined, his lined, elderly face folding into itself with the worries of life and the job in the city of los angeles (i think), a place he regards as hell on earth and which he is very happy to be retiring away from. of course, like every cop on his way out (in hollywood at least) somerset has one last case to face, although it isn't his to take. instead it's the property of a young buck, detective david mills (brad pitt) who initially treats it as 'just another nasty corpse,' in this case a man literally eating himself to death. of course, where director david fincher is involved, a tag like that is bound to be less than the whole story and, before long, a second body is discovered. further plot explanations will only spoil the rest of the film, but stay put through the quiet, if edgy opening and you'll be hugely rewarded. this movie crackles with menace and, even before we meet the man responsible for all the carnage (kevin spacey's 'john doe') you'll have experienced some truly horrifying, terror inducing moments. the fact that few if any of these are the product of screeching music or artificial suspense is a fine testament to fincher's skill and the generally understated production of the film. pitt isn't pretty, somerset is hardly a benevolent mentor and gwyneth paltrow (as mills' wife tracy) is the epitome of be-trodden womanhood, someone whose former carefree existence in some quiet little town outside of la has become a living nightmare inside of it. the cast really shine in this film, as does the director and just about everyone involved. at no point during proceedings are you entirely sure that another horror isn't right around the corner, this despite the fact that the majority of the seven atrocities are seldom even shown on screen. fincher whets our appetite with almost graphic descriptions by junior policemen at the scene and lets the camera play over the locations of the murders just skirting the defiled corpses... but seldomly are we given the full visual. this technique actually makes the whole thing much more disturbing as your imagination is left to fill in the gaps. a corpse on film is seldom unpleasant after you've seen it once or twice. one tantalisingly close yet just out of sight can haunt you far more! and when fincher cheekily allows himself one moment of surprise it bursts from the screen with all the greater force because of his earlier restraint. in this movie the acting, the atmosphere, the direction, the music, the plot and the pacing are all top notch and make this film a must have on dvd. any criticisms i have are limited to a sense that there is a prevalence of style over substance in se7en, something i think fight club also suffers from. the minimalist outlook and constant rain all make for a compelling atmosphere, but you only very occasionally get a feel for how big the case is. instead it more often seems like an irrelevancy in the fast moving metropolis whereas, in fact, the murders are meant to ignite a media frenzy that ultimately leads to the films' incredible conclusion. but that is a minor quibble and one that you must probably accept with all fincher's work. all in all this is a fantastic movie and the perfect antidote to the usual, asinine output from hollywood (and since i'm writing this the day before valentine's day i feel particularly vindicated in saying that!). every cast member does their job perfectly, even the more extreme outbursts of emotion being delivered in such a way as to appear genuine, rather than the 'oh it's just an actor looking for an oscar' pitches that i often feel when i see a modern, 'worthy' film. on top of that you seldom feel like your watching a movie. the director keeps many of his usual tricks to himself this time, instead giving us more of an insight into, rather than presentation of, three extraordinary days in the lives of two ordinary cops (somerset and mills). this understatement and holding back makes for a much better film and, while fight club may be cooler, se7en is superior. therefore my recommendation is: if you haven't seen se7en then do so at the earliest opportunity, though be warned... you'll need a friend close by soon after!;13 February 2006;10;['wrong', 'positive', 'superior', 'old', 'about', 'other', 'new', 'fresh', 'elderly', 'happy', 'least', 'last', 'young', 'nasty', 'less', 'whole', 'second', 'further', 'quiet', 'edgy', 'responsible', 'horrifying', 'few', 'artificial', 'fine', 'pretty', 'benevolent', 'trodden', 'former', 'carefree', 'quiet', 'little', 'sure', 'right', 'fincher', 'graphic', 'junior', 'defiled', 'full', 'whole', 'disturbing', 'unpleasant', 'close', 'great', 'early', 'top', 'minimalist', 'constant', 'compelling', 'big', 'fast', 'incredible', 'minor', 'quibble', 'fantastic', 'perfect', 'usual', 'asinine', 'extreme', 'genuine', 'modern', 'worthy', 'many', 'usual', 'more', 'extraordinary', 'ordinary', 'well', 'cooler', 'superior', 'early', 'close'];0.0996231108073213

544;TonysLittleFriend;"****mega spoilers warning**** detective william somerset is in the last seven days of his career in new york city homicide. he is to spend those seven days showing his replacement, detective david mills the ropes. the first crime scene the pair is sent to investigate is truly a bizarre one, a hugely obese shut-in has eaten himself to death, and is found face-down in a plate of spaghetti. somerset insists that no one would take the time force a man to eat himself to death unless the act itself has meaning that this must be the beginning of something. he asks to be reassigned and is refused. mills asks if he can have the case and is also refused. mills' next case is equally bizarre, a lawyer is found in his office having bled to death after being forced to cut off a pound of his own flesh. the word ""greed"" has been written in his blood on the carpet. meanwhile, somerset returns to the fat man's apartment and finds that the word ""gluttony"" has been written in the grease behind the refrigerator. aha! somerset realizes what's going on, a serial killer is killing his victims based on the seven deadly sins: gluttony, greed, sloth, pride, lust, envy, and wrath. both of the men realize that the killer won't stop his brutal killings until he methodically and creatively executes his victims until his final vision is realized and is remembered, and studied forever. one thing is for sure, this movie is not for the queasy, but apart from that one caveat, i can't recommend it highly enough. the acting by freeman and pitt is what makes this movie one of the greatest crime thrillers of all time. it's stellar! crime movies don't get any better than this, folks. the mystery is clever enough to keep you guessing all the way to the last five minutes of the movie. the direction by fincher is great, the city has never seemed more oppressive or dark. the soundtrack by howard shore i believe is another reason why this thriller ranks above all the rests and sits up with the silence of the lambs. on another note, kevin spacey turns in a truly memorable cameo. in fact, it's better than most lead roles people are giving now a days. he plays a truly disturbed person, and one that you know must be insane. just in this movie alone, spacey proves he is one of the finest actors today. what sold me on this film and just how damn disturbing and dark it is. it's quite amazing. i've yet to see a film that can match next to the upcoming, soon to be classic, ""saw"". how the film didn't get recognized by the academy awards is beyond me. i can't wait to see a movie matches the dark, disturbing and down right brutal way the film plays modern society as place where no one will get away with their sins, and the punishment is unbearable. ****/*****";25 October 2004;10;['last', 'first', 'bizarre', 'hugely', 'obese', 'next', 'bizarre', 'own', 'fat', 'serial', 'deadly', 'brutal', 'final', 'sure', 'great', 'stellar', 'well', 'clever', 'last', 'great', 'oppressive', 'dark', 'memorable', 'well', 'most', 'insane', 'fine', 'disturbing', 'dark', 'amazing', 'upcoming', 'classic', 'dark', 'disturbing', 'right', 'brutal', 'modern', 'unbearable'];0.104679802955665

548;motezart;if fincher didn't invent the convention of the brilliant serial killer always being just one step ahead of the police, he unquestionably perfected it here. this is the twisted psychopath unleashing his vengeance upon the deserving, avaricious world at its absolute best. and this remains fincher's best film. two cops in new york are hunting a serial killer. the presence of the killer is momentous even before the detectives track him down, once caught, the killer is channeled through kevin spacey with a disturbingly authentic evil calm. written by andrew kevin walker, this amazing original script that was almost never made. walker wrote it as an original screenplay around 1991. apparently he was quite depressed at the time. new line cinema bought it, but it took years before it went into production walker went to work on other projects thinking the script would never be made, but it was. it was released sept 22, 1995. by using the seven deadly sins as the basis for justifying the killer's prerogative, the film's plot is definitely one of the best around, added to this amped up, excellent performances by brad pitt and morgan freeman, the production comes off flawlessly, but seven is so haunting and goes down as one of the best thrillers of all time because of fincher's vision of a hellish new york. this world is poison and fincher makes it seep. the grit and grime of the crimes scenes combined with filth of the city streets, alleyways, rooftops, constantly being pounded with rain, darkness engulf even the few happy moments of the film. so much of this film's beauty is in the compilation. the sets and lighting are so complex that making seven must have been the result of a finely tuned crew, each member bulked up on their own creative genius. it is how everything, every element aligns perfectly that makes se7en such a phenomenal filmmaking achievement. more at getthebonesaw.blogspot.com;31 December 2013;10;['brilliant', 'serial', 'twisted', 'deserving', 'avaricious', 'absolute', 'good', 'good', 'serial', 'momentous', 'authentic', 'evil', 'amazing', 'original', 'original', 'depressed', 'new', 'other', 'deadly', 'good', 'excellent', 'brad', 'good', 'hellish', 'few', 'happy', 'much', 'complex', 'tuned', 'own', 'creative', 'phenomenal'];0.352789256198347

552;owen_twistfield;introduction eleven years after it's release i finally got around to seeing se7en. the movie started of well. the characters are believable, the story is intriguing and thought provoking. but then i wonder. why is the fbi able to find that one killer amidst all the thousands upon thousands who borrow books in the library, even if the selection of books is rather exotic? why does the killer not buy the books? he has money enough to spare and the books are easy to buy in any store? and thus he is better to erase his steps. and why does the killer name himself john doe, which is an obvious fake name, but then is silly enough to also register his real address with the library with the obvious result that the police will find him? the library records are actually a key element in the story. the police is able to track down the killer because the fbi is able to find the address of the killer in the library register. indeed there isn't even a list: they get the address and go straight to the killers house. there is more of this in the movie, but nothing is more far fetched than the end. the entire ending rest on the assumption that mills does not once check upon his wife. during the many hours in which the process of justice grinds, not once does mills call his wife. maybe to say hello or to tell her he might be late. and thus at the end the delivery man at exact seven o'clock delivers the gruesome box in the middle of nowhere that causes mills to shoot the killers and thus making it seven kills in all. there is no way the killer could have known the box had to be there at seven o'clock as he had no control over mills being there. it is to much of a coincidence. my conclusion it's a nice movie and might have been a good film if the story elements had been stronger. the movie is too much based on coincidences and contrived elements and this is a pity.;8 November 2006;7;['believable', 'intriguing', 'able', 'exotic', 'easy', 'well', 'obvious', 'fake', 'silly', 'real', 'obvious', 'key', 'able', 'able', 'more', 'fetched', 'entire', 'many', 'late', 'exact', 'gruesome', 'much', 'nice', 'good', 'strong'];0.1865079365079365
553;isaiahwilson15;se7evn once again proves david fincher is the master of composing a story that perfectly balances drama with suspense, and it then finished off with an excellent twist ending. major credit also goes to andrew kevin walker who creates a story that is creepy, compelling and above all original. the progression of se7en is significant as it starts out with an insignificant investigation that evolves into an extremely intense encounter. the movie keeps a good pace whether it's giving the reader time think through what's happened or forcing them to predict what's going to happen. the constant chase makes for a great movie pace, which is further enhanced by the detective duo. brad pitt and morgan freeman are perfectly cast as detectives somerset and mills. the progression of the relationship between the two characters is done perfectly as the viewer sees the ups and downs both characters go through. the introduction of tracy then introduces a huge wild card, which has a huge impact on the mentality of both characters as well as the ending. se7en's villain john doe is what ultimately makes this movie. the brutality, as well as the meaning behind each of his murders, is both fascinating and disgusting at the same time. the scene where mill and somerset question doe as they drive to the location of the final two victims is the best scene of the film. doe finally reveals his motives behind his murders that while they are rather disturbing, do actually make sense. the creep factor of se7en is comparable to that of a scary movie. it's frightening visuals, themes, and the villain makes the movie much more suspenseful and frightening than many would expect. however, its the relatable characters and setting keep the movie grounded. top that all off with one of the best twist ending that leaves the viewer jaw dropped throughout the credits, and you get one of the best thrillers of all time.;2 May 2016;9;['excellent', 'major', 'creepy', 'compelling', 'original', 'significant', 'insignificant', 'intense', 'good', 'constant', 'great', 'brad', 'huge', 'wild', 'huge', 'fascinating', 'disgusting', 'same', 'final', 'good', 'disturbing', 'creep', 'comparable', 'scary', 'frightening', 'suspenseful', 'frightening', 'many', 'relatable', 'top', 'good', 'good'];0.1856481481481482

570;ennieday09;"se7en is unlike any other movie i have seen before. this movie made me realize the genius of david fincher. each scene developed brings a different mindset to the audience because of the surreal art direction that gets into the psyche of the viewer. each moment on screen gives you a feeling of what it is really like to be in the mind of someone who is insane. andrew kevin walker writes a story that is daring, complex, and brilliant. the movie starts off with brad pitt and morgan freeman inspecting the first murder and the different personalities each detective has in the way they work. brad pitt's rebellious attitude and morgan freeman's old school antics is a great team of bold and brass. as each murder occurs, we can see the different reaction it has on the detectives and the way their stature is shaken by these events. each different gruesome murder found increases the shock factor for the audience. to think that one man can do such manipulative and sadistic acts leaves the viewer stunned and wanting more. david fincher couldn't have created a more suspenseful and elaborate plot to keep the audience on edge. while brad pitt and morgan freeman play their role to a t, the real star of the movie is yes spoiler: john doe himself as played by kevin spacey. the shear brilliance of this character is amazing and makes you uneasy with how intellectual and cunning he really is. the famous scene in which he gives himself up to the cops leaves you saying what?! why?! and asking many other questions. while this is his first appearance on screen in the film, the presence of his character only gets better as the movie progresses. the second most famous scene to me has to the be the long monologue the two detectives and john have in the car ride on the way to the murder scene. this to me is one of the most memorable pieces of dialog in any movie i can remember. the genius of this scene is shown mostly in the ways kevin spacey answers the questions the detectives throw at him. example when he questions detective mills about the fact that the people he murdered were innocent, actually leaves yourself questioning, is john doe really the evil one, or is society the devil itself? this was just a prelude to the most amazing ending to any movie i can remember. after the long car drive to the scene where john doe is supposedly showing the detectives where the last two victims of his grand scheme are held, the unexpected hits you like a speeding bullet. in my opinion, i believe that the majority of the people who watched this movie think the last two victims were mills and somerset themselves and john doe was just luring them to the be the final victims of his masterpiece. but david fincher and company leave you with your jaw dropped and eyes wide open. as the scene progresses, a van is seen coming towards their direction. a man comes out saying he is supposed to deliver a box to a detective mills at this time. at this point i'm thinking what in the world could be in that box? is it a bomb? but as detective somerset goes to investigate the box and john doe says that he admires detective mills life, it all slowly starts to piece together. once doe mentions he admires him and his wife tracy, everything starts to make sense. once you find out mills wife tracy's head is in the box you are left speechless with eyes glued to the screen and cannot look away. john doe's famous line, ""it seems that envy is my sin"" is one of the biggest twists in movie history. and finally telling detective mills, ""become vengeance, become wrath"" is still one of the spookiest lines spoken on film to date. when doe is shot and everything is over, you honestly have no idea how you feel. its an assortment of feelings like amazement, sorrow, shock and disbelief. a great film is a film that you can watch over and over again and not get bored. this was one of those movies for me.this is by far my favorite movie off all time and if you watch this classic, maybe it will become a personal favorite of yours as well.";8 October 2009;10;['other', 'different', 'surreal', 'like', 'insane', 'complex', 'brilliant', 'brad', 'first', 'different', 'rebellious', 'old', 'great', 'different', 'different', 'gruesome', 'such', 'manipulative', 'sadistic', 'more', 'suspenseful', 'elaborate', 'real', 'amazing', 'uneasy', 'intellectual', 'cunning', 'famous', 'many', 'other', 'first', 'well', 'second', 'famous', 'long', 'memorable', 'innocent', 'evil', 'amazing', 'long', 'last', 'grand', 'unexpected', 'last', 'final', 'open', 'famous', 'big', 'spooky', 'great', 'bored', 'favorite', 'personal'];0.1386363636363636

(without sounding too apathetic) what is artful about this film is that we never witness the murders. like the detectives, we arrive at the scene. every frame is dimly lit (pitch black at times) & the only glimpse we see of the victims is from the detectives torches. the 'lust' scene is one of the most disturbing moments for me. leland orsers hysterical performance still gives me the most awful feeling in the pit of my stomach. howard shore's score just racks up the films uncomfortable mood x 100, especially in the final scene (wrath). the ending is a piece of cinematic genius, and totally unmissable. one of the greatest endings i've ever seen - it will leave you reeling.

588;FilmLiquet;"two homicide detectives (morgan freeman and brad pitt) are investigating the case of a serial killer, as one of them is about to retire (morgan freeman), whilst the other has just transferred to the precinct and is only starting out (brad pitt). this neo-noir, set in the gritty, grey-looking new york, begins with the character of brad pitt entering a crime scene to introduce himself to his new partner, morgan freeman, however their first interaction proves to be quite cold, as the 'old dog' does not warm up to the newbie. furthermore, they are assigned a mysterious homicide case, in which the killings are linked to the seven deadly sins. the film starts off with a series of fincheresque shots, establishing the morning routine of the detective, then transitioning into a unique introduction title sequence of the film, which focuses our attention on minor details of the shots. it throws us into the action, the music straight away portrays the films as a tense crime thriller, in which the murder scenes send shivers down your spine and make you tense up, expecting a jump scare after every musical build up, keeping the viewer on edge during all times, grabbing our attention and not letting go throughout. however, even though fincher's masterpiece retains the status of a must-watch, the film is more of a stylistic piece, showing off the director's way of seeing things, it might have been better with more content and ironically 'suffers from the sin of self-consciousness' (malcolm d.; the guardian, seven, 04/01/1996). by my opinion it is also one of morgan freeman's best performances in a film.";21 November 2018;8;['brad', 'serial', 'about', 'other', 'gritty', 'brad', 'new', 'first', 'cold', 'old', 'mysterious', 'deadly', 'unique', 'minor', 'tense', 'tense', 'musical', 'more', 'stylistic', 'well', 'more', 'good'];0.0746464646464646

607;from_christmas_past;intentionally gloomy and unintentionally drab, seven can be a difficult movie to watch for many reasons. the murders are shown and described in their most gory form. however, for a crime thriller, the movie moves at a surprisingly slow pace and the plot (beyond the brilliant idea of using seven sins) is almost too basic. understandably, this movie was also to serve as a tirade against society and a critique of crime-ridden cities. but what the film loses in thrill value in achieving this is hardly justifiable, especially when the whole premise of this movie screams a feverishly fast and an intricate battle of wits. the film owes a lot of the accolades it receives to the 'brilliant' twist in the end. however, this film came at a time when the idea of a twist was a fairly novel concept. so, if you have sat though most of chris nolan's and shyamalan's work before seeing this, you could out-think twist in this movie , and perhaps even expect it. that though is not the film's fault. it is watchable for its intriguing premise, good performances and subtle commentary. however, don't be surprised if it fails to fulfil your appetite for a real crime thriller.;27 July 2008;6;['gloomy', 'drab', 'difficult', 'many', 'most', 'gory', 'slow', 'brilliant', 'basic', 'justifiable', 'whole', 'fast', 'intricate', 'brilliant', 'novel', 'most', 'watchable', 'intriguing', 'good', 'subtle', 'surprised', 'real'];0.2104166666666667
608;porazzim42;"this movie was flat-out amazing. it was gripping, fascinating, and not only that but it makes you question your own morality. brad pitt plays david mills, a young detective who thinks he knows it all. morgan freeman plays the seasoned detective who knows the way of the world. these two unalike people are thrust together when a series of murders, that are taking after the 7 sins, take place. what occurs next is a series of gruesome murders that people who have a weak stomach probably shouldn't see. i'll give one example...the ""eat till he burst guy"". pretty revolting. the two actors are amazing, as they usually are. but the real gem of the movie is kevin spacey, although he didn't show up until the end. mills is convinced, as most normal people would be, that john doe, the killer, is just ""crazy"". but as the movie progresses and then you finally hear from the killer at the end, he is more than that. he really isn't ""crazy"" per say. he knows what he's doing and he's quite good at it. he is evil and yet he thinks he's doing this world a favor by killing some of the scum of the face of this planet. as i watched the scene in which spacey describes the people he killed, i had a fleeting moment in which i thought, well maybe he was. and that's what this movie wanted you to think. but this guy was pure evil...the definition of a psychopath. the end of the movie is both shocking and angering. now i'm not going to give away the ending to those who haven't seen it, but for those who have seen it, would you have done what brad pitt did? thjis movie doesn't have a happy ending or leave you with all the answers. it leaves you something to discuss and think about. that's why this movie is amazing.";16 August 2009;10;['flat', 'amazing', 'fascinating', 'own', 'brad', 'young', 'seasoned', 'unalike', 'next', 'gruesome', 'weak', 'amazing', 'real', 'most', 'normal', 'crazy', 'more', 'crazy', 'good', 'evil', 'fleeting', 'pure', 'shocking', 'brad', 'happy', 'amazing'];0.0935374149659863
609;grinningelvis;"i haven't seen this movie in 30 years. i hated it then and i hate it now. ""seven"" is completely of its time and somehow precludes it. there is a winking one-upsmanship in the gore and conventional plotting that brings into sharp focus the gaping plot holes and (even then) familiar tropes of the serial killer fetish. moreover, thirty years later it seems like little more than a music video version of ""silence of the lambs"". pitt, as a character, displays none of the intelligence his ambitious cop is supposed to contain, a problem made more glaring by the grating, doe-eyed plot device that is paltrow. the role is practically the only feminine presence in the film - a theme more common to fincher's work than anyone will admit - and is platformed as a prop with which the script can unload its perversities. and at its core, ""seven"" is just a collection of perversities. one gathers from the busy logic of the english-major screenplay that andrew kevin walker himself has only read the cliff's notes of classic literature. as the reluctant team becomes more enmeshed in the killer's kink, the crimes themselves become less interesting and more obvious, as if the writer and his bad-boy director decidedly front-loaded their queasiest material to ensure that the audience was casually shocked enough to not ask many questions...like where is this movie set (it rains in every scene) and why the fbi isn't involved the very second a high-ranking public official is ritualistically murdered? the film is so intent on sticking its landing that all of the plot just becomes a wash of cartoonish sadism and lots of blank stares from morgan freeman, who seems to be on autopilot here, mainly because once he delivers his grizzled cop lines he has little else to act out. the amateurish playfulness of fincher seems especially shocking when compared to the version of the cerebral crank we have now - the kind of director whose vanity projects revel in specificity and icy pacing. fincher would revisit many aspects of ""seven"" in later, better films (the masterpiece ""zodiac"" and the cool ""mindhunter"") but would drop the trashier elements, all of which seem so glaring here. the film feels young and raw, however, because it has clearly been produced for and by young, raw men with a need to shock - self-serious frat boys nonetheless gathering around a keg and a candle to tell gross-out ghost stories. the movie feels laughably slight even as it scowls at the audience at every turn, as if emphasizing the viscera is the only way to inform the viewer that ""this is heavy, man."" it's a bad movie, made even worse by its reputation as a good one.";9 December 2021;2;['conventional', 'sharp', 'familiar', 'serial', 'little', 'more', 'ambitious', 'glaring', 'eyed', 'paltrow', 'only', 'feminine', 'common', 'busy', 'english', 'major', 'classic', 'reluctant', 'enmeshed', 'interesting', 'obvious', 'bad', 'queasy', 'many', 'second', 'public', 'intent', 'blank', 'grizzled', 'little', 'amateurish', 'shocking', 'cerebral', 'icy', 'many', 'well', 'cool', 'trashy', 'glaring', 'young', 'raw', 'young', 'raw', 'serious', 'frat', 'gross', 'slight', 'only', 'heavy', 'bad', 'bad', 'good'];-0.040546728046728

613;The-Kissable-Writer;"at one point in ""seven"", detective somerset points out that if the serial killer turns out to be the devil, that might live up to their expectations. but who precisely is the man named john doe? he might as well be called 'the man in black'. he's a dark angel on a shoulder, mine and yours, whispering truths we never care to learn. he's that little voice inside ourselves we smother by apathy. he's the anti-conscience unable to relativize the evil forces in this world. or maybe relativizing is just a term often used to mask the fear of facing horrors we're unable to understand and overcome. so we don't even try at all. se7en is as much a thrilling puzzle as an ambiguous morality piece. it present us with a vile world of unpunished sinners where even the biggest heroes lose the fighting courage (somerset), and even the most driven good do-er minds are corrupted (mills). sound familiar? while noir cinema clearly influences fincher's work, ""seven"" plays in present america, and by doing so becomes even more original and relevant. ""seven"" at no point absolves the attrition (""when you regret your sins, but not because you love god."") philosophy preached, but the movie nevertheless sparks intrigue through it by making kevin spacey's john doe incredibly smart and - sidestepping the cliche- not ego-maniacal. he massacres not for fame or as an ill-aimed attempt to avenge his childhood traumas; he ends lives to prove a point. a point he's so determined to make he's willing to give up his own life in doing so. the point in question: sinners deserve to die. do they? we all carry the guilt of at least one mortal sin. let he who is without sin throw the first stone. i feel a little soiled quoting the bible, being an agnostic. fincher is an artist. he doesn't just state his point of view or tries to indoctrinate viewers. in most movies, everything the killer says is the opposite of the movie's message. here, this rule does not apply. why? well, because the center of all that is good and pure in this movie, the young idealistic detective, succumbs to the temptations of vengeance killing. so we basically have two horses pulling in opposite direction. ambiguous! i am firmly against capital punishment personally, but the movie does very well in studying it's characters thoroughly so their motivations ring true, twisted as they may be, they're authentic. besides the brilliant script, ""seven"" has many other virtues. a fault of many good movies, the fault that lowers their status from great to good, is the lack of visual attraction. many serious drama's flaunt production values that barely rise above documentary level. if you're using an audiovisual medium, actually use it. ""seven"" includes some terrific camera shots, fincher follows the noir school in making optimal use of shadows, among others in a scene where the killer's shadow looms in the rain puddle and subsequently threatens detective mills at gunpoint . fincher gives a creative spin even to fairly standard thriller elements. the chase-sequence in the hallway for instance, where the camera finds itself very far from the action so we see the detective chasing a tiny silhouette. instead of using up my thousand words listing awe-inducing audiovisual elements(which i could easily accomplish), i'll spend some attention on a curious element, namely brad pitt's performance. a character actor like morgan freeman can be compared to a singer like frank sinatra, he can't hit a false note if his life depended on trying to do so. even if the end result sometimes is less than impressive, which occurs considering the multitude of roles he takes, he always saves some of the grace. brad pitt on the other hand received more spotlight on his looks than on his acting chops in the early days of his career. the growth process of his acting ability curves bizarrely. he performed remarkably in some early work (""kalifornia"", ""12 monkeys""), yet intersperses those bright bursts of talent with hammy, flat turns in ""seven years in tibet"", ""legends of the fall"", and (certainly in comparison with tom cruise's phenomenal turn) ""interview with the vampire"". my best guess? he needs a lot of direction. why else would fincher get such a great performance out of him in ""seven"" and, let's not forget, ""fight club""? freeman and pitt are star-crossed by spacey though, who - in a surprise, uncredited, appearance - steals the movie. he plays the villain with a familiar patient smart aleckyness, it's scary to think of how much of them could be living right next door. who hasn't got a theory that they're dying to get proved right? how many of them will get the little push that they need? as spacey himself remarked once, people don't recognize him in foreign countries because without his glasses he looks like an ordinary accountant. he's the ideal choice for john doe, bar none. some critics have done injustice to ""seven"" by naming it ""a by the book thriller"". a by the book thriller doesn't deserve to get this much recognition. a scintillating character study embedded into a thriller plot however, that's a whole different story. speaking of stories, the greatest script writers have always understood the ending to be the single most important part of any story. from ""psycho"" over ""the silence of the lambs"" to ""the usual suspects"", masterful conclusions have blown audiences away, flooding them with emotions albeit surprise or shock, anger or overwhelming sadness. this one is all of the above. and it ranks among the very best of the nineties, as does the whole film. it's not a stretch to call it the second most influential and second best thriller of the '90s0";7 February 2009;9;['serial', 'black', 'dark', 'little', 'apathy', 'anti', 'unable', 'evil', 'relativizing', 'unable', 'much', 'ambiguous', 'vile', 'unpunished', 'big', 'good', 'familiar', 'present', 'original', 'relevant', 'smart', 'maniacal', 'determined', 'willing', 'own', 'mortal', 'first', 'soiled', 'agnostic', 'most', 'good', 'pure', 'young', 'idealistic', 'opposite', 'ambiguous', 'capital', 'true', 'authentic', 'brilliant', 'many', 'other', 'many', 'good', 'great', 'good', 'visual', 'many', 'serious', 'audiovisual', 'terrific', 'optimal', 'creative', 'standard', 'tiny', 'audiovisual', 'curious', 'brad', 'false', 'less', 'impressive', 'other', 'more', 'early', 'early', 'bright', 'hammy', 'flat', 'phenomenal', 'good', 'great', 'uncredited', 'familiar', 'patient', 'smart', 'scary', 'much', 'next', 'right', 'many', 'little', 'foreign', 'ordinary', 'ideal', 'much', 'whole', 'different', 'great', 'single', 'important', 'usual', 'masterful', 'overwhelming', 'good', 'whole', 'second', 'influential', 'second', 'good'];0.2275740025740025

618;Bill-276;"i can't remember the last movie i saw that was this full of crap. how did they convince that cast this story would be anything other than the ""t-shirt""/""movie of the week"" brad pitt's character said it was going to be? the performances were fine (particularly freeman's and spacey's). the script, however, was a travesty. first, the consistency of the killings is completely muddled. the first five murders were committed by spacey's character (""john doe""--how original) because of what he perceives to be the sins committed by those he's killed. ok so far. the 6th murder (of paltrow's character) is also done by doe, but not because of a sin she's committed, rather because of the sin doe perceives he has committed. got that? and the 7th murder is done by pitt's character to doe because of the sin mills (pitt) carries with him (i guess?). but even if you link the ""envy"" murder of doe by mills as one of the 7 sinners who ""deserved"" to be killed for their sin, why was paltrow's character killed again? and along with that, why does pitt's character get to live for the sin of wrath? another plot point that i don't think can be overlooked... if doe was the religious lunatic he was presented to be, the murder of paltrow's character and her unborn child would surely have been the 6th and 7th murders. doe was aware she's pregnant. of course, how do you link an unborn child with a deadly sin? i see the writer's problem. his solution was a train wreck. i also didn't buy at all that doe was actually envious of pitt's character. it made for a quirky plot twist, but it seemed so inconsistent for that character. it also didn't make much sense from a plot perspective (see paragraph above). have i got to 7 things yet? did i mention the silly 7 in the title? how about the constant allusions to somerset's knife, the knife tossing, etc... which turns out to be needed most in the film to open a box? i guess if you make the assumption that john doe is insane, then this master plan might make sense to the audience: he's insane, his plan probably shouldn't make sense. but to think that his plan worked, succeeded, was effective or even consistent at all (as somerset's character implies by telling mills not to kill doe and fulfill doe's plan), is giving way to much credit to the writer, and almost no credit to the audience. i recently saw and reviewed michael haneke's ""funny games"" which would fall into the same psychological/horror/thriller genre as ""se7en"". and as much as i was affected by ""funny games"" and impressed by haneke's vision and direction, i said that i couldn't responsibly recommend it. after seeing ""se7en"", however, i finally found haneke's target audience. if ""se7en"" is on your recommended must-see list, then ""funny games"" is really the must-see movie for you.";26 February 2011;1;['last', 'full', 'other', 'fine', 'first', 'original', 'religious', 'unborn', 'aware', 'pregnant', 'unborn', 'deadly', 'envious', 'quirky', 'inconsistent', 'much', 'silly', 'constant', 'insane', 'insane', 'effective', 'consistent', 'much', 'funny', 'same', 'psychological', 'funny', 'recommended', 'funny'];0.034090909090909

629;Andrew-162;"se7en is a very excellent movie. the cinematography is outstanding, and combined with the production design it creates an extremely dark and bleak village (i don't believe they identified it). the screenplay is intelligently written, the direction is well done also. though brad pitt, who to this date i have seen him act well only once (12 monkeys), is not very convincing as detective david mills, it doesn't really matter. morgan freeman is incredible as always, playing his calm, cool and wise character he has mastered in every way. kevin spacey is breathtaking in his small but pivotal role. he does his best supporting work ever here, he was only better in the usual suspects, and possibly l.a. confidential. the film starts out on a crime scene, where we are introduced to detective mills (pitt) and somerset (freeman). they talk, and we learn that mills is new in the force, and that somerset is a veteran that is retiring within the week. they don't get along well, and when they find a mysterious murder (an overweight man was forced to eat spaghetti until he burst, and the word gluttony is found written in grease on the wall) somerset suggests he be moved to a different case as well as mills. this is denied, of course. the 2 find a couple other murders with words written bizzarely on the walls or the floor, and they deduce that the murders are linked to a serial killer who kills according to the seven deadly sins. though i saw the censored version on abc and probably didn't get the full effect of the movie, i still think i have a pretty good idea of the movie's quality. it's brilliant. so then why is this movie only a 3 out of 4? there are missing links to the story, and sometimes there is too much relying on suspension of belief. however, you must see this movie, if not just for the last 20 minutes where we finally meet john doe, the man behind the killings who to the amazement of mills and somerset hands himself in and volunteers to give a full signed confession to all of the crimes. the catch? to take mills and somerset, alone, to the scenes of the last 2 ""killings"".......";16 November 1999;7;['excellent', 'outstanding', 'dark', 'bleak', 'brad', 'convincing', 'incredible', 'cool', 'wise', 'small', 'pivotal', 'well', 'usual', 'new', 'mysterious', 'overweight', 'different', 'other', 'serial', 'deadly', 'full', 'good', 'brilliant', 'last', 'full', 'last'];0.2433982683982684

632;fritzgagi;a psychopathic killer goes around killing people, staging their death according to one of the seven deadly sins. two cops are assigned for the case, one is experienced and stoic and one is impulsive and heated. as they investigate the case, they get caught up in the killers game and need to immerse themselves in his psyche. david fincher orchestrates this film as a pretty straightforward thriller for the most part. the two cops go from crime scene to crime while both of their characters get explored and you get to understand why they work how they do. the dynamic between morgan freeman and brad pitt really works here because neither of them is a cardboard cutout, simply there to convey their respective life mottos, but real three-dimensional human beings, allowing for some genuine conflict. the killer here is a self-perceived messenger of god, on a mission to show everyone how messed up the world has become. kevin spacey portrays him as intelligent and seemingly controlled, rather than insane, which you would expect from someone who puts heads in shoe boxes, thus making this villain scary as hell. the ending is plotted perfectly and it thematically rounds up the movie. although its pacing isn't pulled off as perfectly as its written, its still one of the best endings you'll ever see in a thriller.;12 August 2012;8;['psychopathic', 'deadly', 'experienced', 'stoic', 'impulsive', 'heated', 'straightforward', 'most', 'respective', 'real', 'dimensional', 'human', 'genuine', 'intelligent', 'insane', 'scary', 'good'];0.2068181818181818

643;RolltheClip;the origins of my love for cinema began when i started to discover many films similar to se7en, ones that really provoke mass discussion long after seeing them. that overwhelming necessity to really explore the deeper meaning of the movie. they don't just aim to entertain, but to challenge opinions and push people to comprehend short-comings in society. when the young, cocksure detective mills (brad pitt) moves to the city hoping for a more thrilling line of police work, a string of murders are set in motion. he is consequently partnered with the diligent veteran, detective lieutenant somerset (morgan freeman) to resolve the case, forcing them to put aside their differences to end the sequence of events, only to become pawns on a much larger board. throughout the feature you get the feeling that these are two very different walks of life, the generational divide in their work methods are shown clearly. whilst somerset is cultured, world-weary and methodical, mills is very impulsive and head strong, aiming to make an impression within the force yet not having the same determination when investigating. a montage shows pitt's character is struggling to concentrate at home, meanwhile, his elder is shown pouring over books in a library, making reasonable headway with the case. this is no buddy-cop movie, it's unrelenting and brutal throughout. although all the murders happen off-screen, the events are retold via the crime scene investigations and photographic evidence which enhance the aura of mystery around the killer, building up to the final chilling performance by kevin spacey as their very own john doe. blank of regret and emotion, he fits the performance perfectly as you can see the criminal exuding delight as the detectives are forced to pursue him through the grisly cat and mouse game. one of the ways that fincher expresses how twisted the city-living can become is by the similarities between the characteristics of the 'insane' doe and the disciplined somerset. they act as two parallel examples of how someone can deal with a poor hand. where the detective originally set out to better the world via law enforcement, using his intellect to prevent misconduct, john doe executes a series of pre- meditated murders using his knowledge as a message to the masses. their cynical outlook on how humanity has become so apathetic is resolved in two completely polar ways, their likeness fascinates me. i believe that part of david fincher's plan when filming this was to hold a mirror to modern society. for us to scrutinise why, when murders are committed, we show no empathy? horrors and tragedies are a staple fixture of the world today and much like fincher's 'fight club' adaptation, it questions the very core of how compassion seems to have become less predominant, replaced by a love for money, consumerism and our own well-being. how accustomed we have become to awful events described by various media outlets on a a daily basis. all roles perfectly delivered by all actors involved. the ending flawlessly ties all loose ends within the plot whilst delivering its distressing climax, undoubtedly still provoking debates over a decade after its initial release.;20 March 2014;9;['many', 'similar', 'mass', 'overwhelming', 'deep', 'short', 'young', 'thrilling', 'diligent', 'large', 'different', 'generational', 'cultured', 'weary', 'methodical', 'impulsive', 'strong', 'same', 'reasonable', 'unrelenting', 'brutal', 'photographic', 'final', 'chilling', 'own', 'blank', 'criminal', 'grisly', 'insane', 'parallel', 'poor', 'meditated', 'cynical', 'apathetic', 'polar', 'modern', 'staple', 'much', 'very', 'predominant', 'own', 'accustomed', 'awful', 'various', 'daily', 'loose', 'distressing', 'initial'];-0.0366979794399149

(possible spoilers) the two preachers of the film are john doe, the character portrayed by kevin spacey, and the director, david fincher. fincher's film has a purpose just like that of john doe's murders, to shock american into recognition of its major faults: its sins. unfortunately fincher's point is lost in his bombastic and brazen style which dominates all of his films. fincher seems to be quite the cynic in his view of the world. in ""se7en"" there's not a person in the world, or at least nyc, that's not a sinner, and we're living on a veritable hell on earth. ""the game"" presents a paranoid world where no one's life and security are concrete and ""fight club"" shows us just how superficial of a culture we are. unfortunately, fincher also seems to be an optimist at heart, and this is where his films lose their potency. at the end of each film he tries to give some glimpse of hope. at the end of ""se7en"" morgan freeman quotes hemingway, saying ""'the world is a fine place and worth fighting for.' i agree with the second part."" at the end of ""the game"" it turns out the paranoia was only part of an intricate joke and ""fight club"" falls apart on itself when(among other things) it tries to present some sort of solution, which was, best as i could tell, love. if only fincher didn't try to provide some sort of happy ending(albeit minimal as in this film) his films could be much more powerful(like neil labute's ""in the company of men"" and ""your friends and neighbors"".) he makes his point and then unfortunately loses it in an overblown style and ludicrous attempts at happy endings. compared to the rest of his work though, ""se7en"" is his most effective film to date with fine performances by freeman and spacey.";10 April 2000;7;['possible', 'major', 'bombastic', 'cynic', 'least', 'veritable', 'paranoid', 'concrete', 'superficial', 'fine', 'worth', 'second', 'intricate', 'other', 'good', 'happy', 'minimal', 'more', 'overblown', 'ludicrous', 'happy', 'effective', 'fine'];0.2813888888888888

(john milton, paradise lost, book ii. line 432) ""seven deadly sins, seven ways to die"" is the tag-line for this intense psychological thriller directed by david fincher: ~ detective sergeant mills (brad pitt) is set to replace detective lieutenant somerset (morgan freeman), a world-weary cop retiring after years on the force. somerset can see no end to the harrowing crimes he has witnessed, the sickness that is the city. dealing with murder, rape, abuse, and poverty has become the lieutenant's life and he now hopes for some small shred of peace. mills, on the other hand, is new to the city; he is arrogant and brash, having little time for somerset's thoughtful and analytical techniques. as retirement beckons, so a new spate of killings begin. like it or not, somerset is given the investigation by the captain (r lee ermey) while mills is put on a different case. the murders are soon linked to the same killer - a twisted genius who chooses his victims based on the seven deadly sins in dante alighieri's 'the divine comedy' - and mills and somerset are paired together once more. despite their clash of personalities mills and somerset strike up a good partnership, somerset's introspectiveness and mills's self-confidence turning out to be a useful combination. each one learns a lot from the other; indeed, mills's wife (gwyneth paltrow) thinks somerset is a good influence on the husband she is rapidly growing concerned about. it soon becomes apparent that the 'sins' killer is playing a deadly cat-and-mouse game with the detectives, enjoying watching them either stumble or succeed at every turn in the case ... while he continues to kill according to the seven deadly sins: gluttony, greed, sloth, envy, wrath, pride, lust. they must stop him before he can finish his murder spree and most probably disappear forever ~ se7en is not only the most accomplished film by david fincher (zodiac) but almost certainly - from a writing and directing viewpoint - the best psychological thriller in the history of film and television. there are none of the stereotypical cliches found in countless thrillers of violence, no room for the predictable, for the viewer is kept constantly in the dark until the very end. and the climax is both ferocious and awe-striking ... for once hollywood kept the outcome a secret until the day of release, not an easy thing to do. whatever vision andrew kevin walker had before he took his script to screenwriter david koepp (secret window) was ultimately realised once in the hands of david fincher. fincher's dark and rain-driven sewer, his city of sins, has yet to be matched on film. his choice of cast was spot-on. se7en is a true classic, crossing genres like crime, horror, thriller and police procedural ... dark and moody, harrowing and painful, se7en will appeal to the darker side within us all. co-stars john c mcginley as california (captain of swat team) matthew j lee-williams, review.";2 December 2007;10;['deadly', 'intense', 'psychological', 'weary', 'harrowing', 'small', 'other', 'new', 'arrogant', 'brash', 'little', 'thoughtful', 'analytical', 'new', 'different', 'same', 'twisted', 'deadly', 'divine', 'more', 'good', 'useful', 'other', 'good', 'concerned', 'apparent', 'deadly', 'deadly', 'accomplished', 'good', 'psychological', 'stereotypical', 'countless', 'predictable', 'very', 'ferocious', 'easy', 'secret', 'dark', 'true', 'procedural', 'dark', 'moody', 'harrowing', 'painful', 'dark'];0.035410927456382

689;RedRoadster;"it is a rarity for a film to be completely unsettling and yet unrelentingly gripping. david fincher's story takes place in a bleak and constantly raining city (never named) where urban decay and sleaze in all forms are rampant. coming up to his retirement from the police force is detective lieutenant somerset (morgan freeman) who is tasked with breaking in his replacement, detective sergeant mills (brad pitt) before leaving. somerset is world weary, under no illusions about the futility of the daily role he plays and (initially) wants nothing more than to escape the grime and violence of the city. mills on the other hand is convinced that he is going to make a real difference having voluntarily transferred to this precinct, bringing his wife to the city with him. before somerset can move on, a homicide comes in which he and mills are assigned to investigate. but its only the first of a string of ritual murders that will be committed by a killer who is basing his crimes on the seven deadly sins as depicted in dante's ""the divine comedy"". to begin with, se7en appears to be a standard ""cops on the trail of a killer"" story which shouldn't be too difficult for the audience to get comfortable with. but as we descend along with the characters into the merciless, brutal world without hope that they inhabit, you are left reeling at the events that unfold. the two detectives enjoy an uneasy relationship with no real friendship ever striking up between them. the older somerset is educated, astute and gives the impression of being emotionally burnt out. mills, who has no respect for somersets methodical investigating gets excited at the thought of solving a murder and firmly believes that the good guys will win eventually. the further we get into the action, the might of the evil that they face pushes both men beyond their limits. this film draws heavily on biblical themes and you can certainly see similarities with such films as ""the seventh seal"" (1957). both films show the price that good men have to pay when they fight evil and the unsettling truth that the rule book goes straight out the window when you are dealing with something so diabolical that it has no boundaries or limits at all. se7en shows us a world which has been destroyed by its own sins, a wasteland in which values are minimal. the killer, having nothing but contempt for this world, sees it as his mission to expose the faults and show everyone what they have become. it is a fascinating twist that when the killers motives become clearer, somerset with his greater understanding actually feels some degree of empathy with him. this is lost on mills though, whose level of clarity never reaches the same point. a previous reviewer mentioned that you begin to expect the unexpected whilst watching se7en and i completely agree. eventually if you think of the most obvious outcome in any situation and predict that the opposite will happen, it usually does. even the finale itself became kind of predictable because by then you are conditioned not to have any hope. this is a minor flaw though because the story is so well and so shockingly told. director david fincher didn't pick up another script for 18 months, such was his exhaustion and frustration following the completion of alien 3. apparently he agreed to direct se7en after one reading of andrew kevin walkers screenplay because he was drawn to its hard hitting delivery about inhumanity. he stated: ""it's psychologically violent. it implies so much, not about why you did but how you did it"". for the camera work specially altered film stock was used to make the visuals look as dark and unsettling as possible which is complemented well by howard shores music score. the most disturbing message that se7en puts across, is that the fight against evil is destined to be a pyrrhic victory. but regardless the only thing we can do is fight on whatever the cost. we have no other choice.

725;billreynolds;"se7en is a very complex and deep movie, while also being quite disturbing. andrew kevin walker created one of the most original spec screenplays of all time, but it is the kind of story traditionally used more as a writing sample than actually made into a movie. but the creative team of director david fincher believed in this extremely dark, uncompromising story, and made it just the way walker wrote it. the story revolves around two extremely well-drawn characters, david mills (brad pitt) and william somerset (morgan freeman). in one sense their relationship is the ultimate cliche -- the old veteran cop paired up with the brash rookie (though mills is not actually a rookie, just new to the unnamed city where the movie takes place). but the contrast between these two characters is played out not for laughs or cheap drama but as the real working out of a moral question. somerset, the lonely, cynical older detective, cares about people but has seen too much of the dark side of life to have much hope for society. mills is not as intelligent as somerset (kudos to pitt for being willing to play a character that frequently looks foolish), and he lives by a simplistic belief in the power of law enforcement to change the world. throughout the movie, the two characters struggle with this conflict -- is human society basically rotten, and can one person do anything to make a difference? somerset, an intelligent, well-read man, is smart enough to recognize the truth, however painful that is. mills is the kind of person who has never truly questioned the simple ""values"" he was raised with. somerset tries to educate him, tries to warn him, but ultimately fails. in the end, it is only john doe, the serial killer, who can teach mills (and by extension the audience) the truth -- that this world is very often shockingly vicious and senselessly cruel. doe and somerset actually have similar views of society and the world, up to a point. but while somerset still cares about his fellow human beings, doe hates them, and takes out his rage in a series of gruesome murders based on the seven deadly sins. this movie is about the investigation mills and somerset undertake of doe's murders, his ""sermon"" to the world through serial killing. ultimately, mills and somerset can only do so much to try to stop doe; the killer always seems at least one step ahead of them, and stays that way until the very end of the movie. in a normal hollywood film, mills and somerset would ""win"" in the end by catching doe and setting the world right again. but andy walker had a quite different ending in mind, and fincher and his team take the shocking conclusion all the way to the limit of tension and drama. this movie, like fincher's ""fight club,"" was controversial for being violent and gruesome. certainly there are a number of gruesome and disturbing images of murder victims' bodies, and many aspects of the story are very troubling, to say the least. but only one person is shown being killed on screen, and by far the worst of what happens in this story happens in the viewer's imagination. unlike most films that have high levels of violence -- including, for example, reservoir dogs or silence of the lambs -- this movie genuinely attempts to grapple with the moral implications of what is being shown on screen. in direct contrast with, say quentin tarantino, who uses extreme violence for shock effect and to gain notoriety, fincher actually shows less violence on screen and raises far more probing moral questions in the viewer's mind. i cannot think of any movie that contains as much genuine debate and discussion among the characters about crime and human morality as this one does -- while never becoming dull or preachy for a moment. i cannot finish this review without a word about mr. fincher's extraordinary visual talents. this is a man who ranks with the top handful of directors of all time in his knowledge and grasp of film-making technique. everything from set design to lighting, selection of film stock and processing techniques, camera movement, frame composition, and editing work together to create an entirely new level of visual brilliance. fincher's use of technique brings to mind nothing more than the work of steven spielberg in the 1970s, the last time a director this extraordinary burst onto the hollywood scene. a whole generation has passed since then, and there is a new wave of techniques and tools available to the filmmaker of the nineties. fincher uses every one of these tools to their utmost. the technical work and supporting actors are uniformly superb. this is a movie that works on every level. andy walker, having written a mind-blowing screenplay, must have been stunned when he saw the finished film. this movie will rock you to the core.";7 June 2005;10;['complex', 'deep', 'disturbing', 'original', 'more', 'creative', 'dark', 'ultimate', 'old', 'new', 'unnamed', 'cheap', 'moral', 'lonely', 'cynical', 'old', 'much', 'dark', 'much', 'intelligent', 'willing', 'foolish', 'simplistic', 'human', 'intelligent', 'smart', 'painful', 'simple', 'serial', 'vicious', 'cruel', 'similar', 'fellow', 'human', 'gruesome', 'deadly', 'serial', 'very', 'normal', 'different', 'shocking', 'controversial', 'violent', 'gruesome', 'gruesome', 'disturbing', 'many', 'troubling', 'least', 'bad', 'most', 'high', 'reservoir', 'moral', 'direct', 'extreme', 'less', 'moral', 'much', 'genuine', 'human', 'dull', 'preachy', 'extraordinary', 'visual', 'top', 'set', 'new', 'visual', 'more', 'last', 'extraordinary', 'whole', 'new', 'available', 'utmost', 'technical', 'finished'];-0.0494264069264069

738;eadaoin7;"first of all, i would like to make a few comments about some of the other comments on the movie: first of all, it was actually intentional that brad pitt seem somewhat cocky & ne'er-do-well in his role; the point of his character was that he most likely came from a smallish town's precinct where the hardest crime was probably stealing from the collection plate, and his attitude was looked up to. in a small town. he, in their minds, had the attitude of ""those movie & tv cops"". in l.a., an attitude doesn't even get you a latte. so his bravado is supposed to be misplaced. but what does come through is the fact that he honestly does want to do the right thing his own way, and ""get the bad guys & teach them some manners"", usually with a lot of verbal & some physical abuse. typical small-town, or rent-a-cop, mindset. secondly, a lot of people claim that the gore was hard to take...what gore? we only see the aftermath of the murders, not what they go through. and what they go through is only speculated upon, not hard-cold fact. the gore is in the mind of the audience. frankly i am quite please that they took that approach, as it shows that the writers, producers, directors are giving the audience some credit for having minds & imaginations. hollywood thinking their audience has a few brain cells--go figure... to sum up my feelings on the movie, i have to quote the artistic director, rob bottin, on this one--""this is a script that definitely gave me the butt-willies!"" from beginning almost to the end, i was impressed by not only the idea, but the approach to such an idea. and a haunting thought occurred to me...why hasn't this ever been done before in real life? or has it, but was not clued in to? not that i'm hoping this is so, of course!! i think that given the circumstances, the victims were actually handled with dignity. so many times in movies, the victims are exploited because most of hollywood thinks that we only want shock and after-death scandals. here, there was no dirty laundry airing, no contrite bloodletting...just the sad fact that they were everyday people in everyday lives (whether we want to admit it or not), and chosen to fit a specific killer's agenda. much like most other serial killers. morgan freeman, as usual, does no wrong, and brings a quiet grandness to his role (and every role). brad pitt, with the aforementioned background character, holds his own and does a pretty impressive job to get most of us to forget that he's known for his looks alone. gwyneth paltrow isn't given much to do, but she does it amiably. and r. lee ermey, as always, is a comic-relief treat (ring...""this is not even my desk!"" slam!). plus, how much fun was it for us to see ""shaft"" as the governor?? one minor flaw i feel compelled to say, and this is just my opinion: not the actor portraying him, but the character of john doe, left me a little dry. when he first arrived in the station, his character seemed to fit with all that was discovered in his apartment. but once he started talking, he fell into the same old hollywood killer mode. giving away all of his motives and intentions and thought processes right before the end. this contriteness is in every killer movie, and was a sore disappointment. for me. personally, i would have preferred not to have him speak at all, or very minimally. case in point, at the very end when mills has the gun on him and somerset rushes up after receiving the box. doe goes into saying what his role is in the 7 deadly sins, and what mills' role will be as well...hasn't that been implied already?? we know who will be what sin, just by the set-up! and there's only two left--i think we can tell who is which! sorry, but hollywood--take note, please - we don't need every killer's life story, motives, and intentions spoon-fed to us. besides, with everything only being implied in the rest of the film, having john doe go into such a self-serving diatribe really goes against the grain, and gives the feel of the film a 180 turn...which makes it all the more sad when the first hour & 45 minutes have proved that the writers, et al, have the intelligence to not stoop to that level. however that is my only beef with the film. the rest; above par, superb, magnificent, and a must-see...that you will be seeing in your conscious and subconscious for a long while after the film ends. guaranteed.";2 March 2004;8;['few', 'other', 'intentional', 'cocky', 'smallish', 'hard', 'small', 'right', 'own', 'bad', 'verbal', 'physical', 'typical', 'small', 'hard', 'hard', 'cold', 'please', 'few', 'artistic', 'real', 'many', 'most', 'dirty', 'laundry', 'contrite', 'sad', 'everyday', 'everyday', 'specific', 'most', 'other', 'serial', 'usual', 'quiet', 'aforementioned', 'own', 'impressive', 'most', 'much', 'comic', 'much', 'minor', 'little', 'dry', 'same', 'old', 'sore', 'very', 'deadly', 'left', 'sorry', 'sad', 'first', 'only', 'superb', 'magnificent', 'conscious', 'subconscious', 'long'];0.0207066869300911

753;gaur-abhi;"writing a review for this movie seems to be almost as difficult as the exercise of watching it. no, please do not take it in the negative sense. but the adjectives that come to the mind when thinking about the movie are very mixed, ""brilliant"", ""grotesque"", ""depressing"", ""brutal"", ""unique"". the story is that of a psychotic killer, whose each kill is a 'modern day' representation of the original seven sins from the ancient texts. the sins are gluttony, sloth, greed, pride, lust, envy and wrath. brad pitt and morgan freeman are the two homicide detectives that have been assigned this case. in fact, it is morgan's last case, as he is due to retire soon. the case becomes more and more intriguing as each murder unfolds. each murder is more gruesome and more gory than the previous one. (i must say at this point that it has been one of the most difficult movies to watch. watching it alone at night ,as i did, is definitely not recommended.) by this time audience is certain that the killer is brilliant but a very twisted guy. a very clever technique employed by the director here is that he has not shown any crime being done in action, all are just the post murder shots of the dead. just the level of detailing shown in the movie makes an amazing treat. morgan freeman is as usual very good. but it is brad pitt that really shows amazing acting abilities especially during the last part of the movie, the final confrontation scene between brad, morgan and the killer. having said that movie belongs to the killer, who is the eventual winner (you will have to see the movie to find that out). kevin spacey as the killer has only around 15-20 minutes of the role during the end. but by jove, he does carry it off amazingly well. while watching the movie, i was really wondering how would the director show the viciousness of the killer, which he has shown earlier during the murders. but spacey carries it out with ease. he is a rare breed of an actor. a class apart. one had to just look in to his eyes and the expressions on his face, to become convinced that he is same person that performed all those murders. also worth mentioning is how well the movie ends. the last sequence, the last two murders ( or should i say the sins) are a treat to watch. what an ending. in the end, i would like to quote the brilliant director himself, mr david fincher, to understand why the movie is so dark, stark and gruesome.

778;Furious_Fenner;7 gruesome murders. each gruesome for any number of reasons. one of the darkest and most disturbing thrillers ever, david fincher's se7en set a benchmark when released that has rarely if at all been matched since. in only his second ever film, fincher takes us on a roller-coaster ride of religious fanaticism that shocks, intrigues and horrifies the audience. morgan freeman is a week away from retirement. brad pitt is a week away from replacing him. the pair form an unlikely pair during the curious case of a morbidly obese man who appears to have been forced to eat himself to death. somerset (freeman) believes that it is the beginning. mills (pitt) thinks that it is simple ironic torture. however, a second man is found bled to death, with greed written on the crime scene floor. a second trip to the first location reveals the word gluttony behind a fridge. soon the unlikely duo find themselves hunting a killer who appears to be using the seven deadly sins as both his template and as a murder weapon. fincher's piece of cinematic brilliance is a roller-coaster ride of exhilaration, shock, revulsion and curiosity, and shows a flair of direction that fincher would later show in fight club. his use of directorial techniques, such as his eradication of colour and light from his dark, wet and gloomy sets creates a near nightmare like brooding universe which simply adds to the sinister nature of the investigation. unsurprisingly, the murders are horrific to say the least, although much is actually left to the audience's imagination. the unconventional partnership of freeman and pitt is entertaining, with pitt resenting freeman's almost patronising wisdom, with freeman hating pitt's gung ho, unsubtle attitude. both excel in their roles, as does gwyneth paltrow as mills' frustrated wife. r. lee ermey and john c. mcginley, are, much like the rest of the supporting cast, well judged and make good work of their small roles. however, the most eye catching performance is by the unexpected kevin spacey as the killer. although he doesn't have much screen time, he is terrifying as the righteous and almost serene john doe, convinced that he is doing god's work, and carrying it out with cold cunning and confirmed enthusiasm. it's this planning that paves way for the stunning conclusion, that is both shocking and brilliantly set up. the big star, though, is fincher. the director redeems himself brilliantly following the much slated alien 3, using unconventional techniques ,the creation of a sinister atmosphere, his control of events as well as the pacing that help make the film so memorable. that and the seven gruesome murders, of course.;5 April 2006;10;['gruesome', 'gruesome', 'dark', 'disturbing', 'second', 'religious', 'unlikely', 'curious', 'obese', 'simple', 'ironic', 'second', 'second', 'first', 'unlikely', 'deadly', 'cinematic', 'directorial', 'such', 'dark', 'wet', 'gloomy', 'near', 'sinister', 'horrific', 'least', 'much', 'unconventional', 'entertaining', 'patronising', 'unsubtle', 'frustrated', 'good', 'small', 'unexpected', 'much', 'righteous', 'serene', 'cold', 'stunning', 'shocking', 'big', 'fincher', 'much', 'unconventional', 'sinister', 'memorable', 'gruesome'];-0.1729729729729729

785;youllneverbe;"""se7en"" (1995) dir: david fincher there's no cinematic theme i can think of that has run the gamut from trash to high art (via blockbuster) quite like the serial killer movie. throughout the history of the medium, many of these films have failed to captivate large audiences the way that ""se7en"" did and continues to do, usually because they were either shamelessly exploitative or far too deliberately psychological in their approach for most viewers. it's a tough balance for a filmmaker to strike, but with ""se7en"" david fincher made it look so simple. it is one of the best serial killer movies ever made. part of the reason film-goers consider freeman, pitt and spacey so highly today is because of ""se7en"". all three actors excel in their roles. freeman's detective somerset is a week away from retirement when he becomes involved, alongside his own replacement detective mills (pitt), in what is surely the most horrific multiple murder case of his long career. mills is determined not to shy away from his first case in town, and is shown to be more impulsive than the erudite somerset, who immediately connects the killings to several great literary works including ""the divine comedy"" and the writings of st thomas aquinas. they are always lagging behind the killer, walking solemnly through endless downpours to survey the crime scene of these increasingly sick murders, barely able to grasp the calculated depravity of the man they are chasing. there are brief meditations on human apathy by both freeman's character and the killer himself but aside from these, ""se7en"" is essentially plot- and character-driven. this works to its great advantage - too much philosophy would have affected the momentum of the film, which is expertly weighted and allowed to accumulate at the right points. nothing is cliched, and there are no simplistic 'red herrings' to stretch the action out. it is a thoroughly modern crime film that borrows the religious themes from horror and parts of its aesthetic from film noir, successfully widening its appeal in the process. i've learnt to slightly concede in my critical judgement over years of watching silent films, art films, propaganda films, slow-moving european epics, counterculture movies et cetera, and so part of the reason i enjoyed ""se7en"" so much is that i didn't need to concede anything while watching it. quite the opposite, i was never anything but totally gripped by it. this is the power of really decent american film-making when it successfully balances visual style, directorial control, individual performances and, above all, a great story (which i won't spoil for you any further by elaborating upon in this review!)";25 February 2009;9;['cinematic', 'high', 'serial', 'many', 'large', 'exploitative', 'psychological', 'most', 'tough', 'simple', 'good', 'serial', 'own', 'horrific', 'multiple', 'long', 'first', 'impulsive', 'erudite', 'several', 'great', 'literary', 'divine', 'endless', 'sick', 'able', 'brief', 'human', 'great', 'much', 'right', 'cliched', 'simplistic', 'red', 'modern', 'religious', 'critical', 'silent', 'european', 'much', 'decent', 'american', 'visual', 'directorial', 'individual', 'great'];0.0946971595655806

787;Icarus_prime;"this is a perfect example where a movie is good and/or got better due to its ending. three-quarters of the whole film is pretty much stock standard crime, mystery thriller and the ""senior-rookie"" relationship between the characters that morgan freeman and brad pitt portray is straightforward but not generic and narrow-minded since their chemistry is so natural. the reason for the latter is that the character, mills while impulsive, his short-tempered and foul-mouth personality doesn't detract his presence and overall viewing experience of the movie. he's kept in check by william; the archetypal ""calm and collected veteran"" but during moments like these, they actually have interesting, contrasting discussions in how they see the world, the people and the crimes within a detective's perspective. the film sets up so they avoid mills' emotional outcries as the focus of the scene which i appreciate. it makes mills a more multi-dimensional character because we can clearly see him and william are presented as different people on the surface. but the film takes an effort to establish how they're different. the actual methods and scenes of the murders are indeed quite graphic but the most effective and disturbing one takes place at the end. it's the classic case of not showing that makes it more frightening because it's when our endless imagination takes stage. speaking of the ending, the reason i view it with high praise is because it's not phoned in and artificial. the film put in some key clues in earlier scenes to justify the killer's methods validly. its impact is strengthen by the fact that the serial killer is shown quite early and the film uses the remaining sequences well to establish the character. of course, the actor that plays the killer at the end puts on a a remarkable, chilling performance that only makes the last quarter of the movie better. normally, the 'mystery' aspect to a film like this would be gone and thus detract our enjoyment (julia's eyes is an example that it did) but it didn't for me because we're clearly more interested by the end of why the killer kills. it's a natural, organic progression when we're all sucked in to the elaborate ways that the victims are killed at the start. while the actual killer's motivations is a little simple- minded and its all explained in one convenient scene, i just love how the very last sequence of the movie refused to venture on a black-and-white ""good guys beat bad guys"" type of ending and sticked to its guns on what the film is about by using the killer as the subtext. overall, i enjoyed this modern hard-boiled flick and the only problems i had with the movie is that its a little too reliant on the ending to be a deciding factor on whether or not you would enjoy this picture. lastly, when i referred to the killer's intentions as slightly one-sided, i felt like it was a bit self-indulgent at times and wasn't all-encompassing enough when the film needed to foreshadow more on its underlying message during sections of the film before the killer was revealed. we only see a few glimpses from the interactions between freeman and pitt as well as the dark, grim setting (neo-noir) portrayed in the movie but i need more still. i thought if the film executed on the ""why"" part of the killings a bit better and not just ""how"" (which i already explained it's done admirably) then it would've easily pushed my rating from a 8.5/10 to a 9 or higher.";20 May 2016;8;['perfect', 'good', 'well', 'due', 'whole', 'standard', 'senior', 'straightforward', 'generic', 'narrow', 'minded', 'natural', 'latter', 'impulsive', 'foul', 'overall', 'archetypal', 'calm', 'interesting', 'emotional', 'multi', 'dimensional', 'different', 'different', 'actual', 'graphic', 'effective', 'classic', 'frightening', 'endless', 'high', 'artificial', 'key', 'early', 'strengthen', 'serial', 'remarkable', 'chilling', 'last', 'interested', 'natural', 'organic', 'elaborate', 'actual', 'little', 'minded', 'convenient', 'last', 'black', 'white', 'good', 'bad', 'modern', 'only', 'little', 'reliant', 'sided', 'indulgent', 'underlying', 'few', 'dark', 'grim', 'high'];0.0482608695652174

790;richardtownsley-19550;"se7en remains one of the most disturbing movies i have ever watched. unlike many other movies made during and since its release, se7en refrains from gore and somehow becomes even more appalling because of it. over time, general audiences have been desensitized to violence and gore. what may have been considered absolutely horrifying back in the 50s is nothing nowadays. so instead of showing the results of the crime, director david fincher uses a somewhat hitchcockian technique; by refraining to show the results of the horrible acts committed, and instead of revealing it through dialogue and acting, notably in the 'lust' scene and 'sloth' scene, fincher lets our brain do the heavy lifting and figure out what happened, and what it must have felt like. fincher also goes out of his way to come up with the most disgusting ways a person can die, although some are admittedly tame. ('pride' had it easy) the acting is incredible, featuring one of morgan freeman's best performances as an old, broken-down police detective, and brad pitt in one of his finest roles, and his acting skills are on display in his explosive acting during the finale. however, the best actor in this movie is the actor who plays john doe. observe his acting. smug, self-satisfied, intelligent, analytical. his composure and fearlessness. the movie rests on this one actor to say every line perfectly. he does. his performance is just as affecting as anthony hopkin's in silence of the lambs. but the most impressive feat of all, david fincher does something impossible: he makes the villain seem like a hero. it is hard to explain, but there are some villains that give us a glimpse into our deepest, subconscious desires. and that's terrifying. we all have parts of ourselves that we try to hide and pretend don't exist. these types of villains hold up a mirror and say, look. this is you. it's like watching a perverted car wreck that you can't look away from that hits you somewhere deep and hidden.";16 June 2020;10;['disturbing', 'many', 'other', 'appalling', 'general', 'hitchcockian', 'horrible', 'heavy', 'disgusting', 'tame', 'easy', 'incredible', 'good', 'old', 'fine', 'explosive', 'good', 'satisfied', 'intelligent', 'analytical', 'impressive', 'impossible', 'hard', 'deep', 'subconscious', 'terrifying', 'perverted'];0.0326086956521739
791;Ty-12;"seven is a movie that won't leave you with that ""happy feeling"" after viewing but it will affect you emotionally in some way. you won't feel as though you've seen ""sound of music"" but movies with underlying themes are becoming a rare beast in most hollywood schlock nowadays. below may contain *spoilers* so be forewarned. the film is brilliantly lighted and photographed evoking a noir-like feeling in the nameless, perpetually rain-soaked city it takes place in. the murder scenes are truly sickening and as dark as the crimes that are portrayed but does the movie clearly evoke it's main underlying theme (civilization's increasing apathy causing our decay) or does the viewer lose it's meaning in the movie's superb visualization? a lot has been said about the gore factor which in reality is somewhat under-stated in the film. no one is killed in a on-camera closeup and all but one of the killings are showed as an aftermath, the victim viewed briefly on screen and then revisited via black and white 8x10's that fill aproximently a tenth of the frame. many films show much more graphic violence although seven alludes to a much more insidious deed and the viewer comes away with the feeling that they witnessed them in a much more graphic way than what was shown. all great horror movies do this as our imaginations are much more frightening than the actual image. it is also what makes well written horror novels much more frightening than the run-of-the-mill slasher movie. the fact that most people remember the movie as being extremely gory says a lot about it's effective presentation which may also lend itself to being written off as just a gore-fest. if the viewer sees the film as strictly a blood bath of shocks it actually lends itself to viewer apathy since the film can be easily dismissed as a bloody serial killer flick in much the same way pitt's character dismisses john doe as ""just"" a lunatic. the viewer ends up waiting for the next shock instead of looking deeper. i don't know if fincher actually meant for this to occur or if it just happened as circumstance but it is interesting to see how apathy builds in ourselves esp. when it comes to repeated scenes of violence. freedman's character is used effectively in bringing the viewer back (as well as pitt's character)to see the ""big picture"" so we don't get lost in just the gore. in fact he is the stabilizing force in the movie. it is also interesting to note that freedman's character himself is the one fighting apathy and in the end loses out to it. all in all a very good movie that at it's least gives some great and groundbreaking visualizes and manages to put some meaning in as well. very few films by hollywood of late have been able to do one thing effectively and fincher has done both well although understated themes are probably lost on 95% of the viewing public which is why we are getting so many romantic comedies and beat em up flicks instead of intelligent films open to commentary and interpretation. also the newest release of seven on dvd is superb and make sure you buy it over the earlier flipper release.";13 March 2001;8;['happy', 'underlying', 'rare', 'most', 'like', 'dark', 'main', 'underlying', 'superb', 'black', 'white', 'many', 'more', 'graphic', 'insidious', 'more', 'graphic', 'great', 'frightening', 'actual', 'frightening', 'most', 'effective', 'f', 'bloody', 'serial', 'same', 'next', 'deep', 'interesting', 'apathy', 'big', 'interesting', 'apathy', 'good', 'least', 'great', 'groundbreaking', 'few', 'able', 'understated', 'many', 'romantic', 'intelligent', 'open', 'new', 'superb', 'sure', 'early'];0.2458041958041958

810;Metal-9;i must say this is one of the best movies of all time but there are a contradiction, a logic mistake in the movie that i can't get around. the fulfillment of john doe's horrifying plan is based around david mills (brad pitt) and his wife (gwyneth paltrow). john doe envy mills wife, that's is sin. and when mills kills him he is punished and in the same time mills wrath is punished by letting doe win and the fact that is wife is dead. the plan of john doe has been planned for a long time. the victim of sloth has been tied up in his bed precisely a year. so we can be sure of the fact that john doe has planned it at least a year. we also learn that mills and his wife have recently moved to the nameless city because of mills new job. they have only lived there four a week or something. then we can see that when john doe started his sinister plan he didn't know about mills and his wife. his sin wasn't obvious. of course we could say that he could have picked another woman, another victim for his own sin (envy). but then it wouldn't have been an inspector. freeman character is unwed so he is excluded. it had to be an investigator of the gruesome murders to have worked the way he had planned. this is just a thought that i got. but i don't see anything wrong about it. for me there exist a loophole in se7en, which is a big disappointment. but hey, ignore that and have a lot of fun watching this otherwise spectacular and horrifying movie. 9/10 (degraded after the discovery);20 May 2002;8;['good', 'logic', 'horrifying', 'same', 'dead', 'long', 'sure', 'least', 'new', 'sinister', 'obvious', 'own', 'unwed', 'gruesome', 'wrong', 'big', 'spectacular', 'horrifying'];-0.1066844919786096

812;sannelehmann;"""se7en"" is one of my all time favorite films. it has stayed with me ever since my first viewing. i must have seen it 6-7 times and i still get a quiver down my spine, when i watch certain scenes. i don't think i can say this is true of very many other films. i think the reason why this film made such an impression on me is because it speaks to the intellect thorough the body and visa versa. it makes it evident that although western civilization has subscribed to the vision of the separation between body/mind, we cannot separate these to entities in our experience of reality. we cannot exactly determine whether we make decisions based upon gut-reactions or if we make them through reasoning. the first part of the film plays mainly upon the capacity of the viewer at imagining physical pain. the best example being the pimp who has been lying in his bed for a year, but who is still alive. the first time i saw that scene, i felt nauseous and disgusted. i thought of it as a straight forward gut-reaction, this man who has suffered such pain, and he is still alive. the darkness of the city, the bleakness of the future for people living there coupled with the acute presence of tenderness in the characters also strikes me. once again i had a very physical reaction to the scene where somerset speaks mills' wife about her being pregnant. although he himself has chosen not to bring up children in such a harsh world he says ""if you decide to have them, spoil them every way that you can."" every time i see this scene i find myself crying. when we finally reach the end of the film, when we are transported from the rainy dark city to the open and nowhere-to-hide place where john doe wants to deliver his package. the dialog of the serial killer has the same effect on me every time - i get a stomach ache... the brilliance of it all being that i cannot exactly explain where this stomach ache comes from. do i get a stomach ache simply because this man is such an eloquent incarnation of evil? or is it mainly because i cannot help but agree with some of the things that he is saying? ""only in a world this shitty could you even try to say these were innocent people and keep a straight face. but that's the point. we see a deadly sin on every street corner, in every home, and we tolerate it. we tolerate it because it's common, it's trivial."" john doe has a lot in common with somerset, who also feels despair at the way of the world: ""i just don't think i can continue to live in a place that embraces and nurtures apathy as if it was virtue."" john doe's actions, his evil master plan marks him as an insane person, who has transgressed the taboos of a ""civilised"" society, even though his deed was to punish other transgressors. throughout the film we have had to imagine all the terrible deeds that john doe performed on people of - granted - questionable moral dispositions. we get to see him, and listen to his tale. however appalling his actions are, the actual fact that i as a viewer can agree with some of the things that he is saying turns the physical nausea of imagination from the first part into a kind of intellectual nausea... how can i agree with him even a little bit? this in turn once again creates a physical reaction - a stomach ache. i get a physical reaction as a response to my own reasoning. it reminds me that we all have some type of evil within us, we want pedophiles and evil lawyers to get what they deserve. we can imagine doing something to put things right. but we wouldn't ever do it - that would make us insane. we can imagine this exactly the way the film has let us imagine the pain afflicted, but not let us see it. in short, my fascination with this film comes from the fact that it speaks to the intellect through the body and visa versa. it shows me how experience cannot really be separated into body/soul. at the same time as it shows me exactly how much i experience the mind and the body to be two separated entities. a true masterpiece!";21 July 2005;10;['favorite', 'first', 'certain', 'true', 'many', 'other', 'evident', 'western', 'first', 'physical', 'good', 'alive', 'first', 'nauseous', 'disgusted', 'straight', 'forward', 'such', 'alive', 'acute', 'physical', 'pregnant', 'harsh', 'rainy', 'dark', 'open', 'serial', 'same', 'eloquent', 'innocent', 'straight', 'deadly', 'common', 'trivial', 'common', 'apathy', 'evil', 'insane', 'civilised', 'other', 'terrible', 'questionable', 'moral', 'actual', 'physical', 'first', 'intellectual', 'little', 'physical', 'physical', 'own', 'evil', 'right', 'insane', 'short', 'same', 'much', 'true'];-0.0167534722222222

843;sampath;"it was in alien3, that director david fincher first made his mark: while the script may have been flawed, the acting mundane(save the ever-reliable weaver) and the plot muddled, the film stayed afloat thanks to the fact that it simply oozed dark style. with se7en, however, fincher gets an opportunity to stamp his visual flair on a more-than-competent script, and a jaw-dropping cast(freeman, pitt, spacey et al), and, predictably, an utterly compelling film results. for a serial-killer film, se7en has surprisingly little on-screen blood letting. however the depiction of a nightmarish city and ample forensic detail, together with taut acting and tense direction, means that it is at times an almost unbearably grim suspenser. pitt delivers his lines with twitching intensity, but is far more restrained than in his manic performance in 12 monkeys. freeman is marvellously understated as a detective looking forward to retirement who is drawn into the grisly case which pitt initially undertakes. best of all, though, is spacey, who > has a mammoth screen presence, albeit only being present on-screen for a relatively short period. overall se7en is a relentlessly downbeat yet mightily impressive film. not since the silence of the lambs has there been a psychological thriller with such an oppressive atmosphere and soaring energy as this. but while lambs swept the oscars in 1991(the only truly contemporary film to win the best picture award during the 90s) the academy only managed to nominate se7en for one oscar(that for editing, which is admittedly superb). while se7en is not quite as masterful as lambs, it ought to have won at least a few more nominations(how freeman was left out of the best actor category, one would never know). the only reservation i'd have about se7en is than fincher at times tends to overdo the depressing plot developments. certainly, the viewer can find little refuge or comfort in the ending, which means that the easily upset may want to steer clear; instead they might want to catch the game, which has all of fincher's visual flair and intensity, minus the downbeat tone. otherwise se7en comes highly recommended. 9/10.";9 December 1999;9;['reliable', 'afloat', 'dark', 'visual', 'more', 'competent', 'compelling', 'serial', 'little', 'nightmarish', 'ample', 'forensic', 'tense', 'grim', 'restrained', 'manic', 'grisly', 'good', 'mammoth', 'present', 'short', 'overall', 'downbeat', 'impressive', 'psychological', 'oppressive', 'contemporary', 'good', 'superb', 'masterful', 'least', 'few', 'more', 'good', 'only', 'depressing', 'little', 'upset', 'clear', 'visual', 'downbeat'];0.150297619047619

858;jte6451;"i can't believe that i hadn't seen one before, and i'm glad that i did managed to see it. se7en is often considered to be one of the finest examples of modern crime thrillers and has established david fincher as one of the finest directors in hollywood. set within the course of seven days, it follows two homicide detectives who are on the hunt for a serial killer that based his crimes on the seven deadly sins. as the plot unfolds, a friction arises between the two detectives and how they go about their work as they both race against time to prevent the killer from succeeding his sadistic work. easily fincher's darkest film to date, this movie is dripping with an unsettling atmosphere. right from the opening scene, it lets you know exactly what kind of world we're entering; the lighting, the bleak shadows, the deterioration of the crime-ridden city, the constant rainfall that happens during exterior shots; all of these make the setting feel unsettling and gives the viewers a sense of dread that builds up all the way to the end. the story and the screenplay is masterfully crafted and the slightest details all play a part in the overall narrative. the cast delivers a great performance; morgan freeman is very likable as somerset, an aging detective who has been through hell and is ready to retire and live a peaceful life, but finds that he keeps getting drawn into all the chaos that's happening. brad pitt is also good as mills, a young detective who, while determined to find the killer, he's overly ambitious and is completely naive to the whole situation. their chemistry is what also makes them great; mills is cocky and impulsive, while somerset is calm and self-controlled, and both men try to work off each other. however, the character who steals the show is the serial killer ""john doe"" himself. as soon as he reveals himself to the audience, you can tell he's dripping with dread and evil accompanying him and how he manages to orchestrate his evil plans, all in which builds up to one hell of an intense finale that i refuse to spoil here, but i will say it will make your skin crawl long after you see it. overall, se7en still remains as one of the definitive examples of the exploration of the mind of a serial killer and how he manages to do it instead of why he did it, made possible by fincher's gritty vision that doesn't sugarcoat it. this dark, relentless, and original tale still remains effective now as it was in 1995. one of fincher's best works; highly recommend it. final verdict: 10/10 with an epic seal of awesomeness.";11 March 2019;10;['glad', 'fine', 'modern', 'fine', 'serial', 'deadly', 'sadistic', 'dark', 'dripping', 'unsettling', 'bleak', 'constant', 'exterior', 'unsettling', 'slight', 'overall', 'great', 'likable', 'ready', 'peaceful', 'brad', 'good', 'young', 'ambitious', 'naive', 'whole', 'great', 'cocky', 'impulsive', 'calm', 'other', 'serial', 'dripping', 'evil', 'intense', 'definitive', 'serial', 'possible', 'gritty', 'dark', 'relentless', 'original', 'effective', 'good', 'final', 'epic'];0.0947619047619047
859;Eredain;"****spoiler**** this is a philosophical comment to the point of the film, so it is quite in-depth. although it does not go too much into the plot directly, the film is more enjoyable if one discovers said points of the films for oneself. continue at own risk. somerset: ""the first thing they teach you, is that if you are being raped, don't shout ""rape"". shout ""fire"". then people will come running..... i just can't go on working in a place that nurtures apathy as if it were a virtue"". the point of seven is moral more than religious. its point concerns apathy, and explains how apathy actually is evil. a new testament example of this is the story of lazarus (don't get me wrong. i'm an atheist and deeply loathe the bible as a whole. nevertheless, in part, the bible has a point here.). the wealthy man is deemed evil (in the eyes of god/eternity/objectivity) because of his apathy towards the needy (lazarus) - evil enough, in fact, to be cast into hell. the moral of the story (of lazarus as well as seven) is that active harm is not necessary for one to be evil. one merely needs to abstain from doing good. not all evil people need to actively harm others to get what they want. some already have it, and choose to let others die at their door. so i have no doubt that the people that doe killed were evil. i have no doubt that somerset hated them as well. only somerset was to loving a person to take on the role of judge, jury and executioner. both somerset and doe have let the apathy of the world drive them to give up. doe wants to die and take some of those cold-hearted bastards with him, and, hopefully, make his point and thus change the world. somerset merely wants to escape to some distant place in the country. but in the end, somerset simply can't turn his back on the world. he wants to go on trying to help. probably inspired by mills passion for justice. on a more depressing note, i believe that the moral of the story is, that these vices (seven deadly sins) are what make us human. only one person has none of these vices - somerset - and he is lonely and miserable. inhuman(ly good). ""with much wisdom comes much sadness, and he that furthers his wisdom furthers his sadness"" (ecclesiastes 1:18, loosely translated). mills has it sooo easy, not reflecting on life the way somerset does. he is nevertheless truly good, in my opinon. and that is the only real hole in the pattern of the plot. wrath need not be a vice/sin. mills did not beat up his wife, nor run amuck and kill people or anything like that. his wrath was always just, and it never hurt the innocent. i completely love both him and somerset. this is the greatest, deepest, most insightful film i have ever seen.";20 June 2003;10;['philosophical', 'enjoyable', 'own', 'first', 'apathy', 'moral', 'more', 'religious', 'apathy', 'apathy', 'evil', 'new', 'wrong', 'wealthy', 'evil', 'needy', 'moral', 'active', 'necessary', 'evil', 'evil', 'evil', 'cold', 'hearted', 'distant', 'depressing', 'deadly', 'human', 'lonely', 'miserable', 'good', 'much', 'much', 'good', 'only', 'real', 'innocent', 'great', 'deepest', 'insightful'];-0.0895506792058516

863;mikes-movie-review-onlin;"david fincher's dark, gruesome and intelligent thriller se7en remains one of my favorite films of the 1990s. it's dark visual tone and use of pathetic fallacy coupled with the harrowing story of a killer attempting to teach humanity a lesson is both disturbing and brilliant. fincher shows audiences his true capabilities as a director, and se7en is an exercise in storytelling, visual style, and suspense, making it one of the definitive crime thrillers of the 20th century. the film begins in a miserable and unidentified cityscape, perhaps los angeles, or new york. perhaps it is simply a metaphorical version of all the crime in american urban areas. this city seems for at least the one week the movie takes place in perpetually covered in fog and light rain. we are introduced to detective mills (brad pitt), a young and impulsive cop who was transferred to the city. he is paired with detective somerset (morgan freeman), an older, calmer, meticulous veteran to the force with one week left before retirement. the contrasting pair make a nice centrepiece for the havoc which is to be wrecked upon them by an unknown murder. their first case together is the supposed murder of an obese man, found bound to a chair, he was forced at gunpoint to eat himself to death. his crime was gluttony. there are six more deadly sins, all of which the meticulous, patient, and above all disturbed, serial killer plans to use as his mo. they are: greed, sloth, lust, pride, wrath, and envy. somerset, who has a keen insight into the mind of the killer, asks to be taken off the case but remains in contact with mills as he reads through dante's ""divine comedy"", chaucer's ""canterbury tales"", and other prose relating to the seven deadly sins. together the pair of detectives get closer to the murderer, eventually ending in a climax which is brilliantly scripted by andrew kevin walker. the key to se7en's success as a crime-thriller is the feel of the movie. fincher is terrifically talented at bringing to life the most stylish interpretation of the material possible. the sinister atmosphere of the city is only furthered by the grisly murders and the seeming hopelessness of finding the murderer. even when they find what they think is his apartment they don't discover a single fingerprint. also vital to the film is the script by andrew kevin walker. he gives morgan freeman just enough poetic lines to run with, and the killer presented here is unique. he is intelligent, he writes his thoughts down journal after journal, he is patient, calm, sensible, and he seems to enjoy killing his victims. interestingly, the murderer is presented with about 30 minutes left of the film, given a speaking role and made an important character, opposed to simply being the unnamed monster behind the killings who is caught at the end. i won't ruin who plays the killer for anyone who hasn't seen the film, just know that it was a smart choice both to cast this actor/actress, but also not to advertise it. brad pitt gives a strong performance as mills, the younger cop who loses his temper more frequently, but still believes he can make a difference. i wouldn't have liked anyone else to play the role, but i could see a handful of other actors also embodying mills. somerset, on the other hand, could not logically be played by anyone but morgan freeman. freeman's calm deep voice, and his presence on-screen is unavoidable. his character more questioning of the supposed good nature of humanity, yet still devoted to catching the killer. he is intellectual, he reads milton and dante and chaucer for clues to the murders, and he thinks before he acts, unlike detective mills. this difference in character serves as an essential plot point later in the film. david fincher has become internationally successful as a maker of both highly stylish thrillers (e.g. fight club, the girl with the dragon tattoo) and more sweeping dramatic films like the curious case of benjamin button and the social network. se7en was fincher's first real venture into the crime-thriller genre, and it stands as one of his best works. the director is certainly unafraid of being uncompromising and violent, and he shows a strong understanding of visual style and artistic expression. many shots in this film are incredibly memorable, being just a part of what makes se7en such an unavoidable film.";15 April 2012;9;['dark', 'gruesome', 'intelligent', 'favorite', 'dark', 'visual', 'pathetic', 'harrowing', 'disturbing', 'brilliant', 'true', 'storytelling',

864;shortyrags;the seven deadly sins are the subject of david fincher's enormously popular and cult hit se7en. on a side note, i'm not sure how a 7 looks like the letter v but we digress, i suppose. moving on, this film is both terrifying and tragic, and offers a wonderful detective story with two great performances. morgan freeman plays detective william somerset, a patient and by-the-book officer, who makes decisions with care but is not afraid to act instinctively. brad pitt plays detective david mills, the antithesis to freeman's deductive somerset. mills is rash and often acts impulsively. the interaction between these two characters develops along with the twisting plot of the film, centering upon murders based upon the seven cardinal sins. the film is at its core a detective story with two very different men trying to work with each other to find a serial killer. like a silence of the lambs, this film uses its characters to develop the plot since it is the inherent weaknesses of each victim that the murderer bases his kills upon. like the detectives, we similarly uncover each murder and sin, each becoming more grisly than the former. the film does force us to think a little and make heads and tails of the whole situation. do we feel sympathy for these victims who are extreme embodiments of each respective sin? it's questions like these that make se7en such a thought provoker. it is disturbing and relentless, barely giving a breather to the viewer. either the two are discovering a murder or they are fervently trying to connect the dots. the suspense is great and helps the film nicely overall. the performances turned in by the cast are for the most part, well done. freeman plays a little too close to the chest but even so, he does a good job portraying an intelligent and conservative detective. pitt does an outstanding job and gets stronger and stronger as the film progresses. he really is an officer that i loved to hate so bravo on a job well done. on the other hand, gwyneth paltrow's performance as mills' wife, tracy, is boring and heavy-handed. both a symptom of the writing and paltrow's mediocre acting, tracy ends up being a character hard to sympathize with or even feel good for. this does ultimately end up hurting the film towards the end and it's a shame too. there are some surprises and twists here so i won't spoil them but do be wary. while the screen writing and characters are fairly strong, the cinematography is all over the place. the murder scenes are haunting and baleful, and add a great layer to the film without being gratuitously grotesque. however, in other parts, the camera work is not up to par and the film suffers. the whole ending sequence is mishandled by the camera crew and ends up ruining the whole mystique. the score is powerful when it needs to be and subtle when it needs to be. in any case, it is not tremendously memorable but it does give atmosphere to certain scenes. some of the dialogue is memorable especially the closing lines of the film, which help the film finish well. overall, se7en, (still don't get the 7 in the middle) is a good strong film that will disturb and is likely not for the faint of heart. there are strong performances, unsettling sequences and an overall moody score that does bolster the visuals. however, a sloppy ending, some unfulfilled promise from an all-star cast, and some suspect camera work at times, keep this film from truly being great. definitely a film worth checking out though and one that tells a good story with good characters.;21 July 2008;8;['deadly', 'popular', 'sure', 'terrifying', 'tragic', 'wonderful', 'great', 'afraid', 'deductive', 'rash', 'cardinal', 'different', 'other', 'serial', 'inherent', 'former', 'little', 'whole', 'extreme', 'respective', 'disturbing', 'relentless', 'great', 'overall', 'most', 'little', 'close', 'good', 'intelligent', 'conservative', 'outstanding', 'strong', 'strong', 'other', 'boring', 'heavy', 'handed', 'mediocre', 'hard', 'good', 'wary', 'strong', 'baleful', 'great', 'grotesque', 'other', 'whole', 'whole', 'powerful', 'subtle', 'memorable', 'certain', 'memorable', 'overall', 'good', 'strong', 'likely', 'strong', 'unsettling', 'overall', 'moody', 'sloppy', 'unfulfilled', 'suspect', 'great', 'worth', 'good', 'good'];0.1326719576719577

""se7en"" is definitely a movie no one will forget after watching it. the story follows two detectives: somerset (morgan freeman) and mills (brad pitt) tracking down a serial killer who murders his victims according to the seven deadly sins. seriously, this movie kept me at the edge of my seat the first time watching it. i was too young to see the movie when it came out in 1995, but i managed to watch this on dvd just recently. this movie is told from the point of view from the detectives, trying to find the motives and reasons why the killer is taking out random victims. we see them in a frustrated situation (brad pitt's character is a fine example of this along with his f bomb dialogue). the performances from the cast are superb. the majority of the film focuses on morgan freeman and brad pitt's chemistry - how their relationship builds up as the two are desperately trying to solve the case. gwyneth paltrow is placed third in the top billing as detective mill's wife - a woman who loves her husband but has a dislike for living in the terrible city they live in. her performance sells, but i feel she did not have enough screen time. there is one other actor's performance i really want to talk about. but i can't. you'll have to see the movie for yourself and you'll know who i am referring to. the movie never fails to lose your interest. you are invested in these characters solving a murder mystery that is (to them) not common, yet very disturbing. each kill has been done off screen, and we are left to our imagination of how each murder went down. what we don't see is much more effective than if we do see...and i believe director david fincher has done a great job at this. there are plenty of twists and turns throughout, and it's executed unexpectedly which works for this kind of film. ""se7en"" was a movie ahead of its time. i can't imagine what would it be like had the film been made in let's say 1989-90. definitely recommend this thriller if you're into surprises. even on repeated viewings it's still a thrill to watch and look out for things you may have missed in the first time viewing.";4 July 2016;10;['deadly', 'serial', 'deadly', 'first', 'young', 'random', 'frustrated', 'fine', 'superb', 'brad', 'top', 'terrible', 'enough', 'other', 'common', 'disturbing', 'effective', 'great', 'first'];0.0369791666666666

928;Rhysoedwards;the general plot if you were asked to explain the film in a few seconds would be something along the lines of brad pitt and morgan freeman are two cops on the trail of a serial killer. at first this sounds uninteresting to film lovers who wish for something other than a basic mel gibson and danny glover romp , which from the films brief plot explanation i previously wrote could fool some into thinking that is exactly what they will receive. however, this film is as far from an uninteresting romp as can be. i am willing to bet that there is no one who can walk away from this film and have it not stay with them for a life time. not only is it shocking and almost hypnotic in its gripping direction, it will also make the viewer question the world and how society really works within it. morgan freeman plays an old policeman who has seen far to much of the darkness in the world, so much so, that he is starting to believe that darkness is all that remains in it. this draws him to a decision to retire and leave police work behind, bringing along his replacement detective brad pitt. they do not immediately get along (but don't worry he doesn't jump off a roof with a suicide jumper to gain respect from his ageing partner) but due to their joint discovery of a body, they are forced into each others company. they soon come to the conclusion that a serial killer is on the loose, and find that for one thing, they share enthusiasm for the job if nothing else. freeman's character is fascinated with the killer, and his ideas and beliefs realising that the conclusion the killer has come to in his study of the world is similar to his own, but dealt with in different ways. pitt shares no compassion for the killer who is later discovered to be played by kevin spacey in a scene which is very member able to say the least. the killings are sick and shocking and create a certain amount of unease while watching. you will dismiss the that no human being in their right mind could do such a thing, and anyone to commit such acts would be insane, but i guarantee by the end of the film you will question this. if you want something interesting as well as fresh to fill your mind from the world of film i recommend you try this. this film proves that david fincher films are often fantastic, but only once sat through to the very end. i do feel with mr fincher that the raw substance that each of his films provide is untasted until a good hour into his films. this is really a thought provoking, and a fantastic and yet horrifying masterpiece, but misses out on it's final two stars due to the general lazing about of the first hour.;1 May 2009;8;['general', 'few', 'brad', 'serial', 'uninteresting', 'other', 'basic', 'glover', 'brief', 'uninteresting', 'willing', 'shocking', 'hypnotic', 'gripping', 'old', 'much', 'joint', 'serial', 'loose', 'fascinated', 'similar', 'own', 'different', 'very', 'able', 'least', 'sick', 'shocking', 'certain', 'human', 'right', 'such', 'insane', 'interesting', 'fresh', 'fantastic', 'very', 'raw', 'untasted', 'good', 'fantastic', 'final', 'general', 'first'];0.0229309752747252

""seven"" is so well done and has so many twists and turns in it, that i constantly found myself at the mercy of the surprises. even at the end when you expect the story to take on a lighter path and maybe show a little redemption, it gets even darker and more sinister. after morgan freemans' monologue at the end you get the overwhelming sense of the true realism this story has to offer over all others of it's kind. i have to say that when it comes to murder mysteries ""seven"" is as good as they come.";22 July 2010;10;['select', 'few', 'heavy', 'good', 'rear', 'few', 'dark', 'gruesome', 'dark', 'shocking', 'dark', 'average', 'many', 'disturbing', 'good', 'gritty', 'unrelenting', 'big', 'many', 'light', 'little', 'dark', 'more', 'sinister', 'overwhelming', 'true', 'kind', 'good'];0.0365

939;treeroot;"there are two things in seven that set it apart from the crowd. first, the complementary ways of thinking from two detectives with conflicting personalities. unlike the most stories of the same genre, detectives somerset and mills formed a perfect partnership not by the similarity between them (of which there was few), but by their unlike-mindedness in nearly every point of view. learned, sophisticated, and weary of a thirty-four-year career in dealing with crimes, somerset allowed his heart to quit before the actual date of retirement came, dragging his feet in accepting challenges, and as a consequence the real value remained of him was to give what he guessed or believed based on his time-tested concepts and instinct. mills, as opposed to his partner, was all fresh and green and ready for action. their thoughts crashed practically all the way down to the end, and yet it was their very difference in mind and attitude that supplemented them each with what the other lacked in their mission to find the killer. second, the great disparity in power between the good and evil. it was plain that john doe, the evildoer, was far more intelligent than the two detectives combined. and throughout the entire process of his well-planned killings, doe kept having the upper hand, making his pursuers see what he wanted them to see at what time he defined for them. there seemed no way, absolutely no way for them to conquer him, to do what he was not intended. the last scene, appalling and heart-wrenching beyond belief, showed the utter helplessness from the men trapped and the powerful ill will of the trapper somerset, with the feebleness in convincing even himself, called mills to throw his gun away; mills, suffering torture from shock, agony and rage, couldn't help but do exactly what he was set up to do; and doe, with a triumphant smile on his face, embraced death with all coolness. what an ending! i rate this film 9 out of 10.";4 May 2004;9;['complementary', 'conflicting', 'most', 'same', 'perfect', 'few', 'sophisticated', 'weary', 'actual', 'real', 'fresh', 'green', 'ready', 'very', 'other', 'great', 'good', 'evil', 'plain', 'intelligent', 'entire', 'upper', 'last', 'appalling', 'utter', 'powerful', 'ill', 'trapper', 'triumphant'];0.1192370129870129

yeah. do you guys do that? *******warning: possible spoilers ahead******* one of the best mindf***s ever penned for the big screen, se7en wouldn't have made my list if it hadn't been for the dvd (which was a better print quality than the original in theatres). the cut scenes on the dvd add to the whole aura of this film, and for me, make it that much better. i find the whole concept fascinating to conceive and somewhat disturbing to receive. of course the film is based on the seven deadly sins and while it's completely religious in nature, fincher seemed to focus more on the crimes than their religious implications. this is a very perverse and dark film, but that's what makes it great. plot/story: this is one of those great stories that has one of the best endings in hollywood history. the plot twists kept coming and coming that by the time the end hit you were so spun around that it was a compete shock to see it. what's even more impressive are the two alternate endings were almost as good as the one fincher went with (one was actually filmed, the other was only on stills). the story itself revolves around a retiring detective and his up and coming replacement as they push each others buttons while trying to solve the most disturbing case either of them has ever been involved in. the villain (kevin spacey) meanwhile, has been planning to carry out his psychotic rage for well over a year and in the course of week has set a whole new standard in serial killing. this is an excellent, well thought-out script that deserved more awards and nominations than it got. acting: freeman and pitt are two of my favorite actors and they eat up the screen with two very believable characters. paltrow does an okay job, a lot of people say she was excellent, but there's only so much you can do as a supporting cast, pregnant wife ya know? spacey on the other hand takes his cake and eats it too. i hadn't seen se7en since it came out until i got the dvd and the thing i remembered most about the movie was that the bad guy was great. when i watched the dvd and saw spacey i nearly crapped my pants! i was shocked i couldn't remember his face, but stunned that i had such a vivid memory of the character. some his best work was done on this film also. characters: the characters themselves are not as amazing as the people playing them, you can't relate to any of them and they all seem so complicated you wish the movie were longer just so you could figure them out. of course if the movie were any longer it would have really dragged in a number of places. effects/setting: the setting is typical for the mood. everything is dark and gloomy, it rains all the time, the people are brooding and at times you almost understand why john doe has went nuts and felt he needed to commit his crimes. the deadly 'sins' are what make it impressive, from gluttony to the full uncut vanity (cut so terribly short in the theatres), the stuff john doe has done to these people is full of cringe factor. score/soundtrack: like the setting the music is just as moody and black. perfect fit for a film like this. se7en usually makes everyone's top 10, but not mine. it's a great movie, but the ending alone can't save it all. the pacing at certain times really bores me, and i know i can't be the only one. the brooding nature of the film is actually a part of the experience; fincher makes it hard to relate to the characters for the art of it (i think). this is one of the best thrillers ever made, bar none. morgan freeman and brad pitt prove why they are two of hollywood's most sought after commodities and still it serves as a stepping-stone for kevin spacey and gwyneth paltrow. one thing, though, don't watch this film if you're in a bad mood, you might find yourself committing seven deadly sins. yes, i went there.";26 October 2001;10;['brad', 'favorite', 'insane', 'insane', 'own', 'amazing', 'crazy', 'possible', 'good', 'big', 'well', 'original', 'cut', 'whole', 'whole', 'fascinating', 'disturbing', 'deadly', 'religious', 'religious', 'perverse', 'dark', 'great', 'great', 'good', 'compete', 'impressive', 'alternate', 'good', 'other', 'up', 'disturbing', 'psychotic', 'whole', 'new', 'serial', 'excellent', 'more', 'favorite', 'believable', 'okay', 'excellent', 'pregnant', 'other', 'bad', 'great', 'vivid', 'good', 'amazing', 'complicated', 'long', 'typical', 'dark', 'gloomy', 'deadly', 'impressive', 'full', 'uncut', 'short', 'full', 'moody', 'black', 'perfect', 'top', 'great', 'certain', 'only', 'hard', 'good', 'bad', 'deadly'];0.1959830447330447

966;reddragon-hl;let me begin by saying that when i watched this movie i loved it. it had a stellar cast and an amazing concept. the plot was at just the right pace and never bored me. it had a dark theme although this theme worked perfectly for the way the movie ran. the thing that ruined the movie for me was the ending. first of all the fact that it was kevin spacy that was john doe was obvious. did anyone have trouble discerning that the caller was spacy? however, that only bothered me because the filmmakers though the audience was so stupid that they could not know kevin spacy would be in it from the beginning. the real issue was the fate of the last two sins. i do not remember the order, however, gluttony, greed, pride, lust and sloth were all murdered before john doe turned himself in. then he turns himself in and somehow convinces the detectives to bring him to the open field. then the head in the box sparks brad pitt's wrath into killing spacy's envy. the problem that i had with this ending was that greed, gluttony, pride, sloth, lust, and envy are murdered and wrath goes to prison. the penalty for the other six sins are death, but, the penalty for wrath is prison. the concept makes no sense whatsoever. they should either all go to prison or all die. make up your mind. if i could have changed the ending it would be something like this: -instead of john doe turning himself in he calls brad pitt and says that pitt and freeman must meet him in this open field. they must come alone. when they arrive doe then draws a gun and makes pitt and freeman put theirs away. freeman is sent back a few yards and spacy gives pitt the box with the head. before pitt opens the box spacy puts away the gun. pitt is then overcome with wrath, draws his gun, and shoots spacy. only known to spacy, a bomb is strapped to his chest with a dead mans switch. thus the bomb explodes killing pitt. therefore in my alternate ending spacy dies from his envy and pitt's wrath kills himself. just a thought.;26 April 2011;4;['stellar', 'amazing', 'right', 'dark', 'obvious', 'stupid', 'real', 'last', 'open', 'other', 'brad', 'open', 'few', 'strapped', 'dead', 'alternate'];-0.0260989010989011

we see this in most critically acclaimed thrillers, but this film doesn't let you know where this movie can potentially go because fincher builds small clues and foreshadows as the moment of time happens in the film. every scene in the film is important to the overall plot which makes the film feel so long by the end because you never feel like you wasted any time watching it. the climax of the film is one of the most exciting, edge of your seat climaxes i have ever seen. it has high blood pumping energy with great excitement that the film has built throughout its runtime that pays off so well. the directing is so fantastic that i'm surprised it wasn't nominated for best directing at the 68th annual academy awards. fincher uses great wide shots to capture all what's happening in the frame that keeps the audience in the moment. he carefully uses detailed close ups with his characters in deep emotional scenes that add an extra layer to the film. the score, composed by howard shore, is an amazing score that adds so much to those intense scenes that gives the extra boost it needs to keep you on the edge of your seat. whether its his dark and suspenseful music as the characters are investigating each crime scene or it's the intense energetic moving music in the action scenes, the score is used appropriately and effectively. as for the tech specs, the film has amazing cinematography done by darius khondji who uses a dark colored palate that is used perfectly with the gritty and dreadful tone of the film the use of light during many dark scenes was used perfectly as it didn't over bear the darkness of the setting. when the film used color, it used dark reds, yellows, etc. that gave a little tiny burst of life it needed to not look so dull and boring. many filmmakers try to use this dark colored pallet and look for their movie because of the tone of the movie they are making, but it doesn't always work out because they don't know what they are looking to see. the editing is practically seamless in which scene transition flowed so smoothly that it felt like the movie was shot all in one day chronologically. the action scenes also had incredible editing that it all looked real and presented well. my only issues with the film are small but need to be addressed. during some of the action scenes, mainly in the middle where mills is chasing down a potential suspect, there is a lot of ""shaky cam"" involved where it can be a tad bit distracting watching it, but not bad enough that it ruins the whole scene. overall, this film is one of the best films of all time due to its cast and production team. it has an engaging story that is always interesting and feels like something new is about to happen. the film is exciting, gritty, and dark in the best david fincher way possible. the acting is superb, and the writing makes the film so enthralling throughout. i can recommend to anyone who wants to watch an pure masterpiece in the thriller genre. i give this a 10/10";28 February 2019;10;['unrelated', 'unknown', 'deadly', 'violent', 'deadly', 'creative', 'interesting', 'exciting', 'good', 'actual', 'main', 'brutal', 'bloody', 'dark', 'violent', 'top', 'notch', 'good', 'brad', 'perfect', 'seamless', 'brad', 'respective', 'amazing', 'memorizing', 'good', 'small', 'important', 'overall', 'exciting', 'high', 'great', 'fantastic', 'surprised', 'good', 'annual', 'great', 'wide', 'detailed', 'close', 'deep', 'emotional', 'extra', 'amazing', 'intense', 'extra', 'dark', 'suspenseful', 'intense', 'energetic', 'amazing', 'dark', 'colored', 'gritty', 'dreadful', 'many', 'dark', 'dark', 'little', 'tiny', 'dull', 'boring', 'many', 'dark', 'seamless', 'incredible', 'real', 'only', 'small', 'potential', 'shaky', 'bad', 'whole', 'good', 'interesting', 'new', 'about', 'exciting', 'gritty', 'dark', 'good', 'possible', 'superb', 'enthralling', 'pure'];0.1269418891293891

982;dreamwork-32530;"the movie, ""se7en"", starring brad pitt, morgan freeman, and gwyneth paltrow, is by far one of the most inventive, well-written, and cerebral films in recent history. the film, blending a well put together combination of dark visual style, intense plot development, and polished acting, remains tight and focused throughout, from beginning to end, never straying outwards into unimportant issues, or resorting to typical hollywood cliches. se7en is uniquely on its own for suspense dramas as it both fuels the need of the audience to be drawn in and entertained by the events unfolding, and remain uncompromising and shocking, thus satisfying the initial vision of the director, david fincher. the story surrounds the hunt for a serial killer, who, inspired by dante alighieri's seven deadly sins from ""the divine comedy"", sets out to, ""preach"" about man's impurity, and does so by targeting victims, then torturing them by pitting their own underlining sins against them. se7en seemingly starts out as a typical cat and mouse detective story, however, it quickly develops into of a sort of modern-myth, with good and evil taking centre stage. the story is original on all counts, and thrilling on all levels. the most important aspect of se7en, however, is that it keeps the audience numerous steps behind its story, as oppose to other thrillers, which become predictable and bland by the end. by keeping the audience in the dark, the film remains fresh and original as it progresses. se7en even dramatically turns the tide at one point, just as the audience is finally getting comfortable and asserted into the gloomy atmosphere, thus creating as much as fear and uncertainty in the audience as it is with the characters involved. by the film's conclusion, the audience is as much apart of the film as the characters themselves, and arrive at se7en's surprise ending without a single clue of it, prior to it occurring. se7en's poetic ending(which will not be given away) says a lot for the people behind the movie, showing they are not afraid of going against the grain. a rarity with films so nowadays.";14 August 2017;8;['inventive', 'cerebral', 'recent', 'dark', 'visual', 'intense', 'polished', 'tight', 'unimportant', 'typical', 'own', 'shocking', 'initial', 'serial', 'deadly', 'divine', 'own', 'underlining', 'typical', 'modern', 'good', 'evil', 'original', 'important', 'numerous', 'other', 'predictable', 'bland', 'fresh', 'original', 'comfortable', 'gloomy', 'much', 'much', 'single', 'poetic', 'afraid'];0.0206896551724137

984;boozerira;"wow, this is a really messed up film. it is arguably the most famous crime drama ever produced, and i can see why. the two main characters, somerset and mills, played respectively by morgan freeman and brad pitt, are interesting, no doubt about it. on the flip side, john doe played by kevin spacey , controversy aside, is also a very well played role. his speech near the end of the film is a pinnacle of screenwriting, and easily bumps the entire movie up a few points in my book. looking around, it seems i'm not the only one who shares this opinion. i hate to say this, but i didn't like brad pitts acting as mills. it wasn't horrible and i don't like the film any less for it, but it could've been done better. it almost seems at times like the character that mills actually is and the character that brad pitt tries to portray are not the same person. mills wife talks about him being the funniest person she'd ever met and knowing on the first date that she'd marry him but pitt's acting makes him seem like a wife beater during some scenes. i seem to be alone in this opinion, but on the down low: anyone who tells me the, ""what's in the box!"" scene is perfect acting is lying through their own teeth. that's supposed to be the climax of the film, too. obviously, the film is very dark and someone might even call it gory. the crimes that are committed to the theme of the deadly seven sins, they're all so nightmarish in their own right. i watched the movie a while back, and i still think about sloth and lust sometimes. the job does a good job of making it all feel real. so, obviously, be prepared to see some stuff you won't forget. but if you somehow haven't seen se7en yet, i'd recommend it. it's a masterpiece.";20 March 2018;7;['famous', 'main', 'brad', 'interesting', 'flip', 'entire', 'few', 'only', 'horrible', 'same', 'first', 'alone', 'down', 'perfect', 'own', 'dark', 'deadly', 'nightmarish', 'own', 'good', 'real', 'prepared'];0.165359477124183

989;elorasabine;"i thought this was a decent movie. i did not think it was the great movie that many who left comments rave about. here is why: (some spoilers, nothing big/about the end:) why were city detectives handling this very serious case by themselves? where was the fbi? where were the psychologists and the profilers? at least, why weren't these detectives trained in how to deal with this killer on a psychological level and what kind of man they were looking for -- ie, what he would look like, the kind of place he would live, etc.? basic profiling skills. killers often return to the crime scene after the killing. the detectives could have caught this killer early in the film. but i guess there wouldn't have been much of a movie if they were educated enough to know what they were doing . . . read a few books on serial killers and you will know more than these two detectives did. serial killers are methodical and patient, as the morgan freeman character states. therefore, it does not make sense that this killer who started this killing a year before the detectives knew what he was up to would skip ""wrath"" entirely. victim number #6 (i won't mention because i don't want to spoil it) did nothing wrong. the killer goes on in the back-of-the-car scene that his victims weren't innocent --- blah blah blah -- but what about #6!! #6 was innocent. what did morgan freeman learn from all his reading and study at the library? it did not help him at all with catching this guy or stopping his killing. when brad pitt saw that the killer had taken a picture of him (brad pitt), why didn't he worry that the guy might be interested in him or his life? morgan freeman found the killer through that list of the people who checked out relevant library books. why couldn't the killer have sat in the library and read the books? what if the killer bought the books at a store? he was independently wealthy, why did he need to check books out for two weeks when he could own them permanently? bought them with some of that stash of cash he had under his bed. no records left behind. no trail. he went through the trouble to cut off his fingertips, but didn't go to a bookstore? the biggest disappointment for me was waiting through the whole film to see the detectives do something wise or brilliant or meaningful or assertive to get this case solved and have the killer fall right into their laps. the killer was dynamic. the detectives were limp noodles.";26 January 2002;7;['decent', 'great', 'many', 'big', 'serious', 'least', 'psychological', 'basic', 'much', 'few', 'serial', 'more', 'serial', 'methodical', 'patient', 'wrong', 'innocent', 'innocent', 'interested', 'relevant', 'wealthy', 'big', 'whole', 'wise', 'brilliant', 'meaningful', 'assertive', 'dynamic', 'limp'];0.2123188405797101

1049;Perini;my approach to seven was one of low expectations. based on the stylistic opening credits, i was expecting to be assaulted with low-angle extreme closeup murky cinematography designed to capitalize on human reflex. american film has been thwarted with bad technique in the suspense/mystery genre. instead of style and creativity, many directors have opted for the ole standby of loud unexpected noises/music followed by the alerting appearance of the villain. snore...however, such is not the case with david fincher's seven. the style of seven is fairly straightforward for the first seventy minutes of the film: what you see is what you get. unapologetically grotesque images from the crime scenes of a serial murder and a flood of rain in a dingy, dirty-textured metropolitan city. the plot is nothing we haven't seen before, but it was plenty enough to keep you interested in learning about the murderer. however, the main characters could not have been more contrived. morgan freeman's character, detective summerset, was catatonic to the point of being convincingly dull. the writer went for the starkest contrast with the character detective mills (brad pitt) by giving him the playground mentality of hockey player turned homicide detective. the results were destructive to the film's effect. in the end, mills and summerset do their best to ruin the audience's interest in their involvement. gwynneth paltrow would receive mention if her character weren't a mere fixture within a plot. the characters just didn't help this film at all. it was one of those all too often cases where the actors look the part but the part is badly written =( however, much to the credit of the production designer and cinematographer, the mood of this film was still very effective. there was however one other regrettable inconsistency: for the first seventy minutes or so of the film, the audience forcably endures the foul, wet and lonely darkness of the city environment only to have the rug pulled out in the closing moments when the setting changes to a sun-bleached desert scape. hmmm...7 out of 10?;28 June 1999;7;['low', 'stylistic', 'low', 'human', 'american', 'bad', 'many', 'loud', 'unexpected', 'such', 'straightforward', 'first', 'serial', 'dingy', 'dirty', 'metropolitan', 'plenty', 'interested', 'main', 'catatonic', 'dull', 'stark', 'playground', 'destructive', 'good', 'mere', 'effective', 'other', 'regrettable', 'first', 'foul', 'wet', 'lonely'];0.003125

1056;therickster-2;"(spoilers) ""these days you can't just tap people on the shoulder. you have to hit them with a sledgehammer. that way you can be sure you have their complete attention."" this quote essentially defines an incredible movie. from the outset, david fincher ensures the audience knows this is not going to be an easy film to watch. the relentless torrents of rain, bleak and depressing locations and the consistent use of funeral-style attire maintain the very visual sense of foreboding and dread throughout. first, a basic outlay. the film centres on two stereotypical police officers. one, a young rookie by the name of mills (brad pitt), has been transferred (at his request) to the dark, unnamed city in which the story takes place. the other is veteran detective somerset (morgan freeman), a veteran cop is due to retire in seven days (obviously an attempt at either continuity within the film or a 'red herring' as to it's real content). for his last week, somerset is partnered with mills, and it's not before long that they stumble upon a gruesome murder, wherein an obese man appears to have eaten until he physically burst. initially somerset wants nothing to do with the case, but certain clues convert his theory to believe that this murder is not as 'cut and dry' as it seems to be, leaving him a final case to solve before he puts his career to rest. after a breakthrough via somewhat illegitimate methods, the two detectives push closer to their potential killer. more murders ensue until the film nears its climax with a simply unforgettable collision of events. the acting is clearly worthy of note. before watching the film this reviewer was perfectly aware of brad pitt's 'pretty boy' image. well all i can say is that pitt was perfectly cast (in the role that may well have pushed his career into the 'a' list) as david mills. his good looks and somewhat cocky attitude did him huge favours when portraying a character in need of every one of these assets. mills' arrogance as a character lights up his inexperience as a cop like a neon beam in the city's own dark alleyways. freeman is superb as always, confirming the theory that great actors don't need words to act. an example i have seen frequently used is the scene where mills and somerset discover the first victim. mills, full of enthusiasm for his first case proudly declares ""ladies and gentlemen, we have ourselves a homicide."" at this point somerset turns to face his partner and raises his eyebrows a millimetre. it's not much, but this simple gesture says more than most actors can from a page of dialogue. some people question the validity of his continuously calm attitude in even the films most horrible of situations. my answer to that is simply this - he has been doing this job for so long that nothing has the power to shock him any more. it is like his senses have been numbed to the horror around him simply because he has been dealing with these atrocities for so long. even so, the case does affect him in ways, most clearly in the films 'final showdown' but throughout as well. for example there is a scene where somerset cannot sleep for noises of displeasure outside his window. symbolically these noises also represent the effects of the outside world on somerset's mentality - sometimes he cannot sleep as a result of it. finally kevin spacey must be credited (though he isn't in the title sequence) for turning in a truly electrifying performance. surely if morgan freeman is one of today's best actors, then spacey is one of tomorrow's. his portrayal of 'john doe' is the most brutally honest and terrifying portrayal of a serial killer ever (yes, including hannibal lecter).. there are many comparisons. both are clearly intelligent men, both have an exterior which suggests a physical inferiority and both are seriously disturbed. the reason i find spacey's 'doe' more threatening however, is due to the seemingly relentless pursuit of his beliefs. whereas lecter had other interests, 'john doe' seems hell-bent on performing the mission he has set out to achieve, and his determination makes him that much more terrifying. in my opinion david fincher's 'se7en' is one of the best films i have ever had the privilege of viewing. it's script (by andrew kevin walker) and direction perfectly complement the films dark and dreary tones, while the score ensures every moment of music is a subtle layer on the movies overall effect. if you watch 'se7en' and hate it, watch it again. many people i know watched it and thought it too depressing, too terrifying and generally 'too much. i plead to these people, watch the movie again. perhaps it is because you are more prepared for the events that occur the second time round, though i guarantee the film will shock you just as much, no matter how many times you see it. 10 out of 10.";29 March 2001;10;['sure', 'complete', 'incredible', 'easy', 'relentless', 'bleak', 'depressing', 'consistent', 'visual', 'basic', 'stereotypical', 'young', 'dark', 'unnamed', 'other', 'veteran', 'veteran', 'due', 'red', 'real', 'last', 'gruesome', 'obese', 'certain', 'final', 'illegitimate', 'potential', 'more', 'unforgettable', 'worthy', 'aware', 'pretty', 'good', 'cocky', 'huge', 'own', 'dark', 'superb', 'great', 'first', 'full', 'first', 'much', 'simple', 'more', 'most', 'calm', 'horrible', 'final', 'outside', 'electrifying', 'good', 'honest', 'terrifying', 'serial', 'hannibal', 'many', 'intelligent', 'physical', 'disturbed', 'threatening', 'due', 'relentless', 'other', 'bent', 'terrifying', 'good', 'dark', 'dreary', 'subtle', 'overall', 'many', 'depressing', 'terrifying', 'much', 'prepared', 'second', 'much', 'many'];0.0888510959939531

1058;zaferdc;"if you are looking for a story-based movie, this will not be for you. if you are looking for something with a deeper message and lots of metaphors and reflections of wrong judgement, you will fall in love with this masterpiece. here is my interpretation: joe, being drawn as the 'psycho serial killer' initially, is murdering his victims in accordance with the seven deadly sins. after his first 5 crimes in which he 'punishes' the victims, he goes for detective mills' (brad pitt) wife. that is his sixth crime. when mills finds out about it, he kills joe in his own violent way (in fact, he shoots a whole magazine of bullets), and joe's series of crimes complete. here, the message is that when someone that is judging others because of their 'crazy, psychopathic behavior', they are underrating or not understanding how 'personal' that person has taken the sins that the victims have committed. if joe had killed some other random, mills would have never shot him. he kills him because it is about his wife. however, that is why joe has been killing in the first place: he takes the sins of all those victims very personal; unlike mills who is lacking the empathy that joe has and only decides to kill when the victim is his own wife. here, joe proves that mills is basically no different: he also kills when it comes to a sin that is bothering him so much that he cannot live if he does not do something about it. that is what society is about: we judge people easily on behalf of their acts, but most of the time, we are no different. interestingly, joe's sixth victim, mills' wife, is also not a pure good person. she was considering having an abortion without telling his husband mills, who is the father of the baby, anything about it - which is also a sin. you can clearly see the smile on joe's face when he learns about the fact that mills did not know about the pregnancy. i think that somerset (morgan freeman) could be a metaphor to the 'good and right part of mills'. i think the scene where somerset sits on mills' desk is really key to make me think so. most of the time, mills wants to ignore that good part inside him, but when mills' wife calls him, she wants to speak to somerset (the good side in mills), invites him to dinner, and mills' wife opens herself about the pregnancy to again somerset, the good side in mills. from time to time, somerset has tried to convince mills not to do the wrong thing (first at joe's apartment he told him not to break the door, and in the end not to kill joe), but ultimately he failed. in short, i think this is an absolute masterpiece and i am sure there are still a lot of things that i have not noticed about the movie. the only reason i don't rate it as a 10 is because of the acting that was not the best knowing freeman and pitt's potential. maybe it's because they did not have enough time in their scenes to 'take us in'. overall, david fincher is a genius.";2 April 2020;9;['deep', 'wrong', 'serial', 'deadly', 'first', 'sixth', 'own', 'violent', 'whole', 'complete', 'crazy', 'psychopathic', 'personal', 'other', 'first', 'personal', 'own', 'different', 'most', 'different', 'sixth', 'pure', 'good', 'good', 'right', 'key', 'most', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'wrong', 'short', 'absolute', 'sure', 'only', 'good', 'enough'];0.18359375

1108;tjb103;"when audiences went to see the latest production of a tragedy by william shakespeare at the globe theatre, there was a universal reaction by the spectators to what they were seeing on the stage. it was one of sadness, anger, sympathy and relief. the sadness was normally due to the innocent victim (who was usually a beautiful woman) being murdered in an unjustified fashion, such as desdemona in 'othello'; the anger would have been directed towards the villain in the play whose dastardly deeds had resulted in the deaths of heroes and heroines - here we have iago, arguably the most evil character in the history of literature ('othello' again); sympathy was not for the devil, but for the poor people who had overcome the denouement but had to deal with its consequences (horatio perhaps in 'hamlet', or maybe father laurence in 'romeo and juliet'); and lastly relief was felt because the audience had survived the play's violence and could thank their lucky stars that they did not have to live in a world so cruel. now stay with me here, because there is, in fact, a point to all of this. i believe that fincher's 'seven' is the modern shakespearean tragedy, the modern 'titus andronicus', if you will. the feeling that washes over you when the credits roll in seven (which are damn good credits i might add, start and finish) is on a par with a great shakespearean tragedy, and it is for this reason why i think that films such as seven should be considered as more serious in a literary sense. not only that, but the film even introduces the audience to legendary texts such as dante's 'inferno' and geoffrey chaucer's 'the canterbury tales' - so i would be inclined to try and influence more english professors to watch this film. now here's the part where i say 'yeah seven, woo, it's awesome! yeah!'. i'm just going to go out and say it: this film has everything that you could possibly be looking for when watching a movie. the script, for one, is great. original, funny in places, exciting, sexy...the list is endless really. well played andrew kevin walker; the boy done good. next we have the acting which, to put in a romantic sense, is sublime: people may argue that morgan freeman can only play one character, but i think it's similar to the situation with hugh grant (his one persona may be a bumbling, lovable fool, but he is damn good at it) and it's the same for morgan. here he is at his fatherly, worldly-wise detective best, and the comic double act of freeman and pitt is essential to the film. pitt's performance is probably just about overshadowed by his portrayal of tyler durden in fincher's other chef d'oeuvre 'fight club', but in no way is this a demeaning statement to pitt. he is, or was, one of my favourite 'younger' actors (that's the ed norton, johnny depp ring, as opposed to the pacino/de niro/hoffman circle of expertise) until 2005 came about - ocean's 12, to put it mildly, disappointed me greatly. however, let's think positively: with seven and fight club and snatch, i'm sure brad has something in store for fans like me. gwyneth paltrow is probably the unsung hero, or heroine, of the film and ironically she's the one who gets it worst (or does she? refer back to tragedy point about sympathy). the words 'never better' spring to mind when thinking about paltrow's 'tracey'. there's someone else i'm not mentioning here, despite the 'contains spoiler' tick, but let's just say he/she/it provides, in my eyes, the greatest twist of all time. last but not least, david fincher is where it's at. his undoubtedly cool style is the reason why this film is so...cool, for want of a better word. thanks to him, morgan freeman is cool, gwyneth paltrow is cool, the man who works in that horrible place where the 'pride' crime takes place is cool, even the man/woman/thing with no name is cool (to a certain extent). to conclude, there are certain films that when the credits appear at the end, you think to yourself 'that has to be the best movie i've ever seen'.

1141;iamNirmalKumar;this is actually one of the best films that i have seen that i have only wanted to watch one. the reason being that while it has an interesting plot, plenty of action and a great twist it also has a horrible aftertaste. like spending too long trying to clear a blocked drain. hollywood has, for far too long, glamorised crime and the chasing criminal so it is surprising to see a film maker going the other way. this is a dark, decrepit and cold world where everything is falling apart and unkept. this seems a deliberate policy move that features in many of david fincher's films. interesting - in that is different - but strangely alienating and depressing - and these are emotions i don't want to wish upon myself. the serial killer and the criminal that leaves clues are nothing new, but the way the plot develops is. if you know the twist the movie will be cut in half and thank god i saw it without knowing the pay-off- although i knew there was going to be one. this is a movie after all. brad pitt never convinces as a professional of any type. here he seems to have become a cop overnight and without much training. morgan freeman does his usual quiet-but-logical act that has bought him fame so late in life. he is nearing retirement (in the film), but i thought all cops were about to retire in movies - i took that as read! this is very involving stuff and we are drawn to grandstand finish that we will remember forever - but what is se7en in longterm reflection? a horrible world in which horrible people carry out horrible acts for reasons of self-gratification? serial killers have existed since the dawn of time, but america is home to half of the world's population of them. why is this? maybe it is the last chance to make a mark on a society where being in the media and being in the spotlight are prized? when you have killed someone you are interesting, when you haven't you are not. simple.;21 March 2020;8;['good', 'interesting', 'great', 'horrible', 'long', 'surprising', 'other', 'dark', 'decrepit', 'cold', 'unkept', 'deliberate', 'many', 'interesting', 'different', 'depressing', 'serial', 'new', 'half', 'much', 'usual', 'quiet', 'logical', 'about', 'longterm', 'horrible', 'horrible', 'horrible', 'serial', 'last', 'interesting', 'simple'];-0.0564709595959596

1171;DAInterMilan32;"colour and lighting, fincher emphasizes shadows and dimly lit scenes--the kind that lend more to the tone of the shot than to the ego of the star. you'd be hard pressed to find any light situation in any of his films that truly flatters the actors. se7en is definitely fincher's darkest movie--in mood and in lighting. the majority of se7en contains very little light, the crime scenes being the most notable examples. in fact, most of se7en's lighting is directional, meaning that it comes from an artificial source focused in one direction with a low falloff. the brightness of the desert setting during the climax is a dramatic shift from the rest of the movie and is perfect for the change in tone and action of the finale. the most interesting use of colour in se7en comes when mills and somerset explore john doe's apartment. everything is, of course, red and dark. camera work and editing, the chase scene with mills and doe is about as exciting as they come. the camera moves quickly with the characters, and the odd angles keep the audience from seeing everything--building paranoia and escalating the tension. the steady movement of the swat team as they descend upon the sloth victim is another well-choreographed sequence. all of fincher's films feature some kind of chase scene, which is definitely a good thing, considering how effectively he pulls them off. production and set design, a lot of the settings are buildings in decay; many of them were built from scratch and then made to look worn. i believe that fincher often films on sets rather than scouting out interior locations because actual interiors rarely live up to his meticulous imagination. rotting wood, rust, water stains and peeling paint all help to make each scene totally believable--more like moody still life's than movie sets. in the spirit of rule breaking, fincher makes his credits ascend upwards. i'm not sure if this is the first time this has ever been done, but it's the only movie i have seen it in. aside from scrolling up, the credits are also visually interesting. careless lines and scratches weave in and out of text.";12 June 2002;10;['more', 'light', 'dark', 'little', 'notable', 'most', 'directional', 'artificial', 'low', 'dramatic', 'perfect', 'interesting', 'red', 'dark', 'exciting', 'odd', 'steady', 'sloth', 'good', 'many', 'worn', 'interior', 'actual', 'meticulous', 'believable', 'moody', 'sure', 'first', 'only', 'interesting', 'careless'];0.1851666666666666

1178;trakz7;this review is for people who consider this movie the best thriller ever. i watched this movie because a friend of mine told me that it's one of the best thrillers ever. i have to admit that he was right. the theme (the seven deadly sins) is excellent, i really like thrillers with religious or historical influences. the actors play so well that i couldn't take my eye off the screen, but sadly, there are a few things that make this movie very predictable. first of all, it's the wife (gwyneth paltrow) of detective david mills (brad pitt). when she reveals that she's pregnant to detective william somerset (morgan freeman), everyone will know that something has got to happen to her and their child. the second thing is that pitt is so hot-headed, that you have to be very naive to think that nothing will happen to him. i also can't understand what was tracy's sin. if john doe's sin was the envy, the only sin that remained was the wrath, but i don't think that this had anything to do with the detective's wife. than i realized that it must have been the detective's sin for killing the murderer, but then why did he remained alive??? as morgan freeman said, the murderer needs seven dead bodies with seven deadly sins to complete his masterpiece. i really don't think that this was complete. anyway, i must say that this movie is very original, i can't compare it to any other thriller. it would be one of my favorites, but the ending is the most important thing in every movie, but this one was not so enthralling. i was waiting for a huge clashing but it didn't come. i give 6 stars for this movie, because after all it was worth watching, a few scenes and ideas will remain in my head for a few days, but this could have been the best thriller of the 90's if it had a more shocking ending.;12 August 2008;6;['good', 'good', 'right', 'deadly', 'excellent', 'religious', 'historical', 'few', 'predictable', 'pregnant', 'second', 'naive', 'only', 'alive', 'dead', 'deadly', 'complete', 'original', 'other', 'important', 'enthralling', 'huge', 'worth', 'few', 'few', 'good', 'shocking'];0.1237103174603174

1181;qlqnen;i have had an odd journey with this film over the past 20+ years. i first saw it in my early teens, which was probably a bit too young. i definitely did not get all the gruesome details that are left to the viewer's imagination. as i started watching more movies as i grew up, i slowly moved away from a 'just watching' to a more analytical approach, in the sense that i started to get some idea of how fincher constructed the film and had an appreciation for the sheer technical quality of the movie. at this point, the movie was more an exercise and admiration of the film making. now, with my most recent re-watch, i suddenly was struck by the gut punch that the film delivers. it's like i've gone a full circle with the movie and back to a more emotional, visceral experience. it is a grim and dark film with not really a glimmer of light to speak of, but it's somehow not depressing like other films can be. i'm sure it's highly subjective, but for me, this is simultaneously an example of pure craftsmanship and excellence in film making, and something that after all these years and numerous re-watches delivers an emotional impact. i can't really find any flaws in it. the story moves relentlessly, acting is great (some might disagree on you-know-what), pacing is great, visually stunning in all its grime, and if you see this for the first time without knowing anything about the movie, do yourself a favor and don't spoil it for yourself, just watch it. you might not like where the story takes you along the way, but very, very few films deliver this kind of experience. the darkness is supremely crafted and not just an exploitative sideshow of nastiness.;21 June 2020;10;['odd', 'past', 'early', 'young', 'gruesome', 'more', 'analytical', 'sheer', 'technical', 'recent', 'full', 'emotional', 'visceral', 'grim', 'dark', 'other', 'sure', 'subjective', 'pure', 'numerous', 'emotional', 'great', 'great', 'stunning', 'first', 'few', 'exploitative'];0.0384424603174603

1190;musicallyrt;"i only ever take the trouble to review movies that i truly despise, and se7en is one of them. the film is a trite, cliche and asinine piece - whilst possessing some virtues, is composed primarily of sins. a quick note - other reviews seem to be criticising the ""excessive"" violence and gore in this film - what do you expect from a film about a serial killer? firstly - the acting is good, for the most part. freeman is good as the dashiell hammet/raymond chandler inspired cynical old cop. brad pitt overacts every time he is on screen, making his unbearable character even more unbearable. kevin spacey does a suitably creepy (albeit cliche) job of portraying a sadistic, masochistic serial killer. however, my main beefs with the film lies not in the acting, but in the plot. there are plot holes abound (i encourage you to read the review ""se7en problems with se7en"") but this isn't the only place where the film falls short. the entire story is predictable - as soon as we are introduced to paltrow's character we know that she's going to be the subject of some nasty work. the final scene has to be one of the biggest anti-climaxes in film history... the religious fundamentalist angle. not that i'm overtly sensitive to negative portrayals of religion, but it's getting a bit trite, don't you think? john doe (and yes, that's the name of the antagonist in this film...) killing so-and-so because the big man upstairs told him so. i mean, why can't we have a serial killer inspired by nietszche or stephen hawkings or isaac newton? why does it always have to be religion? the ""tributes"" to film noir include the colour palette used (yup, you guessed it, if you were to compress the film into a single frame, then that frame would be mostly black and white), the fashion, the typewriter that freeman's character uses, the taxis, the rain, the smog, the is-it-new-york-or-chicago-nameless-city, the well-spoken and well-read central protagonist & antagonist, the endless references (atypical to noir and pulp) to literature such as ""dante's inferno"" but this doesn't come across as some new and profound take on it - as say tarantino (pulp fiction, reservoir dogs) or the coenn brothers (the big lebowski, fargo) managed to do at a similar time, but it just comes across as a constant rehash of lamentable pulp and noir tropes that we've all seen before. it doesn't come across as engaging, entertaining, though provoking or cool - it's boring. seek out films such as ""the missing person"" or ""brick"" for a much more engaging take on neo-noir.";25 March 2013;1;['trite', 'asinine', 'quick', 'other', 'excessive', 'serial', 'good', 'most', 'good', 'dashiell', 'hammet', 'cynical', 'old', 'unbearable', 'unbearable', 'creepy', 'sadistic', 'masochistic', 'serial', 'main', 'only', 'short', 'entire', 'predictable', 'nasty', 'final', 'big', 'anti', 'religious', 'fundamentalist', 'sensitive', 'negative', 'trite', 'big', 'serial', 'single', 'black', 'white', 'new', 'central', 'endless', 'atypical', 'such', 'new', 'profound', 'reservoir', 'big', 'similar', 'constant', 'lamentable', 'entertaining', 'cool', 'boring', 'such', 'engaging'];-0.0033855033855033

1214;maxwell-364;se7en's concept is inherently interesting: a serial killer who bases his murders off of the seven deadly sins is notable enough (and certainly opens the door for social commentary), while the characters of somerset and mills are both clashing and easy to relate with in their respective passion and persnickety meticulousness. there was no doubt that following the two detectives hunt down john does was going to be a treat. but what fincher does so beautifully here is surpass the intrigue caused by the film's writing with pacing that escalates the film's events from noteworthy on a base level to thrilling. it would have been so predictable and placid to simply follow each of the seven murders like a trail of breadcrumbs, allowing the final murder scene to be the murderer's reveal and the film's final confrontation, but instead we're introduced to john doe as a character about halfway through the film. while spacey himself doesn't get screen-time until he turns himself in in the third act, doe is characterized through his ruthless pragmatism in immediately shooting at the detectives when they discover his apartment (rather than try to convince them that he's not their guy), which is later contrasted by his decision to spare mills' life: doe was hell-bent on carrying through with his plan, and the senseless killing of an officer would only cloud the message his murders were supposed to send. not to mention the fact that mills was destined to be his wrath. on that point of mills as wrath, there is a plot hole to discuss, or at the very least an incongruity. the fact that every other murder victim seemed to be the result of over a year of planning (especially sloth, who was literally entrapped for over a year) does conflict with the decision to make mills wrath after only knowing that he exists for a few days. doe is endlessly scheming and insanely careful (sanding off his own fingerprints in the off chance that he's discovered), so why would he put his plan into motion without hammering down a surefire candidate for his wrath? while doe could have simply decided that he was going to make whichever detective came after him his wrath, it sort of undermines the perfect casting of the passionate and unfocused mills as the man who would allow doe to get the better of him. looking back at the scene where mills kicks down doe's door, would just any detective have the gall to ignore the law so brusquely? perhaps somerset was supposed to be the unique one, a bastion of purity and law-abiding good-nature (whose positivity has been hammered down over time by the city's unwavering cruelty into apathy) in the sea of brutish and violent officers like mills and john c. mcginley's california. if this was intended to be doe's true message, a commentary on the state of the police force, it seems a little weak. granted, this is all based off of what could have just been a simple oversight in order to deliver the most interesting twist ending possible, but it muddles the impact of the film's ending after moving past the surprise of it. in fact, this all really only came to me hours after the film was over and i had been entranced by the atypical nature of this thriller, so i see no reason to deduct serious marks because of it. se7en is one of the best told murder mysteries out there, and worth a watch to fans of fincher and detective thrillers alike.;15 April 2015;8;['interesting', 'serial', 'deadly', 'notable', 'social', 'easy', 'respective', 'noteworthy', 'predictable', 'placid', 'final', 'final', 'third', 'ruthless', 'spare', 'bent', 'least', 'other', 'few', 'careful', 'own', 'off', 'perfect', 'unfocused', 'well', 'unique', 'good', 'unwavering', 'apathy', 'brutish', 'violent', 'true', 'little', 'weak', 'simple', 'interesting', 'possible', 'atypical', 'serious', 'worth'];0.0323611111111111
1215;Razzzor101;it's been quite a while since i didn't budge for a second while watching a movie with over two hours of runtime. the movie takes place in an unknown city where notorious crimes are committed everyday. it begins with somerset (morgan freeman) auditing a crime scene. soon after he is joined with detective mills (brad pitt)as a new partner, and they begin to investigate a series of unusual, brutal, malignant crimes beginning with an obese victim. one you get to witness each victim and how they are murdered, you get captivated to unravel not just the culprit(s) but more for the mystery and reasoning behind it. there's a point of contrast between the two main characters: somerset is lonely, experienced, patient whereas mills is a married, less experienced, and impatient detective. the plot is to hunt down the culprit(s) behind this series of brutal murders. at various points in the movie it can be seen mills letting his emotions and anger get into investigations which is totally in oppostion to somerset's idiosyncracy, which in someway plays a crucial part in the story. what makes the movie great is the twisted ending which is unparalled even today after 25 years of its initial release and david fincher executes this flawlessly.;17 October 2020;8;['second', 'unknown', 'notorious', 'new', 'unusual', 'brutal', 'malignant', 'obese', 'more', 'main', 'lonely', 'experienced', 'patient', 'married', 'experienced', 'impatient', 'brutal', 'various', 'crucial', 'great', 'twisted', 'unparalled', 'initial'];0.0557239057239057

1220;rbkavg;there are very few films which are truly shocking, brilliant and moving all at once, se7en is one such rare case. in my brief movie invested life, se7en is only one of two films i would consider a masterpiece. david fincher is my favourite director, and brad pitt my favourite actor, and this film is the reason i had begun to take note of the two. fincher's direction is immaculate and andrew kevin walker's script is unbelievably good. characters: william somerset (morgan freeman) is a retiring detective, and he embodies so perfectly - silent intelligence, as opposed to the boyish aggression of his partner, the rookie david mills (brad pitt) despite his claims of experience. both attempt to uncover a truly mesmerising case in which the killer carries out murders based on the seven deadly sins. somerset is deeply reluctant of his surrounding, whereas mills seems to feed off of it, and their partnership brings across the subtle and brash attempt of uncovering a mystery respectively. walker's script expertly devotes time through dialogue and minor actions to bring across the complexities of the two different characters and their different mindsets, whether it's their differing opinion on the killer, environment, or even how 50 bucks is spent. story & direction: as far as murder mysteries go, there are no better than se7en, its script so clever, horrifying and unique. it brings a sense of realism through the characters who live in such a wore down and dismal setting. each murder is horrific, yet as they pass, the audience become further eager to discover the killer as well as becoming further unsettled. and it is without any hesitation that i can say that se7en has the greatest ending of all time, the plot builds up sensationally, with a dark and sinister tone and the finish is so unbelievably satisfying. upon rewatches, the film only gets better. fincher's unique style only adds to the tension and disturbing nature of scenes. acting: morgan freeman as ever, gives a nuanced performance. his portrayal of somerset as having come to terms with the ugliness of reality is impeccable. brad pitt similarly does a great job of acting as the inexperienced, arrogant and angry rookie, trying to make do of his environment. the acting is top notch throughout, as murders unravel, the shock of it all is brought across expertly through the sheer quality of acting, and fincher relies on this, as opposed to cliched flashbacks. verdict: i've seen many mystery films, and none come close to fincher's masterpiece. it's dark, gripping and undeniably shocking. it's one of two films i have given the perfect 10/10. it's a must see.;2 July 2017;10;['few', 'shocking', 'brilliant', 'such', 'rare', 'brief', 'favourite', 'favourite', 'immaculate', 'good', 'silent', 'boyish', 'mesmerising', 'deadly', 'reluctant', 'subtle', 'brash', 'minor', 'different', 'different', 'well', 'clever', 'horrifying', 'unique', 'dismal', 'horrific', 'eager', 'unsettled', 'great', 'dark', 'sinister', 'satisfying', 'well', 'unique', 'disturbing', 'impeccable', 'brad', 'great', 'inexperienced', 'arrogant', 'angry', 'top', 'sheer', 'cliched', 'many', 'dark', 'shocking', 'perfect'];0.0259803921568627

1223;master_tananh;"se7en is an amazing thriller that still seems fresh even after ten years. the story revolves around two cops played by morgan freeman and brad pitt, one of whom is ready to retire and the other is just starting. freeman and pitt work great together and i was pleased to see brad in a movie where he isn't some charming bad boy like in most of his movies. it's a nice change and i'd like to see him do more characters like that. freeman of course does a spectacular job as well, but that goes without saying. although the new cop/old cop pairing has been done jillions of times before, somehow freeman and pitt manage to make their characters different and captivating. the two, after a rough start, become friends and a good subplot involving gwyneth paltrow as pitt's wife, emerges that is a nice respite from the grittier main story, which of course later ties in with the main plot later, as in every respectable movie. of course, the real focus of the movie is not about our protagonists. a serial killer (kevin spacey) has started a killing spree and chooses his victims based on the seven deadly sins, which are gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy, and wrath. he chooses very creative fates in which he fights fire with fire so to speak as he turns their sins against them. this is where the movie gets very graphic. the ""sinner's"" fates are both cruel and unusual. if you're sqeamish, stay away, but it really isn't too bad compared to other movies. you never actually see the murders take place, just the corpses and aftermath. (which is bad enough) this provides a nice balance that helps you focus on the detectives and their search for the elusive culprit behind all this as opposed to the story just being an excuse to show you grisly murders like the saw series. most of the movie revolves around the cops finding the various victims and trying to make sense of the antagonist's tantalizing hints and clues. the villain is very mysterious, and is definitely an interesting head case. he remains an enigma right up to the end, but luckily you do get to see how his mind works near the end. spacey does a spectacular job portraying this mysterious figure when he's on screen, but sadly he's only really in it during the final part of the movie. but this isn't really a complaint. it's an interesting step out of the norm to not fill the screen time with the villain calling the heroes every five minutes to let him know that he hates them and they'll never prevail against his evil plan. the entire movie has a very dark and gloomy feel to it. just about every inside scene is dark and outside it's usually always raining or cloudy. se7en is a great thriller that should appeal to everyone except for those who think that all movies should be fairy tales and should end perfectly. the plot runs along at a good pace and has one of the greatest (not happiest) surprise endings i've ever seen. i never saw it coming even as it was happening. perhaps what i like the most about se7en is that it is not just a gore fest. it has a feel of intelligence and even makes statements about the evils in our society and our tolerance of them. pretty daring for a thriller. with it's dark mood, creative characters, and spectacular plot, se7en comes highly recommended. a 10 out of 10.";9 September 2005;10;['amazing', 'fresh', 'brad', 'ready', 'other', 'great', 'pleased', 'charming', 'bad', 'most', 'nice', 'more', 'spectacular', 'new', 'old', 'different', 'rough', 'good', 'nice', 'gritty', 'main', 'main', 'respectable', 'real', 'serial', 'deadly', 'creative', 'graphic', 'cruel', 'unusual', 'sqeamish', 'bad', 'other', 'bad', 'nice', 'elusive', 'saw', 'most', 'various', 'mysterious', 'interesting', 'spectacular', 'mysterious', 'final', 'interesting', 'evil', 'entire', 'dark', 'gloomy', 'inside', 'dark', 'cloudy', 'great', 'good', 'great', 'happy', 'most', 'f', 'dark', 'creative', 'spectacular'];0.2170528817587641

1241;arunangshuch;"an intensely claustrophobic, gut-wrenching thriller about two policemen's desperate efforts to stop an ingenious serial killer whose work is inspired by the seven deadly sins, this weirdly off-kilter suspense goes well beyond the usual police procedural or killer-on-a-rampage yarn due to a fine script, striking craftsmanship and a masterful performance by morgan freeman. the story surrounds the hunt for a serial killer, who, inspired by dante alighieri's seven deadly sins from ""the divine comedy"", sets out to, ""preach"" about man's impurity, and does so by targeting victims, then torturing them by pitting their own underlining sins against them. se7en seemingly starts out as a typical cat and mouse detective story, however, it quickly develops into of a sort of modern-myth, with good and evil taking center stage. the story is original on all counts, and thrilling on all levels. the most important aspect of se7en, however, is that it keeps the audience numerous steps behind its story, as oppose to other thrillers, which become predictable and bland by the end. by keeping the audience in the dark, the film remains fresh and original as it progresses. se7en even dramatically turns the tide at one point, just as the audience is finally getting comfortable and asserted into the gloomy atmosphere, thus creating as much as fear and uncertainty in the audience as it is with the characters involved. by the film's conclusion, the audience is as much apart of the film as the characters themselves, and arrive at se7en's surprise ending without a single clue of it, prior to it occurring. se7en shows us a world which has been destroyed by its own sins, a wasteland in which values are minimal. the killer, having nothing but contempt for this world, sees it as his mission to expose the faults and show everyone what they have become. it is a fascinating twist that when the killers motives become clearer, somerset with his greater understanding actually feels some degree of empathy with him. this is lost on mills though, whose level of clarity never reaches the same point. as the cops move closer to their foe (whose identity is revealed late and by then it doesn't really matter anyway since it's fundamentally irrelevant) the movie shifts from thriller territory into the realms of horror, and it's here that fincher and screenwriter andrew kevin walker pull off their greatest coup, a piece of cinematic genius - the most downbeat ending imaginable. ever. you come away reeling, emotionally and mentally, shaken and most definitely stirred, muttering to yourself that they couldn't possibly have done that.";14 August 2020;9;['claustrophobic', 'desperate', 'ingenious', 'serial', 'deadly', 'usual', 'procedural', 'fine', 'masterful', 'serial', 'deadly', 'divine', 'own', 'underlining', 'typical', 'modern', 'good', 'evil', 'original', 'important', 'numerous', 'other', 'predictable', 'bland', 'fresh', 'original', 'comfortable', 'gloomy', 'much', 'much', 'single', 'own', 'minimal', 'fascinating', 'clear', 'great', 'same', 'irrelevant', 'great', 'cinematic', 'downbeat', 'imaginable'];0.1334485407066052

1249;hawkeyepierce3191;"se7en is so interesting in a number of ways and for a number of reasons. the first is simply that murder stories have an interesting, visceral appeal which se7en is able to put to use. to compound the powerful drawing force of murder mysteries, se7en has easily one of the most interesting concepts in the history of murder mysteries, as the killer bases his murders on dante's seven deadly sins. each new murder proves to be an interesting twist, since new details about the case as a whole are revealed, and since there's no telling in what gruesome fashion the murder will have been carried out. indeed, the murders of se7en are symbolic yet extremely grisly, meaning that the movie will both capture your attention and take a part of it for good. the movie is also given excellent performances by morgan freeman and kevin costner. in the type of performance that by now seemed attuned to his abilities, freeman plays a muted, wizened character who has seen his share of crap in the world. costner also gives an excellent performance, both in how he plays quieter parts well, and how he fills the shoes of a serial killer perfectly. the best villains are the ones who truly believe they are doing the right thing. easily the most chilling scene of the movie is the scene where costner explains his side of the story. as freeman's character describes, the killings are his ""sermons"" to the world, his teachings to a world with a skewed perception of morality. ""fight club"" director david fincher brings his gritty, dark sense of style to se7en by filling the spaces with shadows and quiet, creepy music. it becomes clear almost immediately that this unnamed city is a place to hate--a dirty place full of prostitutes, beggars, and psychos, a city that shares none of the glamour of the darkened ""sin city."" as the movie progresses, more and more you get the feeling that it's getting darker, and that everything is spiraling out of control. that said, the movie has several very distinct weaknesses which easily make it harder to watch, and harder to enjoy in principle. the gaping hole in se7en is named brad pitt--while clearly his character is meant as freeman's foil--an impatient, aggressive rookie--he ends up being frustrating and obnoxious throughout the movie. there is an immediate attraction to freeman's character, and so with the introduction and development of pitt's character, mills, you end up liking him less and less. the vast majority of the profanity is used by pitt, and it is not used in an effective manner at all. furthermore, mills does not have one interesting bone in his body, and pitt's acting skills are mia for the duration. pitt is obviously more attuned to unique roles, such as tyler durden, and not roles requiring a typical type of acting. the ending, while interesting and definitely worthwhile in concept--and on the script--is dumbed down quite a bit by the anti-climatic pacing and pitt's aforementioned shortcomings. but when you can ignore pitt as much as possible, and when spacey's character is introduced, se7en proves itself to be one of the most interesting concepts in a long time that is, for the most part, cashed in on.";19 November 2006;8;['interesting', 'first', 'interesting', 'visceral', 'able', 'powerful', 'interesting', 'deadly', 'new', 'interesting', 'new', 'gruesome', 'symbolic', 'excellent', 'attuned', 'excellent', 'serial', 'good', 'right', 'chilling', 'skewed', 'gritty', 'dark', 'quiet', 'creepy', 'clear', 'unnamed', 'dirty', 'full', 'more', 'more', 'dark', 'several', 'distinct', 'hard', 'brad', 'impatient', 'aggressive', 'frustrating', 'obnoxious', 'immediate', 'less', 'vast', 'effective', 'interesting', 'attuned', 'unique', 'such', 'typical', 'interesting', 'worthwhile', 'anti', 'climatic', 'aforementioned', 'possible', 'interesting', 'long', 'most'];0.1672373081463989

1268;jameslaw;"this movie's title sequence alone has changed the film and television mediums forever. even if you aren't a film buff, you will immediately recognize this after seeing this beautifully creepy, acid-washed and frantic collage of images. fincher's stylistic use of framing, lighting, and choice of cinematographer creates a mood that sinks like a brick to the pit of your stomach. if i were to choose a genre movie that could definetley top johnathan demme's ""the silence of the lambs"", this would be the one. brad pitt, morgan freeman and gwenyth paltrow are dead-on portraying each of their characters; respectively: a detective who has requested a transfer to the non-specific city's seedier side, a veteran detective who is set to retire in seven days, and a wife who is entirely reluctant about moving to this inner-city. the events which unfold, wrap these characters into a series of situations where no viewer will guess the horrifying ending until it is fully set in motion. spacey alone deserves a separate paragraph. if you thought hannibal was devious and witty (and he is), check out mr. spacey as john doe. his subtle portrayal is in contrast to mr. hopkin's over-the-top, almost campy hannibal lector. kevin spacey sets the ""creep-factor"" to 10 in his vision of a truly sadistic serial killer. do yourself a favor, even if you aren't a noir or horror fan. see this movie, because there are a myriad of reasons to appreciate what fincher has created. if you think you won't get into the story because this, at first glance, appears to be a glorified horror movie, you will be cheating yourself out an incredible film experience.";4 January 2001;10;['creepy', 'washed', 'frantic', 'stylistic', 'dead', 'non', 'specific', 'seedier', 'veteran', 'reluctant', 'inner', 'horrifying', 'separate', 'hannibal', 'devious', 'witty', 'subtle', 'campy', 'hannibal', 'creep', 'sadistic', 'serial', 'first', 'incredible'];-0.0283333333333333

1303;brramirezv;seven is a movie starring for morgan freeman and brad pitt, a couple of geniuses of the acting in the shoes of the investigators william sommerset and david mills, respectively. the movie is classified as a suspense movie, because it unfolds through around to a serie of crimes which started to committed by a serial killer without any cause, however, each of one of the victims were represented by each of one of the seven deadly sins, reminder how we know that seven sins are the causes of any other perversions of the human, according to the christian religion. the movie also is acclaimed because it takes us for many possible emotions from some smiles to the frightening, the astonishing and more than anything to the reflexion about what it's wrong and what it's well, according the viewpoint and what it implies the consequences of a lot of the human behaviors. the film could be leave nuisance, because isn't the casual end of a crime movie where always the good guy wins and the bad guy lost or where the good guy is who leave the reflexion. also, the movie is too chritic and we make us think in the true repentance for the wrong done or just an contrition act, where the regret is not for loving god but it's for what the person can lost. another part about the movie is about the murderer, a methodic and specially patiance man, who has most the planned things and he knows that even in the end of their lifes, the humans ever ends falling into the life's perversions. for least like extra point about the movie, the setting of the scenes (like the weather and the light in closed areas), the photography and the make up complete all the whole of mistery, misery and darkness what distinguish this amazing movie.;28 April 2020;9;['brad', 'serial', 'deadly', 'other', 'many', 'possible', 'frightening', 'astonishing', 'more', 'wrong', 'human', 'casual', 'good', 'bad', 'good', 'chritic', 'true', 'methodic', 'most', 'least', 'extra', 'amazing'];0.1014705882352941

1316;zuacalo;those, you may recall, are gluttony, greed, sloth, pride, lust, envy and anger. in hollywood, sin 8 is a gimmick, a flaw of which the film in question is certainly guilty. the funny thing about seven, however, is that except for its easy, familiar and ridiculously misleading plot, it's a nice murder mystery. morgan freeman and brad pitt play big city cops on a case concerning a serial killer intent on punishing seven people, each of whom represents one of the sins. this is an absolutely hilarious idea, of course. and because there is no real motive for the murders, the case doesn't lend itself to the kind of investigative techniques that often result in intriguing detective stories. what the film does have, however, is a phenomenal film noir atmosphere and some top-notch performances. freeman and pitt may be playing two of the most garish thriller cliches, the retiring veteran and the newcomer, but they breathe new life into their roles. freeman, especially, sets the tone. as somerset, a 34-year-old veteran, the actor's slightly stiff professional bearing has great authority, while his heavy eyes speak of deep sadness. we sense that he knows more than he's saying, more than pitt, as somerset's newly arrived replacement, can guess. what saves pitt's performance as mills from hellish cliche is his total lack of warmth. mills may be young and new to the task, but he is a wise cop. he just doesn't know how bad things can get on this particular beat. good work is also done by gwyneth paltrow (pitt's real-life girlfriend, by the way) as mills' wife and by kevin spacey (the usual suspects), who turns in another of his quietly understated performances. the screenplay is credited to andrew whaker walker, a rookie who once worked as a manager at a large record store. (ever since pulp fiction's quentin tarantino revealed that he used to work at a video store, this kind of information has infiltrated the official bios of more and more movie people.) it's a pretty creepy movie, with lots of blood and dead bodies, etc. however, fincher has the tact to minimize the violence that created the bloodshed. the dark mood he and his cast set is actually to be admired: a solemn tribute to somerset and all those years of incredulous sleuthing. it makes you wish the script was better than it is. the sin of contrivance may not be one of the greatest, but it does take its toll.;11 May 2021;10;['guilty', 'funny', 'easy', 'familiar', 'misleading', 'nice', 'big', 'serial', 'hilarious', 'real', 'investigative', 'intriguing', 'phenomenal', 'top', 'garish', 'new', 'old', 'stiff', 'professional', 'great', 'heavy', 'deep', 'more', 'more', 'hellish', 'total', 'young', 'new', 'wise', 'bad', 'particular', 'good', 'real', 'usual', 'large', 'official', 'more', 'more', 'creepy', 'dead', 'dark', 'solemn', 'incredulous', 'well', 'great'];0.1935064935064935
1317;SPARKVULPA;"when i first came across se7en, it was a sad and forgetful experience. however, upon watching it again as an adult, i now realize how much i had missed, as well as how it could be a masterpiece, depending on how one interprets the final few scenes. my scrutiny begins and ends with the astounding utilization of the last two of the seven deadly sins: envy and wrath. before john doe (kevin spacey) turns himself in, mills (brad pitt) receives a note from his wife, which he never gets a chance to read. whilst the three men, somerset (morgan freeman), mills and john doe drive to the location with the ""last two bodies"", john doe clearly and passionately states that he only kills those who are not innocent. this is especially important, as mills' wife, from everything we know as the audience, which, in turn, is everything john doe could possibly know about her, is an innocent person. when they arrive, they find a corpse of a wild dog, to which john doe declares, ""i didn't do that"", emphasizing the ""that"", which helps answer mills' question, ""what's in the box?"" not a part of mills' wife, but rather, his dog. wrath can only be exercised if there is no ""revenge"" involved, as that would be 'lex talionis' or 'an eye for an eye', not blind rage. knowing that john doe is not an idiot who would suddenly go against his own rules, especially for the grand finale, he could effortlessly shape the situation to bring out the wrath from mills through this final ""test"" without having to harm innocent civilians. somerset, having seen what is in the box prior to mills, realizes the dire situation he had put mills in by leaving him alone with john doe, who is able to easily manipulate and agitate mills. however, somerset is unable to tell mills what is in the box, as that would ultimately allow john doe to win the ""game"", simultaneously disallowing somerset to determine whether or not mills is ready to fill in his shoes once he retires from the police department. ultimately, mills kills john doe without knowing what is box, exercising wrath and losing the ""game"". in the final scene, we see that mills is dispirited, perhaps from finally reading the note his wife left him, only to realize that she is well, and that he had just become a sinner. somerset decides to stay ""around"", as he has failed to find a worthy successor, who he believed could be mills, had he passed john doe's test. this rather far-fetched take on the ending is not only plausible, but for the sake of se7en's character continuity, also logical. even the se7en wiki suggests that mills' wife is dead, which is frivolous and perfunctory, especially given that the director clearly left the final scenes to be interpreted by the audience. much like young me, countless theatergoers were and still are unable to see the possibilities in se7en that completely alter the ending. the true sin in this film was apathy and inattention; the sinners being somerset and other citizens of bardach county. ironically, most of us take significant scenes at face value, unable to care or think twice about our ugly world, committing the same sins as those in se7en. <ul><li>spark vulpa</li></ul>";23 September 2020;9;['sad', 'forgetful', 'much', 'final', 'few', 'astounding', 'last', 'deadly', 'last', 'innocent', 'important', 'innocent', 'wild', 'blind', 'own', 'grand', 'final', 'innocent', 'dire', 'alone', 'able', 'unable', 'ready', 'final', 'well', 'worthy', 'fetched', 'plausible', 'logical', 'dead', 'frivolous', 'perfunctory', 'final', 'young', 'countless', 'unable', 'true', 'apathy', 'other', 'most', 'significant', 'unable', 'ugly', 'same'];0.0852380952380952

1358;Insipid_Shell;"the movie, ""se7en"", starring brad pitt, morgan freeman, and gwyneth paltrow, is by far one of the most inventive, well-written, and cerebral films in recent history. the film, blending a well put together combination of dark visual style, intense plot development, and polished acting, remains tight and focused throughout, from beginning to end, never straying outwards into unimportant issues, or resorting to typical hollywood cliches. se7en is uniquely on its own for suspense dramas as it both fuels the need of the audience to be drawn in and entertained by the events unfolding, and remain uncompromising and shocking, thus satisfying the initial vision of the director, david fincher. the story surrounds the hunt for a serial killer, who, inspired by dante alighieri's seven deadly sins from ""the divine comedy"", sets out to, ""preach"" about man's impurity, and does so by targeting victims, then torturing them by pitting their own underlining sins against them. se7en seemingly starts out as a typical cat and mouse detective story, however, it quickly develops into of a sort of modern-myth, with good and evil taking centre stage. the story is original on all counts, and thrilling on all levels. the most important aspect of se7en, however, is that it keeps the audience numerous steps behind its story, as oppose to other thrillers, which become predictable and bland by the end. by keeping the audience in the dark, the film remains fresh and original as it progresses. se7en even dramatically turns the tide at one point, just as the audience is finally getting comfortable and asserted into the gloomy atmosphere, thus creating as much as fear and uncertainty in the audience as it is with the characters involved. by the film's conclusion, the audience is as much apart of the film as the characters themselves, and arrive at se7en's surprise ending without a single clue of it, prior to it occurring. se7en's poetic ending(which will not be given away) says a lot for the people behind the movie, showing they are not afraid of going against the grain. a rarity with films so nowadays. directed brilliantly by david fincher, and skillfully written by andrew kevin walker, se7en is well crafted and ingeniously clever, making it one of the greatest films of the 90's. while se7en may not have garnered critical acclaim as such films as silence of the lambs, se7en is, undoubtedly, as influential as any film to date. score 10/10";25 March 2002;10;['inventive', 'cerebral', 'recent', 'dark', 'visual', 'intense', 'polished', 'tight', 'unimportant', 'typical', 'own', 'shocking', 'initial', 'serial', 'deadly', 'divine', 'own', 'underlining', 'typical', 'modern', 'good', 'evil', 'original', 'important', 'numerous', 'other', 'predictable', 'bland', 'fresh', 'original', 'comfortable', 'gloomy', 'much', 'much', 'single', 'poetic', 'afraid', 'clever', 'great', 'critical', 'such', 'influential'];0.0474747474747474

1388;sharma-dishant;"ever seen hell on earth? probably not. david fincher shows the closest thing you shall ever see with his depiction of a story of a serial killer meting out punishments to the people committing the seven deadly sins within an anonymous american city with its perpetual silvery rain, the scantiness of light and the constant depressing atmosphere that lurks over your shoulder all the time with an air of melancholy all around. this movie makes for a gory, gloomy and an uncomfortable watch but mind you the mystery is ever so riveting that it keeps you glued to the edge of your seats till the very end. david fincher, andrew walker and darius khondji have created such a masterpiece that this movie can rightly be called as the worthy successor to the ""silence of the lambs"" in regards to the serial killer genre. the movie has a neo noir feel due to the scant usage of light and the constant rains in this unnamed anonymous city. the storyline goes into a realm of its own, where a serial killer is on a carefully planned elaborate spree that dwells into an analysis of a mad man's mind who is convinced that he has been sent on this earth to bring to the attention to the common people that all they have been doing on this earth is sins , and the way he chooses to catch the attention of the commoners is by punishing the sinners in ways he feels fit. morgan freeman plays william somerset a veteran soon-to-retire detective with his partner david mills being the idealistic but rash rookie played by brad pitt. they meet up on a site of a murder scene, a pictorial description of which may force many of us to throw up, and then from there on unfolds a saga consisting of crime unimaginable and so gory that to say it is savagery would be an understatement. the detectives get embroiled in the case and each day brings to them crimes of such barbarity that makes you think of the killer as an equivalent to satan himself. first comes gluttony with an obese man forced to feed until he bursts. second is greed with a lawyer forced to exact a pound of flesh from his own body. third is sloth with a drug addict tied to his bed for over a year. fourth in line is lust with a hooker brutally murdered while being involved in the act. fifth in the cycle is pride with what seems to be an actress who has been horribly disfigured and is given a choice to call for help and live a life with the mutilation or to commit suicide thus saving grace. and the last two sins envy and wrath make up for the most exciting ending to a story i have seen in my life. the brutality of the punishments captured on screen, (dare i say) in my opinion could have only been done by fincher and tarantino, which each murder scene being exponentially more brutal than the previous. the background score is so perfect in maintaining the horrific atmosphere that it's a compliment to the work howard shore himself has done over the years , the diversity of work he has done made him the perfect choice for the composer of such a film. the acting by the leads morgan freeman, brad pitt and kevin spacey only consolidates the class in which they stand, amongst the greatest of our times. all in all, this movie is classic modern horror with a twist/finale to die for. the movie, from the sensory assaulting title sequence to the nerve wracking finale goes for your gut and makes you feed on it all the while constantly gnawing on your brain until you give up and starting believing that the place you live in is truly an infernal cesspool. this movie leaves you reeling, emotionally and mentally and you have a feeling of having been robbed of mental peace. i leave you with this advice - try not to expect it to be a comfortable viewing.";9 June 2013;9;['close', 'serial', 'deadly', 'anonymous', 'american', 'perpetual', 'silvery', 'constant', 'depressing', 'you', 'gloomy', 'uncomfortable', 'riveting', 'very', 'worthy', 'serial', 'neo', 'due', 'scant', 'constant', 'unnamed', 'anonymous', 'own', 'serial', 'elaborate', 'mad', 'common', 'fit', 'idealistic', 'rash', 'brad', 'pictorial', 'many', 'unimaginable', 'such', 'obese', 'second', 'own', 'third', 'sloth', 'fifth', 'last', 'exciting', 'tarantino', 'brutal', 'previous', 'perfect', 'horrific', 'perfect', 'great', 'classic', 'modern', 'sensory', 'infernal', 'mental', 'comfortable'];0.0938172043010752

1404;dionnevdnat;are you afraid of the deathly sins? by dionne van der nat, floris van hoogdalem and myrte tjoa this review is about the film 'seven', directed by david fincher. the film is set in 1995, the year in which the movie was released. in which city the film is set, is unclear and unmentioned in the film. the two main characters, detectives mills and somerset are played by brad pitt and morgan freeman. it is a thriller which is very well directed and acted. the film se7en is about two detectives who try to solve a series of brute murders. detective summerset is retiring in seven days, the seven days relate to the title of the film and the seven murders committed. mills, the young detective, is desperately willing to do a case on his own. every murder committed relates to one of the deathly sins. when the two detectives discover after the second murder they are dealing with the seven deathly sins they know there are some more horrible murders about to happen. summerset and mills try and do their best to catch this guy, but are they able to stop him in time? we thought seven is a very good film and enjoyed watching it even more than once. the film is really catching and moving. while watching the film you have the feeling you are really in it and everything in the film is really happening around you, you can feel the terror and fear of the characters. unlike other films you can relate seven to reality, without knowing everyone sometimes feels or acts like the deathly sins, what if you would be murdered if you did again...? firstly, what makes this movie brilliant is that the acting is very convincing in se7en. the character of william somerset is brilliantly played by morgan freeman. his facial expressions, the way he talks and even his body language makes us believe in the character of william somerset and he develops throughout the film. the connection between him and brad pitt is great and also shows us what a great actor brad pitt actually is. david mills is the young gun in the movie, he is eager to learn and pitt sells this really well. the two completely different detectives develop their 'bromance' throughout the film and you develop a form of sympathy towards the two. another great acting performance is from gwyneth paltrow, who plays mils' wife. the young actress has to make david mills feel comfortable in his new surrounding and she tries to do that, although she herself is very insecure. paltrow might be one of the most important characters in the whole story. secondly, the editing plays an important role in the movie. on the dvd version of the movie they show how and why they have sometimes edited the light and shots. when a scene with a negative mood is filmed, they edit the light in such a way that it is very dark at the set. when a scene with a positive atmosphere is filmed the set has been edited much lighter. the head-space of the actors has been chosen with care, e.g. in a serious scene they want to show the whole face of morgan freeman to show how serious he is and they also do this in the opposite way to create suspense. the use of the reverse shot is used quite often in this kind of movie, especially when there are interrogations. se7en is not an exception, this technique also creates suspense, and you can clearly see the intentions of the one who talks. the average shot length in this movie is different per shot and this makes you think about it. the director has done this sometimes to create suspense, sometimes to make things clearer for the viewer. the use of parallel editing is not used that often in this movie, but when it is used, it is very effective and sometimes it shows a surprise. thirdly, the use of camera-work is from big importance in the movie. the director sometimes does not show things to manipulate us into thinking nothing is there. the use of reverse shot has been discussed in the paragraph above and this is vital in the movie to show the emotions from the characters during conversations. the way we see the corpses for the first time in this movie is also very well done. the camera is moving very slowly and you will see the grossest thing first. this creates a form of disgust and sometimes leave you breathless. the close-ups are mainly to show that the characters are worried and you can see the desperate look in their eyes. the movement of the camera when the detectives are chasing someone makes you feel part of the action and is therefore used effectively. the angle of the camera is sometimes used to make one of the characters look heroic (low angle) or to make a character look weak and vulnerable. the low angle technique is effectively used when the detectives chase the serial killer and it stocks your breath at that point. we think this film was really well thought of and very well casted. everything said in the film really makes you believe the serial killer could stand right behind you. the camera-work is very well done and the music well-chosen. the suspense keeps up throughout the entire film and at the end of the film we were breathless. we think this was a very good movie, and although is was made almost twenty years ago, the special effects are used effectively and the actors are believable. we really recommend watching this film!;12 June 2012;8;['afraid', 'deathly', 'myrte', 'unclear', 'unmentioned', 'main', 'brad', 'brute', 'young', 'willing', 'own', 'deathly', 'second', 'deathly', 'horrible', 'good', 'able', 'good', 'other', 'deathly', 'convincing', 'facial', 'great', 'great', 'young', 'eager', 'different', 'great', 'young', 'comfortable', 'new', 'insecure', 'important', 'whole', 'important', 'negative', 'dark', 'positive', 'light', 'serious', 'whole', 'serious', 'opposite', 'reverse', 'average', 'different', 'clear', 'parallel', 'effective', 'big', 'reverse', 'vital', 'first', 'gross', 'breathless', 'close', 'worried', 'desperate', 'heroic', 'low', 'weak', 'vulnerable', 'low', 'serial', 'serial', 'entire', 'breathless', 'good', 'special', 'believable'];0.1311688311688312

1407;max-cameron;i brought this film from virgin mega-stores not to long ago, for 3.99... i had heard that it was a classic horror/thriller of the 90's so i brought it. i went home and watched it that night to find one of the best movies i have ever seen. you should go out and buy it for a lot more than that,(but don't because you know that the second you do you'll turn around and see it for cheaper and then hate yourself for being impatient.) i had also heard that it was gratuitously gory and violent, upon watching the film i was pleasantly surprised. in my opinion violence can be used to great effect, and also ,in my experience, films that have been certified '18' because of their violence are often over the top and unnecessary. for example 'kill bill' although i found it entertaining (to a point) you start to think that no character in the films life is important because they are being disembowelled left, right and centre, and as soon as you take that away, you take away the reality of it, because in real life every life matters and you cannot just chop through 88 people with a samurai sword. so i thought that this may perhaps be the case for seven. i was, however, wrong. at points david fincher used extreme violence but it works well and makes the audience root even more for mills(pitt) and somerset(freeman) because you want them to solve the crime and be done with this disgusting world (morgan freeman is retiring after the case, and brad pitt's wife wants to go back to the city they recently moved from). another great thing about seven is that not only does it thrill and disturb but it also makes you question the world that we live in. the film is set in the modern day, but in no particular place. it is a dark and grim city filled with crime and corruption, and it makes the audience really think about crime, helped along by morgan freemen who often talks about whether or not crime will stop, or will it go on for ever and why. the acting is brilliant, the contrast between mills and somerset, somerset being the old, experienced cop on the verge of retirement and mills, the hot-headed rookie. one of my favourite parts is when morgan freeman tells pitt he should read up on the crimes, and gives him a list of books to get. later we see a policeman handing the revision notes versions of the books (including 'dante's inferno') to pitt. kevin spacy plays 'the bad guy' fantastically, a calm slimy, religious fanatic, who's voice makes you want to turn the tv off and stop watching. the end sequence is very emotional and the tension is increased by a ten minute long car journey with the two heroes in front and kevin spacy in the back cleverly named john doe, the police slang for an unidentified body. this is an amazing film, scary, tense thought provoking and even funny at times, definitely a classic, and if you have 3.99 i know what i'd spend it on...;29 April 2006;10;['virgin', 'classic', 'good', 'more', 'second', 'cheap', 'impatient', 'gory', 'violent', 'surprised', 'great', 'unnecessary', 'entertaining', 'important', 'left', 'right', 'real', 'wrong', 'extreme', 'disgusting', 'great', 'modern', 'particular', 'dark', 'grim', 'brilliant', 'old', 'experienced', 'headed', 'favourite', 'bad', 'calm', 'religious', 'emotional', 'long', 'front', 'back', 'unidentified', 'amazing', 'scary', 'tense', 'funny'];0.0405753968253968

1431;UblaGoo;"se7en is an amazing movie in so many ways. it is, in fact, my favorite movie, and here is why: to me, the story and themes in se7en are incredibly interesting and well thought out. it is not so much the murderer, the killings, and the police work that matter, it's what lies beyond these. the movie deals with the fundamental ways with which we look at life. this is demonstrated best by the diametrically opposite views of detectives mills and somerset, respectively, but also the views of the killer, in contrast to their views. apathy is the key word here, while choice is another important factor, which is intrinsically connected to apathy. apart from this, the story is masterfully told; it does not rush anything. it takes its time to make the points it needs, which are plenty, without seeming to add any superfluous elements. the technical aspects are pure genius. not only is everything executed flawlessly, but put together it all has a certain synergy that makes it all seem, well, better than perfect, really. the cinematography is excellent. many of the camera angles are different, but not weird or artsy just for the sake of being either of those. the visuals have a sharp purity to them, and are incredibly clean. so clean, in fact, that you can see the dirt and dust in the air at times (particularly in the gluttony crime scene.) many scenes are somewhat dark and gray, for instance all the rain, but it is shown so artfully, which makes them incredibly interesting instead of just depressing. this depressing motif is highly fitting to the themes the movie deals with, though, so it is not at all out of place or misused, in order to try to just seem artsy or dark. the sound and music is not just good, but so fitting and so well done that it actually enhances the experience of the movie, something i feel sound and music are supposed to do in movies and not just in the simple and cheap way tension music does it in so many thrilled and horror movies. both the sound and music go in and interact with the visuals (or the other way around) on just about all situations in the movie. like the very first scene, where we see somerset in his kitchen, where the ambient sound actually goes in and gives us audio clues to the surroundings and situation. or the legendary (often since copied, never outdone or equaled) intro title sequence, where the titles and the gritty, almost evil visuals move and shake in sync with the industrial grinding of nine inch nails' ""closer"". a scene standing in stark contrast with that one, but no less interesting, is the library scene, with bach playing in the back (until it slowly moves into the front). it is an incredibly aesthetically pleasing scene, almost like a fully fitting music video for one of the most soothing pieces of classical music around. there are many other scenes that merit at least a page each of praise on the audio and visual aspects, like the lust scene, the interrogation scene, the chase scene and the scenes from the movie's finale, but there is simply not room for it here. the acting is also dead on. it is just so fitting that it becomes great. freeman has an aura of experience and intelligence over him, but also a strong sense of having given up and resignation that often shows, as the character is supposed to be portrayed. pitt might not have gotten equally appreciated with his effort, but living up to freeman is no easy task. i feel pitt, with his impatience and visible energy, does an incredible job, playing the diametric opposite to somerset, which in my mind is the exact way that character is supposed to be portrayed, as well. the movie, i feel, leaves you stunned. it gets the point across better than any movie i have seen, not just by cheap shock effects, but by a deep, disturbing rumbling that culminates in terrible realization. it does indeed get your attention by hitting you with a sledgehammer. as a final note, i would like to mention that the amount of gore and violence seen in the movie is not great. strangely, many people seem to think so. they claim the movie was too harsh and violent, but when you confront them with this, it turns out they only got this impression, but didn't actually see anything. this, i feel, is a testament towards the skill with which the director so expertly implies these things, instead of going for cheap, visual thrills and shock effects by actually showing all the gore. and that is why se7en is my favorite movie.";19 January 2006;10;['amazing', 'many', 'favorite', 'interesting', 'much', 'fundamental', 'opposite', 'apathy', 'key', 'important', 'apathy', 'superfluous', 'technical', 'pure', 'certain', 'well', 'perfect', 'excellent', 'many', 'different', 'weird', 'artsy', 'sharp', 'clean', 'clean', 'many', 'dark', 'gray', 'interesting', 'depressing', 'depressing', 'fitting', 'artsy', 'dark', 'good', 'fitting', 'simple', 'cheap', 'many', 'thrilled', 'other', 'first', 'ambient', 'audio', 'legendary', 'gritty', 'evil', 'industrial', 'close', 'stark', 'interesting', 'pleasing', 'fitting', 'classical', 'many', 'other', 'least', 'audio', 'visual', 'dead', 'fitting', 'great', 'strong', 'easy', 'visible', 'incredible', 'exact', 'stunned', 'well', 'cheap', 'deep', 'terrible', 'final', 'great', 'many', 'harsh', 'violent', 'cheap', 'visual', 'favorite'];0.2087868480725624

1437;MatsFCT;the movie se7en tells the story of two homicide detectives, david mills (brad pitt) and william sommerset (morgan freeman), who try to solve seven mysterious murders. all the seven murders are committed very sadistically as the victims are badly mutilated. the mutilations have the purpose of symbolizing the seven deadly sins described in the bible. david mills is the new homicide detective and he is aided by the soon to retire william sommerset. the difference between old 'veteran' sommerset and 'rookie' mills brings quite some conflicts in the beginning, but eventually the both of them agree that if they want to catch the killer, they will have to work together and make use of each other's strengths. the movie takes some major twists and turns at the end, and this does contribute to giving the movie a satisfying ending. we think se7en is a good movie. the story behind the murders with the seven sins connected to it makes you think, whether or not the murders were really that bad, or did the victims (sort of) deserve it? asking yourself this question is the result of the strong movie, as you would normally not even consider if a murder was right or not. as mentioned before, the movie builds up to the end, which does live up to the expectations created by the rest of the film, as the ending is just as dramatic and well done as the other parts of the film, which leaves you with a satisfied feeling. editing plays a very big and important role in the production of movies, and this movie is no exception. basically, everything that is even slightly altered from the recorded parts is included in the category editing. editing therefore is making changes in filmed fragments, and putting these changed fragments together to form a fluent and pleasant to watch movie. an editor therefore has to make a lot of decisions. what parts should he choose to put together to create the right feeling and to satisfy the producer? why should he choose these? etc. editing, however, is not just used to make the movie look good or catchy, it's also used to give the audience a certain feeling, imprinted in their minds by the director. in this way, the director can set the experience of the movie to his hand. using things such as different lighting, camera height, music and shot length, the movie directors can give the audience certain opinions about the characters without even having the character say a single word. characters with power are often filmed from a low perspective, as this symbolizes them being greater than you. meanwhile, meaner or evil characters often have a darker glow around them and different background music, because this creates tension. difference in shot length shows a difference in the amount of energy used. the shorter the shots, the more energy is in the actions. for example, in a shooter, shots constantly change from one to the other, whereas in a love-story, the shot length is way longer, to make it more romantic and lovable. this movie includes a lot of dramatic and painful scenes, wherein the director made use of a range of different shot transitions, to highlight the different amounts of tension in the scenes. in order to make sure that the message is communicated to the audience, they use longer shots and they pause between the monologues. in this way, the audience is forced to think about what's being said and what the message of the movie is. when energetic and active scenes are concerned, the director chose for short shot length, and fast shot transitions, in order to give the scenes more speed. the film was shot in a way that is uncommon in popular films. it was shot in a special way using special lighting, making lots of shadows and silhouettes. the film was then edited with a process called c.c.e, which enhances the quality of the lights, making the dark parts darker and the light parts whiter. this alteration from the original is permanent. most of the colors used are shades of black and grey, so that parts of the images with primary colors (red, yellow and blue) stand out in contrast. in this way, red is often used, because this reminds the people of blood. the colors of this movie have a fakish look. this way, the viewer gets the impression that they watch a coloured-in black and white movie. this sequence is called neo-gothic, and in my opinion fits well with the story and the rest of the movie, wherein mainly darker colors are used which corresponds with the dark murder theme. although this is a pretty rad movie, sometimes scenes can get a bit too slow for our taste. this made us lose track of the story a bit, halfway through, and as a result we had to rewind some parts, to understand them. i have given this movie some thought and can conclude that the directors and producers made an excellent decision regarding the choosing of the actors starring this movie. morgan freeman is perfectly able to capture dramatic moments, making the viewers feel sympathy for the actor, and thus making them follow the story better. likewise we think brad pitt is well chosen too, because he is highly experienced with action and shooting scenes. furthermore, the storyline isn't as linear as one would expect from a crime thriller. on the one hand it's a straightforward murder mystery, but on the other hand there are loads of plot twists to make the movie more interesting and challenging to understand. we think it's a highly interesting movie. we would definitely recommend this movie, because it is an highly enjoyable and interesting story, and the way they made use of the different kinds of filming editing gives this story even more tension when needed.;10 June 2014;10;['mysterious', 'deadly', 'new', 'old', 'other', 'major', 'satisfying', 'good', 'bad', 'strong', 'right', 'dramatic', 'other', 'satisfied', 'big', 'important', 'recorded', 'fluent', 'pleasant', 'right', 'good', 'catchy', 'certain', 'such', 'different', 'certain', 'single', 'low', 'great', 'evil', 'dark', 'different', 'short', 'more', 'other', 'romantic', 'lovable', 'dramatic', 'painful', 'different', 'different', 'sure', 'long', 'energetic', 'active', 'short', 'fast', 'more', 'uncommon', 'popular', 'special', 'special', 'dark', 'dark', 'light', 'original', 'permanent', 'most', 'black', 'grey', 'primary', 'red', 'yellow', 'blue', 'fakish', 'black', 'white', 'gothic', 'dark', 'dark', 'slow', 'excellent', 'able', 'dramatic', 'experienced', 'linear', 'straightforward', 'other', 'interesting', 'challenging', 'interesting', 'enjoyable', 'interesting', 'different', 'more'];0.1602820880418283

1442;berggeit9;"se7en is a reflection of our everyday life, we live in a world filled with media & information technology which makes people often live beside each other instead of with each other, even though the serial killer is portrayed as the devil in this movie i can empathize with his feelings/opinion about seeing sins on every corner of the streets. the intellectual, patient personality that's sommerset & the young rebellious ""let's dance"" mills really contrast each other, creating interesting character development. we as the audience are confronted with biblical/religious statements throughout progress of the film concerning homocide cases, if sommerset had to choose a playing card then he'd retire as soon as possible, he's been doing detective work for way to long, but however he does get motivated by the unusual case of 7 sins that are about to unfold including all the plot twists & turns. se7en has been directed with unusual grimmy & dark look, during the film it's constantly raining, as if time never seems to change the mood is captured with great directorial vision, the dark & wet apartments that seem to be abandonded for ages, a combination of brown & black colors recreating a new kind of innovative film noir, consciously leading us to unique cinematographic history. sommerset comes to terms with our serial killer john doe & even though they might agree on certain points when it comes to the subject of everyday life, these 2 characters are worlds apart at the same time, in a sense that john doe murders his victims using the 7 deadly sins. pacing of this movie is nice but if you're expecting a big action movie, perhaps you're better of watching a vin diesel (xxx) movie. we're invited by the director to be intellectually stimulated, while the story develops we must think along, asking ourselves new questions about every single horror murder committed as we go. with that said the film is in my humble opinion highly recommended, especially if you're a fan of the acting skills of brad pitt & morgan freeman, it's got quality(not much though)action, dark mood, acting, story development, character development, mystery, among others. even though not for the faint hearted, since some scenes of the committed murders are visually shocking to say the least (adult rated), se7en is a great police drama by director david fincher. * * * * * * * * * 9 out 0f 10 stars !";2 July 2005;9;['everyday', 'other', 'other', 'serial', 'intellectual', 'patient', 'young', 'rebellious', 'other', 'interesting', 'biblical', 'religious', 'possible', 'unusual', 'about', 'unusual', 'dark', 'great', 'directorial', 'dark', 'wet', 'brown', 'black', 'new', 'innovative', 'unique', 'serial', 'certain', 'everyday', 'same', 'deadly', 'nice', 'big', 'well', 'new', 'single', 'humble', 'much', 'dark', 'faint', 'committed', 'shocking', 'least', 'great'];0.0405911796536796

1454;justlex1313;"the plot of this film revolves around the seven deadly sins and murder investigations over the period of seven days. the lead characters, detective mills (brad pitt) and detective somerset (morgan freeman), follow clues and do research into the seven deadly sins to catch a killer named john doe, (kevin spacey). the theme of this film is how the seven deadly sins relate to the actions we choose and why we choose to take them. many people would agree that murder is a sin but this film makes the viewer question if murder can be justified. each victim in the movie is guilty of one of the seven deadly sins and each victim is murdered in such a way that it reflects the sin they are guilty of. the film can make the viewer consider that maybe the victims did deserve to die. each victim is guilty of one of the seven deadly sins; gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath, lust, envy, and pride. throughout the movie each murder scene tells a story as to what sin the victim is guilty of. each murder scene also contains a clue that leads mills and somerset to the next murder scene. an interesting spin on the movie is that mills seems to become one of the seven deadly sins himself, when he seeks revenge for his wife, tracy's, (gwyneth paltrow) death. the viewer would typically have empathy for mills decision and think his actions could be justified. lighting, camera angles, sound effects, and raw emotion are successfully employed throughout the film, setting the mood for the enthralling theme. the lighting in some of the murder scenes is low and signifies suffering and death. there is a scene in the beginning of the film that silhouettes a detective who was talking to somerset. the detective makes the assumption that the victim was killed out of love by his wife. in this scene as he is walking away from somerset the lighting causes his body to become a silhouette. this is showing the detective's naivety and lack of paying attention to detail. there are several moments when the camera angle is low. one in particular is of mills and somerset standing in the rain, talking. this scene takes place shortly after mills and somerset meet and portrays somerset taking a ""you don't know how cruel this city really is"" approach toward mills. the music that plays in the background adds to the thrill of many scenes in this film. in the opening credits the song that plays is an uncredited remix by nine inch nails and it sets the foundation for the film. there is a scene when somerset makes a trip to the library to research the seven deadly sins. the night guard turns on music that seems soothing and peaceful. while this music is playing somerset is looking through books and murder scene photos giving the scene an ironic feel. raw emotion allows the viewer to relate to the characters. this raw emotion is present in the last scene of the film when mills realizes john doe murdered tracy. mills' tears and facial expressions signify the grief he is experiencing and the dilemma he is facing at that very moment. he is suffering an internal battle on whether or not he should kill john doe to avenge his wife's murder (wrath) instead of letting the justice system do its job. the characteristic of the overall theme to this film, wrath, can be related to the theme in kill bill volume 1 and volume 2 where the main character seeks revenge as well. this film has all of the necessary ingredients to bring the viewer into its ironic reality of religion and murder leading up to the final sin at the end, leaving the viewer completely satisfied.";18 June 2014;10;['deadly', 'lead', 'deadly', 'deadly', 'many', 'viewer', 'guilty', 'deadly', 'guilty', 'guilty', 'deadly', 'guilty', 'next', 'interesting', 'deadly', 'raw', 'enthralling', 'low', 'several', 'low', 'particular', 'cruel', 'many', 'uncredited', 'deadly', 'peaceful', 'ironic', 'raw', 'raw', 'present', 'last', 'facial', 'very', 'internal', 'overall', 'main', 'necessary', 'ironic', 'final', 'satisfied'];-0.0313439434129089

1458;scott-allin;this film is a total triumph for style over substance. characters that you don't care about get caught up in a fairly ludicrous set of circumstances and the ending is telegraphed from early on. the icing on the cake is when a potentially more interesting detective movie/police procedural is suddenly ruined by the confession of one of the minor characters in the film that he is the killer. his drawn out speeches about his reasons for committing the crimes come across as unnatural and forced and the whole movie descends into farce with the courier company (nice product placement) delivery of the severed head of a character so underwritten that her input to the scene remains the same as when her head was still attached. why so many people like this superficially dark but ultimately very mainstream thriller is beyond me. sure, morgan freeman delivers another solid performance and spacey is good even if his performance (much like jack nicholson's turn as the joker in batman) belongs in a different movie to the drab, underplayed, naturalistic tone that all the other actors seem to be opting for. pitt is guilty of phoning in his performance to a large extent and paltrow wrestles manfully with a sketchy part but can't make any serious impression. a puff piece.;28 June 2006;2;['total', 'ludicrous', 'interesting', 'minor', 'unnatural', 'whole', 'nice', 'underwritten', 'same', 'many', 'dark', 'mainstream', 'solid', 'good', 'different', 'underplayed', 'naturalistic', 'other', 'guilty', 'large', 'sketchy', 'serious'];0.1222470238095238
1459;StarkedInMovies;"david fincher's ""se7en"" is one such movie that blurs the line between a giallo horror and a psychological thriller. ""se7en"" sets a mood which is chilling, dark and puzzling. a mood that is present all through the entire movie. the mood set is the excellent work of director david fincher, who wanted to give dark and gloomy atmosphere to the movie just to expose a world which is rough, bleak and gritty. the effect it makes is astounding and is does so by good camera work and lighting, or the lack of it. the cameras used in this film was specially changed film stock to make the visuals look as dark as possible which is complemented well by howard shores music score. the ominous music that is added keeps the audience uncomfortable, in a good way. if it wasn't for disturbing message that ""se7en"" puts across, and astonishing dark scenes, i would have not given the rating i gave. the assignment of roles in the movie is excellent, even though i loathed brad pitt's character. brad pitt's character was at times annoying and glorified. all he did was slow down the overall investigation process. his weak presence makes it seem that he was never the lead or the assistant detective in the investigations of the crime. all he said was excessive swear words and not something tangible and due to this reason, his interaction with morgan freeman's character was frail. at times i felt morgan freeman's character would have done a better job leading the investigation alone. the conversation in the police car was really insubstantial. i would have really despised this movie it wasn't for the phenomenal acting by 'actor who played the killer'. it would've been so much better if brad pitt's character wasn't such a weak character and if he just stop talking at times and listened to the astute morgan freeman's character. whilst watching the movie i wholeheartedly wanted to despise on brad pitt's character and to an extent brad pitt himself but having watched and loved brad pitt in david fincher's fight club i often found myself forcibly liking brad pitt's character and justifying his decisions and his exchange of ideas but i failed. morgan freeman's was excellent in the role of a veteran detective and a wise mentor for brad pitt's character **spoiler** the biggest sin in this movie is perhaps not the character but the ending. i found the ending awfully predictable. i could have seen that one of our main characters would eventually be one of the 'victims'. especially after getting to see the 'wife' and she revealing something crucial at a buildup stage just screamed that she was going to die. the buildup was for nothing if it wasn't for the predictable ending. i had a tiny hope for something magnificent and grimy, since the killer's talk about the sins and how his killings were justified but the killer too just disappointed me in the end. also it made me dislike brad pitt's character that much more, because i was hoping he wouldn't shoot the killer, and that i might get a reason to respect him as a character. i don't care how if a certain movie has a happy or a sad ending, but this movie would've ended on a strong note if he hadn't killed the killer. the director could have found another way of exhibiting the last sin. morgan freeman's character could have and should have done something more in preventing the last 'execution'. after all he is the one who saw clearly what the killer's grand plan was. the ending scene was one big anticlimax and thus this movie could have been my second favorite david fincher movie following fight club if not my second favorite movies of all time. 8/10. note: i used 'actor who played the killer' instead of revealing the actor's name is because david fincher wanted the killer's identity to be a surprise and i shall oblige.";26 December 2015;8;['such', 'psychological', 'chilling', 'dark', 'puzzling', 'present', 'entire', 'excellent', 'dark', 'gloomy', 'rough', 'bleak', 'gritty', 'astounding', 'good', 'dark', 'possible', 'ominous', 'uncomfortable', 'good', 'dark', 'excellent', 'annoying', 'slow', 'overall', 'weak', 'assistant', 'excessive', 'swear', 'tangible', 'frail', 'well', 'insubstantial', 'phenomenal', 'well', 'weak', 'brad', 'excellent', 'veteran', 'wise', 'big', 'predictable', 'main', 'crucial', 'predictable', 'tiny', 'magnificent', 'grimy', 'more', 'certain', 'happy', 'sad', 'strong', 'last', 'more', 'last', 'grand', 'big', 'second', 'favorite', 'second', 'favorite'];0.1122857142857142

1490;emilyjo-10549;"ladies and gentleman, kevin spacey does it again. 1995 must have been quite his year with the release of usual suspects and sev7en just months apart. not only does spacey captivate his audience in both films with stellar performances (winning an academy award for best supporting role in usual suspects and the mtv movie award for best villain in sev7en) but his characters starkly contrast themselves with their ""end game"" motivations. david fincher creates a masterpiece with sev7en. not only does he manage to captivate his audience, keeping them in the dark, on the hunt, with detective somerset (morgan freeman), but he manages to simultaneously repulse them with disturbing gore that they can't quite look away from. his scenes are dark, often limited to the use of a detectives' flashlight, reinforcing the feeling of powerlessness within the viewer. the audience only gets to see what the detectives reveal, and like the detectives, we are never given the full picture. detective miller (brad pitt) serves as the foil for detective somerset. throughout the film miller proves to be a hard character to understand. on one hand the audience dislikes him because of his abrasiveness and rudeness to detective somerset (the obvious protagonist). on the other hand, the audience favors miller because of his role in serving justice (solving the case) and because of the man he is in his own home (playing with dogs, snuggling with his wife, etc.). initially, the relationship between somerset and miller feels like a classic good vs. evil separation. somerset embodies the notable qualities of wisdom, practicality, and patience while miller is confrontational, rude, and power-hungry. yet the two come together to work on the case, to serve as a greater good against the evil of the unknown murderer. fincher plays with the audience's emotions by prompting them to root for a character that isn't exactly favorable by playing on the larger feeling of disgust with the evil nature of the crimes. overall the film is a classic. its something i am glad i watched and would consider watching again. it's a timeless film that managed to hold my attention and surprise me despite being dated 20 years. i give it two thumbs up.";20 September 2016;8;['usual', 'stellar', 'good', 'usual', 'good', 'dark', 'full', 'hard', 'obvious', 'other', 'own', 'classic', 'evil', 'notable', 'confrontational', 'rude', 'hungry', 'great', 'unknown', 'favorable', 'large', 'evil', 'glad', 'timeless'];0.0657142857142857
1491;caitlinmalone;"david fincher reveals a masterpiece of a movie in his film seven. the movie follows the process of two detectives, somerset (morgan freeman) and mills (brad pitt) as they attempt to track down a serial killer (kevin spacey) who is choosing his methods and victims based off of the seven deadly sins. the film is high quality for two main reasons: its complex characters and its moral commentary. the most intriguing character is easily john doe, the killer. rather than creating a stereotypical mindless killer, fincher makes doe a serious, soft-spoken man, whose power comes from his brain rather than his brawn. doe is extremely logical and methodical in his approaches, as his killings require intense planning. his character poses as a striking contrast to mills. although he is the ""good guy""-the cop, the detective, the one trying to stop a killer- mills is not likable. unlike doe, he raves and constantly shows frustration, and often reverts to physical violence to try to accomplish his mission. although the watcher probably will still root for mills, when doe speaks, they will be more apt to listen. somerset serves as the voice of reason, reeling in mills when necessary and respecting doe's genius as he tries to catch him. these characters, especially john doe, perfectly display the film's social commentary on the seven deadly sins within our culture. more importantly, they raise the moral question of what is evil, and what is good. there is a clear clash between good and evil within the film, but the reason it is so successful is that it makes the audience ask themselves questions. are evil people able to be victims? is society harming the killer or did the killer harm society? what is a just price to pay for evil doings? therefore, i highly recommend seven to anyone who is not too squeamish and who enjoys a perplexing film that will leave you thinking. i enthusiastically endorse this film with an ""a"".";21 September 2016;8;['serial', 'deadly', 'high', 'main', 'complex', 'moral', 'intriguing', 'stereotypical', 'mindless', 'serious', 'soft', 'spoken', 'logical', 'methodical', 'intense', 'striking', 'good', 'likable', 'physical', 'apt', 'necessary', 'social', 'deadly', 'moral', 'evil', 'good', 'clear', 'good', 'successful', 'evil', 'able', 'just', 'evil', 'squeamish', 'perplexing'];0.071358024691358
1492;heatsilver;"rarely does a thriller murder film draw in the audience from start to end without presenting predictable foreshadowing. from the opening credits leaving out kevin spacey's name to the consistent ""one step behind the killer"" storyline, se7en accomplishes a dramatic theme of leaving the audience in a dynamic naive state through the eyes of mills and somerset. although the acting was emotionally and physically precise, it was the cinematography and lighting that generated the dreary setting and interactions throughout the film, often evoking the appropriately timed tension and emotion. presented beyond the surface, however, se7en calls upon a society accusation through the thread of dante's ""seven deadly sins."" se7en indirectly advocates that society, as a whole, is migrating towards an inevitable abyss filled with specialization in many of these deadly sins. even though humans may be ignorant to this path, it continues to occur all around us until we become dragged into it, just like mills in the ending. the only individual within se7en that posed a dichotomous relation was somerset; as he continued to logically view the world in awe of the irrevocability. somerset and doe both saw the world in this 3rd person perspective, but their actions represented their individual commitment to the change of society. doe was willing to take action in an upsetting demonstration, but somerset continually wanted to escape the world in a hopeless fashion. therefore, se7en displays multiple protagonists and antagonists throughout the movie. on the surface, mills and somerset are the protagonists trying to stop the killer, john doe, who is the antagonist. indirectly being argued, however, is that doe and somerset are the protagonists with opposing plans towards the change in societal nature (being represented as the antagonist through the seven deadly sins characters including mills). that is why i give se7en a 10/10 for its ability to draw in the audience through cinematography, lighting, plot, and controversial character dynamic throughout the entire film.";21 September 2016;10;['predictable', 'consistent', 'dramatic', 'dynamic', 'naive', 'precise', 'dreary', 'deadly', 'inevitable', 'many', 'deadly', 'ignorant', 'only', 'dichotomous', 'individual', 'willing', 'upsetting', 'hopeless', 'multiple', 'societal', 'deadly', 'controversial', 'dynamic', 'entire'];0.0510416666666666

1507;mjones-17407;"a major issue with watching lots of horror and dark mystery films is that disturbing imagery tends to lose its effect on you. all the blood and gore just stops being disturbing because you've learned how to look at it and see nothing more than cgi or some cheesy effects. what's amazing about se7en though is its ability to get around that. this movie is disturbing. it's hard to go into detail without spoiling the plot, but what i can say is that is shows just enough of the antagonist's murders that you're able to understand the horror of each death. and while what you see is uncomfortable and disgusting, it's nothing compared to what you don't see. the parts of the corpses the movie either jumps-cuts around, or just flat out doesn't show, are the most brutal sections. and since you never see them in great detail, all you're left with is whatever your mind creates to fill in the blanks. the grizzly murders aren't what make the movie though, as acting is a big part of it too. brad pitt and morgan freeman make for an amazing pair, pulling off their contrasting character brilliantly. while the ""genius detective who wants to leave the force"" and the ""guided by his emotions"" characters aren't anything new, they're pulled off so well you'll fall in love with them both very quickly. and then we have the plot of the film. the story follows detective mills and somerset as they track down a killer who is replicating the seven deadly sins through their murders. while most of the run time is the characters talking about how horrific the case is, shouting about how they'll catch the killer, or standing in the rain; the grizzly atmosphere of the mystery is portrayed perfectly in each scene. it never once feels like the movie diverted away from the intriguing plot line, even in the scenes that have nothing to do with the case are overshadowed by the brutal killings. and of course we have the famous final scene. i won't go into any detail, but the end of the film is a jaw dropping experience, and creates a memorable end to the story. one big criticism i do have with the film is there are quite a bit of plot holes throughout. thinking about the killer's plan for more than a few seconds will lead to many questions about it that don't seem to make sense. but in the end, the genius directing and acting make up for these faults. truly an amazing experience.";7 March 2019;10;['major', 'dark', 'more', 'amazing', 'hard', 'able', 'uncomfortable', 'disgusting', 'flat', 'brutal', 'great', 'grizzly', 'big', 'amazing', 'new', 'deadly', 'most', 'horrific', 'grizzly', 'intriguing', 'brutal', 'famous', 'final', 'jaw', 'memorable', 'big', 'more', 'few', 'many', 'amazing'];0.0646998834498834
