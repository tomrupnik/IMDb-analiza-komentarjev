0;TheLittleSongbird;some of schindler's list is very disturbing indeed, with very graphic images on the screen. i thought this film is outstanding. true, it is very long, but the holocaust was a very long and epic event, and the movie needed a long length to convey the harsh realities of the nazi's treatment of the jews. the cinematography was truly excellent, and some of the close ups of people being tortured or dying was enough to make you look away. the direction was taut and focused, most spielburg's movies are good, but don't quite always have an impact on the whole audience. schindler's list is visually disturbing and incredibly moving, and because of this, this is definitely spielburg's best. the acting was phenomenal. both liam neeson and ben kingsley give superb performances, and ralph fiennes is also very chilling in his role. the music by john williams is not only haunting, but also unbearably sad, believe me i was in tears for a lot of this movie. all in all, a truly moving film, that deserves a 10/10. bethany cox.;4 June 2009;10;['disturbing', 'graphic', 'outstanding', 'true', 'long', 'long', 'epic', 'long', 'harsh', 'excellent', 'close', 'enough', 'most', 'good', 'whole', 'disturbing', 'moving', 'good', 'phenomenal', 'ralph', 'chilling', 'sad'];0.1157894736842105
1;bkoganbing;it would not have been possible to have made schindler's list immediately after world war ii. the public was just taking in the magnitude of the holocaust, they might not have believed it. fortunately for the prosecutors at nuremberg and for history the nazis being the anal retentives that they were, made these incredibly meticulous records which scholars and historians have sifted through and we have the whole thing incredibly documented by the perpetrator's own hand. with a fifty year perspective now and the very existence of the state of israel questioned by those who ought to know better, steven spielberg has given us a work for the ages. if you can sit through two incredibly long and sorrowful films one ought to see schindler's list back to back with the diary of anne frank. in the latter film, we see a very ordinary group of people fighting for survival to escape the fate of what we see happened to so many. the fact they were days from possible liberation makes the sorrow of that film all the more poignant. schindler's list is a story of escape from the ultimate fate of six million. oskar schindler played by liam neeson is a german businessman who sees a chance at some nice war profits using some incredibly cheap labor from the concentration camps. he's willing to start a factory in occupied poland with slave labor jews. towards that end he hears of a man who ran a factory among the jews in the newly formed cracow ghetto, itzak stern played by ben kingsley. kingsley agrees to work for him and with him recruiting the labor force, neeson gets his factory going. with that comes responsibility for these people. he fights for them, the original ones and some added to his growing work force. over the over 3 hour film, neeson gradually changes and his concern for his charges becomes humanitarian. he plays a dangerous game, especially with concentration camp commandant ralph fiennes. a man who delights in the total power he's been handed and the liberation from all civilized restraints to exercise barbarism, arbitrary and capricious. fiennes will chill you with his penultimate portrayal of a perfect nazi. let us not forget that schindler himself was a nazi. he did in fact in the end go broke in paying out bribes for special consideration for his charges that meant their very lives. it's also possible that he saw the way the war would end and that those responsible for the holocaust would be held accountable. some have speculated that he did this for no other reason than to bank credit with possible witnesses. if that was the case it certainly worked because he was investigated and not charged with any war crimes. still i'd prefer to believe the testimony of those on the scene including the real life itzak stern. those are the folks that ought to know. schindler's list was nominated for 12 academy awards and won seven including best picture and best director for steven spielberg. liam neeson and ralph fiennes were nominated for best actor and best supporting actor. it deserved every honor it got and i only wish neeson and fiennes were winners as well. it's a film about the holocaust, but it's also a film about the results of dehumanization of a people and when the state completes the process of dehumanization what can be the result. i'm not sure what future work steven spielberg has planned, but he can't top this no way, no how.;16 November 2008;10;['possible', 'anal', 'meticulous', 'whole', 'own', 'very', 'long', 'sorrowful', 'latter', 'ordinary', 'many', 'possible', 'poignant', 'ultimate', 'liam', 'german', 'nice', 'cheap', 'willing', 'original', 'neeson', 'humanitarian', 'dangerous', 'ralph', 'total', 'civilized', 'arbitrary', 'capricious', 'penultimate', 'perfect', 'broke', 'special', 'very', 'possible', 'responsible', 'accountable', 'other', 'possible', 'real', 'good', 'good', 'ralph', 'good', 'good', 'sure', 'future'];0.2368433179723502
2;Leofwine_draca;schindler's list is perhaps one of the ultimate anti-war movies in existence. directed by steven spielberg in a naturalistic, unfussy style, it's a harsh, black and white epic that looks at the extermination of the jews at the hands of the nazis. some humanity is brought to the fold by an excellent liam neeson who plays oskar schindler, a businessman who somehow found himself involved in the situation and who did the right thing. like many spielberg films, this is shamelessly sentimental, but then it can hope to be nothing else given the subject matter. the stirring music combines with the expert direction to make this an effortless watch, complemented by ralph fiennes whose role is the personification of evil.;16 May 2017;8;['ultimate', 'anti', 'war', 'naturalistic', 'unfussy', 'harsh', 'black', 'white', 'excellent', 'liam', 'involved', 'right', 'many', 'sentimental', 'subject', 'expert', 'ralph'];0.1402380952380952
3;SnoopyStyle;oskar schindler (liam neeson) is a social climbing opportunistic womanizing german businessman. he charms important nazis, and gets access to limitless jewish labor. he gets itzhak stern (ben kingsley) as his right hand man, and jewish money to pay for his business. he provides the front. using black market deals and advantageous connections, he becomes rich and powerful. stern works tirelessly to save people. even as the jews are rounded up to plaszow labor camp under the command of unstable amon goeth (ralph fiennes), schindler is able to befriend the mad commander. this is probably the most important movie of director steven spielberg's career. at least it's the most important for him. based on the true story, spielberg uses all his movie making skills to create this iconic movie. the black and white provides starkness and thankfully a little bit of distance from the horrible events. liam neeson and ben kingsley are the perfect duo. ralph fiennes gives a complex performance as the mad commander. the shock of the horrors of the holocaust is expertly done. when i first saw it in the theater, i couldn't help sob a little when schindler breaks down at the end.;23 March 2014;10;['social', 'opportunistic', 'womanizing', 'german', 'important', 'limitless', 'jewish', 'right', 'jewish', 'black', 'advantageous', 'rich', 'powerful', 'stern', 'unstable', 'ralph', 'able', 'mad', 'important', 'least', 'important', 'true', 'iconic', 'black', 'white', 'little', 'horrible', 'perfect', 'ralph', 'complex', 'mad', 'little'];0.0410714285714285
4;Hitchcoc;we need to look at a work of art like this to see ourselves in this movie. this is the result of a regime that no longer saw the worth of the human being. it politicize life. this leads to monstrous treatment of people (because they are not people in their eyes). i saw this film the first week it came out. we were on vacation on hilton head island in south carolina. i remember my wife and i not being able to talk for almost 15 minutes after it was over and then we needed to talk about something else. there are few experiences that can do that to someone. since that time, i've had many others tell me the same thing. why is this movie so much more effective than other holocaust films. first of all, there's something personal about it. we get to know the people, even the bad guys. secondly, the recreation of the death camps is so accurate. then there is a spot of genius, the little girl in the red coat. if anyone wants to complain about black and white, watch this film. we get to see what can be done with shades and shadows. the work of schindler is the work of the heart against great odds. the scene at the end when the holocaust survivors visit the graveyard, is what moves the film. i think that everyone should see this film at some time. then sit down and think about what is being done to people here in our own country.;28 March 2006;10;['human', 'monstrous', 'first', 'able', 'few', 'many', 'same', 'effective', 'other', 'personal', 'bad', 'accurate', 'little', 'red', 'black', 'white', 'great', 'own'];0.133578431372549
5;Horst_In_Translation;"""schindler's list"" is an american mostly english-language movie from 1993 that won best picture that year and took home another six oscars including one for director steven spielberg, for whom it is probably still his career-defining work and with everything that he has under his belt like jaws, indiana jones and much more, this means quite something. this film we have here runs for over 3 hours and i was lucky enough today to catch it on the big theater screen on the occasion of a very special day here in germany. and what can i say. it was a feast. if that is an appropriate term given the heavy subject. i already wrote in the title of my review that this is of course a movie about the holocaust. and it does not even try to hide the horrible deeds done by the perpetrators back then. which means you have several occasions where you see people being shot in the head from the nearest distance and killed in cold blood for what their religion is. but it is also an uplifting movie as the man in the middle of it is oskar schindler, a manufacturer who saved more than a thousand jewish lives during these perhaps darkest days in german (global) history. he is played by liam neeson and this is also his career-defining performance today without a doubt. ralph fiennes was around the age of 30 when he played the main antagonist here, amon goth, and ben kingsley, already an oscar winner back then, is also on board and he looks so different compared to how he looks today, almost older you could say. by the way i did not know this film was based on a book in fact. it's really been a long long time since first time i saw it. but it is as good 25 years after its release as it was back then when i watched it for the first time. i must say i was not too touched throughout the movie as i hoped i could be and as i know many others were, but the last 20 minutes or so are heart-breaking stuff. i am talking about the moment when schindler starts talking to his ""employees"", the guards i mean with that, as well as the jews when he says he will be the hunted from now on. and then there is this powerful march with the haunting music at the very end before the film switches into the now, well into the early 1990s you must say, and we see the survivors, the schindler jews, and their offspring too and this idea of how schindler did not only save these men, but saved entire generations and future children is so incredibly touching that there is no way your eyes won't get wet. i think my entire cinema could have finished drought in africa when the closing credits rolled in. and lets not forget john williams' beautiful beautiful soundtrack / main theme that is among the saddest tunes you will ever hear during a film and i know now already it is one that will never leave my head and ears. it was probably before watching this film the one thing that i have come across many times over the last years/decade and which i remembered better than anything else from this film. i was also glad to see parents with their children in the audience today, kids that were not even close to being born in 1993, so the film's message is carried on to the next generation. well, what can i say. the holocaust subject here in germany is one that is very dominant today also in modern culture and there are constantly new exhibitions about this topic and also many new films still being made. and not just in germany obviously. but i am pretty sure that none of these will ever reach the icon status of schindler's list. other really touching moments for me included the moment kingsley calls the list something like ""ultimate goodness"", when we see earlier on the shoes and jewellery taken from jews before their journey into destruction, the dead girl in the red dress etc. the latter is one you could talk about for ages and write an entire review about in my opinion. what is her significance? well.. i would say this only use of color before the jump forward in time near the end is intended to emphasize that there is an individual human being behind every face and even if they don't stand out thanks to shining garments, we still should not forget that. be it the one-armed men, the woman who knew so much about construction or everybody resting down there below goth's balcony. they all have their stories and their loved ones and they all should not have died. it is very difficult in the presence of these sheer numbers of jews being killed back then, but we shall not forget every one of them deserved to live. and every one of them has their own story. if we lose our empathy and become numb to what happened, then all is lost. and it is merely numbers that mean nothing to us. okay, i mentioned goth already. fiennes was nominated for an oscar for that portrayal and many today say he should have won instead of tommy lee jones, but not having seen the latter's movie, i will not discuss that in detail. but i think it is a surprising loss, even with tlj having the momentum given how much they loved schindler's list. like with the scene i mentioned some lines above, i also think that goth could have deserved his own review. it is so difficult to say what this character is and what he is not. there is no 100% description, it is all about the shades. very fitting the house keeper's description that you never knew what would happen next with him and how you could calm him down. is he an opportunist? a sadist? a psychopath? a racist? probably yes to all that, but then there are these moments when deep down inside him he has affections for the jewish housekeeper before reality bites and he starts attacking her violently. the scene when he tells schindler that he wants to take her with him is telling enough, only to say he should shoot her in the head in the nearest forest. maybe this is the closest he can get to love? tough to say. the relationship between goth and schindler is also interesting. i do think he looks up to schindler for his success with women, his whole aura, his talent to entertain and he wants to be like him instead of being an alcoholic and gambling addict. not many would have gotten away with the hose scene really, but schindler does with the high-profile nazis trying desperately to convince themselves that he is just torturing the jews in the wagons. of course he is not and they know. but they do not have the will and charisma to oppose him. the very first scene at the table when schindler invites the nazis over is already very telling, who is the man in charge. but he needs them too. without being an nsdap member, there is no chance for him to thrive and save a single life. and finally, lets look at the character transformations. some brief words on goth first who believes he is some high-appointed ruler about who lives and who dies thanks to schindler's influence. there is no real goodness in the former. it is all make-believe and when he realizes he shoots the boy in cold blood. but about schindler, there is a lot more to say, also when it comes to his wife and of course his heartfelt final speech about how he could have saved more. at some point, it was never about prestige, about reputation or about business anymore. let alone about money. he gives it all away for his fake factory. this is when he turns into the good human being, which also has a lot to do with stern's influence for sure. so yeah, this is a really long movie, but oh so rewarding and also for me a definite contender for best film of 1993. don't give up on it if greatness is not achieved on all occasions early on. what is waiting for you is absolutely worth it. of course, due to the cruel imagery, this is not a film for the very young ones, but even if it is extremely serious and will break your heart on more than one occasion, there are also really many moments, surprisingly more than i expected where this film will make you smile. these include basically all schindler's exchanges and interactions with women, be it the ones sitting on his desk typing or the ones who want to see him or all the other ones attracted to him and the other way around. or one other scene that stays in the mind very much for me is when he is looking for stern at the train station and how these resilient nazi guards help him quickly after being worried about their own future and having fear of being sent to russia. so yeah, there is probably at least a dozen scenes more that stay in the mind and that i could write a whole chapter about and you will recognize these scenes when you watch them or maybe you will think of completely different scenes than the ones i mean, but that is perfectly fine though. i will spare you all that. but i will not spare you the words that this is an absolute must-see from the historic and emotional perspective and unless you really really hate holocaust movies for whatever reason, you should watch this one. actually, even if you do, you should watch it because this is the one film that can change your mind. go for it if you really haven't seen it so far and with that i am of course speaking in particular to the younger readers. there's a reason this is so high on the imdb top250. and rightfully so. if you are lucky enough like myself to get into a big screen showing, then do not miss out under any circumstances. a gigantic thumbs-up from me for schindler's list.";27 January 2019;8;['american', 'english', 'good', 'more', 'lucky', 'big', 'special', 'appropriate', 'heavy', 'horrible', 'several', 'near', 'cold', 'uplifting', 'more', 'jewish', 'dark', 'german', 'global', 'liam', 'ralph', 'main', 'different', 'old', 'long', 'long', 'first', 'good', 'first', 'many', 'last', 'hunted', 'powerful', 'very', 'early', 'entire', 'future', 'touching', 'wet', 'entire', 'beautiful', 'beautiful', 'main', 'sad', 'many', 'last', 'glad', 'close', 'next', 'dominant', 'modern', 'new', 'many', 'new', 'sure', 'other', 'ultimate', 'dead', 'red', 'latter', 'entire', 'only', 'individual', 'armed', 'difficult', 'sheer', 'own', 'numb', 'many', 'surprising', 'much', 'own', 'difficult', 'fitting', 'jewish', 'near', 'close', 'tough', 'interesting', 'whole', 'alcoholic', 'many', 'high', 'first', 'telling', 'nsdap', 'single', 'brief', 'real', 'former', 'cold', 'more', 'heartfelt', 'final', 'more', 'fake', 'good', 'human', 'sure', 'long', 'rewarding', 'definite', 'good', 'worth', 'cruel', 'young', 'serious', 'more', 'many', 'more', 'other', 'other', 'other', 'resilient', 'worried', 'own', 'least', 'whole', 'different', 'fine', 'absolute', 'historic', 'emotional', 'particular', 'young', 'high', 'lucky', 'big', 'gigantic'];0.1227394041553333
6;mark.waltz;"history has proved that the old saying, ""god makes mad first whom he intends to destroy"", and in the case of nazi ralph fiennes in this steven spielberg masterpiece, that is oh, so true. unfortunately, a lot of innocent people have to pay for that madness in the meanwhile, and that truly adds to the intensity of his madness as it increases and his vileness just gets more and more out of control. on the other end of the spectrum is liam neeson's oscar schindler, a businessman who knows by allowing the nazis to take his jewish workers away, his productivity will suffer. selfish motives keep these innocent people from being sent to the death camps, and as schindler learns the truth about the atrocities going on and becomes closer to the people who work very hard for him, he goes out of his way to keep the nazis from going through with their evil plans. the atrocities you see here are things we can't fathom here in america. innocent children are forced to hide in human waste to avoid discovery. an innocent woman prisoner with a background in architecture is brutally murdered after insisting that a building being constructed is doomed to collapse, after which the evil fiennes simply orders his men to do what she suggested. fiennes picks targets and guns them down, and also has schindler's aged workers killed simply because he considers them too old to contribute. an innocent young girl in a red coat (the only color in this black and white movie) wanders around warsaw as the ghetto is destroyed. neeson almost looses his right-hand man (a magnificent ben kingsley) because of a paperwork mix-up. this culminates in the most daring of escapes from nazi persecution, and that is where neeson realizes the full effect of what's going on, breaking down in a scene that will have you shivering in your seat. i can't watch these movies without the temptation to scream at the nazis on screen. even in the most outlandish propaganda films of the war era, i tended to either applaud loudly or scream in delight ""die, nazi, die!"" as the villain gets their come-uppance, either through brutal murder or the firing squad after a lengthy trial revealed their shame. many of those times, my body was shaking so violently as sobs emerged from me that i was unaware i was capable of. you can't call these feelings manipulation by the direction; spielberg obviously felt a passion for the story he was telling, as if he knows that this can cross over into any race, any culture, any religion. rarely in recent movie history has it been so obvious when a film was released that it would sweep the academy awards, and ""schindler's list"" truly deserved every honor which it received. some stories are so painful that you can't go back and watch them easily; i find that every so often, i need a movie like ""schindler's list"" to remind me of how vile humanity can be, and how one compassionate human being can change the course of history for so many. the finale with real-life ""schindler jews"" honoring their hero is truly awe inspiring and is certainly what you can call triumph over tragedy.";29 August 2014;10;['old', 'mad', 'true', 'innocent', 'more', 'other', 'oscar', 'jewish', 'selfish', 'innocent', 'close', 'evil', 'innocent', 'human', 'innocent', 'evil', 'aged', 'old', 'innocent', 'young', 'red', 'only', 'black', 'white', 'neeson', 'right', 'magnificent', 'full', 'outlandish', 'brutal', 'lengthy', 'many', 'unaware', 'capable', 'recent', 'obvious', 'painful', 'vile', 'compassionate', 'many', 'real'];0.0468837535014005

(we hear hardly anything of the progress of the war.) and it's at this level that the film excels, due to the mature script and the performances of liam neeson, ben kingsley and ralph feinnes. there are many other characters, including embeth davidtz. the film is good because neason's character begins not as a racist or a humanitarian but as a moral nihilist. he cares about nothing but money and the sensory pleasures it affords. he couldn't care less about the jews, or about the nazis either for that matter. the war to him is just a way of making a profit using cheap labor. and the script rises above the formulaic in not giving him a moment of epiphany. at no point does his brow furrow, his eyes light up, and he thinks to himself, ""my god, what am i doing?"" nope. instead, his development is informed by minor but important insights distributed here and there. after the surrender, he leaves the camp as a fugitive, dressed in prison clothes, mourning his carelessness in not saving more lives. spielberg tells the story in a straightforward way but of course some incidents and dialog from events of fifty years ago must be fabricated. and the fabrications are well done. especially enjoyable is the touchy, sometimes abrasive, and often humorous relationship between neason, the salesman and con man who simply has no head for business, and ben kingsley as the matter-of-fact accountant who does. i'd give examples of some exchanges but there isn't space. spielberg hasn't quite gotten over his taste for easy sentimentality. there are only two touches of color in this black-and-white movie. a little girl in a rose-colored coat appears two or three times, so that we can know who it is when her body is wheeled past in a barrow, just another victim. and when the workers hold a ceremony on shabat, the candle flames are touched with a warm orange that signifies life. effective, yes, but unnecessary in an adult film like this. most people watching the film may be trusted to know what's going on without being nudged. but that's small stuff. somewhat more embarrassing is a scene in which a german officer screams like a maniac and makes gargoyle faces at the camera after emptying his pistol into a mountain of burning bodies. are we supposed to learn from this that the people running the camps were evil? the nazi's extermination program prompted many studies in social science, none of which has contributed much to our understanding of why this, and similar programs, seem to be so common around the world. it's easy enough to blame germany and the ss, but what happened in kosovo, maylasia, cambodia, and rwanda? perhaps one of the reasons we've never really understood it is that we don't want to. perhaps the answer lies not in ""f"" (for ""facism"") scales or ideographic studies of power but in the darkest aspects of human nature itself. is there a group of people who have nothing in common but their ethnic identity that we ourselves would enjoy seeing wiped off the map? we all have massive cerebral cortices, much of the functions of which seem devoted to damping down impulses from structures lower down on the brain that generate desires to mate, to flee from danger, and to kill things and people that get in our way. some day science might give us an answer but until then we have to rely on poets like robert burns.

""schindler's list"" is honestly one of the movie powerful movies ever created. since almost everything in the movie is based on true events it makes it all even more powerful. it's hard to imaging that these horrible things all actually truly occurred. the movie is filled with graphic, confronting and humiliating images. it provides the movie with some unforgettable sequences that will leave a lasting impression on you. never has the holocaust been brought to the silver screen in such a detailed and confronting way. not everyone will be able to handle watching ""schindler's list"". it really is not a movie for the faint of heart. spielberg delivers with this movie his most important and perhaps also most personal and best movie. the storytelling of the movie is perfect and the way it focuses on the many characters of the movie is spot-on. it follows many different jewish characters who all had their different experiences. yes, the movie does become over-sentimental at times, especially toward the ending but in this case i forgive spielberg. it in no way makes the movie any less powerful or meaningful. the message of the movie comes trough very hard and direct. everyone should watch this movie, not only because it's such a good one but especially because it's a very important one. the movie is filmed in black & white. i think main reason for this was to make the movie look less graphic, since the main essence of the movie should not be on the graphic images but on the confronting and realistic emotions of history. it's not a movie that tries to shock, it's a movie that confronts in a very direct way instead. whatever the real true reason was for making the movie in black & white, it works really well for the movie its time period and atmosphere. the lighting of director of photography janusz kaminski is really phenomenal at times. also the dramatic musical score by john williams is impressive and makes some of the sequences work even extra powerful. also the acting is great in this movie. the jewish persons are mostly played by unknown and unexperienced actors. it makes them. in their roles, extra credible and believable. we see them as persons, not as actors playing persons. that's also another reason why the movie works powerful, the characters are all very real. not only the jews but also the nazi-germans. the movie launched the careers of both liam neeson and ralph fiennes. liam neeson is great as the main lead and ralph fiennes is truly chilling as the camp commander amon goeth. another fine impressive role is being played by ben kingsley. among the best movies of the 20th century but more important, it's a very important movie that reminds us of what happened- and should never happen again. 10/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/";19 February 2006;10;['powerful', 'powerful', 'possible', 'daring', 'powerful', 'true', 'more', 'more', 'good', 'possible', 'powerful', 'true', 'powerful', 'hard', 'horrible', 'graphic', 'humiliating', 'unforgettable', 'silver', 'detailed', 'able', 'important', 'personal', 'good', 'perfect', 'many', 'many', 'different', 'jewish', 'different', 'sentimental', 'powerful', 'meaningful', 'direct', 'good', 'important', 'black', 'white', 'main', 'graphic', 'main', 'graphic', 'realistic', 'direct', 'real', 'true', 'black', 'white', 'phenomenal', 'dramatic', 'musical', 'impressive', 'powerful', 'great', 'jewish', 'unknown', 'unexperienced', 'extra', 'credible', 'believable', 'powerful', 'real', 'liam', 'ralph', 'great', 'main', 'ralph', 'chilling', 'fine', 'impressive', 'good', 'important', 'important'];0.2584615384615384

26;AaronCapenBanner;steven spielberg won a well-deserved academy award(as did the film itself) for directing this emotionally shattering, dramatically devastating film about opportunistic businessman oskar schindler(liam neeson in a superb performance) who goes into business with the nazis, and amon goeth(ralph fiennes, unforgettable performance) the death camp commandant who supplies him with imprisoned jews for his factories. ben kingsly plays itzhak stern, his secretary who helps schindler have a moral awakening to the evils of the nazis, and who later spends his fortune aiding them, eventually shielding them from extermination, saving over 1100 lives. masterpiece is among the finest films ever made, so deeply moving and wrenchingly does it portray the death camps and what the jewish people had to endure(aided by the exquisite john williams score), and amon goeth personified evil as he indifferently shot the prisoners, or abused his maid. the ending to the film when schindler breaks down, and the jews are liberated is powerful enough for several films, but the coda at the end is so surprising, yet so fitting, that it remains the most emotionally moving ending ever. a stunning achievement for all concerned, especially mr. spielberg.;18 September 2013;10;['devastating', 'opportunistic', 'superb', 'unforgettable', 'moral', 'fine', 'jewish', 'powerful', 'several', 'surprising', 'fitting', 'stunning'];0.2924242424242424
27;Sylviastel;i have seen schindler's list once and it is more than enough. this film can be too painful to watch at times. even though my own family survived the war as polish catholics, they too still have scars to last more than a lifetime. my one problem with steven spielberg is that it's not graphic enough. the war was terrible and almost everybody in poland was scarred as well. schindler's list is a difficult film for adults to watch because it is graphic, brutal but all wars both graphic and brutal. oskar schindler wasn't so much hero or saint but he was a human being who did an incredible thing by saving thousands. there are others out there who did their part like raoul wallenberg. i have to say that if ,holocaust survivor and polish jew, roman polanski directed this story to film, it might have been more brutal and graphic or maybe there would be more of a connection. i felt that spielberg lacked that connection in this film.;15 April 2008;10;['more', 'enough', 'painful', 'own', 'polish', 'more', 'graphic', 'terrible', 'scarred', 'difficult', 'graphic', 'brutal', 'graphic', 'brutal', 'much', 'human', 'incredible', 'raoul', 'roman', 'brutal', 'graphic', 'more'];-0.1073529411764706

29;StevePulaski;"for a movie as monumental as schindler's list, i believe a review should be conducted in a different style. normally, my reviews consist of multiple paragraphs, summarizing the plot and my thoughts on the film. this time i want to give five reasons why schindler's list was easily one of the most powerful and breathtaking motion pictures i've ever seen. it goes above and beyond anyone's expectation, and cements itself on the list of greatest films of all time. here's why. 1. acting. no one could write about schindler's list and not talk about liam neeson's oscar worthy performance as oskar schindler, the business man from czechoslovakia. he plays it with power and full force, grade a acting. still shocked his leading performance didn't win him the oscar in 1994. 2. storyline. instead of focusing on one of the survivors, or a fictional story for that matter, spielberg chooses to focus on oskar schindler, a rather unsung chapter and character of the holocaust. oskar schindler worked for the nazis, and is famous for using his great wealth to buy hundreds of jews to make them work in his factory. it wasn't much, but it prevented death, and they would make bowls for the nazis. even though the film goes into a subject, some may not know, the storyline is definitely one of the strongest points. 3. the end sequence. i don't want to ruin the final scenes in the film, but let's just say, it's one of the most effective and well done scenes in film history. 4. the film's desire to ""show it all."" when holocaust movies are made, so try to water the film down by not showing the terrible treatment of innocent jews. this one doesn't. despite the event being gruesome, tasteless, and ignorant, no movie should subject itself to water down the scenes. unless it's pg-13, and i doubt many holocaust movies are. schindler's list isn't all about the gas chambers and things most of us already know. we witness two of the worst things possible; (1) innocent people taken out to the yard and being shot in the head with absolutely no feeling on the guard's part and (2) we see the heart-wrenching scenes of peoples belonging getting tossed off balconies like garbage. that part i almost couldn't bear to watch. 5. the complete carelessness for human life. face it, the jews and many other races were dehumanized come time of the holocaust. life didn't matter to anybody. you could tell a nazi officer that you just killed sixty thousand jews in one day and they wouldn't flinch, yell, smile, or object. they would say ""good work."" they wouldn't take into consideration you just killed sixty thousand mothers, father, brothers, sisters, grandparents, aunts, uncles, nephews, nieces, and worst of all, children of both sexes. one scene in the film, right before a woman is shot in the head, the camera zooms in on her to show her frightened reactions, her pale face, and her clearly nervous behavior. spielberg most likely did that to remind viewers that the victims in this movie were people and they were innocent people with their own feelings in life. dehumanization lived in the holocaust. schindler's list currently ranks number nine on the american film institute's (afi) list of one hundred greatest american films ever made. i am a firm believer that if this wasn't in spielberg's hands, it wouldn't touch that list. thankfully, we get one down to earth and very vibrant holocaust movies that manages to accomplish what it should. just an all around amazing film. starring: liam neeson, ben kingsley, ralph fiennes, caroline goodall, jonathan sagall, and embeth davidtz. directed by: steven spielberg.";4 June 2011;10;['monumental', 'different', 'multiple', 'powerful', 'breathtaking', 'great', 'oscar', 'worthy', 'full', 'fictional', 'unsung', 'famous', 'great', 'much', 'strong', 'final', 'effective', 'terrible', 'innocent', 'gruesome', 'tasteless', 'ignorant', 'many', 'most', 'bad', 'possible', 'innocent', 'complete', 'human', 'many', 'other', 'good', 'bad', 'frightened', 'pale', 'nervous', 'innocent', 'own', 'great', 'american', 'firm', 'vibrant', 'amazing', 'ralph', 'caroline'];0.1818981481481481

31;Red-Barracuda;"at the time of this film's release, while he was the undisputed commercial king of cinema, steven spielberg had never been considered a 'serious' film-maker. with the exception of the colour purple he was known as a director of big-budget b-pictures. many people criticized his films for being too syrupy and child-like. with the notable exceptions of duel and jaws this wasn't necessarily an unfair assessment. while his vision was unerringly on the pulse of the mainstream, it rarely had any edge whatsoever. so with the release of schindler's list, spielberg was able to offer something pretty bleak and hard-hitting. he was also rewarded at the academy awards, which was another thing he craved desperately. the book by thomas keneally from which the film was adapted is a masterful and deeply disturbing account of true events in nazi occupied poland. it takes a documentary approach to events, as it is all from real accounts. it was, therefore, the sort of novel that had to be treated with the utmost respect if it was to be translated to the screen with any success. it has to be said that spielberg was largely very successful in this challenge, and his film remains a powerful telling of this most harrowing, if ultimately uplifting, of tales. he wisely decided to film it in stark black and white which lends an immediate bleakness to proceedings and recalls old footage from the second world war. when he does decide to inject a bit of colour, as in the little girl in the red coat, it works in bringing out the appalling tragedy of this little girl's life even more it doesn't seem gimmicky. another major plus for the film is in the performances. liam neeson has the right blend of charisma and humanity as oskar schindler but best of all is ralph fiennes as the camp commandant amon goeth; he played this character with extreme skill and brought to the screen a strangely complex presence. i certainly wouldn't go as far as to say fiennes's goeth was sympathetic he was vile but his underlying impulses and insecurities had interesting depth to say the least. on the whole spielberg handles things very well here. his trademark schmaltz is thankfully absent, and he does not hold back when he needs to ramp things up and show atrocities. quite often schindler's list is very unpleasant, and the director wisely doesn't sugar-coat things. the only place where he breaks is in schindler's closing speech at the factory. this moment was melodramatic and totally unnecessary. the events depicted up to that point had been faithfully told from a historical point-of-view and they did not need that invented moment of emotional manipulation; what had gone before spoke for itself. this minor slip-up aside, schindler's list did prove that spielberg was capable to making serious films when he put his mind to it.";30 March 2011;9;['undisputed', 'commercial', 'serious', 'big', 'many', 'like', 'notable', 'unfair', 'able', 'bleak', 'masterful', 'true', 'real', 'utmost', 'successful', 'powerful', 'harrowing', 'uplifting', 'stark', 'white', 'immediate', 'old', 'second', 'little', 'red', 'appalling', 'little', 'gimmicky', 'major', 'right', 'good', 'ralph', 'extreme', 'complex', 'sympathetic', 'vile', 'interesting', 'least', 'whole', 'absent', 'unpleasant', 'only', 'melodramatic', 'unnecessary', 'historical', 'emotional', 'minor', 'capable', 'serious'];0.0392704517704517
32;OllieSuave-007;"this movie is difficult to watch as it, in detail, expresses the sheer horror and grisliness of the holocaust. from the forced relocation of the jews toward the ghettos to the terrors of auschwitz, the persecution of the jews is a centerpiece of this film and it will resonate in your mind long after this movie is over. this movie also centers around the life of oskar schindler, played brilliantly by liam neeson, as a money-hungry german businessman who employs jews to work in his factory, but ultimately grows concerned for the well-being of the jews as he witnesses their merciless persecution by the nazis. his mission in turning his factory into a salvation for the jews throughout wwii becomes a driving force for the plot and builds up the suspense and tension, making you eager to find out what the aftermath is by the film's end. ben kingsley gave a great performance of itzhak stern, the jew who ends up being schindler's trusted assistant and right-hand man, and ralph fiennes gave a haunting portrayal of the evil and sadistic amon goeth - an ultimate villain you would love to hate. and, all the supporting actors and extras who portrayed the jews gave a heartfelt performance; even as actors, you really sympathize with them as they gave such a realistic and heart wrenching portrayal. janusz kaminski did a good job on the cinematography, capturing the aura and tension of world war ii; john williams gave a stirring music score with a beautiful violin solo by izak perlman; and steven spielberg did a nice job directing a well-paced film. it's true that some people criticizes the accuracy and historical facts of the film and the overly intensiveness of the plot elements, but, it is no doubt an impactful film about the holocaust and the courageous deeds of a man who sought to save many. grade b+";8 September 2015;8;['difficult', 'sheer', 'hungry', 'german', 'concerned', 'eager', 'great', 'right', 'ralph', 'evil', 'sadistic', 'ultimate', 'heartfelt', 'realistic', 'good', 'beautiful', 'nice', 'true', 'historical', 'overly', 'impactful', 'courageous', 'many'];0.1834920634920634
33;sddavis63;"this movie must be the best piece of work dealing with the holocaust that i have ever seen. the only criticism i can find myself making of it is that it was a little bit confusing in the first hour or so, but even that was probably appropriate as the movie portrays a time of chaos anyway. the first thing that one notices is the decision to film the movie in black and white. that was a brilliant decision. somehow, it gives the story greater power. the brutality of the holocaust is obvious, the sadistic nature of the ss is portrayed brilliantly, both in depictions of actual events and by ralph fiennes in his portrayal of ss officer amon goeth, the confusion and uncertainty and desperation of the jews is palpable. everything is raw with power. i would have liked some greater explanation of the impact of the little girl who provides the only splashes of colour in the movie (she's dressed in red) on schindler. she's hardly the only child he sees suffer. why her in particular? ben kingsley's portrayal of itzhak stern, the jewish accountant recruited by schindler to run his business is appropriately low-key. here was a man who saw an opportunity to help his fellow jews through schindler's company and who quietly took advantage of it. which brings me to liam neeson's portrayal of schindler. he did a great job - completely believable as he portrays schindler's evolution from a businessman who just wanted to make money and who brought jews into his factory for no reason except that they were the cheapest labour available to a man determined to protect his jewish workers from the insanity and horror of auschwitz. the closing scene, as he breaks down crying out that he feels he should have saved more people, is one of the most powerful and moving scenes i have ever seen in a movie, especially as stern quietly comforts him and says ""no - you did so much"" and the other jews he saved rush up to embrace and comfort him. it was also moving to see the schindler jews honouring his grave at the end of the movie. schindler provides the inspiration here. yes, it's inspiring that he saved 1200 jews, but the inspiration goes beyond that. as the story makes clear, schindler was largely a failure at everything he did in life, both before and after the war. and yet, this man - who was (i hate to use the word, but it's pretty much true) a loser - managed to rise to what must have seemed an insurmountable challenge and accomplished something great of historic proportions. if a man like schindler could do this, surely others can do it too - not with respect to the holocaust anymore (thank god!) but with some of the other issues in the world today. this is truly a brilliant piece of work. 9/10";3 August 2009;9;['good', 'only', 'little', 'confusing', 'first', 'appropriate', 'first', 'black', 'white', 'brilliant', 'great', 'obvious', 'sadistic', 'actual', 'ralph', 'ss', 'palpable', 'raw', 'great', 'little', 'only', 'red', 'only', 'particular', 'jewish', 'low', 'fellow', 'great', 'believable', 'cheap', 'available', 'determined', 'jewish', 'more', 'powerful', 'stern', 'other', 'inspiring', 'clear', 'true', 'insurmountable', 'great', 'historic', 'other', 'brilliant'];0.226163967611336
34;ElMaruecan82;"introduction : steven spielberg always developed an interest for ww2 more than any other film-maker of his generation, mostly concerned by the vietnam war and its cultural impact. therefore, he revolutionized the industry of film-making, not the mentalities. he never made thought-provoking or introspective films like ""apocalypse now"" or ""taxi driver"". this attachment to the past, to childhood cemented spielberg's indisputable talent to entertain and touch hearts, genuinely or deliberately. spielberg had a traditional view on film-making, which consecrated him when the 80's saw the return of a more conventional style. in the early 90's, he was the most successful director capable of the best like ""duel"", ""jaws"" or ""the color purple"", movies where, ironically, his touch was less present, as much as the worst like ""hook"" which caricatured the spielberg traits to the extreme. when spielberg dilutes himself behind the camera, he can be incredible, when he indulged himself to express some sentimentality; it rarely worked after the 80's. that's why my favorite of his films, ""the color purple"" is the most misunderstood, why ""jurassic park"" will never surpass ""jaws"" and why ""saving private ryan"" is weak compared to the movie i'll review now : ""schindler's list"". schindler's list : the movie opens on a religious ceremony, the colors slowly fade, like a painful flash-back into an episode forever rooted in memories. and the black-and-white cinematography suggests the haunting presence of death in the minds of people whose only ""crime"" was to be jewish and the hearts of us, viewers, whose only ""excuse"" was to be born after that tragedy. and there starts a tragedy of epic proportions following different levels of grief. denial of evilness : when a one-armed old man is killed like an animal because he's useless for the third reich, i was caught by surprise. when kids were shot, i was shocked. and i have no words to describe the whole krakovia ghetto massacre sequence. the duality of horror as the most atrocious form of barbarity that contaminated civilized men ; how can a man who plays bach or mozart, exterminate a family with the same hand? or a beautiful gift allowing sick people 'to never hear the gunshots'. angry incomprehension : one of the most despicable movie characters ever, amon goeth, whose leisure consisted on killing jews in the most gratuitous way, doesn't even deserve to be called 'villain' as his evilness transcends any cinematic perception. the shooting of the engineer diana reiter is the part i couldn't get out of my mind, so unexpected, random and cold-blooded, the moment defines the torture endured by people in concentration camps, not just physical, but psychological, as any day could be the last one of your whole life, depending on the mood of an officer, or a defect in a gun. death acceptance : the absurd level of cruelty changes the very perception of death, and provides sometimes some sort of darkly comedic reliefs moments, like when a kid points his finger on the chicken thief who's 'coincidentally' the first man shot by amon goeth. ralph fiennes as the suave beast, who exercised his right to kill or spare like a roman emperor, perfectly captured the essence of evilness trapped in his own torments, probably loving his power more than hating the jews, as the exaltation of a kind of bestial superiority. devastating sadness : the word 'depression' would be an indecent understatement, some passages are absolutely devastating, thanks to a direction, guilty of perfection, and john williams' sober and emotional score. i understand this must have been painful for spielberg, a man who loves children, to shoot the part where kids hid in a toilet hole, where the little girl in red 'reappeared', not to mention the gut-wrenching climactic shower scene. my heart was hysterically screaming with these women who thought it was the end. light of hope : liam neeson plays oskar schindler as a man with a way with people and women in particular. however, his depiction is undermined by something betraying the ambitious nature of a war profiteer. this characterization proved to work for characters like rick blaine (there's something strangely bogart-esque in the way neeson holds his cigarette) but the subject here is too serious for glamorization. he's a businessman who thinks of interests, and progressively, his natural charisma will become providential. it's ironic how he, the german, and his jewish assistant, yitzhac stern, played by ben kingsley, handle as a business project what will be one of the most generous and humanistic acts ever. who saves one life, saves the humanity conclusion : whatever i said in this review concerning spielberg loses its relevance when it comes to ""schindler's list"", his greatest film because it's probably the only one where you can find both the personal touch, and something that speaks for humanity, to remember one of its most shameful pages. but the criticism starts again regarding the reception of ""schindler's list"". the film has been described with so many superlatives that i really question the sincerity of this immediate prestige and if it's not just proportional with the gravity of the subject. does ""schindler's list"" really deserve to be in the american film institute's top 10? is it really that iconic in american pop culture? i also read that ""schindler's list"" was voted the best film ever made by the german film magazine 'cinema', and it felt like the film was automatically praised as a way to make up for the guilt of having allowed these crimes to be committed. i hope i am wrong because i truly love ""schindler's list"", but i just don't like the simplistic and systematical way the movie is praised. but i sincerely hope the inspirational message of the film would inspire others about so many overlooked atrocities, just because some countries can't generate a film-maker with the same talent and influence as steven spielberg.";23 July 2011;10;['more', 'other', 'cultural', 'provoking', 'introspective', 'indisputable', 'traditional', 'conventional', 'early', 'successful', 'capable', 'good', 'color', 'present', 'bad', 'incredible', 'color', 'most', 'private', 'weak', 'religious', 'painful', 'black', 'white', 'only', 'jewish', 'only', 'epic', 'different', 'armed', 'old', 'useless', 'third', 'shocked', 'whole', 'atrocious', 'civilized', 'same', 'beautiful', 'sick', 'angry', 'despicable', 'gratuitous', 'cinematic', 'unexpected', 'random', 'cold', 'blooded', 'physical', 'psychological', 'last', 'whole', 'absurd', 'very', 'darkly', 'comedic', 'first', 'ralph', 'roman', 'own', 'bestial', 'devastating', 'guilty', 'sober', 'emotional', 'painful', 'little', 'red', 'climactic', 'liam', 'particular', 'ambitious', 'bogart', 'serious', 'natural', 'providential', 'ironic', 'german', 'jewish', 'generous', 'humanistic', 'great', 'only', 'personal', 'shameful', 'many', 'immediate', 'proportional', 'top', 'iconic', 'american', 'good', 'german', 'wrong', 'simplistic', 'systematical', 'inspirational', 'many', 'same'];0.0003555764411027

48;tomgillespie2002;"schindler's list is a film that will no doubt forever grace the endless 'best movies' lists trumped up by various organisations and movie magazines. it's serious subject matter, black-and-white photography, rousing score and 'directed by steven spielberg' tag has cemented it's status as one of the best american movies of all time. but the more hardened movie-goer will more than likely pick holes in it, and tell you that this in fact not even spielberg's greatest achievement. which is why, 21 years after it's release, i decided to revisit schindler's list, and although i would agree that spielberg has made better (he did make jaws (1975) after all), this is still a masterful work, a wonderfully mature step-up for the film-maker who had, up to 1993, leaned towards the visual spectacle of david lean and howard hawks. the holocaust is now very much a roll-your-eyes focus for a film-maker, easily passed off as a desperate plea for awards and serious recognition, and the oscar are routinely stacked with movies portraying this appalling historical event. but spielberg's movie was the first one brave enough to show it for what it was - a sickening, bloody event that humiliated its victims and where the life of a jew was worth less than the work the nazi's could squeeze out of them before they were routinely disposed of. documentaries such as night and fog (1955) and shoah (1985) hit hard, much more so than in this movie, but schindler's list feels like a documentary come to life, with janusz kaminski's cinematography giving the movie a sense of timelessness. liam neeson is oskar schindler, a czechoslovakian opportunist looking to use cheap jewish labour during world war ii to make him enough money to help him retire a very wealthy man. he employs jewish accountant itzhak stern (ben kinsley) to hire his workers and run his factory for him, at first making kitchen utensils to be used in the war. after witnessing the liquidation of the krakow ghetto under the direction of ss- untersturmfuhrer amon goeth (ralph fiennes), in which many jews are massacred, schindler is profoundly affected. he begins to lavish gifts and bribes upon goeth in order to protect his workers from being murdered, but as the germans begin to lose the war, goeth receives the orders to move the jews from his camp onto auschwitz. made the same year as his cgi blockbuster jurassic park, schindler's list showed an unseen maturity in spielberg's work. he had made 'serious' films before, but they were always in the style of classic hollywood; grand, sweeping epics that were generally homages to better directors. here, spielberg is invisible, his hand nowhere to be seen until one of the final scenes. this was film-making closer to italian neo-realism, with hand-held cameras, bleak cinematography, and a glorious lack of sentimentality. rather than make you weep into a tissue, he has you looking away from the screen in utter shock. hundreds of naked jews are humiliated as decisions are made on their ability to work and goeth coldly shoots workers with a rifle from his balcony before breakfast. in one of its most famous scenes, a group of women are led into a shower room that may just be a gas chamber. it's one of the most terrifying sequences in recent memory. spielberg wisely chose relatively unknown actors to fill the roles. neeson, now inexplicably an action star, brings a complexity to schindler as he changes between smug womaniser and nazi suck-up to a man capable of great kindness and selflessness, and the film isn't afraid to show the darker side of his character. kingsley, who was known for his oscar-winning role in gandhi (1982), is schindler's consciousness, a constant reminder of the atrocities that were being committed outside of schindler's comfortable bubble. as amon goeth, one of cinema's most memorable villains, ralph fiennes steals the film. he is a hypocritical, loathsome psychopath, embodying the sense of self-righteousness of the nazi power trip. he despises the jews, and preaches about their extermination, yet falls in love with his servant helen hirsch (embeth davidtz), only to beat her in his disgust. although there are better films out there that focus on world war ii or the holocaust, it is of no surprise that this is still one of spielberg's most revered films. it is a brave, accomplished film that gives you a sense that this was the film the director was always meant to make. however, he seems unable to resist stamping his recognisable dose of sentimentality at the climax, as schindler breaks down in front of his workers wishing he did that little bit more. it's an unnecessarily slushy scene, a piece of director self-indulgence in what is damn near a perfect film, that, if anything, lessens the brutal impact of what came before. but this is a staunch reminder of the atrocities that humanity is capable of, and, as all great movies do, feels incredibly short at over three hours. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com";6 April 2014;9;['endless', 'good', 'various', 'serious', 'subject', 'black', 'white', 'good', 'american', 'great', 'well', 'masterful', 'mature', 'visual', 'desperate', 'serious', 'appalling', 'historical', 'first', 'brave', 'bloody', 'worth', 'less', 'such', 'czechoslovakian', 'cheap', 'jewish', 'enough', 'wealthy', 'jewish', 'ralph', 'many', 'same', 'unseen', 'serious', 'classic', 'grand', 'sweeping', 'well', 'invisible', 'final', 'close', 'italian', 'bleak', 'glorious', 'utter', 'naked', 'famous', 'terrifying', 'recent', 'unknown', 'smug', 'capable', 'great', 'afraid', 'dark', 'constant', 'comfortable', 'memorable', 'ralph', 'hypocritical', 'loathsome', 'helen', 'well', 'brave', 'accomplished', 'unable', 'recognisable', 'little', 'more', 'slushy', 'perfect', 'brutal', 'staunch', 'capable', 'great', 'short'];0.0818502824858757
49;zkonedog;"when watching a movie like ""schindler's list"", there are so many ways that it can be appreciated. it's a history lesson, an intense drama, and a gripping character study all at once. for me, however, the film really hits home with the realization of the difference that one person can make in the grand scheme of things. for a basic plot summary, ""schindler's list"" focuses on oskar schindler (liam neeson), a high- ranking member of the nazi party during world war ii. when the german nazis invade poland and begin rounding up jews into ghettos, schindler sees it as strictly a business operation, opening up his own pots-and-pans factory using jewish labor. while raking in the dough on the backs of the jews, however, schindler begins to see the escalating brutality of the nazis and is eventually appalled by their treatment at the concentration camps. thus, he creates a list of workers that he ultimately hopes to protect from the brutality. as a history-based epic, ""schindler's list"" manages to capture the essence of the moment and yet still be subtle about it at the same time. director steven spielberg strikes the perfect balance between drama and realism. the acting performance from ralph fiennes as the nazi commandant is especially shocking for its ability to depict the brutality of those camps. essentially, this is a movie that should be shown to american high school students at least once during their education for its ability to show the true horrors of the holocaust. perhaps the true hallmark of the movie, though, is the character evolution of mr. schindler. he starts off as nothing more than a ruthless businessman, but over time (and it quite literally takes almost every minute of the film's 3+ hour runtime to come to fruition) he begins to realize not only the horrors transpiring around him, but also that he has the power (and thus the responsibility) to do something about it. to me, that was the most endearing message that i took from the overall experience. thus, i consider ""schindler's list"" to be a masterpiece of american cinema (although, what should i have expected from mr. spielberg?!). it is compelling on both a historic and personal level simultaneously. even though it is quite long, there are very few wasted moments.";7 March 2017;10;['many', 'intense', 'grand', 'basic', 'german', 'own', 'jewish', 'subtle', 'same', 'perfect', 'ralph', 'shocking', 'american', 'high', 'least', 'true', 'true', 'more', 'ruthless', 'endearing', 'overall', 'american', 'compelling', 'historic', 'personal', 'long', 'few'];0.0798717948717948
50;filipemanuelneto;this film tells the story of oskar schindler (liam neeson), a polish industrialist who collaborated with the german war effort, after the invasion of his country, by keeping working in his plant many jewish prisoners. aware that keep them working was to save their lives, schindler hires as much as he can, going against his own interests and even raising suspicions among the nazis. directed by steven spielberg, this film also has the participation of ben kingsley and ralph fiennes. based on a true story, the film screenplay is from steven zaillian. there are some movies that are so good and symbolic that ultimately overcome the art of cinema itself and become part of the heritage and memory of humanity. this is one of those movies. there isn't any negative note to do: the cast exceeded expectations, the script is excellent, the costumes and scenarios are historically accurate. the cinematography deserves special positive note, with interesting camera angles and a very clever use of black and white. in recognition of this merit, the film won seven oscars (best film, best director, best adapted screenplay, best cinematography, best art direction, best editing and best original soundtrack) and was nominated for another five statuettes (best actor, best supporting actor, best costume, best sound and best characterization). the story told in this film is the living testimony of a sad page in world history, but that doesn't end in the past. the holocaust ended decades ago but there's still genocide and ethnic cleansing in other parts of the world. if this film brings a message of compassion and humanity, this isn't only for some people, but transcends the issue of jews or germans to reach all those in this world are persecuted for their faith, ethnic or other perverse motivations.;8 September 2015;10;['polish', 'german', 'many', 'jewish', 'aware', 'own', 'ralph', 'true', 'good', 'symbolic', 'negative', 'excellent', 'accurate', 'special', 'positive', 'interesting', 'clever', 'black', 'white', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'original', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'sad', 'genocide', 'ethnic', 'other', 'ethnic', 'other', 'perverse'];0.3940442370129869

53;Dr_Coulardeau;"this film was and still is a revolution in our approach of the shoah, the holocaust, the extermination of the jews during the second world war. it reveals in shocking images the tactics used by the nazis to capture the jews, here in poland, in order to seize their possessions and to transform them into slaves. in each city of some importance all the jews of a region were compelled to regroup and live entirely within the militarily controlled limits of a ghetto. then the nazi party imposed the election or appointing of a jewish council to manage the ghetto, that is to say to implement the orders from the nazis. then some businessmen, essentially industrialists came to provide the jews with work and there the jews became consenting even if forced slaves and later on the ghettos will be liquidated and forced labor camps will further transform the jews into inmates forced to work for the businessman and kept in order by some ss unit. the value of the film comes from the fact that the industrialist concerned in krakow, schindler himself, comes from previously independent czechoslovakia and is a member of the nazi party with important connections in berlin that gives him the upper hand even on the ss. it is unluckily slightly difficult to believe it since the connections are not brought within our knowledge. who could in nazi germany be more powerful than the ss? the film will show how much money this man was able to make with that slave labor. real fortunes that enabled him to double his political influence with financial corruption. but there it shows how the jews from the very beginning (the order to go and live in the closest ghettos) right to the very end (either their being sent to auschwitz to be gassed or being saved and freed by schindler) will always disbelieve the worst news they could get and always believe in some kind of higher order that will either sacrifice them or save them, that order being from another dimension of time and space. is it divine, is it a god, is it some kind of cosmic force? no one knows which one, but it is a force against which you cannot do anything. you have to submit and survive if it so pleases this force. this submissiveness is never questioned and hardly contrasted to some jewish individuals, and only individuals, who would have thought of resisting, or at least escaping. no matter what happens, they sing a song of lamentation or a song of thanks, but they were reduced to a herd of cattle and they submitted to that fate. it is pathetic to see how schindler's jews do not protest against any violence or whatever. they just, on arriving in auschwitz, call the name of their ""nazi master"", schindler himself. they have been reduced to being schindler's herd. the vision is absolutely disquieting, disturbing, sickening. that definitely is the worst part of such a war. and that absolute alienation is constantly brought back by any war, be it in palestine, in lebanon or in iraq. that's were the film is poignant and at the same time finds its limit. the film avoids all other types of exterminated group, ethnic or not, because all these other groups produced another attitude: rebellion, refusal, fight, struggle. it is also important to see that even in poland, even in these ghettos, even within these jewish councils there was some refusal, rebellion, even a rebellion in the name of freedom in spite of it meaning immediate death: better die than submit to the final degradation, alienation, internalized victimization. stephen spielberg hence does not reflect the whole historical truth but favors one approach only. that explains why the film feels as having aged with time and the end definitely becomes morbidly sentimental: love and gratefulness for the one who made them slaves and only saved them because they were his property that he bought with the money they produced. he is only saving his own possessions, like a rancher would protect his herd. the ending thus is too positive to be acceptable. if the jews had been able to massively move into rebellion, resistance, guerrilla warfare or even plain warfare, the war could have been different. we are speaking of more than two million jews just in poland. to run down such a human wall you need time and quite a lot of tanks and planes. hence it does not bring in any profit but cost a tremendous amount of money. could hitler have afforded it without having to cut some further actions short?

54;johnnyboyz;"schindler's list begins with the striking of a match and the consequent lighting of a candle in a small room; an action which illuminates the rest of the locale and sheds light on those in the form of people and items around it. steven spielberg's film is a piece which goes on to shed degrees of light on a man, whose titular list and what it incurs, is the harrowing but brutally honest subject for this three hour true-to-life experience. shot in black and white amongst deathly downcast greys which combine brilliantly with chillingly cold white in the form of snow and general skyline, schindler's list unfolds amidst a bleak time of murder and pillage but will go on to focus on a ray of hope or salvation in the form of nazi businessman oskar schindler; specifically, his work on the eastern front during world war 2 that saw him save and aid a vast number of jewish people destined for slaughter. liam neeson plays the man, a factory owner of czech origin living in the year 1939 about embark on a period of six or so years which will change his life and many of those he comes to interact with, forever. when we first encounter oskar, he neatly lays his shirts out across a bed during preparation for an evening out; his room neat and very formal, large sums of spare money sitting idly in a nearby draw for whatever reason suggesting a rich or high lifestyle. the measure of the man in his charismatic abilities is are established when schindler arrives at an function in the evening full of german nazi officials; light entertainment in the form of cabaret as well as food and drink which is already flowing. when he first enters, very few people seem to know of him, but by the end of the evening he appears to have wedged himself in amongst everybody as the centre of attention and entertainment. at a function in which all of the other nazi officials seem greyed out by the, schindler comes to have a white ray of light fly over his face suggesting there's a little more to this man than just mere self-indulgence and death. schindler's goals are entirely infused with tendencies that veer towards capitalism, his dealing with the nazi party officials see him enter a business proposition that'll have him enter with nothing but come away with a great deal of something. the situation as to whether we are on the side of oskar in the initial stages is additionally challenged when it transpires if the war were to end, schindler's enterprise might falter so the longer that most of the activity happening in and around everybody at this time continues, it's going to be pretty good for business. inbetween all of this, the second world war reaches somewhat of an infamous crescendo in and around the locality of central europe; the holocaust causing widespread jewish demotion into set ghettos, later followed by evacuations leading onto murder for them but a severe clashing of morality for schindler whom comes to realise employing these proverbial lambs to the slaughter would go a long way in saving them. the film is a high end piece of drama, balancing a character's gradual struggle with being able to offer salvation really well with its meshing of the war genre. spielberg's gradual dragging of his lead away from a self-obsessed businessman always looking out for ways to make money out of the system into this mournful, regretful man makes for wonderful viewing. by the time he is weeping, towards the end, at what has happened or more importantly what hasn't happened in the saving of more jewish people, we feel the need to weep with him - thus successfully aligning the audience with this figure whom was once how he was in his indulgent, nazi function attending self. the comparison is somewhat bookended very simply in how it is both schindler as a stand alone man and how the nazis as a collective group go about the employment of the jews and the manner in which they treat them in a physical sense. where schindler will come to offer hope and salvation in the shape of factory employment, regardless of ability or handicap, an early scene will see german soldiers ruthlessly eliminate an elderly man because of his inability to successfully carry out what it is they ask of him through their charging him with a task, namely, the shovelling away of snow so as to clear a public road. schindler comes to stand in direct opposition to a fearsome nazi captain of the s.s. named amon goth (fiennes), goth additionally being based on a true to-life individual. like schindler, goth is running a business or operation in which management and organisation are key; but while both members of the nazi party and sharing similar basic ingredients as to their respective action plans, the men couldn't be any further apart in character. goth arrives on the scene, a krakow suburb called paszow, to help in the construction of a new concentration camp; the house on the hill he's charged with living in a dominant position in which he is able to overlook all of his work construction orientated or otherwise. just as schindler goes out of his way to 'select' an aide or assistant in the form of ben kingsley's itzhak stern, goth himself goes through a similar process of 'selecting' a assistant he renders a maid-come-slave in the form of a young jewish woman. the measure of fiennes' performance as goth is highlighted in his ability to have the motivational ""tonight is history"" monologue prior to a ghetto liquidation come across as just as chilling as the act of liquidation itself. the film is an exhausting watch;

58;Anonymous_Maxine;steven spielberg's epic portrayal of the nazi holocaust is one of the most powerful films ever brought to the big screen. during production, spielberg is said to have stood in the cold on location in austria and cried, being partly jewish, as he imagined the horrors that all of those people suffered during the second world war under the oppression of the nazis. it is clear that at least some of this emotion transferred over into the film, and the end result is startlingly effective and moving. sure, spielberg has had several other films that have been amazing and memorable, not the least of which, obviously, are ones like saving private ryan and amistad (oh shut up, amistad rocked), but in my opinion, the shocking realism achieved in large part through the documentary style filmmaking gives schindler's list the boost needed to surpass the also brutally realistic saving private ryan. the story involves a nazi who exercised his humanity and attempted to free as many jews as possible from being killed in the concentration camps. steven spielberg has been often criticized for being overly sappy or emotional in his films (this was, of course, long before spielberg himself criticized roberto benigni's life is beautiful for virtually the same thing), and this may have happened in schindler's list as well, but in this case, if he was sappy it was for good reason and with great effect. at the end of the film, liam neeson's oskar schindler has saved a tremendous amount of people who would otherwise have died, but he doesn't seem to notice this as he emotionally laments all of the possessions that he still has that could have been used to save peoples' lives. this is especially effective because of the fact that he was a much more materialistic opportunist at the beginning of the film before he began to pay attention to his conscience. as he did with saving private ryan, spielberg creates a film with schindler's list that is absolutely unflinching. he does not shy away from the horrific things that happened to the victims in the concentration camps, and he does not sugar-coat his presentation of it at all. the time period is re-created and brought to the screen with stunning and disturbing realism, and if it weren't for the quality of the presentation, it could almost seem that we are watching stock footage of the concentration camps themselves rather than a scripted and edited film. spielberg's emphasis on the emotional element of his films comes into play most powerfully in the closing scene of the film, as a very long line of people the descendents of those that he saved during the war walk through a cemetery in the modern day and place flowers on his grave. schindler was unsatisfied when the war ended because he felt that he could have, and should have, saved more people, but during this scene it becomes abundantly clear that he really made a difference, and that his accomplishments were important and long-lasting. with schindler's list, steven spielberg once again demonstrates his tremendous skills as a filmmaker. 1993 is a testament to spielberg's filmmaking skills, because this was the year that he directed schindler's list, the best picture of the year, as well as jurassic park, which was the most popular film of the year. these two films are a perfect example of the two main types of films that spielberg is so adept at creating. there are the fun and exciting films, like jurassic park, e.t., hook, the indiana jones films, and the more recent a.i. artificial intelligence, and then there are the films that are historically accurate and are made to deliver powerful messages to the world in reference to the events portrayed in the film, such as amistad, saving private ryan and, probably his most powerful yet, schindler's list.;2 April 2002;10;['epic', 'powerful', 'big', 'jewish', 'second', 'clear', 'least', 'effective', 'several', 'other', 'amazing', 'memorable', 'least', 'private', 'shocking', 'large', 'realistic', 'private', 'many', 'possible', 'sappy', 'emotional', 'beautiful', 'same', 'sappy', 'good', 'great', 'tremendous', 'effective', 'materialistic', 'private', 'horrific', 'stunning', 'disturbing', 'scripted', 'emotional', 'long', 'modern', 'more', 'clear', 'important', 'lasting', 'tremendous', 'good', 'popular', 'perfect', 'main', 'adept', 'exciting', 'recent', 'artificial', 'accurate', 'powerful', 'such', 'private', 'powerful'];0.1709478021978022
59;jzappa;steven spielberg's versatility can no longer be a question once you have seen schindler's list, one of the all-time quintessential american films. where his most commercially successful films have been fantasies with enormous suspension of disbelief and elements of childlike wonder, schindler's list is unremittingly real, not only in its story and subject matter but in its portrayal of a horrific point in history. one of the most unforgettable sequences i have ever seen in a movie is the ss clearing the krakow ghetto, sending in hundreds of troops to empty the cramped rooms and shoot anyone who protests, does not cooperate, elderly or infirmed, or for no reason at all. the strange unpredictability of the sequence is masterful, such as the heartbreaking point during when the lone boy desperately tries to find a place to hide. or when one ss officer plays a piano and carries on a nonchalant discussion while machine guns massacre hiding tenants. as oskar schindler, perhaps liam neeson's greatest role, watches the carnage from the hills overlooking the area, and is profoundly affected, during one of the most oft-revered employments of color technique in contemporary cinema. oskar schindler's story is so purely human, as opposed to what could have been a clearcut good vs. evil storyline in a film depicting the holocaust. schindler is a crass businessman from czechoslovakia who takes advantage of the abundantly cheap work force of jews to manufacture for the german military. he is a coldly opportunistic member of the nazi party, smothering the army with bribes as well as ss officials in charge. funded by the military, he procures a factory for army mess kits. not being shrewd enough to suitably run such an enterprise, he develops a connection with itzhak stern, played by ben kingsley in his best performance next to sexy beast, a functionary in the local jewish council who has contacts with the now underground jewish business community in the ghetto. they loan him the money for the factory in return for a small share of products for black market trade. schindler makes the nazis happy and takes pleasure in his wealth and status while stern actually does the handling of the organization. when stern suggests schindler hire jews instead of poles because they cost less, this means that the jews themselves get nothing. their wages go to the reich. schindler's jews are allowed outside the ghetto though, and stern fabricate documents to guarantee that as many people as possible are deemed essential by the nazi bureaucracy, which saves them from being transported to concentration camps. schindler is not doing any of this to salvage the lives of these people. he's doing it because of the financial benefits. his realization of his advantage to save lives comes slowly as a sincere and valid human evolution and progression. it is an essential unlikely hero story, true, self-effacing without airs, and humbling. it is however current that drives the epic depiction of truly mortifying horrors. there are many scenes even aside from the krakow ghetto scene that may perhaps create blood clots in your head. truly the most unforgettable performance is given by ralph fiennes, playing ss official gothe, a relentlessly evil character in the coldest, cruelest sense.;5 August 2008;10;['quintessential', 'american', 'successful', 'enormous', 'childlike', 'real', 'subject', 'horrific', 'unforgettable', 'elderly', 'strange', 'masterful', 'such', 'heartbreaking', 'lone', 'nonchalant', 'great', 'contemporary', 'human', 'good', 'evil', 'crass', 'cheap', 'german', 'opportunistic', 'shrewd', 'good', 'next', 'sexy', 'local', 'jewish', 'underground', 'jewish', 'small', 'black', 'happy', 'stern', 'stern', 'less', 'stern', 'fabricate', 'many', 'possible', 'essential', 'financial', 'sincere', 'valid', 'human', 'essential', 'unlikely', 'true', 'current', 'epic', 'many', 'unforgettable', 'ralph', 'official', 'evil', 'cold', 'cruelest'];0.106910569105691

61;freemantle_uk;schindler's list is my favourite film of all time. the film is based on the novel schindler's ark, which itself was based on the life of oscar schindler who saved over 1,000 jews during the holocaust. oscar schindler was played by liam neeson, and his performance was excellent. the shows that schindler himself was faulted character himself, he was a member of the nazi, he was a war-profiteer, a womaniser and bribed officials. he did however have a sense of humanity and could not allow innocent people die. he uses his influence and money to save them and has to battle nazi officials to do this. ralph fiennes was also performed brilliantly as amon goth, a senior nazi who was sent to help organisation the final solution. goth was portrayed a sadistic murderer who enjoyed randomly killing jews and having sexual affairs. it was also shown that schindler had to work with goth to save as many jews as he did. as well as the acting, the black and white filming added to the atmosphere of the film. it gave the film a sense of beauty and also gives the viewer the feeling of being there. the film also shows how the horrible the holocaust was and showed some of the things people had to do to stay alive. but it also shows the faith of many of jews and strengthen their resolve against the nazis. i find the holocaust interesting on a historical, psychological and sociological viewpoint because it shows mankind at its worst. it was the worst atrocity in the 20th century and unfortunately genocides still are going on. the ending was very touching for me as well. some people have criticised it but i don't know why. i felt the level of emotion was just right, not over done or underplayed. it is the only time i ever been tearful during a film and that is why i think the ending works. i also like the use of real footage at the end of the film. the film as serves as a film lesson which is very good, especially since i am a history student. all in all, this film is a classic!;13 March 2008;10;['favourite', 'novel', 'liam', 'excellent', 'innocent', 'ralph', 'senior', 'final', 'sadistic', 'sexual', 'many', 'black', 'white', 'horrible', 'alive', 'many', 'interesting', 'historical', 'psychological', 'sociological', 'bad', 'bad', 'touching', 'right', 'underplayed', 'only', 'tearful', 'real', 'good'];0.1483709273182957

65;dee.reid;"filmmaker steven spielberg's 1993 world war ii/holocaust drama ""schindler's list"" is a cinematic triumph. unquestionably spielberg's most ""satisfying"" film about wwii (and of his career, perhaps), ""schindler's list"" is one of his many directorial highlights because of its message of hope, survival, and humanity during a time in human history that lacked any of those three. this is what spielberg's vision of world war ii was really about: regaining a sense of hope, survival, and humanity in grave times. it's been a while since i saw it last. i saw this film about six years ago my sophomore in high school; we had to watch it as part of my world history class. boy, am i glad i chose to show up those two days we watched this movie because i surely would have missed out on an incredible film experience. this is my favorite film about the holocaust during world war ii; ""raiders of the lost ark"" (1981) was pure fun about world war ii, and ""saving private ryan"" (1998) showed the personal cost of world war ii. spielberg is himself a jew, and his personal feelings about wwii and the plight of the jews during that time are no secret to anyone who watches his movies about that period in time; has anyone got the feeling he was secretly smirking to himself when indiana jones (harrison ford) was making mincemeat out of those b******s, the nazis, in ""raiders of the lost ark?"" i do. ""schindler's list"" is spielberg's masterstroke of cinematic film-making. if ""raiders of the lost ark"" showed a jewish kid vicariously living out his fantasies of slaying nazis, then ""schindler's list"" showed us that that kid has finally grown up. adapted from thomas keneally's book, this heartfelt - and oft-times horrifying - tale is about a german war profiteer named oskar schindler (liam neeson) who gives safe haven to over 1,000 jews (including his loyal accountant, itzhak stern, played by a superb ben kingsley) in his factory after becoming sensitive to the horrors inflicted upon them by the nazis, especially by the psychopathic, high-ranking nazi commandant amon goeth (ralph fiennes). by no means a saint, his transformation from womanizing war profiteer who thought nothing of socializing with the nazis to humanitarian savior is nothing short of a brilliant performance by neeson, who gives this at-first loathsome character a heart and a human portrayal who risked bankruptcy and certain death to ""save one life, and save the world entire."" what's most striking about this production is its authenticity. spielberg filmed ""schindler's list"" at the real nazi concentration at auschwitz - just to give it that extra-real feeling of authenticity. to make the film fit the time, he chose to film it in black & white, much rather than the easier color print. however, when color does appear in one particular key scene, you get why spielberg chose to put it there. there's also something so real and believable about the concentration camp scenes that make the imagery during those sequences unforgettable. who can forget the startling sequences where the nazis are making the jewish prisoners strip in freezing-cold weather, and then herd them into darkened rooms where ominous-looking sprinklers loom overhead? ""schindler's list"" is one of the key films about world war ii, the holocaust, and of the 20th century; maybe it's the definitive film about those three. its historical significance will allow it to never become dated, and will make it one of the best films in the history of cinema. steven spielberg probably has, indeed, made the most satisfying film of his career. 10/10";15 December 2008;10;['cinematic', 'many', 'directorial', 'human', 'grave', 'last', 'high', 'glad', 'incredible', 'favorite', 'pure', 'private', 'personal', 'personal', 'cinematic', 'jewish', 'heartfelt', 'oft', 'horrifying', 'german', 'safe', 'loyal', 'superb', 'sensitive', 'psychopathic', 'ralph', 'humanitarian', 'short', 'brilliant', 'first', 'human', 'certain', 'entire', 'striking', 'real', 'extra', 'real', 'black', 'white', 'much', 'easy', 'particular', 'key', 'real', 'believable', 'unforgettable', 'startling', 'jewish', 'freezing', 'cold', 'ominous', 'key', 'definitive', 'historical', 'good', 'satisfying'];0.1784163898117386
66;CubsandCulture;this is a film that is made by a filmmaker at the height of his powers. the dramatization of the holocaust is some of the most intense footage ever made. in so far as the end goal was to get the viewer to experience even a small part of horrors european jews experienced the film succeeds wonderfully. but the film's focus is critically off in two ways. schindler's story of moving from an amoral capitalist to a humanitarian saver is compelling but it is not what the holocaust was. it was genocide, murder and pointless brutality. there's no good reason to tell schindler's story as the central point. it was and is an anomaly. this problem is really brought home with the fake out sequence in the auschwitz showers/gas chamber. most people who entered that space were murdered. it is almost as if spielberg cannot bring himself to display the actual horrors of genocide directly. to tell only the story of schindler's list is fundamentally misleading. second, i don't understand why stern isn't the protagonist or why schindler is. to frame the holocaust through the eyes of a german gentile is gross. schindler, for all his goodness, was not the target of the genocide. moreover, certain beats in schindler's story trivialize the holocaust if treated as the focal point. the famous sequence of the young girl in the red coat is the moment schindler changes. it is when he first sees the humanity of jewish people. but that isn't what matters. what matters is the mass murder that is occurring. if the film made stern the protagonist this problem would be greatly lessened. this is a film with messed up priorities.;5 February 2019;6;['intense', 'small', 'amoral', 'humanitarian', 'compelling', 'genocide', 'pointless', 'good', 'central', 'fake', 'out', 'most', 'actual', 'misleading', 'stern', 'german', 'gross', 'certain', 'focal', 'famous', 'young', 'red', 'jewish', 'mass', 'stern', 'lessened'];0.0946428571428571
67;ackstasis;"the holocaust is undoubtedly one of the most significant and horrifying events of the twentieth century. between 1938 and 1945, the jewish population was segregated and persecuted, culminating in the merciless slaughter of approximately six million jews (this figure is quoted in the film, though most historical estimates vary between five and seven million). amidst all this butchery, one man decided to make a difference, famously saving the lives of more than 1100 jews- men, women and children who would otherwise have been killed. oskar schindler (played brilliantly by liam neeson, ""batman begins"") was a sudeten german industrialist, a wealthy womanizer who wasn't afraid to throw his money around. always bearing his nazi party badge proudly, schindler would often frequent nightclubs, extravagantly showering high-ranked nazi officers and their girlfriends with champagne and caviar. with impeccable connections in the black-market, there was little that he couldn't get his hands on, and he was a good person to know. buying friends was something that schindler could do well, and he would often use these newfound alliances to aid his own business ventures. when thousands of the polish jew population was relegated to the krakow ghetto in 1941, schindler saw an opportunity for further success, enlisting desperate jewish investors and employing jewish workers (who were substantially cheaper to employ) to open an enamelware factory. his connections in high places ensured lucrative army contracts, and schindler need only have watched as his personal fortune grew, despite doing little to run the company beyond offering it ""a certain panache."" it is clear from the beginning that oskar schindler does not harbour any racial prejudices. when schindler requests the services of itzhak stern (a superb ben kingsley, ""gandhi""), a clever, humanitarian jewish accountant, stern declares that, ""by law i have to tell you, sir, i'm a jew."" ""well, i'm a german, so there we are,"" replies schindler indifferently, before getting straight to business. it is not race that he is concerned with, it is himself and, of course, his money. stern does not enjoy running schindler's business, and he initially acquires little satisfaction from it. when schindler attempts to convey his genuine gratitude for his profitable services with a glass of whiskey, stern absentmindedly refuses to drink it, and an embittered schindler drinks it himself before ordering stern to leave. with the arrival of amon goeth (played as the epitome of evil by ralph fiennes, ""red dragon""), a hauptsturmfuhrer of the ss, the hopeless plight of the jews grows darker. in a harrowing extended sequence, largely based on the testimonies of holocaust survivors, the jews are mercilessly ""liquidated"" from the krakow ghetto, many simply shot on the spot. ""today is history,"" proclaims goeth. ""today will be remembered. years from now the young will ask with wonder about this day. today is history and you are part of it. for six centuries there has been a jewish krakow. by this evening those six centuries will be a rumor. they never happened. today is history."" this sequence also marks the celebrated appearance of the little girl in the red coat. an ingenious plot device, the character was based upon a real girl named roma ligocka who, unlike her film counterpart, survived the war, and wrote a memoir entitled ""the girl in the red coat: a memoir"". the embodiment of innocence, schindler spots the small girl wandering amongst the black-and-white chaos of the krakow ghetto, and we follow her as she retreats into a building and takes shelter under a bed. when schindler later notices her disheveled corpse carted past him to be incinerated, he is understandably horrified, unable to understand how the soldiers could possibly destroy something so innocent. this event memorably signifies the turning-point of schindler's attitudes towards the carnage, fuelling his desire to save as many jews as possible. long known as a ""blockbuster"" filmmaker with such adventure classics as ""jaws,"" ""e.t. the extra terrestrial"" and ""raiders of the lost ark"" to his name - ""schindler's list"" was - and remains - steven spielberg's most mature directorial effort. working with a screenplay that steven zaillian adapted from thomas keneally's booker prize-winning 'schindler's ark,' spielberg treats the subject matter with the respect it deserves. wisely choosing to depict the events as realistically as possible, spielberg allows the images to speak for themselves. flawless acting, stunning cinematography and a haunting john williams score excel this film above all others of the 1990s. this is the powerful story of the difference that just one man can make, and it is a story that deserves to be seen by all. we can only feel grateful that it was steven spielberg who chose to be at the helm.";9 February 2007;10;['significant', 'horrifying', 'twentieth', 'jewish', 'most', 'historical', 'more', 'sudeten', 'german', 'wealthy', 'afraid', 'frequent', 'impeccable', 'black', 'little', 'good', 'newfound', 'own', 'further', 'desperate', 'jewish', 'jewish', 'cheap', 'high', 'lucrative', 'personal', 'little', 'certain', 'clear', 'racial', 'superb', 'clever', 'humanitarian', 'jewish', 'german', 'little', 'genuine', 'profitable', 'embittered', 'ralph', 'red', 'hopeless', 'dark', 'harrowing', 'extended', 'many', 'young', 'jewish', 'celebrated', 'little', 'red', 'ingenious', 'real', 'red', 'small', 'black', 'white', 'disheveled', 'horrified', 'unable', 'innocent', 'many', 'possible', 'blockbuster', 'such', 'extra', 'mature', 'directorial', 'subject', 'possible', 'flawless', 'stunning', 'powerful', 'grateful'];0.1172491496598639

69;GiraffeDoor;i reviewed this movie far more thoroughly back when i had a different account but i want to have one on my profile. the basic problem with this movie for me is that it is not the movie it should me, not unlike bird box. it should be the story of oskar schindler saving some jews but it's actually just an exhibition of the holocaust. there's little plot and as much as i like the macabre of genocide, it gets tiring just getting death after death without much sense of plot progression. it's smugly blunt about its deaths without giving any real reflection on why this atrocity is happening. then there are incongruously lyrical monologues. it's a simpering and ostentatious historical slasher that jacks itself off over genocide without any real depth or characterization, imaginative moments notwithstanding. also, this is in english and that's not ok. why go to such depths to recreate a particular time and place but then ruin that illusion in such an obvious way? doesn't the german language convey the tone so much better? don't get your hopes up...regarding the imdb ratings it is, for me, the most over-rated movie.;22 March 2019;3;['different', 'basic', 'little', 'much', 'blunt', 'real', 'lyrical', 'ostentatious', 'historical', 'real', 'imaginative', 'ok', 'such', 'particular', 'obvious', 'german'];0.1482638888888889
70;Coxer99;"an intense and moving motion picture that shocks, astounds and amazes in all of its 3 hours and 17 minutes. liam neeson is superb as schindler, a womanizing bastard who profiteered off the sweat and tears of countless numbers of jews at the start of the 1940's. as time went on, he saw the demise of the jewish to nazi rule and took a stand to save as many as he could. he ended up saving 1,100 jews and he is considered, to this day, a savior. neeson's transformation throughout the course of the film from nazi supporter to savior of the people is a poignant journey of soul searching. when you watch the piece, you may wonder, ""is he changing because he's out of money? does money truly matter at this point anymore? i think many would agree that schindler had an awakening and that saving the people and himself was his destiny. he found peace with himself and with god. steven speilberg gives us a story that he has never imagined he could bring to us. he brings real life horror. a horror many people cannot confront as a survivor, let alone as an actor. every actor should be commended for their courage in telling this important story. i am not jewish, so all i can feel is sadness and sorrow for the tragedies that took place, but i cannot the anguish the countless families have felt for decades over the loss of parents, grandparents and children alike. with an intense screenplay from stephen zallian and cinematography and art direction that is the finest in years. ralph fiennes is outstanding as the nazi soldier who treats jews as cattle. the scene where he awakes, picks up a rifle and commences firing on a jewish woman standing alone is true horror. through the course of this film, i turned my head away countless times, not knowing what made people do what they do. was their hope? hope. that seems to be the key word in describing this movie. hope is what oskar schindler gave 1,100 jews. he gave them hope. he gave them life!";25 March 1999;10;['intense', 'superb', 'countless', 'many', 'poignant', 'many', 'real', 'many', 'alone', 'important', 'jewish', 'countless', 'intense', 'fine', 'ralph', 'outstanding', 'jewish', 'true', 'countless', 'key'];0.2833333333333333

72;MaxBorg89;"prior to making schindler's list, steven spielberg was known for close ecounters, e.t. and the indiana jones films - not exactly the kind of resume studios would trust when searching for the ideal guy to direct a holocaust drama. then again, scorsese passed on the project because he felt only a jewish filmmaker could get it right (plus, he was still recovering from the controversy surrounding the last temptation of christ), billy wilder said he was too old (but he did contribute to a first draft of the screenplay) and roman polanski stated he just wasn't ready to face his childhood nightmares yet (he did nine years later with the pianist). spielberg received a lot of criticism before the film was released, purely because of his back catalogue. of course, it is now a fact he proved everyone wrong with what can be considered the best, most affecting of his serious movies. based on thomas keneally's bestseller (deftly adapted by steven zaillian), the film tells one of the most amazing true stories of our time, one that stands out as a testament to courage and selflessness in a time as brutal and inhuman as world war ii. the story is that of oskar schindler (liam neeson), a german industrialist who first came across the ""jewish situation"" in hitler's germany when he decided to employ jews in his factory in order to save money. he wasn't an outspoken anti-semite, nor did he oppose the nazi regime - to him, it was all about business. case in point: when he first meets his new assistant (ben kingsley) and the latter says he's a jew, schindler's matter-of-fact answer is: ""and i'm a german."". the famous list doesn't enter the game until much later, when the cynical businessman witnesses the horrors perpetrated by the ss, particularly the stunningly cruel amon goeth (ralph fiennes), and decides to use all his power and influence to save as many innocent lives as possible. his actions, which could have cost him his life had he been discovered, will go down in history as one of the most extraordinary events of all time. if told the wrong way, schindler's story would have ruined spielberg's career. luckily, the director made the wisest choice possible, opting for a documentary-like approach to the material: the film is shot in grainy black-and-white, as if it were a newsreel from that period, and the realism is most evident in the concentration camp scenes - spielberg doesn't linger on the violence or sanitize it, he just shows it exactly as it was. the one element in color in the whole picture (a girl's red dress, reminiscent of nicolas roeg's don't look now) isn't a concession to the somewhat cheesy sentimentality that is occasionally present in spielberg's filmography, but a tool to highlight the tragedy of it all. the sobriety of the direction is reflected in every other aspect of the picture, most notably john williams' oscar-winning score and the three main performances: kingsley's talent was never in doubt after gandhi, and neeson and fiennes will probably never do better than here (although both have managed to get pretty close, thankfully). this painfully real film is a precious means to remember the past and think thoroughly about one of the worst things that ever happened to people, an atrocity mankind hopefully won't repeat, not even in a thousand years. it's a look on the past that serves as a warning for the future, and as such, its power will never diminish.";7 December 2005;10;['close', 'ideal', 'jewish', 'last', 'old', 'first', 'roman', 'ready', 'back', 'wrong', 'good', 'most', 'serious', 'amazing', 'true', 'brutal', 'inhuman', 'german', 'jewish', 'outspoken', 'semite', 'new', 'latter', 'famous', 'cynical', 'cruel', 'ralph', 'many', 'innocent', 'possible', 'extraordinary', 'wrong', 'wise', 'possible', 'like', 'grainy', 'black', 'white', 'evident', 'whole', 'red', 'reminiscent', 'present', 'other', 'main', 'well', 'close', 'real', 'precious', 'bad', 'such'];0.0709090909090909
73;jimbo-53-186511;"schindler's list tells the story of oskar schindler (neeson)who is a nazi businessman who decides to open a factory that employs 'skilled' jewish workers to make pots and pans (as well as other metal products). he then trades these goods and ends up making an awful lot of money. he employs itzhak stern (kingsley)as his accountant and ultimately his 'right hand man'. whilst he is clearly exploiting his workers, they don't mind as they would rather work for schindler than be under the brutal regime of the ss. when schindler's workforce are taken from him by the evil general amon goeth (fiennes) and when he witnesses the horrors of how goeth and his men are treating them, schindler decides to take action and tries to save as many of those that are being persecuted as possible. if i was to judge this film on a technical basis only then it would get a 10 for me; the directing, the cinematography, the acting were all perfect in my book. i also liked that it was filmed in black and white as this helped to not only capture the 'bleakness' of the holocaust, but it also helped in getting a feel for the era. i also liked how the era had been recaptured and created - it certainly had an authentic feel to it. finally we come to the acting and for me it was fiennes that shone as the evil general amon goeth - he was really creepy and absolutely personified evil. neeson and kingsley were great too, but for me fiennes put on the best performance. so having said all that, you might be wondering why i'm only rating this 7/10? well for me, it is technically perfect, but schindler's list (at well over 3 hours long was far too long in my opinion). the first hour was brilliant and the last 30-45 minutes were also very good. it was the middle part of the film that dragged for me. i personally felt that 2 1/2 hours max would have been sufficient, but at 3 hours and 15 minutes it was just ridiculous. having said that this is still a film that everyone should watch. it's not an easy watch at times, but it's still a very important film. as a side note, the end of the film is probably one of the most 'moving' and 'touching' moments i've ever experienced when watching a film. great film - but a tad too long in my opinion.";17 November 2013;7;['skilled', 'jewish', 'other', 'awful', 'right', 'brutal', 'evil', 'general', 'many', 'possible', 'technical', 'perfect', 'black', 'white', 'authentic', 'evil', 'general', 'creepy', 'great', 'good', 'perfect', 'first', 'brilliant', 'last', 'good', 'middle', 'sufficient', 'ridiculous', 'easy', 'important', 'touching', 'great'];0.140937019969278
74;Nazi_Fighter_David;"it's september, 1939. oskar schindler is a nazi-catholic industrialist from czechoslovakia, a bon-vivant who realizes that a nice long war in europe might be an excellent situation for making money... so in a great opening parallel montage, spielberg depicts the personal journey of one man and the massive journey of one race... as thousand of families are forced to abandon their careers, properties and homes to live in overcrowded ghettos, the scene switches to schindler, where he pays his way to get a fine table at a fancy nightclub in nazi-occupied city of krakow, the surviving gem of poland's medieval cities... drinking alone, he scans the strange clientele and slowly sets about casting his nets on the ss german officers... he quickly plied them with food, caviar and french wine... and as a magician, overcoming every resistance, he transforms the separate tables of the cabaret into one joyful drunken party of wine, women, and song for the nazi officials... the two worlds come together when schindler meets itzhak stern and offers him a deal... since jews cannot own businesses, they should work together... stern's contacts can provide investors, and stern's expertise can run the business, and schindler will take care of the presentation... in those same scenes, amon goeth is introduced... goeth is a flabby psychopath who comes to embody the evils of nazi racism... he is in charge of the camp where the workers are housed and must be bribed and pampered if schindler is to stay in business... goeth's excessive cruelty is also part of the reason that schindler is transformed from an opportunistic 'victimizer' to 'humanitarian.' liam neeson portrays oskar schindler, the businessman with irresistible charm - the charm of the same magnitude that saved hundreds of innocent people and brightened schindler's reputation among critical historians... as movie gradually progresses, schindler's perspective changes much as when he himself states that ""people die - it's a fact of life."" neeson's flexibility as an actor is impressive... his performance is built on a combination of self-confidence, indecision, and doubt... his character is always evolving, yet always convincing... his transformation from 'war profiteer' to a ""righteous"" man is adequately slow and well developed... as the war draws to a close, schindler decides unexpectedly to evaluate his life... he turns over his gains into a noble cause - and virtually takes his workers away from being swallowed up by the holocaust... in one of the film's most touching scenes, schindler goes to auschwitz and fights for the freedom of the wives and children of his workers... ben kingsley plays the role of itzhak stern, the timid gifted accountant, and the silent partner wary of his employer and the enemy... stern (spared from the horrors of the holocaust) is also schindler's good angel... he occasionally reminds the audacious man that he could get in a lot of trouble if his true motives are ever discovered... kingley delivers history's judgment of oskar schindler in a touching moment: 'whoever saves one life, saves the world entire.' ralph fiennes brilliantly portrays amon goethe, the complex study of a sadistic true monster... he is a heartless and cruel killer, with a complicated, twisted personality... stripped to the waist and overlooking the prison yard, he leaves his mistress ingrid (beatrice macola) in bed to shoot arbitrarily, with his scope rifle, slow-moving jews from the veranda of his high villa... goeth despises jews, yet he inexplicably falls in love with a shy jewish maid, helen hirsch (embeth davidtz). rather than allowing himself to touch her, and nearly committing the capital crime of kissing her, he remembers that he is supposed to hate her, and beats her ruthlessly for seducing him... goeth is a man to despise... but the full scope of his atrocities are not entirely shown... spielberg shows carefully as much of the horror as the screen can bear... the savage scenes are difficult to watch... spielberg's camera pans to the pillar of dark smoke rising from the chimney stack into the frightening sky of auschwitz, and to the lines of jews unknowingly lead toward the gas chambers... spielberg captures the terror of the nazi reign in the terrifying dramatic moments when stunned women and children are mistakenly sent to auschwitz... the disturbing images of arbitrary murder are harshly realistic... 'schindler's list' assaults the viewer with lasting images of jewish prisoners announcing their names as they are registered, given work assignments, or separated into ""essential"" and ""non-essential."" spielberg focuses on children and uses them both as victimizers and victims... in a powerful way to personalize the slaughter without a single word, spielberg colors the coat of a little girl as she is invisibly making her way, aimless and alone, through the chaotic destruction of the krakow ghetto... (it's almost the same shade as the jacket worn by the young protagonist of spielberg's 'empire of the sun', in a similar situation when he's alone in a mob and trying to find his way home). 'schindler's list' is a tribute to those who lost their lives in the holocaust, a dramatic recreation of that dark, frightening period during world war ii... the horror is alleviated, slightly, by janusz kaminski's stunning black and white cinematography... the lack of color reminds us of german expressionist films, and allows spielberg to be explicit without becoming tastelessly graphic... john williams' tragic and somber, almost unnoticed score adds to the melancholy tone... spielberg's great visual moments - when, in a scene, schindler joins the nazis on the platform as they fire the cold water at the cars on the desperate, suffocating people inside... 'schindler's list' is an outstanding movie... it has an important role in adding credibility to the holocaust, and in thomas keneally's fact-based novel, spielberg finds the right balance of redemption and sorrow.. he makes us watch and feel the extermination through the actions of oskar schindler...";21 January 2002;10;['catholic', 'nice', 'long', 'excellent', 'great', 'personal', 'massive', 'overcrowded', 'fine', 'fancy', 'medieval', 'strange', 'ss', 'german', 'french', 'separate', 'joyful', 'drunken', 'same', 'flabby', 'excessive', 'opportunistic', 'humanitarian', 'liam', 'irresistible', 'same', 'innocent', 'brightened', 'critical', 'impressive', 'convincing', 'righteous', 'slow', 'noble', 'touching', 'timid', 'gifted', 'silent', 'wary', 'good', 'audacious', 'true', 'touching', 'entire', 'ralph', 'complex', 'sadistic', 'true', 'heartless', 'cruel', 'complicated', 'twisted', 'high', 'shy', 'jewish', 'helen', 'full', 'much', 'savage', 'difficult', 'dark', 'frightening', 'terrifying', 'dramatic', 'stunned', 'disturbing', 'arbitrary', 'realistic', 'lasting', 'jewish', 'essential', 'non', 'essential', 'powerful', 'single', 'little', 'aimless', 'chaotic', 'same', 'young', 'similar', 'alone', 'dramatic', 'dark', 'frightening', 'stunning', 'black', 'white', 'german', 'explicit', 'tragic', 'somber', 'unnoticed', 'great', 'visual', 'cold', 'desperate', 'outstanding', 'important', 'right'];0.0176272015655577

78;Samuel-Shovel;"this movie is visually stunning. just the sheer mass of extras, set design, costumes, cinematography, and everything else that went into this movie is breathtaking. through all this, the movie definitely pulls off a war-time atmosphere, the black & white photography only adds another element to this. the acting is (mostly) great. and the story is a good one and an important one. what schindler did deserves our recognition, respect, and reverence. i'm glad spielberg was able to bring it to our attention. now for the problems with this movie. first off, the length: i think this movie's 3 hour 15 minute runtime just snuck by gandhi as the longest theatrically released movie in my viewing history. i try not to make a fuss over the length of a movie; however long the director requires to get their story across to the audience is up to them. what i do take issue with is a movie that has a 3+ hour long runtime that is completely unnecessary such as this one. this movie contains a story that doesn't need its allotted time. i think a 200 minute cut of this movie would really improve it, maybe even a straight 2 hours if you're pushing it. too much time is taken replaying the horrors of nazi-occupied germany seemingly over and over again. i just want to be clear that i am not trying to diminish what happened or the emotional impact these scenes have, however when we as an audience are bombarded with scene after scene of tyrannical cruelty via the hands of the germans, the emotional effectiveness of said scenes starts to fall under the law of diminishing returns. at a certain point, i as an audience member have no emotional energy left to invest and the effort spielberg's putting into causing a mournful tone just becomes fruitless. with most things in life, overexposure will lead to dulling of the senses and emotional desensitization. i am aware that what is occurring on- screen is horrendous but my mind can no longer keep up with what is being presented. sometimes less is more. my next issue relates to the treatment of the protagonists and antagonists of this movie. no, there is no excuse for what the nazis did and defending this party or their belief system is contemptible and disturbing. but as a director making an oscar-winning best picture, please do not make your characters these black and white symbols of good and evil. not every person in the nazi regime was 100% certifiably evil; not every person representing the good guys was a sinless angel. it is up to you as a director to show us these characters, their nuances, their grey areas, and their stories as a whole. it is up to us as an audience to take in all of this and make decisions about these stories and their characters. but when a director paints all these characters in broad strokes, labeling everyone as either entirely pure or entirely evil, he or she has taken the decision out of our hands and we as an audience are forced to consume the subject matter from the pre-destined moralistic vantage point that the director has prepared for us. that is exactly what has happened here. spielberg hold our hand through the entirety of this movie, not leaving anything up to the audience's interpretation or judgment. in roman polanski's ""the pianist"", we get to see the multiple dimensions to characters from this conflict. polanski focuses more on the character development of the nazis and jews and less on the abhorrent crimes that were occurring. so, when we do see some kind of appalling act taking place on the screen, it is considerably more effect and haunting. but the point is that polanski treats all characters, whether bad or good, like human beings. and, to me at least, it is much more frightening to see people with humanlike qualities behind these egregious acts of genocide. (see ""downfall"" for another great example.) spielberg's nazis act more like monsters from some other dimension, far less unsettling. another issue i see with this movie is the character arc of our main focus, oskar schindler himself. at the beginning of this movie, we see a man who can be labeled as a womanizer, a drunkard, an opportunist, and someone who is self-centered and focused on personal wealth attainment. by the end of the movie we see a family man melodramatically balling his eyes out because he didn't give away enough of his wealth to save more jews. (did we really need that scene?) in theory this is a nice beginning and end point, however during the movie itself, we do not see exactly how this man went from being an egoist to a full-fledged humanitarian. sure, the scenes involving the young girl with the red coat is supposed to represent a pair of epiphanies that schindler has that alters his mindset similar to a dickensian scrooge. however, to me at least, these two scene do not do enough to cause me to buy this change. this movie is 3 hours and 15 minutes. we could spend a little of that time seeing schindler's subtle changes over the course of the war. instead we have this dramatic shift seemingly overnight that is difficult to swallow for me as an audience member. the character development just comes across as half-baked. despite all the gripes i have with this film, i still think spielberg made a fine movie here. he told a beautiful story competently and with a few scenes that left me awe-struck. while the length of this film is a bit overwhelming, it is still something that i think everyone should see at least once, a very important piece of film history.";3 August 2017;7;['stunning', 'sheer', 'black', 'great', 'good', 'important', 'glad', 'able', 'long', 'long', 'unnecessary', 'such', 'allotted', 'straight', 'much', 'clear', 'emotional', 'tyrannical', 'emotional', 'certain', 'emotional', 'mournful', 'fruitless', 'most', 'emotional', 'aware', 'horrendous', 'more', 'next', 'contemptible', 'disturbing', 'good', 'black', 'white', 'good', 'evil', 'good', 'sinless', 'broad', 'pure', 'evil', 'subject', 'pre', 'moralistic', 'roman', 'multiple', 'polanski', 'abhorrent', 'appalling', 'more', 'polanski', 'bad', 'good', 'human', 'least', 'frightening', 'humanlike', 'egregious', 'great', 'other', 'unsettling', 'main', 'personal', 'enough', 'more', 'nice', 'young', 'red', 'similar', 'dickensian', 'least', 'little', 'subtle', 'dramatic', 'difficult', 'half', 'baked', 'fine', 'beautiful', 'few', 'overwhelming', 'least', 'important'];0.0602813852813853
79;davidmvining;"this movie is built on contrasts, and it includes one of the most devastating single cuts in movies. it's a dual narrative that almost feels separated for a while before the two become completely intertwined in the final hour. it's impeccably made, acted, scored, and assembled. it is one of, if not the, greatest single film by steven spielberg, and it's the best example of an ""important"" film. the first sustained sequence to the film is our introduction to the main character of oskar schindler. it's largely wordless, showing him putting on his finest clothes, pocketing a large stack of cash, and zeroing in on some nazi officials in a polish nightclub. he means them no harm, he only wants to schmooze with them and gain the contact necessary to get a manufacturing contract with the nazi military early in the second world war. it's an intoxicating scene as schindler works his magic, going from an empty table to hosting a dozen officers and their dates, all to get in with the high ranking officer who reserved the best table in the place. and then there's a hard cut to nazis marching through krakow. the music is gone, the levity is gone. we went from being seduced by the fun of hanging with nazi officers to the cold hard reality of a nazi occupation in a major jewish population with one edit. it's hard, and it's very effective. that contrast is at the heart of everything in the film, including schindler's character. visually, we see things like schindler in his office above the factory floor while the slave laborers remain separated from him below in much the same way that goeth sits on the porch of his house above the labor camp. schindler wants to use slave labors to make a fortune, which he does. schindler and goeth contrast really well as well. they both sit in positions of power, schindler in the private sector and goeth military, but they end up going in different directions. schindler watches the liquidation of krakow, focusing on that famous little girl in her red coat, and something clicks within him. he's never seen the jewish people as anything more than tools for his own personal wealth, but there's something about that innocent little girl, weaving her way through the mass murder going on around her, that makes him reconsider his assumptions. goeth, on the other hand, is a monster through and through (apparently toned a good bit down from reality), and, once he's given the opportunity to exercise what schindler calls ""real power"" (letting the guilty man go free), goeth realizes it's simply not who he is and he snipes the boy who couldn't get the stain out of his bathtub. through the events of the film is the quiet figure of itzhak stern. when spielberg and ben kingsley were discussing the character, they both boiled the man down to a single word. spielberg chose ""conscience"" and kingsley chose ""witness"". both words perfectly capture, especially together, who stern is in this story. he's largely our eyes into the world, playing a placid man in the face of constant threat, who does what he can to help his employer. on the other hand, he provides little nudges to schindler to move him in the right direction, like getting schindler to meet the one handed worker who credited him with saving his life. he's the one schindler ends up confiding in and plotting with to create the list of 1100 jews to save from the nazi ovens. the parallel story is the story of the holocaust as a whole. we watch the story unfold from persecution on the streets of krakow to the ghetto to the labor camp and finally to the death camp. there are criticisms of the film that it doesn't go far enough on this end. i think, regarding the actual story at play, the creation of the list by oskar schindler, it doesn't necessarily fit, though i get the idea. we see the crackdown, liquidation, and oppression of the jews in exact detail throughout the movie, but once we get to auschwitz, the movie turns away. we don't see the piles of bodies or them being cooked in the ovens, though we do see the smokestacks belching out the ashes from it. it feels like the movie could have taken another step to really embrace the truth of the horror, but spielberg was unwilling. i don't know...i think we might have seen enough and just the implication of the final solution was enough. it's a harrowing look that, perhaps, flinches in the final moments, but the central story of schindler's exposure and reaction to the horrors of the holocaust are magnificently capture and presented. liam neeson is great as schindler. kingsley is quiet and great as stern. ralph fiennes is pure evil as the (toned-down) goeth. john williams' music is somber, touching, and distinctly jewish by design, fitting the film perfectly. spielberg made it because he felt like a holocaust movie needed to be made, and he used every bit of his talent to pull it off. this is a great, great film.";13 January

80;gcd70;"i think i can safely say that steven spielberg is without a doubt the most talented film director of all time. given any subject matter to cover, or any genre in which to film, he is able to produce movies of unsurpassed brilliance. whether it be science-fiction, adventure, action, comedy or drama, his genius prevails every time, as he manages to ""entertain"" in each of these fields. ""schindler's list"" may or may not be his best ever work, but it most certainly is his most important. the story of oskar schindler, member of the nazi party, womaniser and business entrepreneur, is an amazing tale of how the lord god has provided for his people israel. schindler saved over one thousand jews from the atrocities of nazi death camps and so ensured that generations would continue until time's end. spielberg's perception and new found maturity shines as he presents us with a beautifully judged, understated work. he never allows the horrible violence to become gratuitous, and his decision to film in black and white again shows his marvellous insight. spielberg knew that he would be mistaken to lend colour to such a dark period in history. backing spielberg up of course were some fine cast and crew members too, and the seven academy awards that ""schindler"" won is indicative of its' very professional production values. cinematographer janusz kaminski uses the camera to full effect, bringing us some stunning pictures. michael kahn's film editing is very efficient and john williams again scores the perfect music. spielberg was also very grateful to steven zaillian, saying that his adapted screenplay (from thomas keneally's novel ""schindler's ark"") was beautifully understated and restrained. the cast round off the whole show with strong performances. the ever enjoyable ben kingsley plays a major role as schindler's jewish accountant itzhak stern, and does so very well, but not as well as the brilliant ralph fiennes, whose portrayal of twisted and sadistic commandant amon goeth is outstanding, and must have narrowly missed out on an academy award. of course we shouldn't forget lead player liam neeson, whose more than convincing performance was well worthy of the oscar nomination it received. ""schindler's list"" is a numbing and all too disturbing film that conscientious movie-goers must no miss! after deservedly receiving both the best picture and best director oscars for the first time, steven spielberg pleaded with all educators world wide to teach these horrors of the jewish holocaust in our schools so that we would never forget. i have said before that spielberg will probably never eclipse ""e.t."" for sheer wonderment, and the same must be said about ""schindler's list"" for the fact of its sheer magnitude. ""schindler"" is steven spielberg's crowning glory. it has given him the recognition that was long overdue him, and has also established him as perhaps the greatest film maker of all time. congratulations steven, and thank you! wednesday, march 23, 1994 - balwyn cinema ""schindler's list"" is even better on a return viewing. one is able to acquire a deeper understanding of oskar schindler the person and his motivations. steven zaillian's screenplay is exquisite in both its detail and its simplicity, adapted superbly from thomas kenneally's novel ""schindler's ark"". director steven spielberg handles all aspects of his film with quiet assuredness, producing a profoundly moving, shocking and revolutionary piece that is almost perfectly weighted, and deftly understated. spielberg's labour of love is truly the work of a dedicated director. john william's score is a masterpiece of melodic orchestration, being quietly soothing. michael kahn's editing (academy award winning) is very astute, janusz kaminski's camera is very probing and unnerving, capturing some very memorable scenery. the costumes, art direction and set decoration departments have outdone themselves in recreating war time europe. acting is outstanding, starting with liam neeson, who is even better than i recall. his dramatically profound performance is probably the most important of his life. neeson is truly haunting as he makes schindler his own. ben kingsley is at his competent best in the role of the tentative but brilliant accountant itszhak stern, a perfectly weighted showing. powerful support also comes from embeth davidtz and caroline goodall. final word goes to ralph fiennes who, in the role of the sadistic, twisted commandant amon goeth, is chillingly brilliant and mesmerisingly effective. a real find of the year, fiennes deservedly won an oscar nomination and followed this success with another strong showing as charles van doren in robert redford's ""quiz show"". ""schindler's list"" clean swept the 1993 academy awards, and so it should have. spielberg's most intellectually deep, affecting and historically important film is his crowning glory. a must see, though it is at times emotionally upsetting. it is thus hard to describe as fantastic, but one must! unforgettable! saturday, december 30, 1995 - video";28 December 2007;9;['talented', 'subject', 'able', 'unsurpassed', 'good', 'important', 'amazing', 'new', 'horrible', 'gratuitous', 'black', 'white', 'marvellous', 'dark', 'fine', 'indicative', 'professional', 'full', 'stunning', 'efficient', 'perfect', 'grateful', 'novel', 'restrained', 'whole', 'strong', 'enjoyable', 'major', 'jewish', 'brilliant', 'ralph', 'twisted', 'sadistic', 'commandant', 'outstanding', 'lead', 'liam', 'more', 'convincing', 'worthy', 'oscar', 'disturbing', 'conscientious', 'good', 'good', 'first', 'wide', 'jewish', 'sheer', 'same', 'sheer', 'overdue', 'great', 'well', 'able', 'deep', 'exquisite', 'novel', 'quiet', 'moving', 'shocking', 'revolutionary', 'dedicated', 'melodic', 'astute', 'unnerving', 'memorable', 'outstanding', 'well', 'profound', 'important', 'own', 'competent', 'good', 'tentative', 'brilliant', 'powerful', 'caroline', 'final', 'sadistic', 'twisted', 'commandant', 'brilliant', 'effective', 'real', 'oscar', 'strong', 'deep', 'important', 'upsetting', 'hard', 'fantastic', 'unforgettable'];0.2683416193181819

82;Steffi_P;"one of the benefits of our modern day cinema (and by modern, i mean last forty-odd years) is that movies can be made with complete frankness. the more difficult segments of history can be recreated with some accuracy. schindler's list deals with subject matter so sensitive, and tells one of the most important stories of the entire century, that the makers absolutely have to get it right, on every level. thankfully, they did. screenwriter steve zaillian has taken on the difficult task of adapting a work of non-fiction. much of the picture is simply a series of vignettes, most not strictly necessary to the plot, the sort of material that has been cut for reasons of space in a thousand lesser pictures. but they contribute to an overall tone each has its own meaning, and to cut one would make for a poorer film. although it of course follows real events as closely as possible, great care is taken with the rate at which we are exposed to the magnitude of horror. the first two deaths we see the one-armed man and the civil engineer are painfully shocking. but by the time we get to the ransacking of the ghetto we are desensitised to the killing, immersed in this world where the ending of life is a casual act. lines of dialogue which at first seem trivial gain resonance later on. when meeting with the black marketers schindler tells them ""nice things cost money"". eventually he will be buying human lives. in evaluations of schindler's list, so often the importance of the man who portrayed the title role is forgotten. liam neeson's performance perhaps doesn't stand out too much because it is very low-key, and the character is almost passive for all his significance. but this makes neeson's work all the more impressive. he puts all of schindler's emotion, all his thought, into this restrained facade. schindler was a man who essentially spent the whole war keeping up a pretence, albeit for altruistic purposes, that he was a good party member and practical businessman, and neeson handles this contradiction flawlessly. when he allows the floodgates to open in his final scene, the effect is devastating. steven spielberg famously offered this project to a number of directors before deciding to take on the job himself. it could have been disastrous his direction is appalling in the color purple, his first real drama but in the intervening years he had improved considerably. for schindler's list he takes an incredibly indirect approach, his camera often separated from the action or just focusing briefly on hands and objects, as if the material is somehow distant and difficult to fully engage with. despite this distancing effect, spielberg proves himself a master at picking out the important detail in each shot. to give one example, when we first see ben kingsley as itzhak stern, he is right at the back of a room with a dozen or so people in, but spielberg has arranged everyone into diagonals so that our eyes are drawn straight to kingsley. spielberg's utter simplicity and lack of camera trickery are commendable. his careful pacing of scenes makes those all-important lines stand out, and emphasises the life in the people. and this the life is essentially what schindler's list is about. i didn't really intend to comment on the issues in the picture because i wanted to discuss it mainly as an example of perfection in filmmaking. but like any movie schindler's list is not without its detractors, and sometimes people do miss the point. spielberg has been accused of sugar-coating the holocaust, of taking this horrible event in history and making an uplifting story out of it. of course, the nazis did many more terrible things which the movie does not show, and it does end upon a note of hope. but the truth is, schindler's list is not the story of the holocaust. it is the story of oskar schindler, a man who saved lives. the tragedies that occurred in europe are the backdrop to this story, and the realities that spielberg offers us a modest window onto are nonetheless graphic enough to give it meaning. this is not primarily a picture about the evil that went on, it is about the good that existed in spite of that evil. and if ever there was something worth making a motion picture about, it is this.";1 January 2012;10;['modern', 'modern', 'last', 'odd', 'complete', 'difficult', 'subject', 'sensitive', 'important', 'entire', 'right', 'difficult', 'non', 'much', 'most', 'necessary', 'less', 'overall', 'own', 'poor', 'real', 'possible', 'great', 'first', 'armed', 'civil', 'shocking', 'casual', 'trivial', 'black', 'nice', 'human', 'low', 'passive', 'impressive', 'restrained', 'whole', 'altruistic', 'good', 'practical', 'neeson', 'final', 'devastating', 'disastrous', 'color', 'first', 'real', 'indirect', 'distant', 'difficult', 'important', 'right', 'utter', 'commendable', 'careful', 'important', 'horrible', 'uplifting', 'many', 'terrible', 'modest', 'graphic', 'worth'];0.0084325396825396

85;Samiam3;"oskar schindler was a german entrepreneur who came to poland during the nazi occupation to start a new business. he wanted to hire jewish labor because they were cheaper than polish. for a while, a good number of jews went to work in schinder's factories, making pots and pans for the german economy. eventually they were rounded up by nazi comander amon goeth and put in the concentration camps. those who were not fit to do back- breaking slave labor were put in the gas chamber. oscar schinder, who was in fact a nazi supporter, slowly became empathetic after watching the cruelty to these harmless people. using all the money he made from the business, he purchased 1,100 jews from the nazis, and put them back to work in his factory, under good conditions until the war was over. not long after the war ended, amon goeth was executed for his crimes against humanity, and schindler unfortunately never ran a successful business again, but today the descendants of the jews he saved number, tens of thousands. he has become a fairly controversial figure, but i personally think that oskar schindler was great hero of the 20th century, and this is one of the greatest american films of all time; absolutely heartbreaking, cinematically epic, and flawlessly acted. many thanks to both schindler and spielberg.";15 May 2010;10;['german', 'new', 'jewish', 'cheap', 'polish', 'good', 'german', 'fit', 'empathetic', 'harmless', 'good', 'successful', 'controversial', 'great', 'great', 'american', 'heartbreaking', 'epic', 'many'];0.389090909090909
86;Spleen;"steven spielberg was wrong about the subject matter of his own film. it's no more 'about' the holocaust than it's 'about' eastern europe. it's about oscar schindler. more to the point: it's about an amoral small-time capitalist with neither more nor less compassion than most other people, who finds himself as surprised as anyone when cruel and unusual circumstances mould him into a hero. it's about a man led to the path of morality as much by his belly as by his heart. it's a study in the banality of goodness. i don't know how many other people have used that phrase, but there's no better way of putting it. it's the job of documentaries, not fiction, to teach us about the past. 'schindler's list' is not a lesson about the what happened to european jews under nazi rule - at any rate, it's not a particularly good lesson. it's fiction. i'm not, of course, saying that it's false - i gather most of it is true. nor am i saying that it can't teach us a lesson of another kind. when superman saves a thousand people we can always say, 'that's all very well, but i can't leap tall buildings in a single bound; and anyway, superman is supernaturally virtuous.' when someone as flawed as oscar schindler saves a thousand people it's not so easy to make excuses. there's a good story here. many people do some of their best work in telling it. i don't think that neeson, fiennes or spielberg have ever performed better than they do here, and john williams writes fine music in an understated style he hasn't used for a while. but it's really the story that makes the movie. spielberg, in thinking that he's making a kind of documentary, sometimes lets the story down - every single use of colour is an intrusion, and anyone who's read the book will find that sections have been transferred flatly, with a palette knife, to the screen. probably this film has been praised a little more than it deserves. oh, well. excess praise will be washed away with time. one minor point: when the book was first published in australia, it was called 'schindler's ark'. 'schindler's list' is the (inferior) american title. sadly, after the success of the film the book was called 'schindler's list' even here. spielberg could have called his film 'schindler's monocle' - or anything at all - and publishers would have dutifully re-named the book. it's a pity he didn't use his power to restore the original title.";7 September 1999;10;['wrong', 'subject', 'own', 'amoral', 'small', 'more', 'less', 'most', 'other', 'surprised', 'cruel', 'unusual', 'many', 'other', 'well', 'european', 'good', 'false', 'most', 'true', 'tall', 'single', 'virtuous', 'flawed', 'easy', 'good', 'many', 'good', 'neeson', 'fine', 'understated', 'single', 'little', 'more', 'excess', 'minor', 'inferior', 'american', 'original'];0.1277841781874039
87;Jeremy_Urquhart;"took me a good 10 years to revisit this, but i'm glad i did. as fantastic as it is, it's not the kind of movie that's an easy rewatch, for obvious and very intentional reasons. that being said, it is a gripping and incredibly well-paced movie. calling it ""entertaining"" isn't accurate, as such a word might sound flippant when used to describe a movie with this kind of subject matter... but it is expertly paced and flows incredibly well, ensuring that the 195-minute runtime is more than warranted. there's a heavy use of titles- that might be the only noticeable shortcut it takes when helping the audience keep track of what's going on, what year it is, and what location the film is showing. given that it's based on a real story, i think it's an acceptable strategy for contextualising the narrative that detracts very little. besides the expert writing and editing that ensures the film is engaging and well-paced, it's also worth nothing that it features three incredible performances from its leads (liam neeson has never come close to giving such a great performance again, ralph fiennes plays a genuinely terrifying and cold-blooded antagonist with disturbing effectiveness, and ben kingsley is amazing in a more understated performance- his acting was something i didn't appreciate as much on my first watch). the music is also amazing, with john williams delivering another phenomenal score that is impossible to forget, and spielberg's direction is impeccable, too. there are too many fantastic shots to note in one review, and the handheld camerawork here for some of the more intense sequences is - i would argue - even more effective than the much more famous use of handheld cameras in his other highly acclaimed war film, saving private ryan. there does persist an argument that schindler's list is overly sentimental in some regards, considering its subject matter. i wouldn't disagree or argue with anyone who thought so, but would only say that from my perspective, and perhaps limited understanding, it feels genuine and accurately depicts the horrors of the holocaust to an extent that i don't think it feels disrespectful. the scenes that aim to be horrific are absolutely horrifying. the last few scenes, however, are tearjerkers- spielberg does want to highlight an act of good that occurred in a period of despair and evil. it's the approach he chose to make, and at the end of it, i didn't personally feel it undermined the horror he also chose to portray. i think if a filmmaker wants to do both and has the skill to pull it off, that's okay. spielberg clearly has the skill to, in my opinion, and his jewish heritage means i'd like to think he wouldn't have done the film in this manner unless he knew that it was respectful, and true enough to the real experience of those who lived through and suffered at that time in history. there were certainly still some survivors of the holocaust alive in 1993, after all. the issue of sentimentality aside (which is certainly not a problem for all viewers, it seems), schindler's list is a technical marvel, and a rare 3+ hour epic that doesn't feel its length and more than justifies its running time. visually it's amazing, the writing, acting, editing, and music are all phenomenal, and there are sequences of such immense power contained within that are impossible to forget (i was surprised by how much i'd actually remembered from that first viewing, even though it was about a decade ago). it stands as probably spielberg's best film, and the fact he released this the same year as maybe his 2nd or 3rd best film - jurassic park - more than cements him as one of the greatest filmmakers of all time, in all honesty.";1 February 2021;10;['good', 'glad', 'fantastic', 'easy', 'obvious', 'intentional', 'gripping', 'entertaining', 'accurate', 'flippant', 'subject', 'heavy', 'only', 'noticeable', 'real', 'acceptable', 'little', 'worth', 'incredible', 'liam', 'great', 'ralph', 'terrifying', 'cold', 'blooded', 'disturbing', 'amazing', 'understated', 'much', 'first', 'amazing', 'phenomenal', 'impossible', 'impeccable', 'many', 'fantastic', 'handheld', 'intense', 'effective', 'famous', 'handheld', 'other', 'private', 'sentimental', 'subject', 'limited', 'genuine', 'disrespectful', 'horrific', 'horrifying', 'last', 'few', 'okay', 'jewish', 'respectful', 'true', 'real', 'alive', 'technical', 'rare', 'more', 'amazing', 'phenomenal', 'such', 'immense', 'impossible', 'surprised', 'first', 'good', 'same', 'good', 'more', 'great'];0.1816842310694769

95;screenman;"oh-dear; i'm afraid i must inevitably ruffle some self-righteous feathers here. before the juggernaut rolls, let me just say that i am not a holocaust denialist. quite the contrary; i have several books relating to the subject including martin gilbert's acclaimed, definitive and enormous work, which i have read right through, and thoroughly accept as fact. what is shown in this movie is almost certainly as meticulously researched, if for no other reason than that some - like me, perhaps - would shout out 'hey; that ain't true', and make a big fuss about zionist dishonesty etc, etc, if misrepresentations came to light. in any case, there are still enough survivors with suitably vivid memories and whose witness testimony is readily available. one suspects that they, of all people, would most object to any omissions or inaccuracies, depicted in this movie. so we can take as a kosher work. but somehow this just didn't cut it for me. i didn't find the principal characters believable. i didn't understand schindler at all. his reformation from grasping capitalist to saintly cost-no-object saviour was never adequately explained. perhaps the man himself was too much of an enigma to be understood by others. whatever the case, i couldn't identify with him. there were times when his suave slightly-reckless, man-of-action persona bore an uncanny resemblance to indiana jones, and i began to wonder if mr spielberg was having slight de-ja-vue associations with his most famous creation. neither could i begin to understand the motivation of ranulph feinnes' character. he was evidently a lunatic from my standpoint, but attempts to portray his personality left more questions than answers. the scenes of brutality were, if anything, rather less harrowing than some of the descriptions i have read. though they were frightful to behold even so. and i thought the lighting itself - especially at night - was well worthy of the oscar that it gained. it's not clear to me why a child was singled-out for colour treatment in what was a specifically black and white production. did the director think his audience was too dumb to recognise her, despite the constant camera-tracking? this struck me as particularly crass. it was a long movie, and perhaps deservedly so. but the specialised nature of its subject makes it one for students of the holocaust rather than mainstream movie fans. i've described this movie as jewish propaganda and that deserves explanation. propaganda is not necessarily lies, but sometimes the truth can be told in different ways. selective bias, if you like. in this case, we have a movie that was directed by a jew, financed by jews, using jewish facilities (hollywood), and starring jews. and, moreover, it depicts jews as victims and never victimisers - which is probably how they envisage themselves as a people. and with the best will in the world, i cannot see how that can be anything but propaganda. when the day comes that i see mr spielberg make a movie about the sufferings of a people of that ghetto we may not mention - called the gaza strip - a people who are crowded together just as the warsaw jews were, who are brutalised by their fascist task-masters in tel-aviv; who are starved, beaten, bulldozed, bombed, summarily arrested, tortured and murdered, denied electricity even for essential services, and whose land is stolen by a master-race that claims a higher title to it - well, then l'll begin to believe in the unbiased nature of hollywood. and the devil will be wearing thermal underwear. by the way, there are no prizes for guessing why and how it won so many oscars.";1 June 2008;7;['dear', 'afraid', 'righteous', 'several', 'definitive', 'enormous', 'other', 'true', 'big', 'enough', 'vivid', 'available', 'kosher', 'principal', 'much', 'reckless', 'uncanny', 'slight', 'ja', 'famous', 'ranulph', 'more', 'harrowing', 'frightful', 'worthy', 'clear', 'black', 'white', 'dumb', 'constant', 'crass', 'long', 'specialised', 'jewish', 'different', 'selective', 'jewish', 'good', 'ghetto', 'fascist', 'essential', 'high', 'unbiased', 'thermal', 'many'];0.0883333333333333

106;sme_no_densetsu;"circa 1993, steven spielberg was arguably the biggest name in hollywood. the world had just seen ""jurassic park"" become the third of his films to take over top spot in the list of the highest grossing films of all time. then, for an encore, he delivered ""schindler's list""; the film that finally brought him oscar recognition. the story is based on a factual novel by thomas keneally about a german businessman who moves to poland during wwii in the hopes of making his fortune as a war profiteer. he thrives with the aid of jewish slave labour but as the war progresses he becomes increasingly concerned about the safety of his work force. eventually, he resolves to sacrifice his wealth in an attempt to shield his workers from certain death at the hands of the nazis. the screenplay by steven zaillian is a strong one and it ended up resulting in an oscar win. the tone can be grim at times as the film unflinchingly portrays the nightmare of german occupation. with a runtime of more than three hours, the film is somewhat gruelling early on but you eventually get so wrapped up in the story that the time passes quickly. zaillian should also be commended for not portraying schindler as a man without fault; rather, he is an unlikely hero. the cast also rises to the occasion. it's no surprise that the always dependable liam neeson landed an oscar nomination for his portrayal of schindler but it is surprising that this is his only nomination to date. meanwhile, ralph fiennes, in his breakout role, basically stole the show as nazi commandant amon goeth. also deserving of high praise was ben kingsley, whose low-key performance spoke volumes. visually, the film is exceptional. the black and white cinematography of janusz kaminski is stunning and spielberg's direction is impeccable. both individuals were justly rewarded with oscars for their work. meanwhile, the sets & costumes were also top notch and helped to lend the film a feel of authenticity. also worth mentioning is john williams' oscar-winning score. in the end, while ""schindler's list"" shows exquisite care in every area it is ultimately the film's emotional impact that elevates it above the pack. it'd be a stoic individual indeed who isn't moved by this film in one way or another.";17 September 2012;9;['big', 'top', 'high', 'grossing', 'oscar', 'factual', 'german', 'jewish', 'concerned', 'certain', 'strong', 'oscar', 'grim', 'german', 'more', 'unlikely', 'dependable', 'liam', 'oscar', 'surprising', 'only', 'ralph', 'breakout', 'high', 'low', 'exceptional', 'black', 'white', 'stunning', 'impeccable', 'top', 'notch', 'worth', 'exquisite', 'emotional', 'stoic'];0.1965674603174603
107;pyrocitor;films detailing the tragic events of the holocaust more often than not tend to descend into ill-advised and horrifyingly cliched anti-war lectures, so the notion of steven spielberg, debatably the founding father of the blockbuster, helming a ww2 epic may not always have been an ideal prospect, for fear that the gritty realism of the period may have been lost beneath a shiny veneer of hollywood gloss. needless to say, such doubts are near instantly dispelled upon viewing schindler's list, which, while refusing to shy away from the horrific realism of the period, manages to extract moments of genuine glimmering hope out of the darkness, managing to stand out as both one of the most emotionally draining yet exhilarating and uplifting films of its kind. dispelling all potential skepticism, spielberg proves himself entirely the right man for the job, and schindler's list is arguably one of his very strongest and most effective films to date. the film sears itself into the viewer's memory, with many haunting images proving inescapable, from the jarring sound of sporadic nazi gunshots to the despairing moan of thousands of jews crowded into a ghetto. spielberg's effortless manipulation of the audience's emotions is laudable indeed, as is his masterful pacing between the atrocities of war and the small moments of comfort which prevent the film from descending into complete darkness. complimented by a typically moving and beautiful musical score by john williams, the film perfectly counterbalances despair with hope, creating a truly compelling and moving portrait of one of humanity's darker hours. the historical accuracy of the film is similarly laudable - the immaculate period costumes and expansive set design are pitch perfect, and all beautifully rendered in pristine black and white cinematography, a refreshing diversion from the colour saturated contemporary film industry. and while the film's hefty three and a quarter hour running time may be a source of complaint, it serves only to further immerse the audience within the context and period, allowing the emotional drama to resonate all the more. it would seem spielberg was not content to simply provide audiences with a film, and instead settles for an experience - an emotional epic with an uncanny ability to draw an audience in, capture their sympathies and churn them out with a tear in their eye yet a smile on their face in a nearly peerless fashion. and despite the film's undeniable occasional forays into melodrama and cliche (schindler's breakdown near the end, tearfully declaring that he could have saved more is a bit much...) it is difficult to turn one's nose up at so captivating and heartfelt a film as this. liam neeson gives a career defining performance as the benevolent oskar schindler, and his gentle charisma and subtle intensity perfectly compliment the many facets (womaniser, enterpriser and saviour of thousands of innocent lives) of such a monumental role. ben kingsley is similarly impressive as itzhak stern, the jewish manager of schindler's factory. in a role which would normally entail typical hollywood grandstanding, kingsley instead embraces the realism of the character with subtly churning emotions, and his performance is all the more masterfully crafted as consequence. however, despite the stellar work of the main two stars, both pale in comparison with the magnetic ralph fiennes, effortlessly stealing the show as impassive yet impulsively murderous nazi official amon goeth. fiennes' chilling intensity is truly a spectacle to behold, and it is nearly worth seeing the film just for his performance - one of the most haunting, but ultimately human antagonistic faces ever associated with the holocaust. caroline goodall gives a strong performance as schindler's neglected wife, and embeth davidtz is genuinely moving as helen hirsch, a jewish slave working who attracts the fancy of the monstrous goeth. throughout the years, schindler's list has been widely celebrated as one of the most powerful, draining yet uplifting films in recent memory, and upon viewing it, this status is difficult to contend. while the film may toe the line of melodrama at times, and the running time may be enough to dispel some potential viewers, the blistering emotional clout and historical poignancy make spielberg's labour of love easily worth watching for anyone willing to undergo the admittably difficult and draining watch. out of all the second world war films out there, schindler's list stands out as debatably the most engrossing and ultimately uplifting of the lot, proving that in the midst of darkness and despair, genuine human emotion can still be celebrated. -10/10;17 October 2007;10;['tragic', 'anti', 'war', 'ideal', 'gritty', 'shiny', 'needless', 'such', 'horrific', 'genuine', 'exhilarating', 'uplifting', 'potential', 'right', 'strong', 'effective', 'many', 'inescapable', 'jarring', 'sporadic', 'despairing', 'effortless', 'laudable', 'masterful', 'small', 'complete', 'beautiful', 'musical', 'compelling', 'dark', 'historical', 'laudable', 'immaculate', 'expansive', 'perfect', 'pristine', 'black', 'white', 'refreshing', 'contemporary', 'hefty', 'emotional', 'more', 'content', 'emotional', 'uncanny', 'peerless', 'undeniable', 'occasional', 'much', 'difficult', 'heartfelt', 'liam', 'gentle', 'subtle', 'many', 'innocent', 'monumental', 'impressive', 'jewish', 'typical', 'stellar', 'main', 'pale', 'magnetic', 'ralph', 'impassive', 'murderous', 'official', 'chilling', 'worth', 'haunting', 'human', 'antagonistic', 'caroline', 'strong', 'helen', 'jewish', 'monstrous', 'powerful', 'recent', 'difficult', 'enough', 'potential', 'blistering', 'emotional', 'historical', 'worth', 'willing', 'difficult', 'second', 'engrossing', 'genuine', 'human'];0.1211136712749616

112;bobsgrock;"steven spielberg delivers his masterpiece here in telling the very unknown story of a german nazi party member who became the savior for over 1100 jews during the height of the holocaust. this is very dark material and spielberg was wise enough to film it in black and white obviously to emphasize the bleakness of the situation. here all the elements come together and mesh fluidly. the acting is superb with liam neeson perfectly capturing the multiple emotional cycles that schindler went through. at first, he is happy and wealthy yet struggles with the relationship to his wife. as the story progresses, he becomes more saddened and shocked at the horrific events that are taking place on jews in the local towns of poland. he then decides to use the immense wealth he has gathered to try and save those that worked for him in poland before they were moved to concentration camps towards the end of wwii. this is not a happy story at all, and yet there is something so beautiful about this picture. when i first saw it, i cried at multiple scenes. now, after seeing it for the second time, i was more taken aback and could only watch in awe as a simple german businessman did something that only a handful of human beings would have the courage to do. he went face to face with multiple ss officers, including the demented head of the camp amon goeth played sinisterly by ralph fiennes, in order to save all he can. the last hour of the film showing schindler collect all his money together so he can pay for the jews to move them to safety can only amaze and stun you as we watch one man risk and sacrifice all he owns for the benefit of 110 strangers he knows nothing about. here it is all about the quality of human life and how important one person can be to so many others. this truly is one of the greatest films ever made and it is in my mind the best of the last decade. not to be missed by anyone, schindler's list is more than a film; it is an experience of a n event that i pray will never occur again.";20 May 2008;10;['unknown', 'german', 'dark', 'wise', 'black', 'white', 'superb', 'liam', 'multiple', 'emotional', 'happy', 'wealthy', 'horrific', 'local', 'immense', 'happy', 'beautiful', 'multiple', 'second', 'simple', 'german', 'human', 'multiple', 'demented', 'ralph', 'last', 'human', 'important', 'many', 'great', 'good', 'last', 'more'];0.2044444444444444

115;TheUnknown837-1;"while this is not my personal favorite out of all of steven spielberg's films, i do have a powerful appreciation for ""schindler's list"" and i do credit it as the best holocaust film ever made and probably spielberg's third-best lifetime achievement and every time i watch some of the film's most graphic and heart-wrenching or even just plain disturbing sequences, i can understand the director's emotional weaknesses he had during filming of the project and he had every right to be so. i find it amazing that somebody who needed so much emotional assistance from friends and family could pull off a film with such amazing detail and craftsmanship. it just comes to show how much of a genius this man really is. ""schindler's list"" is a film that stretches at least close to, or even over, three hours in length. at times there are instances where i think maybe the film could have dealt with just one less conversation between stars oskar schindler (liam neeson) and amon goeth (ralph fiennes), but once i get down to the last fifteen minutes of the film, i know it couldn't have been any shorter than it is. but ""schindler's list"" is not just a film about displaying the unjustifiable tyranny and suffering caused during the second world war, but it also explores the man who saved 1100 innocent lives: oskar schindler, who began caring about nothing but himself. schindler as we first see him in the film, is married, yet he is a womanizer. he bends the law to profit during the war, he initially cares next to nothing about the jewish people being tortured and shot by the nazis. he's nothing more than a unsuccessful businessman who suddenly sees an opportunity to make a name and fortune for himself by benefiting from the suffering of others. and yet, as we go on later in the film and learn to understand him, the man is totally transformed, as indeed he was in real life. and he ends up giving everything he has and forced to lead the rest of his life alone and without success, to save the lives of over one thousand innocent jewish people whose people were being tortured and killed just for being jewish. while oskar schindler is definitely one of the greatest heroes...both on screen and in real life, amon goeth is undeniably one of the most horrifying villains of all time. here, he is portrayed unbelievably convincingly by ralph fiennes. the character of amon goeth, as well as the entire nazi party in the film, symbolize the vile cruelty that the biased nazi party in real life would place upon their prisoners. we see a scene in the film, where they not only kill them for fun, but also make experiments out of their prisoners. such as lining up a few men against a wall, sticking a rifle barrel to the stomach of the nearest one, and seeing how many of the men behind him the bullet will still strike. and then afterwards, walking up with a pistol and ruthlessly killing the survivors. amon goeth is even more terrifying, in some scenes, he shoots at workers for no apparent reason other than to kill time. and yet while the film explores the cruelty of goeth, it also explores the other sides of him and how he could still be a friend and even a reasonable businessman who other germans. the friendship that develops between him and oskar schindler never steers in a wrong direction, as one might expect, and they remain good friends throughout the entire film, despite their differences in outlooks upon the jews. the music score, composed by masterful john williams, is one of the finest scores ever composed for a film. masterful films gets masterful music scores to go along with them and heighten the tension or drama or whatever is necessary for a scene. the opening scores of the film, as they mostly revolve around schindler's first dives into success, are cheery and intriguing and later on, as the emotional parts begin to arrive, the soundtrack becomes heart-wrenching powerful and sad. the last fifteen minutes of the film are truly amazing and simply rips one's soul apart. and with william's amazing music in the background, you cannot ignore it or refuse to take it seriously. ""schindler's list"" is filmed almost entirely in black-and-white and it seems most appropriately that it is. i personally can not imagine what it could have seemed like in color. well, maybe i can, but i cannot imagine it being as pure and artistic with color. it was meant to be black-and-white, because it was meant to be as much like a documentary as possible. and by using actors and actresses who are talented, yet mostly unknown names to the public, it brings more convincing appearances to the film. this is one of the greatest films ever made. and nobody else could have done it any better than steven spielberg himself. he did not live in a concentration camp or experience the suffering the schindler jews did, but he knows enough about it and brought his visions to the screen with absolute perfection.

119;hall895;oskar schindler did not set out to be a hero. he set out to make money. he was a war profiteer, making money off of the misfortune of poland's jews. they were cheap, easy labor. but somewhere along the way things changed. schindler saw what was happening all around him. the extermination of a people was underway. and in these circumstances a hero was made. for schindler it was no longer about making money. it was about saving jews. his jews. amidst the darkness of the most unspeakable of horror there was a small light shining bright. yes, the number of those who were saved pales in comparison to the number of those lost. but this story, and this film, shows us that there can be something good even where all seems so impossibly bad. even in the worst of circumstances there is room for hope. there is room for a hero. setting the right tone for this film seems an impossible task. you have to celebrate those who were saved. but you must also honor those who were lost. steven spielberg walked this fine line wonderfully. he told his uplifting story of oskar schindler. but the bigger picture was never lost. the horror of what took place comes through very clearly. spielberg does not just tell the story of those saved, he makes it vividly and brutally clear just what they were saved from. the pain, anguish, horror and terror is all very real. seeing the greatest evil the world has known on display is enough to make you lose your faith in humanity. seeing the bravery and heroism of oskar schindler restores that faith. spielberg was fortunate in that he had three terrific performers to work with. liam neeson played schindler so beautifully. here was a character who evolved so much over the course of the film and neeson was pitch-perfect each step of the way. war-profiteering nazi or heroic savior of jews, whatever the moment called for neeson nailed it every time while maintaining an air of mystery. who was oskar schindler really, why did he do the things he did? he was an enigma who neeson portrayed wonderfully. ben kingsley played schindler's accountant itzhak stern. at first schindler and stern have very different motivations. but a bond is formed, a friendship blooms. and stern plays his part in helping to save his people. a quiet, yet determined, presence whom kingsley personifies so well. and then there is ralph fiennes portraying one of history's true madmen, the disgustingly evil amon goeth. any story of a hero needs a villain and goeth, as played chillingly by fiennes, is as villainous as they come. perhaps the scariest thing about him is that there are moments of humanity, kindness even. but in the blink of an eye the moment is gone and the homicidal monster is there before us. kingsley is very good, neeson is terrific but fiennes absolutely takes your breath away. he makes this monster his own, an acting performance of the absolute highest quality. the three stars certainly play a big part in the success of the film. but spielberg makes such great use of so many performers. some play characters who we get to know a little bit. many are nameless, just part of the multitude being led to the slaughter. the hordes in the ghetto and in the camps convey the magnitude and the great sadness of what went on. spielberg holds nothing back in portraying the manner in which these people were dehumanized. and the specter of death always looms. it's a film of over three hours in length which does not seem nearly that long. it grips you throughout, never lets up, never lets you go. and there are some moments which are nearly unbearable, the tension unlike anything you've ever seen. one scene in a shower may well have your heart beating through your chest. and you're just watching, people actually lived this. this was such a challenging story to tell and spielberg tells it so well. the holocaust is an odd place to look for a hero. but here a hero was found. and oskar schindler's story is one we can all remember when we are ready to give up hope for this world.;10 July 2012;8;['cheap', 'easy', 'underway', 'unspeakable', 'small', 'bright', 'good', 'bad', 'bad', 'right', 'impossible', 'fine', 'uplifting', 'big', 'clear', 'real', 'great', 'enough', 'fortunate', 'terrific', 'perfect', 'heroic', 'first', 'different', 'quiet', 'ralph', 'true', 'evil', 'villainous', 'scary', 'good', 'neeson', 'terrific', 'own', 'absolute', 'high', 'big', 'such', 'great', 'many', 'little', 'many', 'great', 'long', 'unbearable', 'odd', 'ready'];0.1788431013431013
120;sharky_55;"spielberg once stated that schindler's list is not about the millions that were killed during the holocaust, but rather about the one thousand that were saved. it's a very important thing to consider when looking at some of the criticisms levelled at this great film. there have been documentaries that have attempted to capture the atrocities of the holocaust but even so none come close to the unflinching and systematic mass murder of the event. schindler's list doesn't attempt to provide an substantial and unbiased view of it. it is a story about one man in particular and his absolute good. even so, the film does attempt to place itself within the reality of the events and create some sense of authenticity. apart from the powerful bookends which are drenched in colour, the black and white documentary approach serves its agelessness and heightens the intensity of some scenes; the first look we get at the enigma of oskar schindler, catch-lights hitting his twinkling eyes at the party, or when a little boy attempts to hide in the underground box full of sewerage. hand- held is also used intensively and to great effect - the rounding up of naked jews, the extended liquidation scene, scrambling around the camp in madness in avoiding a psychopath with a sniper rifle. spielberg doesn't overdose the film with visual tricks but shows it for what it is (the lack of storyboarding aided this), making those little touches all the more effective - quick match cuts to show the various inept secretaries that are hired anyway, kingley's distant voice-over as goeth executes lined up boys silently and mercilessly, and the most powerful motif of them all, the girl in the red coat, a symbol of innocence lost and atrocity committed. there are two exceptional performances here. the first is of course neeson, who brings to the table a great charisma and pragmaticism that later dissolves into sympathy and great courage. we first are charmed like the german officers at the party (i love the great touch of the officer moving forward to get closer to oskar in the photo, obscuring the pretty girl he was initially wooing), and through voice-over and a photo we receive those charms again through the lavish gifts of champagne, caviar and sardines. spielberg does not create a moment of realisation or change; it is a gradual and subtle process that oskar goes through. he is not the morally pure and idealistic man we look for in a hollywood production such as this - he initially hires an entire group of secretaries not to save them, but to further his womanising and marital affairs, and when a one-armed man comes to thank him for saving his life, neeson's face is struck and visibly confused; we wonder if he has ever been the receiver of such sincerity and gratitude. but that changes when he realises the gravity of the situation (""he was a metal press operator""). oskar's front is of course the affable german business man, concerned only about profit, but in glimpses he shows his true humanity and courage in front of the nazis: a long kiss on his birthday, a determination to see worker's thirsts quenched, and in that final teary-eyed heart wrenching monologue, a complete reversal of his ambitions. john williams' iconic violin theme is stirring and most evident here. the other is fiennes' goeth, who takes a despicable monster and adds tiny tinges of humanity that make his character all the more terrifying. his introduction is telling, a faceless pov in the back of the car before we reveal him, not some intimidating figure, but an irritated man with a cold: ""ja, why is the top down? i'm f*cking freezing."" another one of these moments is a brilliant scene where he corners helen in the baseless, shivering and terrified. goeth ignores this, constructing a rather tender conversation in his mind, and we witness a insatiable conflict in his mind, unbelieving that he has fallen for a ""jew bitch"". he almost gives in, but his nazi sensibilities come back to him and he strikes her. this segment is brilliantly inter cut with kisses of another location, the modest jewish wedding and the lavish birthday party where oskar kisses many. this man is truly barbaric, and even a clever appeal to his ego from oskar (""i pardon you."") does not satisfy his cold murderous streak. what fiennes does is give us a tiny bit of insight into a man like goeth, because to us it seems inexplicable that such a man could do such sadistic things and be instrumental in genocide. and so, he loses helen over a game of 21. they bargain over the life of these essential jew workers, and goeth's question to schindler is perhaps a moment of realisation of what he must do. one little moment in the montage of compiling the list is a overlooked appearance from another righteous among the nations, julius madritsch, who save thousands of jews himself. i am struck by how his story and many others could similarly be rightfully portrayed as a compelling act of bravery in the face of such evil, much like oskar schindler's. his story was almost never told; a fateful encounter between writer thomas keneally and a schindler's jew in poldek pfefferberg was the basis of a book and later this film. pfefferberg's own words are particularly telling about this great man: ""schindler gave me my life, and i tried to give him immortality."" and in this film, he has achieved it.";19 September 2015;10;['important', 'great', 'systematic', 'mass', 'substantial', 'unbiased', 'particular', 'absolute', 'powerful', 'black', 'white', 'first', 'little', 'underground', 'full', 'great', 'naked', 'extended', 'visual', 'little', 'effective', 'quick', 'various', 'inept', 'distant', 'powerful', 'red', 'exceptional', 'first', 'great', 'great', 'german', 'great', 'close', 'pretty', 'lavish', 'gradual', 'subtle', 'pure', 'idealistic', 'such', 'entire', 'marital', 'armed', 'such', 'affable', 'german', 'true', 'long', 'final', 'teary', 'eyed', 'complete', 'iconic', 'evident', 'other', 'despicable', 'tiny', 'terrifying', 'irritated', 'brilliant', 'terrified', 'tender', 'insatiable', 'int', 'modest', 'jewish', 'lavish', 'many', 'barbaric', 'clever', 'cold', 'murderous', 'tiny', 'inexplicable', 'such', 'sadistic', 'instrumental', 'essential', 'little', 'righteous', 'many', 'compelling', 'such', 'much', 'fateful', 'own', 'great'];0.1801686507936507

128;Angry_Arguer;"the european holocaust unleashed by adolph hitler and his deranged madmen will always be one of history's darkest moments. to present this on film is one of the most difficult things to do, how do you present all the tragedy, horror, grotesque, and evil of the events from 1939-1945 outside of western eyes for six long years with the sense of hope that still remained in many minds...many didn't live to see that hope come true in the form of liberating capitalists and communists. spielberg has gone from creating fun films like indiana jones to drama of the first order. many scenes oft mentioned by critics still can resonate in our minds with both visual beauty and unflinching brutality. the krakow ghetto liquidation, schindler making his various deals, the near executions and the ones that fall through, the burning of the bodies at the camps. all of this is done in a fashion unlike saving private ryan, spielberg's other big wwii movie. neeson is perfect as the man who is both human (immoral, corrupt, and sinful like all of us) and savior (do-gooder, compassionate). six million jews were burned, gassed, shot, or died of starvation in the holocaust, such equivalence would be nuking new york. for such horrible loss, the jews gained a nation to call their own. that is why for 70 years they have continuously fought the arabs and never lost, to prevent another holocaust that the un could never stop from occuring. by far the most psychologically unique character of schindler's list is amon goethe (most excellently portrayed by ralpy fiennes) as the cruel, ss commandant. when he is first introduced in the krakow winter, he is being shown the ghetto. after his guide is almost finished, what does amon say? not sum racist comment or other nazi-related speech on aryan superiority, rather: ""why is the roof down? i'm f***king freezing!"" he doesn't care about people, later he takes potshots at his own prisoners and uses a method of extracting information from suspected thieves that would have primetime drooling. in a moment of possible humanity by being remotely polite to helen, his jewish ""maid"" brought in from the camps. possibly resisting the urge to rape her, he beats her instead when his self-control runs out. we are not sorry to see him die at the end. if the end or some point near the end does not cause you to reflect on your life or even just cry, you have missed the whole point of the movie that we can never again let anything like the holocaust happen--understood in places like rwanda it is too late for that but our thoughts must be of tolerance and not blatant hate.";4 October 2002;10;['adolph', 'dark', 'difficult', 'grotesque', 'western', 'long', 'many', 'many', 'true', 'first', 'many', 'visual', 'various', 'near', 'private', 'other', 'big', 'perfect', 'human', 'immoral', 'corrupt', 'sinful', 'compassionate', 'gassed', 'such', 'such', 'horrible', 'own', 'unique', 'cruel', 'racist', 'other', 'aryan', 'own', 'primetime', 'possible', 'polite', 'jewish', 'sorry', 'whole', 'late', 'blatant'];-0.0098484848484848
129;TheNorthernMonkee;"spoilers sixty years is a long time. when you compare the world today with 1945, so much has changed. people complain about multiple different things which really are quite petty. in contrast, all those years ago, the world was in a terrible state. millions dead, countless cities destroyed, humanity took itself to the verge of extinction. through brutal and inhumane methods, vast quantities of people were wiped off the earth. one of the biggest groups of people to suffer were those of jewish faith. detested by adolf hitler due to a belief that they were responsible for the decline of the german power, jews were slaughtered in huge numbers. not all germans followed this route however. through the work of german 'heroes' like oskar schindler, some were saved. telling the story of schindler's list of jewish workers, steven spielberg's 1993 film is not easy watching. at over three hours long, it is a powerful black and white piece which shows the brutality of the nazi extermination of the jews. it is an amazing piece of work which is understandably shown in schools. just like spielberg's later ""saving private ryan"", ""schindler's list"" reminds us of parts of the war and it is a film which is crucial to the future development of the human race. as the german war machine spread across europe, hitler's army began to spread his beliefs across the land. rounding up jews and putting them into ghettos, the nazi party began the slow process of wiping out a race of people. german industrialist oskar schindler (liam neeson) hated these events, and under the excuse of manufacturing for the war effort, he set about saving as many as he could. from the first moment to the last, it is hard not to be taken aback by this film. ironically beautiful in a well shot black and white form, it recreates the ugly side of human nature. whether it's ralph fiennes nazi commandant or the misguided child spitting at the passing jews, ""schindler's list"" is not afraid to show this nasty side of humanity. successful at the oscars with awards for best film, director, adapted screenplay and others, the one disappointment is neeson loosing out to tom hanks in ""philadelphia"". hanks was outstanding in that film as a man with aids, but throughout every scene of this film, liam neeson displays the finest acting he has ever done. from the first moment of exploitation of high ranking generals through to his heartbreaking final scene, neeson is outstanding. in terms of acting, neeson is not alone in his quality. the amazing, and perhaps even more powerful, thing about ""schindler's list"" is the way in which every single individual on the screen has you believing them. from the main characters through to the random five second jew, every person on that screen is wonderful. you watch the actors playing a difficult role, and they do it so well, that it just makes the film even more powerful than it already is. one of the most crucial aspects about ""schindler's list"" is the sense of the numbers. in any film where genocide is committed, it is incredibly easy to loose track of the numbers and become dehumanised to the suffering. steven spielberg shows throughout this film how aware he is of this. in the clearing of the ghetto though, spielberg gives his clearest indication of bringing the individual back into focus. as the film progresses in black and white, during the ghetto scene, spielberg has a little girl in a bright red coat running along innocently. this girl, this child, is trying to escape the danger, and both the audience and schindler notice her distinctively. spielberg focuses on this girl and then half an hour later we see her body amongst a pile of the deceased. we're reminded, brutally but crucially, that these are not just statistics but individuals with lives, families and dreams. we are shown that all this waste of human life is terrible, and that little girl stops us from ever growing numb to the vast quantities of dead. the issue of the holocaust is not an easy topic to portray. if it is badly written, the story looses it's meaning slightly, if we are just shown large numbers of corpses we become desensitised. steven spielberg knows this. in ""schindler's list"", spielberg has created a masterpiece. beautifully written and acted, the film is particularly powerful because it manages to use an attractive method of filming to show something truly terrible. from the first five minutes through to the conclusion, ""schindler's list"" is an amazing piece of work. it is powerful, it is moving, and to try to prevent something like this happening again, it needs to be shown regularly in schools. like a small number of films, ""schindler's list"" is a masterpiece which reminds us of events we should never forget.";21 June 2005;10;['long', 'much', 'multiple', 'different', 'petty', 'terrible', 'dead', 'countless', 'brutal', 'inhumane', 'vast', 'big', 'jewish', 'responsible',

130;Atreyu_II;"from what i see, most people seem to like this movie very much. i'm not criticizing them. it's just that i don't like war movies, so i don't understand how can anyone like them. first of all, before watching this movie i thought a lot if i should do it or not. it wasn't only because this is a war film, but also because it is shot in black & white and especially because it is 3 hours long. i knew that this would be another holocaust movie, but this one has something different which made me wanna give it a try: a nazi named oskar schindler saved almost 1200 jews during the holocaust. i thought that was incredible. i also know that this is based on a real story, which makes this somehow a biographical motion picture. in fact, yes, it's admirable the hero that oskar schindler became by saving nearly 1200 lives. that's what happens by the end of the movie, probably the most emotional and powerful part of the film. oskar schindler even wished he could have saved much more lives, which is perfectly understandable. his emotions are particularly very well shown in this part. liam neeson does a great job and steals the show by portraying the german hero oskar schindler. ""schindler's list"" is steven spielberg's most serious movie ever. it shows us a very realistic foresight of what the holocaust was: the cruelty of the nazis, the killing fields, the war, the destruction of everything, how thousands of jews's lives were taken and much more. it is a shocking film and the fact that this is shot in black & white increases this painful environment. even so, considering that this is a war movie, it isn't one of the most violent. however, this is a film that requires lots and lots of patience. it is a slow and very long movie which might very well take one to the limits of his/her patience, especially for those who don't like this kind of movies or aren't interested in these subjects. there's something else i'd like to talk about. why does every single movie about the holocaust has to win academy oscars? i mean, every single movie that comes out about the holocaust is regarded with a rain of oscars. i understand somehow that they do that, but is it all that necessary to exaggerate?";9 December 2007;6;['most', 'black', 'white', 'different', 'incredible', 'real', 'biographical', 'admirable', 'emotional', 'powerful', 'more', 'understandable', 'great', 'german', 'serious', 'realistic', 'more', 'shocking', 'black', 'white', 'painful', 'violent', 'slow', 'long', 'interested', 'single', 'single', 'necessary'];0.0182857142857142

""you have to spend money to make money."". schindler was schmoozing with the local nazi & ss officers to build a customer and contact base. he'd already made plans to open the emailwarenfabrik factory & supply the german army with cookware but he needed to find the right people to sell his product to, ie, all the officers that frequented the restaurant. you can see him working up the chain of officers that come into the place. schindler (at least in the film) is presented as not only very charming but also very cultured -- he orders appetizers & entrees that appear to be crowd-pleasing & converses with the maitre'd about the right wine for his guests. at the end of the scene we see him having a drink with oberfuhrer julian scherner, who is the highest ranking officer that enters the place -- his rank is that of a senior colonel. if schindler is able to, at the very least, strike up a friendship with this man, then scherner will be likely to throw business schindler's way through the other officers under his command. schindler's strategy pays off well; he picks up a lot of business & begins making a lot of money. schindler wasn't completely broke when he arrived in krakow. you can see, while he picks out his outfit for the evening, that he has lots of polish zlotys stashed in various places. schindler is also a very shrewd businessman, as we see throughout the course of the film. he'd be the type of person to know how to stretch his money during dinner to accommodate his guests, however he did lavish on them quite a lot to gain their trust and friendship. also, the restaurant management might also have, later in the evening, recognized oskar to be a trustworthy customer and may have let him run a tab for his dinner expenses. schindler could have easily paid them back later with a budget of$22,000,000 (estimated) it made a lot of money in in america $96,067,179 steven spielberg makes one of (if not the one) his greatest movies of all time. liam neeson gives a great performance as schindler and the whole film is just powerful, amazing and sad but it doesn't matter because the movie is so good. ralph fiennes makes an even better performance as goeth, a man who made everyone stare into the screen with anger and sadness and that is just what a movie is supposed to do-make you feel sad, happy, angry or effect you in some way. i read that someone thought it was overrated and bad, but i think it's a classic and it'll never go away. so if you want to see one of the greatest historical films ever made, then go buy schindler's list.";29 July 2016;9;['long', 'historical', 'right', 'top', 'first', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'original', 'dedicated', 'ralph', 'stern', 'ralph', 'vainglorious', 'greedy', 'german', 'unlikely', 'barbaric', 'german', 'true', 'alive', 'real', 'southern', 'real', 'many', 'cruel', 'psychotic', 'jewish', 'old', 'local', 'german', 'right', 'least', 'charming', 'cultured', 'pleasing', 'right', 'ranking', 'senior', 'able', 'least', 'likely', 'other', 'broke', 'polish', 'various', 'shrewd', 'lavish', 'trustworthy', 'great', 'liam', 'great', 'whole', 'powerful', 'amazing', 'sad', 'good', 'ralph', 'well', 'sad', 'happy', 'angry', 'overrated', 'bad', 'great', 'historical'];0.1959821428571428

140;virek213;"some events in human history are of such a magnitude that no single film made anywhere, least of all hollywood, can ever do them complete justice. but in 1993 steven spielberg put all his heart and soul into a film about the greatest injustice that man has ever foisted upon his fellow man--the holocaust. schindler's list is the result. this epic movie, shot in a somber, documentary-style black-and-white, focuses on oskar schindler (liam neeson), a savvy nazi businessman who had opened an enamelware factory in krakow, poland after the nazis basically overran it. schindler was every bit the womanizer and con man, and initially he saw the jewish people of the krakow ghetto as potential slave labor, nothing more. but when it became rather clear to him what his fellow nazis were doing to the jews, he began to use his powers of persuasion to shield his workers and their families. in doing so, he somehow managed to save twelve hundred lives from extinction. spielberg clearly does not gloss over schindler's gamier side, though he may be accused of romanticizing it. but he also does not spare us the horrible fact of the nazis wiping out at least six million people because they were jews, and perhaps three times as many more of other ""inferior"" peoples. ralph fiennes is about as chilling a villain as there could possibly be, since he's portraying the notorious auschwitz death guard amon goeth. this is a film about pain, death, and murder on a scale never before seen in human history (and, if we're lucky, which will never been seen again). but it is also about redemption. oskar schindler was no saint; and for each life he saved, at least 5000 more died. but he did as much as he possibly could, and went broke doing it. for that, there is a place in heaven for him. winner of seven oscars, including best picture and director (which spielberg clearly deserved long before this), schindler's list is one of the most important films of modern times, a monumental statement against hatred from a master of the cinema.";31 July 2001;10;['human', 'single', 'least', 'complete', 'great', 'fellow', 'epic', 'somber', 'black', 'white', 'savvy', 'jewish', 'potential', 'more', 'clear', 'fellow', 'horrible', 'many', 'more', 'other', 'inferior', 'ralph', 'notorious', 'human', 'lucky', 'least', 'good', 'important', 'modern', 'monumental'];0.1031926406926406

""the pianist"", a recent fine example, shows the suffering of a gifted and wounded man against a supporting backdrop of horror. in ""schindler's list,"" the hopelessness of the victims stretches from frame to frame and the first senseless killings seamlessly lead to a growing orgy of dehumanization. liam neeson is extraordinary as the german factory owner and ralph fiennes as the ss concentration camp commander is both repulsive and fascinating as a warped man whose violence ebbs and flows without any rational inciting events. some dismiss fiennes' character as one-dimensional and unreal but, in fact, any study of ss types who commanded those camps reveal the same split personalities: people who could be fine family men before setting off to work to superintend mass murder, stopping on the way to commit the occasional individual atrocity. the dvd release has been digitally enhanced and the sound is crisp. spielberg declined to provide the usual extras found on most dvd releases, stating that his original film should speak for itself. but augmenting the movie is a documentary where some who survived because of schindler recount their experiences. it must not be missed: some of these voices are already stilled-all will be soon. a very unusual item in the dvd edition is an envelope soliciting contributions to keep the memory of the holocaust alive and to teach its lessons to young people increasingly remote from the war. the solicitation is appropriate-i'm posting a check. tonight was my third viewing, the first at home on dvd. an amazing, disturbing, brilliant film that will continue through the decades to be invaluable. 10/10";18 March 2004;10;['last', 'dead', 'dense', 'much', 'unprecedented', 'efficient', 'painful', 'agonizing', 'special', 'many', 'good', 'enigmatic', 'likable', 'german', 'small', 'ravenous', 'small', 'precious', 'individual', 'postwar', 'different', 'incomplete', 'important', 'notable', 'beautiful', 'much', 'clean', 'recent', 'fine', 'gifted', 'first', 'liam', 'extraordinary', 'german', 'ralph', 'repulsive', 'fascinating', 'warped', 'rational', 'dismiss', 'dimensional', 'unreal', 'same', 'split', 'fine', 'mass', 'occasional', 'individual', 'crisp', 'usual', 'most', 'original', 'unusual', 'alive', 'young', 'remote', 'appropriate', 'third', 'first', 'amazing', 'disturbing', 'brilliant', 'invaluable'];0.2162608225108225
147;movieguy1021;eventually, i would have had to have seen schindler's list. not only was it a staple in modern filmmaking, but i'm also jewish and have been taught all about the holocaust. i like spielberg, and i can sit through long movies (although i did watch the movie in three pieces), so i plunked this newly released dvd into my player and was treated to an adventure, the likes of which i had never seen before. oskar schindler (liam neeson) is a german during world war ii. all he cares about is money, and runs a business while the height of the nazi regime in poland is taking place. he realizes that he can save money on hiring jews instead of poles to work in his factory (since the jews would be taken from the concentration camps, they would not really require much, if any, pay). after some pleading from his wife and his desire to hold onto his accountant, itzhak stern (ben kinglsey), schindler decides to make a list of jews to save from certain death to work in his factory. quite obviously, this movie will have different effects on different people, much like the recent passion of the christ did. those who had relatives who were captured by the nazis, or knew someone, or were alive at the time, or anything of the like, would be much more affected by this film than others. i found myself horrified by many of the atrocities brutally shown, especially ones done by amon goeth (ralph fiennes). it's amazing, how you can be so affected by gruesomeness done to characters you know nothing about. on a lesser side, i found many scenes to be unnecessary and uninteresting. they only added to the already obscenely long runtime. also, the character of goeth, when not brutalizing jews, seemed to become perfectly normal and balanced. goeth seemed duplicitous, and therefore somewhat unbelievable. neeson was good, but kingsley was excellent. one more thing that bothered me was the girl in the red dress. filmed in almost all black-and-white, there's some sort of symbolism there, but there's no telling what it is. overall, schindler's list is an important film, and a tough one to get through, but what you'll get out of it will differ from what others will. my rating: 8/10 rated r for war violence and language.;16 April 2004;8;['modern', 'jewish', 'long', 'much', 'certain', 'different', 'different', 'recent', 'alive', 'many', 'ralph', 'amazing', 'less', 'many', 'unnecessary', 'uninteresting', 'long', 'normal', 'balanced', 'duplicitous', 'unbelievable', 'good', 'excellent', 'more', 'red', 'black', 'white', 'important', 'tough'];0.1413359788359788

154;oOoBarracuda;"oskar schindler was a german member of the nazi party who saved the lives of over one thousand jews during the holocaust by employing them in his factories. in 1993, steven spielberg believed oskar schindler's was a story that needed to be told, directing that year's best picture academy award winning film. casting liam neeson in the titular role with ben kingsley and ralph fiennes in strong supporting roles, oskar schindler's courageous story was brought to life. the story of an unlikely hero proves the point that even the most individual of lives can be turned to a life lived for the masses. oskar schindler was not who you would typically think of as a hero. he was a drinker, a womanizer, and a frequent gambler who had one goal in mind of becoming a millionaire. liam neeson illustrates the many flaws of oskar wonderfully through his many scenes drinking, gambling, and philandering against his wife in the first half of the film. the holocaust gives schindler a golden opportunity to realize his dreams of riches. schindler begins to employ vulnerable jews as laborers in his factories, saving them from certain exile and saving him immense amounts in labor costs. gradually over time, he becomes deeply affected by the treatment of the jews, especially that of his accountant and partner of sorts, itzhak stern (ben kingsley). schindler then starts going to great lengths to protect as many jews as he can, even convincing the german high command to allow him to build another factory and employ more jews. schindler even puts himself at risk by going head to head with amon goeth (ralph fiennes) s.s. officer in command of krakow-paszow concentration camp. even when one camp is closed, schindler arranges for ""his"" jews to be transplanted in another factory. when the train carrying truckloads of jewish women is deferred to auschwitz, schindler races the train down to have them freed using funds from the massive riches he has amassed. by the war's, and the film's conclusion, we see that schindler has lost all of his wealth in the attempt to save as many jews as he could from persecution; being responsible for saving the lives of 1,200 people. many film devices were used exceptionally well throughout this film which is no doubt due to steven spielberg's skill as a director. the film starts out in color, then fades to black and white only to be illuminated in color at its conclusion (and who could forget that red coat scene). this was a marvelous way to illustrate the lives of the millions of jews affected by the holocaust to the grim reality they faced once it started (black and white) to the realities they could experience after the persecution ended (return to color). the film could not have told the grim tale it told in color and the fade to black and white was one of the brilliant decisions spielberg made in this film. the title cards used throughout the first quarter of the movie was a wonderful use to keep the audience engaged and learn further details about the characters involved. the most powerful aspect of this movie has to be its use of sound. i have never watched a movie that used sound so well in a film, especially diegetic sound. the sound is the easiest way to pull an audience into a film and to set the mood of the story, spielberg, however, uses sound in inventive ways to produce realism by really immersing the film into the 1940's. the film closes with a powerful scene in which we see, in present-day the many descendants of the people saved by schindler's list, reiterating the powerful reminder of the origins of dangerous political power, especially needed in today's election cycle.";9 May 2016;5;['german', 'good', 'liam', 'titular', 'ralph', 'strong', 'courageous', 'unlikely', 'frequent', 'many', 'many', 'first', 'golden', 'vulnerable', 'certain', 'immense', 'great', 'many', 'german', 'high', 'more', 'ralph', 'closed', 'jewish', 'massive', 'many', 'responsible', 'many', 'due', 'black', 'white', 'red', 'marvelous', 'grim', 'black', 'white', 'grim', 'black', 'white', 'brilliant', 'first', 'wonderful', 'further', 'powerful', 'diegetic', 'easy', 'inventive', 'powerful', 'present', 'many', 'powerful', 'dangerous', 'political'];0.1544990079365079
155;policy134;you can't really find anything that is as powerful, thought-provoking and tragic as seeing this superb film from the director, often accused of dealing with more flashy projects. even so, as tragic as the subject matter is, it is not a depressing film. we see oskar schindler (a brilliant performance by liam neeson), con man and war profiteer. he likes the finest things in life (good wine, women and most of all money) but a metamorphosis occurs where he simply doesn't care about any of it and loses everything in order to save his workers, who happen to be jews. he is himself a member of the nazi party. on the other hand we have amon goeth (ralph fiennes in a part that defines evil), the ruthless leader of the death camps where jews are killed left and right, simply to terrorize the living jews who mistakenly believes that the nazis operate logically. he is stupid, alcoholic and a miserable human being. fiennes plays his part with absolutely no redeeming qualities and the scary part is that you can't figure him out. a bizarre sequence between schindler and goeth illustrates this point, where schindler tries to explain true power. we think that goeth will take the advice of schindler, only to learn that spielberg goes the other way. quite schocking. both schindler and goeth pay for their actions and you can't really say that either of them is a hero or a villain. spielberg doesn't want us too root for anyone, he mainly shows us what happened. of course, many people consider schindler a hero but liam neeson never plays the hero. he simply seems to have lost interest in all what he held dear in the beginning. what is so fascinating about this movie is hard to explain. it doesn't have one glamorous moment and there are many horrifying scenes. maybe it's this: it's a depiction of triumph of the human spirit (sounds cliche, doesn't it?) but it is nevertheless true.;15 December 2008;10;['powerful', 'provoking', 'tragic', 'flashy', 'tragic', 'depressing', 'brilliant', 'fine', 'good', 'most', 'other', 'ralph', 'ruthless', 'right', 'stupid', 'alcoholic', 'miserable', 'human', 'scary', 'bizarre', 'true', 'other', 'schocking', 'goeth', 'many', 'liam', 'dear', 'fascinating', 'hard', 'glamorous', 'many', 'horrifying', 'human', 'true'];-0.0625661375661375
156;TaylorYee94;"spielberg interviewed that he 'felt very strongly that the sequence had to be almost unwatchable' about ghetto liquidation scenes. he achieved more than this goal in 'schindler's list'; it is so uncomfortable to watch from the start to the end. crime against humanity is conducted in very inhumane way and the movie displays what happened without filter. amon hunting human beings for fun, elders running naked in front of all people for medical check-up, and separating children from their parents, and etc. makes me just too painful to watch. juxtaposition of the reality and the background in contrast increases the effect of the cruelty. when jews are naked in front of people and forced to run for the medical check-up, spielberg places ss officers casually talking and laughing, not even giving a glance at what is happening. in the ghetto liquidation sequence, what we see is callous mass murder, but officers drink cognac in the place with ghetto as a background, and grand classic orchestra is playing with thunder-like gunshots, and lighting of the gunshots sparkles in the windows like photoflash, recreating the party gatherings of german officers in the beginning. when amon is shooting like man-hunting just for fun without any remorse, he is shirtless showing off fat stomach and his partner is shirtless lying on the bed, not surprised at all, maintaining her coolness. two are as lazy as they can be while jew's life is hanging on amon's arbitrary mind, life and death matter. by contrasting the very opposite, audience once again feels this inhumanity of nazi regime. 'schindler's list' is a black-and-white movie, so it feels timeless, which i think appropriate for documenting history. there are only two scenes that show color: the girl in the red coat and the candle for jews' religious assembly. both cases signify hope, a hope that people will survive, that there will be a helping hand like schindler's, and that this hell will be over soon. on the contrast, gas and smoke indicate ominous happenings such as gas chamber and train smoke, serving as repeated indicators. 'schindler's list' is, in my opinion, the best direction of spielberg. direction-wise, he gave meaning and messages in every single scene. they are not too evident but very subtle and delicate. the purpose is to show both schindler's life and inhumanity of holocaust, and he did it so well. going back and forth between one's personal journey & growth and social situation smoothly is hard, and if it is not naturally done, the whole movie can collapse. however, spielberg manages to develop both sides to the level of perfection.";29 July 2021;8;['unwatchable', 'ghetto', 'more', 'uncomfortable', 'inhumane', 'human', 'naked', 'medical', 'painful', 'naked', 'medical', 'ghetto', 'callous', 'mass', 'ghetto', 'grand', 'like', 'german', 'fat', 'surprised', 'lazy', 'arbitrary', 'opposite', 'black', 'white', 'appropriate', 'red', 'religious', 'ominous', 'such', 'good', 'single', 'evident', 'subtle', 'delicate', 'personal', 'social', 'hard', 'whole'];-0.0276587301587301
157;ronakkotian;steven spielberg has made a huge impact on cinema as we know it. movies like jaws and saving private ryan just show how great of a director he is. schindler's list is another example of spielberg's talent as a director. schindler's list follows oskar schindler, a german businessman and a member of the nazi party, who decides to save the lives of his jewish workforce after being exposed to the horrific treatment they receive from other nazis. what can i say about schindler's list that hasn't already been said. it's such a disheartening experience that shows the worst of humanity. through this 3 hour 15 minute film, schindler's list conveys the brutal and horrific ways jews were treated by nazis and spielberg presents this with as much authenticity as possible. the film's lack of colour captures the bleakness and terror of the holocaust brilliantly. the black and white created this depressing feeling that loomed throughout the entire film making each scene as gut-wrenching as possible. the film is very long but it felt purposeful as spielberg explores the barbaric nature of the nazis and the immense torment jews had to go through to the fullest. there are still some scenes that are etched in my memory by how realistic and well executed they are. like the opening scene from saving private ryan, spielberg doesn't hold back here as there are many graphic images but it's those scenes that carry the most emotions and paint a realistic picture of the holocaust. the performances in this film are absolutely spectacular. liam neeson is fantastic as oskar schindler. his expressions along with the graphic imagery make up for some really powerful moments that i won't forget. ben kingsley as itztak stern is incredible. the ending involving him and neeson is one of the most heartbreaking scenes ever and ralph fiennes is truly outstanding as amon goeth. goeth is shown to be as evil and ghastly as possible and fiennes captures that perfectly whilst remaining grounded at all times. who can also forget john williams's devastating score that evokes of sadness every time it plays. it's used during all the right moments and elevates the distressing nature of what's taking place. along with the pianist, schindler's list is one of the best holocaust films to ever be made. it's one of the most honest and personal depictions of the holocaust i've ever seen and for that i have to applaud spielberg and the rest of his crew for the amount of work they put into it. schindler's list is a film that remains close to many people's hearts and won't be forgotten anytime soon.;28 December 2020;10;['huge', 'private', 'great', 'german', 'jewish', 'horrific', 'other', 'disheartening', 'bad', 'brutal', 'horrific', 'much', 'possible', 'black', 'white', 'depressing', 'entire', 'possible', 'long', 'purposeful', 'barbaric', 'immense', 'full', 'realistic', 'private', 'many', 'graphic', 'most', 'realistic', 'spectacular', 'fantastic', 'graphic', 'powerful', 'incredible', 'heartbreaking', 'ralph', 'outstanding', 'evil', 'possible', 'devastating', 'right', 'distressing', 'good', 'honest', 'personal', 'close', 'many'];0.0295482295482295

'whoever saves one life, saves the world entire.' i finally made it, i cannot ever see the whole picture at once for it's brutality that was displayed, but yesterday night i did it gone through the film at length and just took a water break and the 3 hour long saga made me cry even an hour after it was ever. i am emotional and certainly have deep feelings, i cam to restore them again with very film. it made an impact and it re emphasised the value of the life a human, i know what a loss means, i have gone through that, i just can't bear any untimely losses anymore. here, they are organising a crime of execution of poor souls. i wrote the film is in english, though 40% of it is german and polish. it's about oskar schindler, a nazi man man who saved more than 1100 jews from the holocaust of the german army. 6 million jews were killed them can you imagine how much it is, 6000000. that is, a whole race was being eliminated and this man stood up against all odds, and saved 1100 of those. now, this did happen and oskar schindler is one of the few heroes who must be revered for what he done to jew community specifically and to humanity at large. i can say that i am now happy to be reviewing a masterpiece that shows a world of a different kind, a world that i never knew of, but it happened to exist in the world ward 2 under hitler's regime. a world where they call you names, just to kill you, where people are not afraid to be dead either. this was what taliban had did to those in afghanistan. now cinematically it's flawless, it's 3 hours but no editing is needed, any cut would demean the value of a life of a jew, it's best the way it is, cinematography, sound, music, set design and art direction are sublime. now, what' great is you have nearly thirty thousand people working on a film and they themselves make a world that is real in every sense. the actors everyone of them is just so real. we watch history and many epic films but this one is something else. it is by far the greatest documentary made on war. i cannot say anything about the genius of spielberg, i am no worth even to utter a word of single word of praise. about the film, i can say this much, you might not like to watch it many times, but if you did it once, it's highly unlikely to forget anything about this film. by the way, i loved itzhak stern played by ben kingsley, he is more a hero here than anyone else. it's not about applauding the team for such a masterpiece, it's about thanking them for what they have done to humanity by depicting history the way it was. they brought us a story that teaches us value of a life, what more can you ask. i am speechless and even a 5/5 rating seems so less, to this masterpiece. ah, it's aching me even now as i write this in the joy of pain. salutauions to the heroes who have saved lives and our only little tribute we can give them is by knowing their story, so please watch this film. those, who have seen this, they may better know where it comes. for those who have not, here is a scene from the ending of the film.;19 September 2014;10;['humane', 'tragic', 'hopeful', 'entire', 'whole', 'long', 'emotional', 'deep', 'very', 'untimely', 'poor', 'german', 'polish', 'more', 'german', 'much', 'whole', 'few', 'large', 'happy', 'different', 'afraid', 'dead', 'flawless', 'good', 'sublime', 'great', 'real', 'real', 'many', 'epic', 'great', 'worth', 'single', 'much', 'many', 'unlikely', 'more', 'less', 'only', 'little'];0.1387090773809524
159;MovieCriticOnline;he has made some great classics, but in terms of filmmaking, story, heart, pure emotion and craftsmanship, this is by his best film. every scene is filled with depth and rather than just regular plot points, it gives you building blocks for characters and relationships, the foundation for a great movie. these days most films are overly plot driven and worse, action driven fueled by special effects and hollywood formula. schindler's list is none of that. based on a true story it follows oskar as he matures from a businessman to a national hero. lots of great scenes and sequences that don't have music to manipulate how you should feel. i actually wish the whole movie was without music, because it would have been even more real. you can tell the difference between the scenes without music and the ones with. there is much more of a documentary feel to the ones without it. the best part is schindler's list doesn't sugarcoat anything. it shows the brutal nature of the events without censorship. the even better part is it showed everyone as complicated people and not as the standard hollywood black and white characters. i've seen it 5-6 times now and it gets better each time. i even discover new things every viewing. i wish spielberg made more films like this instead of his later duds. a must see.;21 February 2021;10;['great', 'pure', 'good', 'regular', 'great', 'most', 'bad', 'special', 'true', 'national', 'great', 'whole', 'real', 'more', 'good', 'brutal', 'well', 'complicated', 'standard', 'black', 'white', 'well', 'new', 'more', 'later'];0.2174345495774067
160;action-6;schindler's list is an over 3 hour long drama in black/white. this in itself is more than enough to put off younger viewers from watching this film. the movie is about oskar schindler who came to poland as a business man, and ended up saving 1100 jews from extermination. the fact that the movie is filmed in black and white is quite a masterstroke from steven spielberg. this means that the movie looks like an old documentary, instead of a feature-film from hollywood. the movie is packed with emotions and shows who war brings out the cruelty in all people. being able to understand the german language, i was delighted to see that small-talk between the soldiers were in genuine german and not english. the scenes from the concentration-camps(kz-lager)are really scary and nasty, but very realistic. prepare yourself to watch the cruelties of the nazis in a way that you won't see in other feature-films, only in documentaries. 10/10;17 June 2000;2;['long', 'black', 'white', 'more', 'enough', 'young', 'black', 'white', 'old', 'able', 'german', 'delighted', 'small', 'genuine', 'german', 'english', 'scary', 'nasty', 'realistic', 'other'];0.0104166666666666

166;SKG-2;steven spielberg showed he could make grown-up movies with this powerful drama about the holocaust and about one of the handful of people who tried to save jews rather than kill them or allow them to be killed during this time. it's unflinching in looking at the nature of good and the nature of evil. the good is represented, at its most unlikely, in the form of oskar schindler, a womanizer, boozer, charmer, and money-grubber who nonetheless manages to do one good thing and save over a thousand lives. contrary to what some people have commented, he is not presented as a saint, but as a complex, enigmatic human being, and liam neeson plays him that way splendidly. i do agree the scene where schindler wishes he could have saved more feels misguided, but that's my only complaint about the film. on the other side of the coin is ralph fiennes, in an absolute chilling portrayal, as amon goeth, who represents evil here. yet like schindler, his is not a simplistic portrayal, but is someone who doesn't feel anything, except contempt and maybe a little greed. he kills not out of pathology but rather out of boredom. the only time we see any feelings come over him is when he decides, as an experiment, to spare people who do wrong, rather than kill them, and it shakes him, so he goes back to killing. also he's undone by helen hirsch, his maid, so he lashes out at her even more than if it was just some servant. the genius of the movie is to see him and schindler as closer than we would like to think. also, ben kingsley is very good. spielberg was trying to bring the reality of the holocaust to people who didn't know about it, and maybe were being bombarded by all the hate groups who are spreading a disinformation campaign by saying it never happened. and i think he suceeded brilliantly.;4 March 1999;10;['powerful', 'unlikely', 'good', 'contrary', 'complex', 'enigmatic', 'human', 'liam', 'more', 'misguided', 'only', 'other', 'ralph', 'absolute', 'chilling', 'simplistic', 'little', 'only', 'helen', 'more', 'good'];0.05546875

170;chrisbrown6453;"schindler's list did quite well at the box office, while it guaranteed the maker his first oscar for directing. jane campion edged him out for several of the year-end awards given by critics groups, but the academy put him at the top of their ""a"" list for this effort. 1993 was quite a year for spielberg. jurassic park went goofy worldwide, eclipsing yet another spielberg megabuck effort, e.t. schindler's list may never quite reach the same box-office stratosphere, but spielberg can certainly be most pleased and proud of this film. shot in glorious black and white, it is the heart-wrenching story of a group of jews condemned to the krakow ghetto who are saved by a most unlikely guardian angel, a german businessman named oskar schindler. herr schindler is, at first, only interested in these people as cheap labor that can further enhance his bank account, but somewhere along the way he gains a measure of humanity and is soon taking substantial risks for ""his"" jews. the movie isn't precisely clear about why this drastic character change takes place, but that hardly matters. the inherent drama of the turbulent situation carries us along for the full three hours, and you'll be hard-pressed not to shed a few tears during the journey. liam neeson does a stalwart job of filling the schindler shoes, not skimping on the little character details while looming larger than life. it has been noted that neeson has the presence of an old-fashioned movie star and as schindler, he shows that he knows what to do with it. the real-life schindler was described as a cross between curt jurgens and george sanders. also quietly impressive is that gandhi guy, ben kingsley, as itzhak, a very clever accountant who is the brains behind the schindler empire. newcomer ralph fiennes has also copped some best supporting actor awards for his nasty nazi, amon goeth, who heads up the plaszow forced labor camp. when bored, goeth picks off unsuspecting prisoners with his rifle from the terrace of his villa. chilling. the rest of the large cast has been carefully chosen, the script is intelligent, the music is sweeping, and that cinematography by janusz kaminski is a knockout. the complaints about schindler's list are mostly minor. at one point spielberg feels compelled to use a special-effects trick. it looks like a cheap cut-and-paste job. couldn't the man who made dinosaurs walk the earth so realistically pull off this relatively simple stunt? the protracted finale also got on my nerves. after the movie climaxes, the director lets it drag on with a heartfelt but misplaced tribute to the actual survivors. mr. spielberg, your manipulation is showing.";17 June 2002;8;['first', 'several', 'same', 'pleased', 'proud', 'glorious', 'black', 'white', 'unlikely', 'guardian', 'german', 'interested', 'cheap', 'substantial', 'clear', 'drastic', 'inherent', 'turbulent', 'full', 'few', 'stalwart', 'little', 'large', 'old', 'fashioned', 'real', 'impressive', 'clever', 'ralph', 'good', 'nasty', 'unsuspecting', 'chilling', 'large', 'intelligent', 'sweeping', 'minor', 'special', 'cheap', 'simple', 'heartfelt', 'misplaced', 'actual'];0.1225230414746543

179;charchuk;"finally watched it. and, even with everything it's been hyped up to be, i was still impressed. i thought it worked best when it was just focusing of schindler, and showing his growing reaction to the horrors around him, rather than outright showing the atrocities, but you can't really fault spielberg for showing bits like the ghetto liquidation scene, or the shower scene, because they're so powerful without really being manipulative at all. the only bit that really falls into emotional manipulation is the final scene with the rocks, which really took me out of the movie and was obviously a personal, not artistic, choice by spielberg. i was also very surprised at how technically superb and inventive the film was. i expected the powerful impact, but i didn't expect some rather creative shots like the piano playing during the liquidation, or the distant shadow at the top of the long staircase. it's really a beautifully shot film, which is refreshing, because spielberg could have easily gone for a gritty, raw feel and probably still got the same effect, but the near-noir like set-up made the on-screen horrors even more unbearable, due to their glamourized feel. the acting is almost uniformly excellent, from neeson's gradual growth over the film, to fiennes' unredeemably evil yet almost sympathetic villain, to kingsley's quiet nobility, and embeth davidtz's rather underrated turn as amon goeth's housemaid. it's really a shame that the film won no acting oscars, as it truly deserved some, especially fiennes for his tormented performance. the story is not the typical ""exposition-build up-climax-denouement"" but i liked that, as you really didn't know where the story was heading next, and it gave the whole thing a sense of danger and desperation, much like what the characters would feel. this was probably the most well-known and well-received film that i hadn't seen, and now that i have, i have to say i'm not disappointed, though i don't know how many more times i'll be watching it. it really takes a lot out of you. furthermore, despite how much i loved it, it's probably not even in my top five spielberg films, which is really a testament to how many superb films he's made.";8 January 2008;9;['impressed', 'ghetto', 'shower', 'powerful', 'manipulative', 'only', 'emotional', 'final', 'personal', 'artistic', 'surprised', 'superb', 'powerful', 'creative', 'distant', 'long', 'refreshing', 'gritty', 'raw', 'same', 'near', 'unbearable', 'excellent', 'gradual', 'evil', 'sympathetic', 'quiet', 'underrated', 'tormented', 'typical', 'whole', 'disappointed', 'many', 'more', 'much', 'top', 'many'];0.190893015030946

181;roghache;stephen spielberg's amazing schindler's list is an incredibly moving, graphic depiction of holocaust horrors, as they relate to one unlikely humanitarian hero. the czech born german businessman, oskar schindler, starts up a factory in poland, intending to make his fortune by taking advantage of cheap jewish labor. as he becomes increasingly aware of the concentration camp horrors, his motivations change from profit to helping his fellow man, and he is able to save 1100 jews from the atrocities and gas chambers of auschwitz. liam neeson is brilliant in the role of the cool and very human oscar schindler, an ordinary businessman not lacking in human frailties himself. the only other actor that i specifically recall from the movie is ben kingsley (who earlier played gandhi), always wonderful in any role. just a trivial detail, but i found very touching the jewish custom of placing stones on the graves of loved ones. it is used with dramatic effect in this movie. this is a superbly crafted film, the use at times of black and white photography giving a starkly moving, documentary mood. the movie serves as a dramatic tribute to one ordinary and obviously flawed man who, through good will, smarts, and audacity, was able to save so many lives. it is also a troubling personal depiction of the holocaust, brought to horrific life to many viewers because of spielberg's efforts. however, it is not of course, by any means, an entertaining film. i have not seen it since its original release and find it too disturbing to deliberately set forth to watch a second time. although some reviewers have criticized the insensitivity and false portrait, i'd also recommend the italian film, life is beautiful, for a different and unusual view of concentration camps, a story filled with love, humor, and optimism. also, although i believe there was in years past a tv movie of some sort (starring richard chamberlain?), i'd like to see a major film done on another holocaust hero, raoul wallenberg, a swedish diplomat who saved countless hungarian jews. i put wallenberg in a similar heroic category along with oskar schindler. schindler's list is a must see movie, both disturbing history and extraordinary heroism brought dramatically to life on the screen.;22 March 2006;9;['amazing', 'moving', 'graphic', 'unlikely', 'humanitarian', 'german', 'cheap', 'jewish', 'aware', 'fellow', 'able', 'brilliant', 'cool', 'human', 'ordinary', 'human', 'only', 'other', 'wonderful', 'trivial', 'jewish', 'dramatic', 'black', 'white', 'moving', 'dramatic', 'ordinary', 'flawed', 'good', 'able', 'many', 'troubling', 'personal', 'horrific', 'many', 'entertaining', 'original', 'disturbing', 'second', 'false', 'italian', 'beautiful', 'different', 'unusual', 'major', 'raoul', 'swedish', 'countless', 'hungarian', 'similar', 'heroic', 'extraordinary'];0.1084302325581395

184;WhimsicalVonia;"'schindler's list' is one of the most important, illuminating, admirable, and beautiful films ever made. it is also one of the most enigmatic, unnerving, and demoralizing ones ever made. this makes for a most interesting combination. what this translated into for me was that it took me several viewings to finish the film, finding it necessary to pause to recollect my thoughts, both wishing to remember emotionally overwhelming scenes and to let myself realize that this is history. and quite recent history. as much as i wish this were another story of some fictional premise, i would be in denial, which is exactly what this film aims to alter. because of these very reasons, holocaust films are usually not very successful. 'schindler's list' remains as a preeminent exception to this. i was amazed to learn that steven spielberg was behind this masterpiece. apparently, among other great directors, scorsese & polanski were also given the opportunity. and i am damn glad it was spielberg who ended up with it. but i have to admit i would not have said this before seeing what he can do; apparently the variety of his talents. the same man who brought us the indiana jones & jurassic park series. where is the hollywood action? the pizazz? the overdone glamour? even his more serious films, saving private ryan, catch me if you can, munich, seem to be done by a completely different director. to me, they all pale in comparison to this film, which i confidently assert as the quintessential holocaust/nazi film. spielberg's choice to film in black & white illustrated the foresight and vision of a master. furthermore, his selection of what minimal color would be used (bookend scenes & the young girl's red coat) was pure genius. it gives the film a timeless quality, yet matching the feel and style of the time of the events, rather than the time of filming. whether or not intended, the film also drew parallels to italian neorealism, traditionally filmed on location, with some unprofessional actors, telling the stories of struggle and everyday life. the girl's red coat was a conspicuous way to make a visually beautiful statement. our eyes are drawn to this unexpected, sparse, vivid infusion of color. ""look at me,"" it says. ""you can try to be in denial, but this is really happening. you cannot pretend it isn't these deaths, this injustice, this wrong is not going away on its own."" and, in fact, it is when schindler realizes that the girl he observed so silently only days before is now gone forever, signaled only by her red coat, that he sees this and begins his dramatic character shift. the second use of color, in the bookends, seems to be primarily for the candles. both scenes portray a family observing the shabbat. in the opening bookend, before the start of the war, we watch two votive candles melt away into nothing; in a beautiful use of cinematography, the last of the smoke from the candles, lightly colored, dissolves and transforms into the black and white smoke from a train arriving in krakow, poland. a title card announces world war ii. in the closing bookend, to signify redemption and the renewal of hope, these same candles are relit; color is renewed.";16 June 2017;10;['important', 'admirable', 'beautiful', 'enigmatic', 'unnerving', 'interesting', 'several', 'necessary', 'overwhelming', 'recent', 'fictional', 'very', 'successful', 'preeminent', 'amazed', 'other', 'great', 'glad', 'same', 'serious', 'private', 'different', 'quintessential', 'minimal', 'young', 'red', 'pure', 'timeless', 'italian', 'unprofessional', 'everyday', 'red', 'conspicuous', 'beautiful', 'unexpected', 'sparse', 'vivid', 'own', 'red', 'dramatic', 'second', 'votive', 'beautiful', 'last', 'black', 'white', 'same'];0.1696097883597883

189;mOVIemAN56;arguably one of the greatest films ever made, schindler's list details the struggles of two men who are trying to save as many people as they can during the holocaust of world war ii. our main character, oskar schindler (liam neeson) is a german business man who runs a company which builds supplies for the german army. oskar employs many jews from the warsaw ghetto because he can pay them near nothing to do long hours of labor. he treats them good and if one of his workers is harmed by a nazi officer he writes letters of complaints and demands retribution for the damage. as the movie progress', oskar meets jewish accountant itzhak stern (ben kingsley). stern helps schindler to run the company and is constantly hinting a plea for help to his boss. slowly, schindler begins to witness the horrors of the holocaust after witnessing the liquidation of the warsaw ghetto and the slaughter of hundreds of jews. soon schindler is no longer a cold-hearted german who has a schedule for when his goods need to be made but a man seeking to save everyone he can. schindler's lsit draws you in with the very first scene and holds you until the last credit rolls of the screen. filmed entirely in black and white except for the first and last scene, the movie brings forth a n awesome sense of realism and authenticity. the sets are stunning and the effects sued are captivating. the movie also uses some symbolism which is odd for a spielberg film. the infamous girl in red is the only character in the entire film who appears in color while the rest is black and white. she is put forth to represent to the conversion of oskar and is used in only two scenes. liam neeson is able to captivate the audience with his breathtaking performance. he is cool and quick thinking, a ladies man and a sly talker. he is able to bring forth the desperation of his character by the end of the film of how hurt and damaged his soul is from what he has witnessed. he is able to bring for oskar like no other with a sense of realism and compassion, he brings forth a man who is trying to save as many people as he can. i had no idea that ben kingsley was in this film until reading the cast list after seeing it. he barely ever talks but when he does, his words will bring tears to your eyes. he brings out the suffering of the jews and how they are truly innocent of everything the nazi's hold them accountable for. kingsley continues with this film to be one of the greatest actors in the industry. the last of the main characters is amon goeth (ralph fiennes), a troubled german officer and sort of commandant of the concentration camp that oskar's workers come from. fiennes kick started his career with this role. acting opposite of neeson, he is able to hold his own and bring out the lunacy of what the german's planned to do. you can't help feeling pity for him but also an overwhelming sense of hatred at the same time. it is fiennes finest role to date. schindler's list is one of a very few select films that are able to convey a sense of humanity. it shows that murder and genocide solve nothing and that the greatest power to posses is to be able to have power but spare an enemy. the film moved me in a way that i have never felt before, this film will truly stun you. 5 out of 5 stars;21 March 2006;10;['great', 'many', 'main', 'german', 'german', 'many', 'long', 'good', 'jewish', 'cold', 'hearted', 'first', 'last', 'black', 'white', 'first', 'last', 'awesome', 'stunning', 'odd', 'infamous', 'only', 'entire', 'black', 'white', 'able', 'cool', 'quick', 'able', 'hurt', 'able', 'other', 'many', 'innocent', 'accountable', 'great', 'last', 'main', 'ralph', 'troubled', 'german', 'able', 'own', 'overwhelming', 'same', 'fine', 'few', 'select', 'able', 'great', 'able'];0.2208333333333333

194;jackasstrange;so here we go in my 80th review, in this november 28th 2013, coincidentally the day of an american holiday thanksgiving day. nothing better in fact than watch a very good film in that special date for those who celebrate it, and for sure, schindler's list is the perfect film. it's very cliche to say that, because as we all know it is a very popular and acclaimed film from both critics and audiences, and is widely regarded as one of the greatest of all times, but even with these accolades, i think i need to say it's a great film, because it has everything you can seek in a film. it's sad, it shows how the war can affect otherwise normal people as goth_masterfully interpreted by ralph fiennes_ in wicked and psycho assassins, which believed so much in the nazism that he turned into a disturbed man. but unlike schindler himself says in the film's beginning, a war also can turn a 'bad' person in a 'good' one, perhaps. schindler was a completely egocentric person, but after the vision of the girl in red which contrasts with the black and white scenario. she clearly has a specific allegoric sense, and so had the candles. then he starts to help the jews, and he really did everything that he could do to help them, until the war's end. and despite my despise for these conventional 'black and white' characters, this film works very well exploring these, i must say, one-dimensional characters. with an exception to goth,of course, because he had various faces in the film, though all due to his madness. i don't need to say that the cinematography and art design were fantastic in this film. it principal photography took place in krakow, poland, over the course of 72 days in 1993. spielberg shot the film in black and white and approached it like a documentary. cinematographer janusz kaminski wanted to give the film a sense of timelessness. i highly recommend this film, if you haven't already watched it. 9.4/10;28 November 2013;9;['american', 'good', 'special', 'sure', 'perfect', 'popular', 'great', 'great', 'sad', 'normal', 'ralph', 'wicked', 'bad', 'good', 'egocentric', 'black', 'white', 'specific', 'allegoric', 'conventional', 'black', 'white', 'dimensional', 'goth', 'various', 'fantastic', 'principal', 'black', 'white'];0.1892857142857142

196;mnpollio;"schindler's list is one of steven spielberg's first ""serious"" oscar-bait attempts and it is a superb (near flawless) piece of film-making up to a point. spielberg has chosen to relate the horrors of the holocaust through the biographical story of businessman oskar schindler. schindler was an opportunist who decided to exploit the jews affected by hitler's final solution and utilize them in his factory. as he witnessed first-hand the repercussions of the holocaust, he gradually began to take active efforts to save the 1100 jews in his employ by literally buying their lives. spielberg's stark black-and-white photography enhances the realism of the film and he directs the material with a refreshing no-frills approach. spielberg is usually known to be a very sentimental director and what is astonishing about his work for much of the film is how cool and unsentimental it is. this is not an insult, the approach works wonders. he let's the tension and the terror of what unfolds speak for itself without embellishing with tired hollywood cliches and intrusions. liam neeson's performance as schindler is nuanced, enigmatic and entrancing. he is a person that one never truly gets to know, but his evolution from unconcerned businessman to one who in a sweaty frenzy tries to beat the clock to remember all of the names of his employees in order to save their lives is amazing acting. spielberg and neeson never try to turn schindler into a saint and we get a warts-and-all central character. ralph fiennes is also astounding as the thoroughly amoral amon goeth and ben kingsley contributes one of his finest restrained performances as foreman itzhak stern. i also found embeth davidtz moving in the peripheral role of helen hirsch, a young jewish woman who becomes the beleaguered object of affection for both goeth and schindler. the film is required viewing for anyone interested in history, the holocaust or simply masterful film-making. in fact, the only thing that prevents me from ranking the film at its highest level is its conclusion. spielberg in his latter years seems to have a problem with providing satisfying codas to his films the more serious ones provide the greater difficulties. schindler's list is no exception and i believe that he panders in the final few moments and fails to accept the intelligence of his audience for processing what went before. he has just crafted a perfect account of the events and torn our hearts out in the process viewers are fully able to comprehend the depth of the accomplishments of schindler. however, spielberg seems to feel we need a refresher course. he adds a totally unneeded closing where the real surviving schindler jews and their offspring march side-by-side across the screen (all the better to marvel over their numbers) and pay tribute at schindler's grave. while i must say i was mildly interested in seeing the modern-day equivalents of some of the characters i had just seen on screen, it was like a subtle, insightful film suddenly brandishing a sledgehammer and adopting a totally different approach to make its point. still, just in case any is still slow on schindler's accomplishments as a savior, spielberg then literally types it out for us to remind us exactly how many were saved and how many offspring from future generations have been saved by schindler's selfless efforts. i really found this drawn-out and needless climax to shatter the mood generated by the earlier portions of the film and it prevents me from rating this a masterpiece.";3 January 2007;8;['first', 'serious', 'oscar', 'biographical', 'final', 'first', 'active', 'stark', 'black', 'white', 'refreshing', 'sentimental', 'astonishing', 'much', 'cool', 'unsentimental', 'tired', 'enigmatic', 'unconcerned', 'amazing', 'central', 'ralph', 'astounding', 'amoral', 'fine', 'peripheral', 'helen', 'young', 'jewish', 'beleaguered', 'interested', 'masterful', 'only', 'high', 'latter', 'serious', 'great', 'final', 'few', 'perfect', 'able', 'unneeded', 'real', 'well', 'interested', 'modern', 'subtle', 'insightful', 'different', 'slow', 'many', 'many', 'future', 'selfless', 'needless', 'early'];0.1423015873015873
197;dy158;1939 poland. polish jews from around the country were being relocated to the krakow ghetto. meanwhile, ethnic german businessman oskar schindler (liam neeson) had also arrived at the krakow ghetto, hoping to make a fortune as a war profiteer. bribing high-ranking officials to build a factory for the production of army mess kits, having a polish jew in itzhak stern (ben kingsley) who is an official from the krakow's jewish council as his accountant and administrator in his factory. stern would also be credited for typing the list of names eventually famously known as schindler's list, the jews who would come to survive the holocaust because of his boss oskar schindler. schindler had originally hired polish jews instead of polish catholics because of cheap labour, but he soon realises the horror of what some of his workers were going through. it is in view of ss lieutenant amon goth (ralph finnes), who at the concentration camp, oversaw the massacre (which eventually came to be known as the operation reinhard in krakow) where those who were protesting or appeared uncooperative were to be shot. oskar schindler who saw what was going on from the hills overlooking the area with his mistress, become increasingly affected by those whom he call 'his' workers. mindful of his friendship with goth, schindler brides him to build a sub-camp for his workers in order to prevent any more random execution. there is a reason why oskar schindler will always be celebrated for what he did for the jews he had managed to save during the second world war, despite the various faults he had as a person. acclaimed film director steven spielberg, who based the film on the novel 'schindler's ark' written by australian novelist thomas keneally (which the inspiration for the work in poldek pfefferberg, who is one of the many schindler jews was the one who decided to bring the story of oskar schindler to the wider audience), has make the film such that we are being transported back to the actual war years itself with the black-and-white images. that is with the exception of the opening sequence and what happens after the war ended where it is in colour. liam neeson played well in his role of schindler, while ralph finnes perfected the role of ss lieutenant amon goth, to the extent it was rather convincingly that it could be really goth himself. while it is a film depicting the horrors of the war and how one ethnic german decided to go all out to save as much as he could despite his nazi connections, it is also a film which is still relevant in the times we are living in apart from the fact that the holocaust denial is still alive in certain quarters and neo-nazism has not really gone away.;21 March 2011;9;['polish', 'ethnic', 'german', 'polish', 'jewish', 'polish', 'polish', 'cheap', 'ralph', 'uncooperative', 'mindful', 'random', 'second', 'various', 'australian', 'many', 'wide', 'such', 'actual', 'black', 'white', 'ralph', 'goth', 'ethnic', 'relevant', 'alive', 'certain'];0.0529761904761904

202;cinephile-27690;"this is simply steven spielberg's greatest movie. i dare you to challenge this. sure, et is great, and so is jurassic park, and so forth. but of all the movies spielberg has directed, how can any of them top the power and importance of schindler's list? schindler's list is the true story of oskar schindler, portrayed wonderfully by liam neeson. he is a german who saves the lives of over 1,100 jews during the holocaust. schindler does this out of greed, making them low wage workers in his factory for his benefit, but then he does it out of compassion for his fellow man. that's the theme of the movie that echoes throughout long after the credits roll, and from where the film's power stems. the nazis considered jews to be ""vermin"" and not humans worthy of love, care, or compassion. oskar schindler over time sees that they are in fact worthy, and uses this basic human value to change the world. steven spielberg waited over a decade to make this movie. he wanted to it after making e.t., but he felt that he wasn't ready to tackle the holocaust yet. (note that spielberg himself is jewish.) the time he took is well worth it, since he crafted it so well. the movie won 7 oscars, including steven's sole best picture win and his first of 2 best director wins(the other being for saving private ryan). all 7 are well earned for this fantastic movie. spielberg also chose to shoot this in black and white, based on documentaries he saw with actual holocaust footage. this was done to make the movie seem even more real, and this goal succeeds. this was also done so a girl with a pink coat can stand out. while she never speaks, she inspires schindler to have compassion for the jews, she's a sight that speaks to him louder than words. in addition, the black and white cinematography is glorious to look at. since this movie is centered around the greatest tragedy in all of human history, the film gains an r rating for it's realistic violence. prepare for jews to be shot, burned, or gassed for what they believe in. it's hard to watch, but it's the most effective quality. there were people who took pleasure in killing millions of their own kind, and spielberg exposes this horror to perfection. i first saw this in 10th grade in history class, so i was 16. i would say 15 or 16 would be the best age to see this, and 13-14 if there is parental supervision since younger teens may have questions about the holocaust, and for emotional support. i say this because while everyone should see schindler's list, it is not for the young, and historical prior knowledge is necessary. aside from the flaw of crimes against humanity, my only critique of schindler's list is that the german accents of non-german actors are so thick that i needed subtitles to follow the dialogue. apart from this, schindler's list is nothing short of a masterpiece. despite it's grim subject matter, schindler's list must be seen, even if just once. seeing it for the 4th time in my life put it in my top 10. thank you, oskar schindler for your heroic act, and thank you steven spielberg for telling us his incredible story. this is a powerful film that will leave a great impact on you. it should never be forgotten. if all but a few movies are wiped away from human memory, let schindler's list be one that remains. note: this ties with shoah in my top 10. this is a 9.5 hour documentary with real survivors and witnesses to the holocaust. it's $100 from the criterion collection. this is another movie that i consider to be a must see, despite its cost and run-time.";14 May 2020;10;['great', 'great', 'true', 'low', 'fellow', 'worthy', 'worthy', 'basic', 'human', 'ready', 'jewish', 'worth', 'sole', 'good', 'first', 'good', 'other', 'private', 'fantastic', 'black', 'white', 'actual', 'real', 'pink', 'black', 'white', 'glorious', 'great', 'human', 'realistic', 'hard', 'effective', 'own', 'good', 'parental', 'young', 'emotional', 'young', 'historical', 'prior', 'necessary', 'only', 'german', 'non', 'german', 'thick', 'short', 'grim', 'subject', 'top', 'heroic', 'incredible', 'powerful', 'great', 'few', 'human', 'top', 'real'];0.180503144654088

211;krational66;at first, i learned about the movie from the director's teacher, and at that time, i thought it was called 'hitler' list. strong curiosity drove me to download the movie. i was originally not interested in such overly profound films, but i couldn't help but watch the director spielberg's great fame. it has to be said that such art-house films about human nature in the context of war abroad, although they often take nearly three hours, are not boring at all. the film's black-and-white images give a sense of historical vicissitudes, creating a documentary-like atmosphere. the main theme of the film is peace and redemption, which clearly shows the transformation of a german arms dealer named schindler from his greed for personal gain at the beginning to his sincere desire to save every jew persecuted by the german nazis. the war has brought death and fear to every corner of the world. those ruling parties are willing to wage war in order to safeguard their own interests, totally regardless of the lives of the people. war distorts human nature, but it also shows the good side of human nature. under hitler's leadership, the nazis developed a hubristic sense of racial superiority in which they saw the jews as animals with no human rights. they raised their butcher's knife to kill innocent jewish people, they used a ruthless face to the fascist brutality of take in everything in a glance, i can't forget those who hid in the floor to avoid the nazis came for the wardrobe and under the bed, trembling of women and children forget german soldiers in found that after surviving jews rushing a leave their guns, a gentleman's officers sitting in the elegant piano of fiddling with the keys of the jews, like mozart's music is accompanied by the way, like punctured beans gunfire as dance music is a god of death. the director satirizes the nazi's cruelty and perversion in a seemingly absurd way. when schindler and his wife rode up the hill and witnessed the beastly behavior of the german soldiers who were massacring innocent jews in the city, and when he saw the little girl in red running in a panic in the chaos of the crowd, he was enlightened by his inner goodness. he understood that, in this troubled world, even if earn more money can not buy the living human life, no human nature, even if there is no amount of wealth is just a walking corpse. there are plenty of details about schindler's transformation, such as the way he began to use his connections to get a lifeline for the jewish workers at the factory, and the way he treated the jewish women at his birthday party with full respect by passionately kissing them regardless of the eyes of others. the contrast with schindler is that of the nazi lieutenant, whose air of militarism and fascism cannot be concealed. even though he is elegant in front of outsiders, his loneliness is revealed when he meets helen, a jewish woman. he didn't kill helen. maybe he needed someone to comfort him. he may not really like helen, just want to have someone to express his feelings, but his inner racism is already in his there is a deep and indelible imprint on the soul. when schindler exhorted him to try to forgive others, i seemed to see a silver lining in him, and he seemed to shake a little at that moment in his own soul about what he believed in. when he caresses helen in the basement as a maid, he is infatuated with her beauty, but can not express his love for her, because he is a german nazi officer, his identity and beliefs make him helpless. his inner contradictions make him irate, fascist thoughts take over his soul again, he madly beats poor helen, and the director uses a parallel montage to contrast schindler's kindness to jews at the party with his perversion. this is perhaps the director of war warped human another way of saying. when wrapping film, schindler met german soldiers dug up the bodies of those in the concentration camps were slaughtered, the audience was surprised that the figure of a wearing a red dress sitting in a pile of dead bodies for cremation, the little girl's body already decay, schindler did not think of a child can't escape from fate, due to the particularity of color film, director of the little girl's figure used alone and local color, which have a certain impact on the vision. in the black and white of the body, the red is very dazzling, in this dark age, the child is buried by the ruthless killing, hope is destroyed in an instant. schindler understood the meaning of the list and what he was supposed to do. he didn't want to eat or sleep, he just wanted to save one more person. this reminds us of the businessman schindler at the beginning of the film, who only wanted to make money from the war but didn't care about the lives of the jewish people. it turns out that a person can change, and the jews let schindler complete a self-redemption. let him understand save a life, is to save the truth of the world. the film can be described as a memoir by spielberg himself, who is a jew. he deeply criticizes the distortion of human nature caused by the war, and at the same time praises the humanity that has not been lost in the war. see all 5 responses related issues;22 March 2020;8;['strong', 'interested', 'such', 'profound', 'great', 'such', 'human', 'black', 'white',

212;krational66;there was so much in this three-hour movie that really stuck in my head, in my bones. we've all seen a lot of movies about world war ii, but if we had to pick the most memorable, schindler's list would be on the list. this is a magnificent movie, in this movie, i can strongly feel the weight of life! to save one person is to save the world! in the whole film, the most striking thing for me is not the tragic scene of burning bodies, nor the panic and despair in the gas chamber, but a relatively ordinary morning. this morning, a group of poor jews were working like cattle and horses on the electricity grid in a german district. and the governor of the precinct, goff? he was standing bare-chested on the balcony outside his bedroom, hunched over the jews he commanded. in the bedroom behind him, his girl was fast asleep. after stretching his muscles, goff strolled back to the house and picked up a sniper rifle, aimed it at the slightly slower jews in the distance, and killed them all. he cocked his head, a cigarette in his mouth, and his expression was calm. each shot disturbed goff's sleep. she tried all she could to keep her ears out of the noise, but it failed, and she was miserable -- miserable because the noise disturbed her sleep. it was not an emergency, but part of their daily lives. the killing no longer had any excitement in their minds, and this unusual event was considered the norm. this, i feel, is a hundred times more evil than the killing itself. where there is war, there are heroes. life in the camp was as cheap as cattle, trampled on at will. the plight of the jews is deplorable, and the bitter cost of the war unbearable. human nature is confused in the war. as schindler said, war always highlights the ugly side of human nature. we also see the nazi soldiers' disregard for life and wanton killing of innocent polish jews. fortunately, we also see that the merciless nature of the war brings out the best in schindler. he was the representative of the cold - blooded capitalist who made a huge amount of money in the war with his clever brain and cheap labor. but he was a man of conscience, who saved the jews again and again and brought them to his refuge. at the end of the film, when i received the gold ring of surviving jews sent to him, on the hebrew: save a person, is to save a world, the collapse of mr schindler mood, since always thought i have done good justice success also lost to weak and frustration, he said, pointing to their own cars, said it can and goethe officers in 10 people, pointing to his own brooch, said that in 2 people, even more. he was in tears, complaining that he had not worked hard enough to make more money, and that he had been able to save just over 1,100 jews. that scene really moved me. before losing his fortune and going on the road to exile, mr. schindler finally fully showed his greatness and, i am sure, his great love for all innocent human beings. at that moment, i really want to cry. the truly great are never proud of their merits, but still review their shortcomings as a sin. in fact, mr. schindler was, as the ring aptly said, the brightest light of the darkest days. each name on schindler's list is the weight of life!;22 March 2020;8;['much', 'memorable', 'magnificent', 'whole', 'striking', 'tragic', 'ordinary', 'poor', 'german', 'asleep', 'slow', 'calm', 'miserable', 'miserable', 'daily', 'unusual', 'more', 'evil', 'cheap', 'deplorable', 'bitter', 'unbearable', 'human', 'ugly', 'human', 'innocent', 'polish', 'merciless', 'good', 'cold', 'blooded', 'huge', 'clever', 'cheap', 'good', 'weak', 'own', 'own', 'more', 'able', 'sure', 'great', 'innocent', 'human', 'great', 'proud', 'bright', 'dark'];0.1125968992248061

214;general-melchett;"schindler's list has been hailed as steven spielberg's best ever film, and is #6 on imdb's top 250. it won loads of awards, including seven academy awards. despite the fact that it is not quite an epic with its relatively low budget, it justifies its existence with great acting, directing, a very well-written script, rich characters, and authenticity that no other film has yet equalled. but unfortunately, it is marred with a slow pace, some pointless scenes, extremely unnecessary sex scenes and nudity and the lack of any real originality in the acting. no acting awards were won, but the most memorable performance was hammered home by ralph fiennes, who played amon goeth. his real villainy and spite made the film even colder. this film not only hammered home the true horrors of nazi regime, it also shows that there are good people in even the most villainous clans, and those good people end up being remembered for what they did. this is not a gory action flick like ""saving private ryan"" - there are only a few shootings in the whole three hours. but there is lots of blood when there is a death, and the complete unfairness of the killings make this film even more shocking and powerful. but the main problem of this film is that none of the characters really change. goeth does learn a lesson from schindler, who gives some wise words, but he is still a nazi through and through. schindler does get some inspiration on and off, but he never really deteriorates, and liam neeson really does not own the role 100%. the last minutes of black and white are reminiscent of many western films (you see my point - man rides into a village on horseback to liberate people, a huge crowd of people come over the horizon of a desert), and john williams' score is not used enough. however, mr. williams actually put some care and thought into his music, unlike in the jurassic park score of the same year, which was just full-on hollywood ham. on the whole, all of the characters in schindler's list do deliver good performances, unlike ""aeon flux"" in which every character was flat and dull. to mouth off about schindler's list is wrong - there is nothing duff about this film, and every second comes from the heart. though it isn't gripping, it will fascinate, and will take you back 60 years with ease. however, it is not quite perfect, and perhaps a teensy bit overrated. i may need to watch it again. but on the whole, schindler's list engaged, and worked perfectly as a film. however, i am still more with ""saving private ryan"" as spielberg's best war film. but may i make this clear - this is the most authentic film ever made, and must be seen. a stunning job! 9/10";11 October 2006;9;['good', 'ever', 'top', 'low', 'great', 'rich', 'other', 'slow', 'pointless', 'unnecessary', 'real', 'memorable', 'ralph', 'real', 'villainy', 'true', 'good', 'villainous', 'good', 'gory', 'private', 'few', 'whole', 'complete', 'shocking', 'powerful', 'main', 'wise', 'liam', 'last', 'black', 'white', 'reminiscent', 'many', 'western', 'huge', 'same', 'full', 'good', 'flat', 'dull', 'wrong', 'duff', 'perfect', 'overrated', 'private', 'good', 'clear', 'authentic', 'stunning'];0.1793650793650793

216;drunken_munki;the black and white film was a poor choice that eliminated the potential for any visual mastery since spielberg isn't very good with black and white filming. there simply isn't any beautiful imagery or camera work in this film, a lot of intense set pieces (luggage stacked up, etc) but the camera glides by real quick in a hurry. it's a strange choice not to loom over the set a little longer, considering it is a 3 hour long picture. in the end it is very boring. the first hurdle is the acting level, leem neeson just isn't very good. then this is emphasized by the poor accent from ralph finnes, the conversations between the two come across very poorly rehearsed and amateurish. what echoes the filming quality and acting quality is nearly all the scenes with extras, all seeming to be amateurs and not actors with any chops at all. i saw straight through it all, in some scenes the extras are smiling. this is supposed two be the persecution of the jewish people from the nazis... why the heck are people smiling without any context? also if they are not smiling they are just normal faced, not distressed, angry, confused, in pain or otherwise. this is mirrored by the one dimensional antagonist, who spends nearly every second on film shooting random jews. it is extremely contrived and i don't believe a single frame of it. this is poorly researched crap made into popcorn material for the sake of pulling emotional strings. well, it didn't work on me. if you want to see some real mastery and horror shown in this topic then i recommend 'conspiracy', a hbo for tv movie on a secret meeting that pushes forward the plans for the death trains and concentration death camps... that will blow you away. failing this, i would recommend band of brothers, a ten part mini series that covers american soldiers going to the front lines in ww2. i give this a 5/10 as an average film. usually this rating and below i give to films i would never watch again, including this one.;25 August 2020;5;['black', 'white', 'poor', 'visual', 'good', 'black', 'white', 'beautiful', 'intense', 'quick', 'strange', 'little', 'long', 'boring', 'first', 'good', 'poor', 'ralph', 'amateurish', 'acting', 'jewish', 'normal', 'distressed', 'angry', 'dimensional', 'random', 'contrived', 'single', 'emotional', 'real', 'secret', 'mini', 'american', 'front', 'average'];-0.0675492610837438

220;BadgerStorm4345;schindler's list has a narrative that centers around the holocaust and oskar schindler's story. this movie is more haunting than any slasher horror movie for many reasons. for one, the music is somber and builds up utter hopelessness or dread, depending on what fits the scene. the second reason is that this has a real world basis and there are millions of people who actually died in our world, only a fraction of the horror can be shown through a movie, but there's no film that does it better. the third reason is that there is nothing special about the villains of this movie, they were real people with no special gifts, they just had their rage controlled by a mad man who directed their rage to kill millions of people through war and genocide. the nazis are normal people, which fills you with much more dread than anything else. schindler's list is an absolute masterpiece but i can only recommend someone watches this once, i hated watching this movie.;26 July 2020;10;['many', 'somber', 'utter', 'second', 'real', 'third', 'special', 'real', 'special', 'mad', 'normal', 'more', 'absolute'];0.1617857142857142
221;rhinocerosfive-1;"perhaps i should be shot, but i think four minutes of ""springtime for hitler"" is a more ingenious and powerful argument against anti-semitism than four hours of ""shoah."" many jews attribute the resilience of their culture to a capacity for laughter in the face of catastrophe. as saul bellow said, ""oppressed people tend to be witty."" pogroms didn't start with hitler; by the time the spanish inquisition burned a hundred thousand jews, the story of jewish oppression already could fill many volumes. many peoples once multitudinous have perished from the earth: there are no carthaginians left. there are no more thracians to speak of. the celts live only in musical traditions and some old literature, having been subsumed by their conquerors. their gods are dead, and their languages, or nearly so. but the jews thrive on. something kept hope alive under stalin, under isabella, under the caesars. a sense of humor is a great virtue, not to be undervalued. but in order to make sure i appreciate the horror of the events portrayed, this movie cheats me of a glimpse at real life. the situations don't live as they might, because all the time i'm being flogged with message. there is no even partially redeemable nazi in this movie, and schindler's own late-stage change of heart is presented with such suddenness that the movie veers into melodrama. and even melodrama need not be propaganda; minnelli and ray always left us with choices. but ""schindler"" must be classified as propaganda because it lacks the truth of even gallows humor, which by many reports existed in great abundance in the ghettos and even in the death camps. the films of bunuel and altman are often political but rarely propagandist. the films of michael bay and marcus nispel are always propagandist and not always political, though they are of course always bad. so propaganda need not be political, and politics need not be propaganda. this shouldn't need saying, but in the modern age of american politics, it's worth remembering. i wish steven spielberg remembered it. one can define propaganda objectively as a sort of forced perspective, a narrow range of potential reactions for the viewer. propaganda is the use of art to persuade. it turns art into an expository essay. propaganda is therefore by definition a limited form, limited by its very agenda. the tools of propaganda become less necessary the more inherently obvious the subject matter; the mass extermination of a people would seem to me to fit this category. so i think the style of this movie is unfortunately maudlin, an overkill on the negative. i am not heartless; i hate hate as much as anybody, and i celebrate jews and all humans as valuable and not for burning. but is there no other way to express a political point than to make me cry for three hours? the fact is that film as a medium lends itself to propaganda. there is a decision made about every angle; literally, the perspective is chosen for the viewer. this is not the case with other arts, with musical performance, acting, writing, sculpture; but the more visual the medium, the greater its tendency to make statements and the less its potential for ambiguity. it takes a lot of skill to manage a visual art form into something with real depth, into a question rather than an answer. you can make propaganda about love, like ""love story"" or ""english patient""; you can make propaganda out of character, like ""patton"" or ""lawrence of arabia."" the easiest and most common sorts of propaganda are flag-waving and hate-mongering - what's found in state of the union addresses and election campaign ads. at its best, propaganda can remind us of our values, of our responsibilities, of our mythologies and potentials; and so it can be a great good. at its worst, propaganda may contain any of the faults of any medium - it may be bland, dull, predictable. when it is these things, it is not very persuasive, and so it fails at its main intent. in this light, ""schindler's list"" is maybe the second-best type of propaganda. it has real emotion, a compelling story, myriad technical virtues; it leaves me with no choice but to agree with it, but of course i agree with it already insofar as genocide is not a force for good. the movie moves me to an extent. but it lacks comedy, the propagandist's most effective tool; and so when it pretends to explore a range of humanity, it tells a half-truth. liam neeson plays an excellent cad, and ralph fiennes' raptor beak was never used to more terrifying effect. (it is among the many faults of the ""harry potter"" movies that they cut off his nose.) but i prefer ""the pianist"" as a portrait of nazi-occupied poland. aside from possessing greater artistic powers than spielberg, roman polanski has an immensely deeper capacity for human truth. he does not preach, and he is not strident, and he is not sentimental. and he allows adrien brody to make me laugh occasionally, not as often as he makes me cry but sometimes. shakespeare's trick of contrasting tragedy with comedy is not simply effective storytelling; it is a view to a more realized universe. ""jaws"" has it. ""e.t."" has it. but spielberg apparently felt that to be funny about the holocaust would be in bad taste. as far as propagandist filmmakers go, i'll take charlie chaplin or paul verhoeven. they are at least funny; the pill of ""great dictator"" or ""starship troopers"" goes down more easily, more persuasively, therefore more effectively, than the pill of ""schindler"" or ""private ryan.""";19 November 2007;7;['ingenious', 'powerful', 'semitism', 'many', 'witty', 'spanish', 'jewish', 'many', 'many', 'multitudinous', 'more', 'musical', 'old', 'dead', 'alive', 'great', 'sure', 'real', 'redeemable', 'own', 'late', 'such', 'many', 'great', 'political', 'propagandist', 'political', 'bad', 'political', 'modern', 'american', 'worth', 'narrow', 'potential', 'expository', 'limited', 'very', 'necessary', 'obvious', 'subject', 'mass', 'maudlin', 'negative', 'heartless', 'valuable', 'other', 'political', 'other', 'musical', 'visual', 'great', 'visual', 'real', 'english', 'patton', 'easy', 'common', 'good', 'great', 'bad', 'bland', 'dull', 'predictable', 'persuasive', 'main', 'good', 'real', 'compelling', 'myriad', 'technical', 'effective', 'half', 'excellent', 'ralph', 'terrifying', 'many', 'great', 'artistic', 'deep', 'human', 'strident', 'sentimental', 'effective', 'funny', 'bad', 'least', 'funny', 'great', 'private'];0.1433366402116402

224;kyle-cruse;"currently hailed as one of the top ten films of all time, ""schindler's list"" remains an amazing story depicting the persecution of the jews during the holocaust. if you ask me, the film is not truly about the jews themselves. for me, the main part of this film deals with the man oskar schindler (liam neeson, in what is possibly his best role) and the life change he endures by deciding to help out the jews. he begins as a selfish man using the jews to work for him so he can make a profit. as a result, he pays to save the jews from hitler's persecution so he can use them to work for him instead. a large number of jews end up on his list (the list of the title) and come to work for him. by the end, however, he sees what he has done for them and wishes he had been less selfish and could have spent more of his money (which he now sees as worthless) to save the lives of more of the jews. the scene in which he realizes this is my personal favorite scene of the film. this is where the movie is at. it makes us all wish we could do more to help. at over three hours long, this film can prove to be a bit long and slow at times, which is really the only reason i cannot call it perfect. nevertheless, everything about the movie is perfectly well done. the depictions are very realistic and the acting is brilliant. spielberg pulls it off once again. hard to say if this should be the best picture of 1993, though.

227;BadWebDiver;"i rank this as the best drama story ever. when it got released, i was chatting with a co-worker in the staff room who said: ""i know i should see this movie, but i don't think i could handle sitting through two hours of watching people suffer in the concentration camps."" and i totally agreed. if only we'd realized how great this film tells its story. i think a scene that best demonstrates this film is the train rescue scene. i can just imagine a lesser production putting a heavy-handed sentimental moralistic sob speech right in the middle of it (which would have turned oskar into a very quick martyr for sure). instead, the characters are trying to cope with the immediate concerns of the situation. they're almost in a state of self-denial about the implications of what's going on; and it's left to the unspoken sequence at the end to bring home the emotional impact. as alfred hitchcock said: ""a good filmmaker doesn't tell you something, he shows you something"". another aspect that makes this film work, and one i don't think gets acknowledged too much, is it's effective use of dark humor. examples include the chicken thief scene, and oskar negotiating with the aucshwitz commandant. (i also reckon the sequence where goeth tries out oskar's ""benevolence is power"" idea, and decides it doesn't work is humorous - but that may be just me!). this film almost has the personality of a hogan's heroes episode - and i mean that as a sincere complement. it reminds me of a yiddish joke i heard about a nazi sympathizer and a jewish businessman who bump into each other on a street corner at the start of ww2. the nazi sympathizer snaps ""schweinhund!!!' and stalks off in a huff. the jewish businessman brushes himself off, tips his hat, and murmurs; ""and **i'm** goldberg."" but the thing that really makes this film work is the fact that is plays on the viewer's expectations. the film is made for people who have seen ww2 documentaries, and think they know what happened. the prime example is the shower scene (which i think is more psychological than psycho). this film works because it doesn't preach at you, it plays the situations and asks you to respond to them. and i think that's the secret of great storytelling.";7 March 2002;10;['good', 'great', 'good', 'less', 'heavy', 'handed', 'sentimental', 'moralistic', 'quick', 'sure', 'immediate', 'unspoken', 'emotional', 'alfred', 'good', 'much', 'effective', 'dark', 'humorous', 'sincere', 'yiddish', 'jewish', 'other', 'jewish', 'prime', 'shower', 'psychological', 'great'];0.2758771929824561

230;maximkong;an epic true statement about probably the only member of the nazi party that saved the victims behind one of the most atrocious massacre in history...and surprisingly, despite the heart-wrenching details and the inhumane deeds being presented on-screen, it gave off quite an overall positive impact too. however, it failed to be included into my top list. considering the weight of the subject matter, i expected a lot more from this movie. i believe the movie could have investigated things deeper and further given the amount of time allocated to this movie. but it didn't, and some of the scenes behave in a way that i think it was kind of sugarcoated, or over-dramatized, that sometimes i wonder whether the scenes meant to emulate the harsh truth of war did serve their purpose. i am not saying the atrocities should have been made more gory - it doesn't need to - all i am asking and expecting is to do more justice to viewers who are relying on this movie to understand what has happened in a the full extent of this historical chapter.;25 November 2012;5;['epic', 'true', 'only', 'atrocious', 'inhumane', 'overall', 'positive', 'top', 'subject', 'more', 'sugarcoated', 'harsh', 'more', 'more', 'full', 'historical'];0.0707070707070707
231;Come-and-Review;"the first time i've seen it, schindler's list didn't give me much of an impression. it was horrific, black and white, and i was 15. now, after i got myself quite a cinematographic culture, feeling the urge to identify spieblerg's masterpiece, i came back to this movie. i knew it was rated as one of the best films generally, ever, but when i took a look at the reviews, i became really worried. most of the 1/10 ratings bring reasonless motivations for this film's criticism. the main points of criticism that i saw are the following: 1) it manipulates facts; 2) presents a too distinct line between good jews and evil nazis; 3) too emotional; 4) money grab; 5) ""holocaust is bad, we already knew it"" (and this is an almost exact quote); 1) the claims for this point of criticism are that it portrays a positive figure of oskar schindler, exaggerates several aspects of the holocaust, and portrays essentially bad nazis (we to this latter point in 2)); let's get this straight: unlike some reviewers claim, oskar schindler didn't end up as an enriched industrialist, as some reviewers wrongly claim. in other words, he didn't earn off the holocaust anything. on the contrary, he spent his entire fortune on bribes and corruption acts in order to aid his jewish workers. he even had to escape to argentina, as many nazi officers did after wwii. as for the claims of overly dramatisation, that is certainly an aspect of the film. there are a few scenes which are not accurate (e.g. the shower scene - in real life, jews didn't fear the gas chamber as they where purposely misinformed). generally, though, i didn't see that much of an overly dramatization. most of the times, the film presented simply factual events. jews were in fact killed and persecuted, there's nothing overly dramatized. concentration camps where truly such bloody places as seen in the film. instead, maybe it even downgraded violence quite a lot., still being incredibly bloody as a film. 2) good jews vs. bad nazis; i remember hans landa's monologue from the beginning of inglorious basterds, which centered on jews being rats in the sense that they're generally a population that could figure out a solution easily. do not get me wrong here (obviously landa stereotypes this immensely), but this is portrayed often, mainly in the first portion of the film. jews going to the synagogue to buy and sell instead of praying, some jews that join the police force and essentially collaborate with the nazis, and some jews fight each other when hiding away during the ghetto persecution scene. i clearly would not say that all jews are good nor that all german soldiers are bad, but that shouldn't be a matter to be portrayed in a holocaust film. to see an avid jew, go watch ""a christmas carol"". as for ""bad nazis"", i'd like to clear out again what is nazional-socialism. it was an extremist, right-wing movement that enhanced, in this case, germany's national identity and superiority on the base of racial distinction, and urged violence on anyone that would not be member of the ""superior"" race. this movement, along with fascism, attracted a great deal of fanatics. i'd like to suggest the view of ""novecento"", which similarly depicts the rise of fascism in italy and its ruthless cruelty, carried on by it he insane and violent individuals which joined the party in the early twenties. i know that one movie depicted a nazi soldier's moral division during wwii, called ""onore e lealta"", which has low reviews for the same reason that prevents this film from portraying ""good"" nazis: it is kind of dangerous, and can easily turn in a glorification of nazis. nonetheless, most of the cruelty is carried through a notorious war criminal, amon goeth. 3) spielberg is of jewish origins. as a filmmaker, he's considered this story very personal. moreover, he is notorious for being emotional in his serious films. 4) it is well known that spielberg chose to renounce for his fee as he considered it ""blood money"". of course studios have to do a profit of their movies, but film is still a form of art. movie makers of spielberg's caliber do films without a simple capitalistic view of making money, but with the purpose of making an art work. schindler's list is not a fancy action blockbuster, if nothing else, its black and white colouring identifies it as an art film. add the fact the spielberg felt personal about this story, and you'll realise how empty this claim is. 5) this film was released in 1993; i personally don't know many outstanding holocaust films from before 1993 (certainly a lot from after 1993), or if there were, they certainly weren't as bold as this one. a black and white film about a crude subject that keeps the viewer's attention for 3 hours and 15 minutes. think about it. i personally believe that, unlike other films (this includes my favourite holocaust film, son of saul), gives a such wide view on the holocaust. this film shows most of the aspects of the holocaust, some overrdramatised, but nonetheless represented. it is really stupid to see this movie as unnecessary. conclusively, i'd like to point out that 6 million jews died due to the holocaust. the only bigger genocide i know of is that of the native americans, 18 million only in northen america. seeing so many 1/10 reviews that base their claims on this being basically jewish propaganda is worrying, especially considering the rise of right-wing ideologies that happened in the latter years. are we forgetting history? i hope not. and, in case that's the truth, it's films like schindler's list that remind us of that.";24 September 2017;9;['first', 'much', 'horrific', 'black', 'white', 'good', 'worried', 'most', 'main', 'distinct', 'good', 'evil', 'emotional', 'bad', 'exact', 'positive', 'several', 'bad', 'latter', 'enriched', 'other', 'entire', 'jewish', 'many', 'overly', 'few', 'accurate', 'shower', 'real', 'much', 'overly', 'most', 'factual', 'such', 'bloody', 'bloody', 'good', 'bad', 'inglorious', 'wrong', 'first', 'other', 'ghetto', 'good', 'german', 'bad', 'avid', 'bad', 'nazional', 'right', 'national', 'racial', 'superior', 'great', 'ruthless', 'insane', 'violent', 'early', 'moral', 'onore', 'low', 'same', 'good', 'dangerous', 'most', 'notorious', 'jewish', 'personal', 'notorious', 'emotional', 'serious', 'simple', 'capitalistic', 'fancy', 'black', 'white', 'personal', 'empty', 'many', 'outstanding', 'bold', 'black', 'white', 'crude', 'other', 'favourite', 'such', 'wide', 'most', 'overrdramatised', 'stupid', 'unnecessary', 'big', 'native', 'many', 'jewish', 'right', 'latter'];-0.0273978186315848

236;sandnair87;"in schindler's list, we see images that we never thought we would ever see in a non-documentary film. it will kick you in the stomach and not stop until you can't take anymore. it will twist your finger and force you to open your eyes and take in things you would hope to never see in your whole life. the movie follows the story of oskar schindler, an entrepreneur who exploits krakow jews, only to later become their friend and redeemer. he keeps thousands of them in his factory and out of the camps while challenging and manipulating the venomous s.s. officer amon goeth with the help of his jewish accountant itzhak stern. during its 195 minutes runtime, schindler undergoes a subtle transformation, from a self-indulgent exploiter of slave labor to savior with a mission and finally to a hero in hiding. shot entirely in black and white, schindler's list is certainly the most intense and uncompromising depiction of the nazi horror ever to appear in a fiction film. steven spielberg directs this poignant drama with an incredible amount of uplifting hope, once again underlining the undeniable splendor of his craft. the detached reticence with which spielberg captures the nazis' savagery only adds to that effect. he does not use one trite shot, one forced tear-jerking assemblage. tears are evoked, but honorably! initially, the absence of color (with the exception of one haunting, recurring figure) may seem to spare us the gore. but it has the opposite effect: when a guard shoots a kneeling man in the back of the head, the black blood that oozes out is even more unsettling. headlining the magnificent cast is the hitherto underrated liam neeson who inhabits schindler with such authority that you cannot envisage any other actor do justice to this 'role of a lifetime'. ralph fiennes is simultaneously terrifying and fascinating as the s.s. officer amon goeth. watch him muse to his jewish mistress ""i realize that you are not a person in the strictest sense of the word"" and you will be convinced how fiennes was clearly robbed off his oscar. the other key part is schindler's jewish accountant, played with self-effacing brilliance by ben kingsley, who lends the movie just the right amount of warmth. marked by a brilliant screenplay and an attitude toward the traumatic subject matter that is both passionately felt and impressively restrained, this is the film to win over spielberg skeptics.";18 March 2015;10;['non', 'documentary', 'whole', 'venomous', 'jewish', 'subtle', 'indulgent', 'black', 'white', 'intense', 'poignant', 'incredible', 'uplifting', 'undeniable', 'detached', 'trite', 'opposite', 'kneeling', 'black', 'unsettling', 'magnificent', 'such', 'other', 'ralph', 'fascinating', 'jewish', 'strict', 'other', 'key', 'jewish', 'right', 'brilliant', 'traumatic'];0.1258658008658008
237;dkncd;"""schindler's list"" is steven spielberg's acclaimed film that explores the life of oskar schindler, a german industrialist who saved almost 1,200 jews during the holocaust through his actions. spielberg appropriately decided to make the film in black and white, which gives the film a documentary-like quality. it also allowed him to make effective use of occasional glimpses of color. john williams again proves his ability to come up with an appropriate soundtrack for any type of film. spielberg also shows in a time of overwrought special effects that effects can be used subtlety to great effect, such as the zoomed out shot of a building on which windows light up to indicate nazi gunfire and killings. liam neeson is perfect as oskar schindler. schindler is initially a war profiteer who is eventually moved to use his fortune and influence to shield jews from the holocaust. interestingly the character was given an enigmatic quality and generally isn't explicit about his perceptions for a lot of the film. to the film's credit, it doesn't suppress the womanizing aspect of schindler's character. ben kingsley is also excellent in a subtle performance as schindler's invaluable accountant and assistant, itzhak stern. ralph fiennes also gives a great and frightening performance as the unstable and insecure megalomaniac amon goeth. this film is long and sad, but absorbing at the same time such that it is never tedious during its length of over three hours. the film gains intensity from the graphic depictions of nazi violence and the lingering sense that jews can be killed at any time. it also shows us how the courage of one individual can have an important impact. schindler laments not having saved more people, but the film effectively makes it clear that almost 1,200 people is an important number.";1 December 2007;10;['acclaimed', 'german', 'black', 'white', 'like', 'effective', 'occasional', 'appropriate', 'overwrought', 'special', 'great', 'such', 'perfect', 'enigmatic', 'explicit', 'excellent', 'subtle', 'invaluable', 'ralph', 'great', 'frightening', 'unstable', 'insecure', 'long', 'sad', 'same', 'such', 'tedious', 'graphic', 'important', 'more', 'clear', 'important'];0.1541208791208791

243;Jonathon_Natsis;"schindler's list is the kind of once-in-a-generation film that comes along and earns truly universal acclaim. the tale of oskar schindler, a member of the nazi party who saves well over one thousand jews during the holocaust through his cunning and selflessness, is a timeless exhibition of exactly why the very medium of filmmaking was invented. approaching its 20th anniversary, universal sony has converted the original film into high-definition, allowing a new generation to experience its soaring story and visceral intensity. schindler (liam neeson) is a man who considers himself a businessman first and a nazi second. in the throes of wwii, he sees opportunity in hiring jewish pows to work in his enamel factory. with the help of trustworthy accountant itzhak stern (ben kingsley), he develops a godly reputation among the jews despite originally being apathetic to their struggles. naturally, his actions raise the curiosity of some high-ranking german officers, including the sadistic amon goeth (ralph fiennes). the legacy of schindler's list stands tall two decades after its theatrical release. the film took home seven oscars at the 1994 academy awards, including best picture, director and adapted screenplay, while neeson and fiennes were bested in the acting categories by tom hanks (philadelphia) and tommy lee jones (the fugitive) respectively. today, schindler and goeth are considered arguably the finest moments of either man's distinguished career. the blu-ray conversion is virtually faultless at every turn. it is one thing to infuse a visual sense of wonder to a screen already populated by giant sharks, prehistoric beasts or cuddly other-worlders; it is quite another to invoke that same awe to a sombre tale filmed in monochrome, but that is precisely what has been achieved with this restoration. the update beautifully renders some of the most harrowing shots ever put to celluloid, including the massacre set to bach and the first glimpse of auschwitz; its steaming, monstrous pillars resembling a most ironic monolith of human evolution. the famous girl in red- for many, the emotive highlight of the film- is given new and ironic life through touched-up footage keeping her dress from fading into its surroundings, as was the case with the original negative. for such a powerful piece of cinema, the mastery of spielberg's direction is his ability to peel back as opposed to going for the jugular too early or too often. the film expertly traverses a near-impossible pitfall of melodrama. as he did with more contemporary histo-drama lincoln, spielberg's ability to blend the emotionally challenging and the humanistic is unmatched, in what remains not only his most personal project, but perhaps the most personal film of any a-list director ever. the end result is still a depressing and, at times, highly disturbing piece of art, but one that concurrently remains an absorbing character study of the highest order. schindler is not a wholeheartedly compassionate man; for him, it's all about the benjamins- or in this case, the reichsmarks- and he is offended- nay, enraged- that his workers would have the audacity to call his factory a 'haven', until his perspective on the war is forever changed. likewise, goeth, the man who kills jews from his balcony with the same indifference as a man reading the morning paper, is the same one that secretly lusts after his jewish maid. kingsley's stern, then, just may be the most emotionally integral character, acting as the catalyst for schindler's eventual change of heart while playing the role of the unshakeable moral compass and most accessible window for the audience into the lives of those persecuted. it is this story of flawed good versus flawed evil that humanises these once mythical creatures. appropriately, it isn't until the final half-hour that the immensity of their actions are realised in one of the most memorable, heartfelt endings of all time, in which spielberg breaks every rule of conventional narrative filmmaking at once in order to pay his final respects. the blu-ray comes complete with a series of special features, including voices from the list, a documentary featuring testimonies from some of the 'schindler jews' who survived the holocaust, as well as a story on spielberg's usc shoah foundation. the intentions of universal are salient here, as their features keep in line with the director's original intent to minimise publicity or self-servitude, to the point where he even refused payment for his work, citing 'blood money' as the deterrent. however, trivia buffs interested in some of the more allegorical tidbits of production (including the alleviation of on-set depression through spielberg's screenings of seinfeld and robin williams sketches, and the time a survivor trembled with terror at her first sight of fiennes because he reminded her too much of the real goeth) may be satiated by a 16-page companion booklet, featuring behind- the-scenes information on the incredible stories around an incredible composition. *there's nothing i love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. so drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review. if you're looking for a writer for your movie website or other publication, i'd also love to hear from you.*";13 March 2013;9;['universal', 'timeless', 'universal', 'original', 'high', 'new', 'visceral', 'jewish', 'trustworthy', 'godly', 'apathetic', 'german', 'sadistic', 'ralph', 'tall', 'theatrical', 'good', 'adapted', 'neeson', 'fine', 'distinguished', 'faultless', 'visual', 'giant', 'prehistoric', 'cuddly', 'other', 'same', 'sombre', 'harrowing', 'first', 'monstrous', 'ironic', 'human', 'famous', 'many', 'emotive', 'new', 'ironic', 'original', 'powerful', 'jugular', 'impossible', 'more', 'contemporary', 'challenging', 'unmatched', 'personal', 'personal', 'depressing', 'disturbing', 'high', 'compassionate', 'same', 'same', 'jewish', 'integral', 'eventual', 'unshakeable', 'moral', 'accessible', 'flawed', 'good', 'flawed', 'mythical', 'final', 'half', 'memorable', 'heartfelt', 'conventional', 'final', 'complete', 'special', 'universal', 'salient', 'original', 'servitude', 'trivia', 'interested', 'allegorical', 'first', 'much', 'real', 'incredible', 'incredible', 'more', 'good', 'bad', 'other'];0.1450341184239489

252;Dodger-9;in the same week that et opened in america, steven spielberg read thomas keneally's schindler's ark, the book based on the true story of one man who rescued more than 1,000 jews from under the noses of the nazis. intrigued by the subject, the film rights were snapped up and the result was the most talked about movie of the nineties. schindler's list rarely fails to stir the emotions. as with all of the cast - especially ben kingsley and ralph fiennes - liam neeson gives the performance of a lifetime as the suave businessman oskar schindler, spurred on by the brief that as many people as possible should see the movie - and not just from a commercial point of view, as neeson recalled at the time of release. 'i remember steven saying 'don't take this wrong, but i want everyone in the world to see this film,' and i knew exactly what he meant.' it goes without saying that the holocaust was such an horrific event that any director would have to feel mature enough to tell their story without letting sentiment get in the way. so, 10 years after he first read the book, the master movie-maker was ready to tackle the most important film of his career. he had a self-confessed reluctance to confront the holocaust and his own jewishness as a subject. following his more 'human' dramas such as the color purple and empire of the sun, the project was still very much in his mind, but his own involvement would be purely on a production level. after offering it to fellow film directors martin scorsese and sydney pollack, they both turned it down and hollywood's favourite son was left to condense the novel into a three-hour black and white movie. having successfully fleshed out many of his childhood fantasies and with events in the balkans at the time mirroring those of fifty years earlier, 1993 was exactly the right time to address the matter. so keen was spielberg to make the film, he left the hawaiian set of jurassic park before the film's completion and flew to poland to start filming. old friend george lucas was left to edit the dinosaur blockbuster while steven watched the footage on descrambled satellite transmissions. both films went on to achieve widespread acclaim, for different reasons. if jp was the sort of a movie an overexcited child would make, then sl was that of a seasoned film-maker at ease with his craft and intent on delivering something extremely adult. schindler's list received 12 oscar nominations, including the elusive best director gong which steven eventually picked up from an academy that had ignored many of his movies on the grounds that he had been rewarded enough. tackling a drama in which six million people ended up dead was not for the novice film-maker - it was for the brave of heart and a director that could tell such a stark tale without alienating his audience from the outset. indeed, only claude lanzmann had delivered anything that came close with his epic film shoah, a nine and a half hour documentary about the holocaust which wowed the critics in 1985. for his movie, spielberg was blessed with a polished screenplay by steve zaillian, a young writer who went on to direct his own movies such as the john travolta vehicle, a civil action, and who has just spruced up the dialogue for silence of the lambs sequel, hannibal. needless to say, this not the sort of movie you curl up with on a saturday night with a box of chocs and a six pack. it's a harrowing film which has lost none of its power either on the small screen or in the eight years since its release.;16 January 2001;10;['same', 'true', 'more', 'ralph', 'liam', 'many', 'possible', 'commercial', 'horrific', 'mature', 'ready', 'important', 'own', 'more', 'human', 'such', 'own', 'fellow', 'favourite', 'black', 'white', 'many', 'right', 'keen', 'hawaiian', 'jurassic', 'old', 'widespread', 'different', 'seasoned', 'elusive', 'good', 'many', 'dead', 'novice', 'stark', 'epic', 'half', 'polished', 'young', 'own', 'such', 'civil', 'hannibal', 'needless', 'harrowing', 'small'];0.1334054834054833
253;FilmSnobby;"i mean, has enough time passed? or has the release of *schindler's list* on dvd fueled a new hushed awe towards the picture? spielberg's critic-proof holocaust film has several problems, the biggest of which is the way it turns a horrible real-life tragedy into a three-hanky melodrama. i continue to maintain that the holocaust is generally unfilmable, in terms of what we might call a standard movie. generally unfilmable, but not inevitably unfilmable. off the top of my head, i can recommend two recent films on this subject: francesco rosi's *the truce*, and costa-gavras' *amen"". both films approach this material with far more nuance than spielberg's film, which, i repeat, is weepy melodrama. (and as such, treads a fine line between reverence and tastelessness.) for that matter, polanski's *the pianist* gives us a more unique approach than what we get here, which is a movie that features a hero whom your average american multiplex popcorn-tub-muncher can easily identify with: a gregarious capitalist named oskar schindler (liam neeson) who, despite all the war-profiteering (read: ""initiative""), turns out to have a heart of gold. or marshmallow mush. please don't bother pointing out that this is a ""true story"": those who've read the actual book by thomas kenneally on which the movie is based will be rather shocked by the movie's willingness to sacrifice verisimilitude for ""dramatic license"". the biggest example of this is the ""villain"" of the piece, ss-kommandant amon goeth (ralph fiennes in a career-making performance). the screenplay ladles all sorts of freudian syrup over this character, meaning: he's crazy as a loon. so much for the ""banality of evil"": instead, we get, via fiennes' method-y performance, a study in mere neurosis instead of a rigorous examination of the murderous pathology that's inherent in humanity. spielberg can't resist having herr goeth develop a crush on one of his jewish housemaids, and we get the requisite ""hath not a jew eyes"" speech, delivered with what is supposed to be irony by fiennes. then he beats the crap out of her. change the plot particulars, and you've got your standard ""lifetime channel"" movie about an abusive husband. don't get me wrong, the film is not a total waste of time: even melodrama has cumulative virtues, and many of the scenes in *schindler's list* are quite affecting, particularly the very last sequence in which the surviving ""schindler jews"" appear (in color), accompanied by the actors who portrayed them. they pay tribute to schindler by laying stones on his grave. moving stuff. ben kingsley, who portrays the worry-wart itzhak stern, must also receive special mention. and spielberg's technical mastery is never open to question: this is one beautifully mounted film, impeccably photographed. the set-design, which is called upon to perform the daunting task of replicating nazi labor camps and so forth, is beyond reproach. proving that he's still the same guy who directed *jaws*, spielberg is able to send chills up our spines when a train full of jewish women & girls is accidentally routed to auschwitz: it's a night-scene, replete with a light-tower that approximates a beacon from hell. but, all-in-all, the movie remains an elementary approach to the holocaust genre. it's tailor-made for desultory viewings by 12th-graders: ""hey mom, we learned about the holocaust in class today."" nothing wrong with that, but aren't the kids better served by a factual documentary about this subject, rather than an oscar-baited exercise in self-importance? you decide.";2 March 2004;3;['enough', 'new', 'several', 'big', 'horrible', 'real', 'hanky', 'unfilmable', 'standard', 'unfilmable', 'unfilmable', 'recent', 'francesco', 'more', 'weepy', 'such', 'fine', 'unique', 'average', 'american', 'gregarious', 'true', 'actual', 'dramatic', 'big', 'ralph', 'freudian', 'crazy', 'mere', 'rigorous', 'murderous', 'inherent', 'jewish', 'requisite', 'standard', 'abusive', 'wrong', 'total', 'cumulative', 'many', 'last', 'special', 'technical', 'open', 'daunting', 'same', 'able', 'full', 'jewish', 'replete', 'elementary', 'desultory', 'wrong', 'factual'];0.0086239950525664

""the shower scene"" wants viewers to think ""some lived because of a misrouted train."" this one scene sugar-coats the horror of the death camps, and hurts what otherwise is so close to a perfect film. but i will tell you about a film that is just as good as schindler's list, even better, because nothing is sugar-coated. it is the nbc mini-series from the late 70's, holocaust. that picture is still the best holocaust film ever made. schindler's list could have been just as good as holocaust. unfortunately, the fictional shower scene hurts this otherwise landmark film.

264;Rawal_Afzal;before i proceed to add any comments on the film, i must simply salute to this great human-being. compassion and love is the most natural state of us humans, any other emotions of hatred, rage and violence are an alteration of our very being and existence. it is most commendable of mr. schindler to have stuck to his natural state amidst all the violence and the preaching of extreme hatred for jews, amidst a world war to put it best. it is a perception that rich people care the least about the poor and the suffering, but above all is god almighty's unbeatable law of descending good people amongst bad people, and vice versa, and here he descended an angel in the form of a rich business, the best option, for the jews who'd been suffering hopelessly. i smiled when he said to his secretary that if the german army becomes suspicious of the incompetent works done in his factory he'd buy ammunition and weapons from some other factory and then sell it to the army to keep things in control. a masterminded person! it was so touching and heartening to see him instead of feeling satisfied at his achievement or taking pride in it, he chose to cry and curse himself for having not saved even more lives and for not having used earlier opportunities to take this path. he cursed his rich lifestyle and the expensive things he bought for himself instead of spending even more money to save even more lives. truly a sign of a great human-being who chose to reflect on his flaws instead of the good works he did, which itself was a huge, huge risk that could've cost him not only his status, business and money but also life if the army could've got even a minor sniff of it. on the film, since it was based on true events i can't really find faults and point to things they could've done differently. so no issues with it. however, two things annoyed me a bit, the first of which being it being in black and white. it prevented me from getting a good feel of the atmosphere, the surroundings and the whole drama. i felt as if i was looking at the screen from a place very far. so this wasn't a smart move on spielberg's part in my view. by the way, i mean no disrespect to the films of years ago which were in black and white anyway. they'd to be shot that way and you as a viewer understood the limitation of the film-maker, but that can't be said of a film released in 1993. secondly, although i fully admit that the film had to be full in every detail and very spread out with explanatory scenes, but still feel it could've been shortened at least by 20 minutes. three hours is just way to long for a film of which its entertainment value is its least strength.in general, films on suffering and pain shouldn't be that long, never. since such films are low on entertainment, the aim should be to make the viewer stayed focused throughout, and if the film turns out to be as long as three hours then somewhere in the middle of it you'll find the viewers scratching their head, looking left and right, talking to others in order to re-find their focus after a few minutes break. in short, such films should be shorter in length.;13 July 2016;8;['great', 'natural', 'other', 'commendable', 'natural', 'extreme', 'rich', 'least', 'poor', 'unbeatable', 'good', 'bad', 'rich', 'good', 'german', 'suspicious', 'incompetent', 'other', 'touching', 'satisfied', 'more', 'early', 'rich', 'expensive', 'more', 'more', 'great', 'good', 'huge', 'huge', 'minor', 'true', 'first', 'black', 'white', 'good', 'whole', 'smart', 'black', 'white', 'full', 'explanatory', 'least', 'long', 'least', 'general', 'long', 'such', 'low', 'long', 'right', 'few', 'short', 'such', 'short'];0.134640522875817

266;blackburnj-1;"steven spielberg's career was somewhat unfilled before 1993. sure there were some fine films and some enjoyable films but there wasn't the truly great film that such a great filmmaker deserved. in 1993, that drought was ended by schindler's list. when poland is subdued by the invading nazi armies, oskar schindler attempts to form a business, employing only jews and freeing them from the ghetto. however, the holocaust and the final solution begin to take hold; more and more of his workers are taken to concentration camps but schindler continues to try and get jews into his factories. however, as the year begins to draw to a close, schindler begins to draw up a list of jews who he wants to buy and take to his own factory. what a film! it is fantastic. it is supremely well made, exquisitely written with a touching score and brilliantly shot. it is a tour-de-force with three fantastic central performances from liam neeson as the benevolent and great schindler, ben kingsley as the mistreated jew, itzhak stern and ralph fiennes as the homicidal and psychotic goeth. it is simply sublime from all. john williams' score is possibly his best ever (which is high praise indeed). the photography is superb from janusz kaminski and they all help to make a film that has two strong bases. the first is steven zaillian's fantastic script, brilliant created and moulded. the second is spielberg's direction, which is genial, brilliant and sublime. he deals with the case of the holocaust in a suitably stark way but he also provides an uplifting film that shows humanity's better side in one man at the very least. he also uses his skill to the maximum. in particular, his use of colour is awesome, especially his focusing on a girl in a red coat during the liquidation of the ghetto and her re-appearance later in the film put simply, this is a film that is veritably great. without a doubt, the film is one of the greatest ever and should be seen by all.";28 October 2005;10;['unfilled', 'sure', 'fine', 'enjoyable', 'great', 'great', 'final', 'more', 'own', 'fantastic', 'touching', 'fantastic', 'central', 'liam', 'benevolent', 'great', 'ralph', 'psychotic', 'sublime', 'good', 'high', 'superb', 'strong', 'first', 'fantastic', 'second', 'genial', 'brilliant', 'sublime', 'stark', 'uplifting', 'well', 'least', 'particular', 'awesome', 'red', 'great', 'great'];0.407816091954023
267;Hawkensian;"wwii and the holocaust were events of mind bending statistics and proportions. tens of thousands dead in single bombing raids, 20+ million soviets dead, 15+ million chinese dead, 6+ million poles dead, 7+ million germans dead, 11 million the victim of nazi genocide it just beggars belief. the european and pacific theatres were so dreadful, so massive, that it's impossible for one to fully process it emotionally. schindler's list is one of the finest cinematic depictions of those dark years; a sweeping, brutal film that brings a remarkable story to the attention of millions of viewers. however, as with all historical films, it does not serve as the definitive source of information. the film follows oskar schindler (liam neeson), a sudeten german businessman who reaped the benefits of slave labour during wwii. with his imposing presence and magnetism, he charms his way through nazi circles, soon operating an enamelware factory in krakow, poland using jewish labour. at this point schindler appears largely indifferent to the persecution all around him, or rather he avoids confronting the ugly truth of the nazis' approaching final solution. he eventually becomes acquainted amon goth, the callously evil commandant of the paszow concentration camp who is performed excellently by ralph fiennes. goth was an incredibly violent man, the extent of his crimes were such that his sentencing was phrased as following: 'amon goth himself killed, maimed and tortured a substantial, albeit unidentified, number of people.' goth's violence isn't sugarcoated in the film, he shoots dozens of defenceless people and never shows even a modicum of remorse, so fanatical is his hatred for them. the film is starkly brutal, there is no cinematic sheen, the scores that are shot bleed profusely as they fall to the ground like rag dolls. fiennes, whose face can be both that of a mild-mannered englishman and sinister villain all at once, delivers a performance that's nuanced and restrained yet hauntingly evil. just like an inundated office worker, goth complains to oskar about the pressures of the job, which at the time is the exhumation of thousands of rotting corpses 'can you believe this? as if i don't have enough to do they come up with this? i have to find every rag buried up here and burn it.' like adolf eichmann, the logistics man responsible for the deportation of hundreds of thousands of hungarian jews, fiennes' depiction of amon goth is another example of hannah arendt's phrase 'the banality of evil'. it is a compelling depiction of one of the third reich's most committed defenders; a man deeply entrenched in nazi ideology that has lost almost all humanity. the relationship between schindler and goth and his ss cronies is quite uneasy for the viewer. schindler enjoys pushing the boundaries, he thrives off being a renegade, in one scene he kisses a jewish woman in the presence of a whole party of ss officials. as the film progresses and schindler realises both the abhorrence of the situation and his power to do something about it, something of a good vs. evil dichotomy arises. deriders may say this is a simplistic construct, but it isn't, they are two complex characters. their exchanges shows that schindler is the strongest leader between him, he has personality and charm, whereas goth only has ruthless barbarism, something goth realises and struggles with. the film has grand scope and several brilliant set pieces. a notable example is the 'red girl' scene during the liquidation of the krakow ghetto, it is very impressive logistically, there are countless extras who all need directing. schindler, who is atop a hill witnessing the brutality below, is the camera's point of view, following this little girl in a red coat (famously one of the few moments of colour in the film) as she navigates her way through all the murder and pillaging. the scale of the scenes at the paszow concentration camp is also considerable, particularly as great masses of prisoners, naked and completely dehumanised, are shuffled around like cattle for inspection. cinematographer janusz kaminski said that the film was shot in black and white so it would look 'timeless'. i think the colouring achieved the desired effect, and i also think the film's visceral edge and authenticity was achieved through the hand-held, shaky cinematography that would later work so well in saving private ryan (1998). a great film will almost always have a great score, and it is no different with schindler's list as spielberg once again found a masterful auditory companion in john williams, whose beautifully melancholy score, particularly the central violin melody, has become instantly recognisable to many people. the depiction of the mass exhumation at chujowa gorka is set against 'immolation (with our lives, we give life)', whose stirring operatic vocals and chords make the scene almost apocalyptic. there is also notable use of hebrew music, such as the ebullient yerushalaim shel zahav and the haunting oyf'n pripetshek/nacht aktion. even the trailer leaves a huge impression through music. 'exodus', a work by the celebrated polish composer wojciech kilar, has a brooding subtlety that emphasises the trailer's ambiguity, making its two minutes and twelve seconds most moving and unsettling. despite massive universal acclaim, the film inevitably had its detractors, most notably stanley kubrick, who said: 'the holocaust is about 6 million people who get killed. schindler's list is about 600 who don't.' firstly, around 1200 were saved, not 600. kubrick suggests that 'schindler's list' is somehow a sugar-coated account of the holocaust, it certainly isn't. it is a true story, oskar schindler really did save 1200 people, it isn't a fanciful, maudlin figment of a screenwriter's imagination. it is an emotionally affecting yet tactful depiction of both the systematic murder of scores of defenceless people and a complicated man's remarkable act of humanity in the face of unimaginable suffering. 97% www.hawkensian.com";12 June 2014;9;['dead', 'single', 'dead', 'chinese', 'dead', 'dead', 'dead', 'european', 'pacific', 'dreadful', 'massive', 'impossible', 'fine', 'cinematic', 'dark', 'sweeping', 'brutal', 'remarkable', 'historical', 'definitive', 'sudeten', 'german', 'jewish', 'indifferent', 'ugly', 'final', 'evil', 'paszow', 'ralph', 'violent', 'such', 'substantial', 'unidentified', 'defenceless', 'fanatical', 'brutal', 'cinematic', 'mild', 'mannered', 'sinister', 'evil', 'enough', 'responsible', 'hungarian', 'compelling', 'third', 'committed', 'uneasy', 'jewish', 'whole', 'good', 'evil', 'simplistic', 'complex', 'strong', 'ruthless', 'goth', 'grand', 'several', 'brilliant', 'notable', 'red', 'impressive', 'countless', 'little', 'red', 'few', 'paszow', 'considerable', 'great', 'naked', 'black', 'white', 'timeless', 'visceral', 'shaky', 'private', 'great', 'great', 'different', 'masterful', 'auditory', 'melancholy', 'central', 'recognisable', 'many', 'mass', 'operatic', 'apocalyptic', 'notable', 'hebrew', 'such', 'ebullient', 'huge', 'celebrated', 'polish', 'unsettling', 'massive', 'universal', 'true', 'fanciful', 'maudlin', 'tactful', 'systematic', 'defenceless', 'complicated', 'remarkable', 'unimaginable'];-0.0100305662805662
268;lhhung_himself;"schindler's list is not a bad film per se - liam neeson is very good as schindler and if you edit out some of the more overblown scenes - the story is still riveting. yet it could have been so much more if the story just told simply and if the central theme were fully understood and developed. before the war schindler and his friend, goeth were boozy, flirtatious german businessmen. both would have likely been uninspired failures had there been no war. in a kinder world, goeth's and schindler's moral differences might have manifested themselves in the size of the tip that they would leave the barmaid. in war, the consequences of moral choices are greatly magnified, resulting in schindler becoming a most unlikely heroic figure, and goeth becoming a loathed prison commandant. in the film, spielberg elevates schindler to sainthood status and portrays goeth as a sadistic psychopath. by sanitizing schindler's many faults (boozing, gambling, womanizing...) and by demonizing goeth, spielberg severs our connection with them and, ironically, blunts the conflict between them. adolf eichmann was far more chilling than charles manson. unlike manson, whom we could dismiss as psychotic, eichmann was the faceless functionary that we have all experienced, whose defense of ""following orders"" is one that we have all heard, a defense that was used by many during the war, and one that we might see ourselves using under similar circumstances had we not schindler's courage. by making schindler a saint, spielberg diminishes both his accomplishment and his inspiration to us - saints have no problems making the right decision - the rest of us do. rather than a gaping chasm, there is but a fine moral line between schindler and goeth - one that we tread every day, which fortunately for us, rarely does more than determines a barmaid's salary. spielberg does not develop this simple theme, preferring to impress us with a grandiose view of a great moral tale. instead, he comes off as the underskilled sous-chef drowning a wonderful filet mignon in an overly rich sauce. the quality of the ingredients still shine through despite the clumsy handling but does not approach its great potential. in the end, the best thing about the film is that it reminds americans of a monstrous event in history. it is unfortunate that this reminder is necessary and that it reduces such a timeless parable to a useful public service announcement.";11 February 2002;1;['bad', 'liam', 'good', 'overblown', 'more', 'central', 'boozy', 'flirtatious', 'german', 'uninspired', 'kind', 'moral', 'moral', 'unlikely', 'heroic', 'loathed', 'sadistic', 'many', 'chilling', 'psychotic', 'functionary', 'many', 'similar', 'right', 'fine', 'moral', 'simple', 'grandiose', 'great', 'moral', 'underskilled', 'sous', 'wonderful', 'rich', 'clumsy', 'great', 'good', 'monstrous', 'unfortunate', 'necessary', 'parable', 'useful', 'public'];0.1508832565284178

285;gottogorunning;"in 1942, a german nazi named oskar schindler developed a business, in krakow, germany. it was managed by a jewish man, itzchak stern, and populated hundreds of working jews. one day, the workers and the living jews in the ghetto were overruled by invading nazis, led by amon goeth. they were evacuated and taken to a concentration camp near the ghetto. devastated by the loss of workers, schindler demanded to goeth that his workers be released immediately. but not so; goeth told schindler that the jews were to remain in the camp. determined, and self-willed, schindler opened a business near the camp, and made a list of jews that could work there. the list was only meant for a couple hundreds, but eventually became a list with one thousand and eleven jew names on it. the jews were shipped out, and worked until the end of the war. afterwards, at midnight the day world war ii was strictly declared over, stern and some friends made a letter of evidence that schindler was innocent, and a ring out of a jew's tooth, with the words ""whoever saves one life, saves the world entire"" inscribed on the side. it was at exact moment that schindler learned that not only did his factory become successful, it saved the lives of jewish victims. this is a beautiful yet horrifying crafted movie about the terrible holocaust. it is a very well-done picture, with fantastic cinematography-all done in black and white-, flawless acting, and a powerful score. liam neeson plays oskar schindler, showing the kindness yet fierceness of the man who was considered a 'savior.' ben kingsley is wonderful as the jewish assistant, itzchak stern. but the most recognizable performance of the cast is ralph fiennes, who is incredible as the root of all evil, amon goeth. the story is incredible all in itself, and it contains such mind-blowing images, text, and sounds. spielberg used his directing skills very well, showing audiences the real horrors and incredible sadness through these elements. such complex things are heart-wrenching to imagine, but not even this film can display the holocaust. this film shows only but a pinprick of the evils of this senseless massacre. notable scenes are the liquidation of the ghetto, the children escape, and, most of all, the heartbreaking close-to-the-end scene. the final scene is emotional, because you see the 'schindler jews', along with the actors that played them, place rocks on the grave of schindler. and the last person, whom is only but a shadow to us, places a red rose in the middle. i cannot tell you the incredible and durable sadness i felt as i watched this film, but it made me realize that even ordinary people can save lives. i recommend that everyone should see this; it really is more than a regular film. it is a masterpiece.";13 August 2005;10;['german', 'jewish', 'determined', 'willed', 'stern', 'innocent', 'exact', 'successful', 'jewish', 'beautiful', 'terrible', 'fantastic', 'black', 'flawless', 'powerful', 'liam', 'wonderful', 'jewish', 'itzchak', 'recognizable', 'ralph', 'incredible', 'incredible', 'such', 'real', 'incredible', 'such', 'complex', 'notable', 'most', 'heartbreaking', 'final', 'emotional', 'last', 'incredible', 'durable', 'ordinary', 'more', 'regular'];0.2927777777777777

287;fatcat-73450;i see why seinfeld decided to make out in the theater instead of paying close attention to this movie. it's way too long, sometimes boring, and visually confusing. of course, the subject matter here is about one of the most important events in human history, yet i think it's a big flaw to give a piece of art high marks just because it deals with an important topic. it must also be judged on its artistic value. this is basically two stories in one. on the one hand we have a sadistic military commander who's rude, crude, emotionally unstable, and bloodthirsty. this part is like an exploitation movie - calculated to shock the audience. however, given that these scenes are most likely close to the truth of an actual situation, it's appropriate. the other part concerns the evolution of the character of schindler from a practical businessman to a humanitarian who gives up all of his fortune for the sake of the jews in the film. it's a beautiful story, and the ending is touching, but the evolution is, in my opinion, a little too subtle. i don't feel schindler fundamentally displayed any big change throughout the film. seems like he was always a rather decent guy. the use of music throughout is a unique and brilliant touch. the whole thing seems to move in sync with a rhythm. that being said, this film is way too long and some parts are boring. the first third, especially rolls along at a snail's pace. also filming this movie in a tenebrous black and white just to use the girl in the red sweater as a symbol was not only vulgar symbolism cramming, but made the movie hard to watch. also why did they cast liam neeson and ralph fiennes in the leading roles? they look like twins. i sometimes wondered why schindler was committing all of the atrocities only to discover that it was actually a different character. along with the darkness, made it harder to watch. it's a good movie from a technical standpoint. creative, impactful, and well-directed, but i wouldn't blame you if you made out while it was playing in the theater. honourable mentions: jurassic park (1993). short, fast-paced, good effects, in color... in my opinion, spielberg's best work.;13 September 2021;6;['close', 'long', 'boring', 'confusing', 'subject', 'important', 'human', 'big', 'high', 'important', 'artistic', 'sadistic', 'military', 'rude', 'crude', 'unstable', 'bloodthirsty', 'close', 'actual', 'appropriate', 'other', 'practical', 'beautiful', 'touching', 'little', 'subtle', 'big', 'decent', 'unique', 'brilliant', 'whole', 'long', 'boring', 'first', 'third', 'tenebrous', 'black', 'white', 'red', 'vulgar', 'hard', 'ralph', 'different', 'hard', 'good', 'technical', 'creative', 'impactful', 'honourable', 'short', 'good', 'good'];0.0319186046511627

294;Marx_Bros_Fan86;"articulating my thoughts on this movie has been difficult, given my mixed feelings for it. schindler's list introduced me to the holocaust and encouraged me to learn more about it. no film has ever made me cry more. yet i find myself agreeing with some of the common criticisms of the film, that it is emotionally manipulative at the expense of promoting a more complex understanding of the holocaust. i respect spielberg for showing little restraint in depicting the horrors of the holocaust. schindler's list provides a general overview of the subject, from the initial discrimination against jews, to the liquidation of the ghettos, to the concentration camps. this is without a doubt spielberg's most emotionally gripping film. some of the more memorable moments for me were the scenes where children escape death by hiding in toilets, and the chimneys at auschwitz. john william's theme earned the score an academy award all on its own; the rest of the movie might as well have had no music. ralph fiennes gives a chilling performance as the film's villain, amon goeth, and the black and white documentary style gives it an unparalleled feeling of authenticity. to be honest though, that seems to be all there is to this movie. it is purely emotional, with little intellectual value. i believe this is in part due to the way spielberg treats his characters. the two supporting characters, itzhak stern and amon goeth, would have been more interesting characters than the lead, oscar schindler. stern, as schindler's personal assistant, is able to avoid many of the hardships faced by his fellow jews. i would imagine this would present an interesting moral dilemma for stern: it is in his best interest to remain schindler's assistant, but how can he remain loyal to his people in this somewhat privileged position? he soothes his conscience by trying to prod schindler into saving more jews. goeth is presented as a psychopath who shoots jews from his balcony for sport. the historical record verifies that he indeed partook in such abominable acts, but spielberg tries to meld him into a three dimensional character with only partial success. goeth kills jews because it makes him feel powerful, but oscar schindler challenged this definition of power when he said that true power is permitting someone to live, rather than killing them. goeth attempts to exert schindler's definition of power by not punishing a jewish servant, but he quickly reverts to his old ways by shooting him on his way out the door. another scene involves his sexual attraction to a jewish servant, but he ends up severely beating her, and blames her for trying to subvert him. these two characters are very different, but they have one thing in common: they are involved in a personal struggle over their own beliefs. stern has to find a way to remain loyal to the jewish people while saving his own skin, while goeth attempts to change his sadistic ways, but fails. unfortunately, their status as supporting characters limits what spielberg can really do with them. the film never explains goeth's brutal ways other than chalking it up to his psychopathic, sadistic tendencies, which pertained to some nazis, but not all. nevertheless goeth is one of the more interesting characters in the film. oscar schindler, the main character, does not have an equivalent struggle over his own identity, only a moral struggle, over whether he should challenge the nazi power to save his workers, which would put his life, as well as his business, in danger. he is strictly an observer to the horrors around him, not a participant, which makes him the least interesting character in the film. he witnesses a series of atrocities and looks sadder and sadder each time. basically, the message about this character is pretty clear: he's a greedy businessman, but he has a soul, and it's only a matter of time before he does the right thing. he decides to save 1100 of his workers, ending the film on a happy note, but still reflecting on the millions who did not make it. a flawed character such as this would make for some great character analysis, but he feels distant, like an empty vessel for the audience to slip into. perhaps this was spielberg's intention. but the character's development takes such an obvious, unsurprising course that it almost feels like the film is just delaying the inevitable for three hours. optimism is truly spielberg's forte. whenever he takes on a depressing, complicated subject, he portrays it in the most simplistic and comforting ways. i find it most interesting that spielberg, a jewish filmmaker, would make a holocaust movie that does not focus on jews that much. stern is the only jewish character who is developed to any degree. i am not trying to accuse spielberg of being anti-semitic. i just believe that focusing on the jews in this story would have been inconsistent with spielberg's optimistic style of film making, because only schindler had the power to save them. but focusing on schindler so much almost robs the jews of any agency, making them all the more pitiful. this gives the film a strictly emotional core rather than an intellectual one. i admit this is more of a subjective criticism than an objective one, because who says the emotional route is not as legitimate as the intellectual, but i believe a film can be emotional and intellectual at the same time. schindler's list packs an emotional punch that few films have matched, and for that, it is a must see. despite this, the most admirable quality of the film is not a characteristic of the film itself, but how it has promoted awareness of the holocaust. schindler's list is an excellent introduction to the holocaust and i believe it will continue to encourage people to learn more about it, but if you are looking for deep analysis, look elsewhere.";1 April 2010;7;['difficult', 'mixed', 'more', 'more', 'common',

295;matlefebvre20;"for the last thirty years or so, steven spielberg has been the greatest star to shine in the film universe. he is already claimed as being the greatest filmmaker of all time even if he still have time to make other movies. and of all of these last thirty years, one of them must be especially highlighted: 1993. it's by far the greatest year of spielberg's career. first, he broke the bank and revolutionized modern cinema with ""jurassic park"" which became (and still is) the most successful film of his career. it was the summer's highlight. and for christmas, spielberg came out with his crowning achievement: ""schindler's list"". based on a true story (yes, a true story!), this extremely dramatic and ultra-realistic tale of a nazi businessman who saved 1,100 jews during holocaust ultimately ended up with seven academy awards, including best picture and a well-deserved best director award for mr. spielberg. the first aspect of the movie that strikes the viewer is the filming process. ""schindler's list"" is mostly shot in black and white, because it matched with spielberg's ideas about world war ii. he said that the only images that came to his mind when he thought about wwii were in black and white. thereby, the movie brings a very adequate mood which is fueled by fear, sorrow and the most inhuman cruelties and dark feelings that are parts of this abominable war. but even if black and white is the most prominent filming process, colored parts appear in short, but crucial moments. the greatest example is the little girl with the red coat. she becomes the catalyst of schindler's altruistic efforts. she is first spotted during the liquidation of krakow's ghetto and then, schindler sees her, unfortunately dead and about to be incinerated by the ss officers. the main force behind ""schindler's list"" is the depiction of the nazis' cruelties and racist gestures made to the jews. and also the jews' efforts in order to stand and flee from these absurd and inhuman moves. this idea is particularly shown in the ghetto's liquidation scenes which are the greatest, hardest and most harrowing pictures of the movie. ""schindler's list"" is also a success because of its three leading actors. liam neeson is oskar schindler, this messiah-like figure who used his recently-made fortune in order to save his people. neeson's performance is extraordinary and we can feel his inner transformation throughout the movie. he is perfectly depicted as a greedy man, but also as a restless seducer and womanizer. ben kingsley is schindler's jewish assistant itzhak stern and he delivers his greatest role apart from gandhi in the eponymous movie. finally, there's ralph fiennes' unforgettable performance as untersturmfuhrer amon goeth who is the main representative of the nazis' horrors and his attractive physique hides a wildly devilish nature, which fuels each one of his atrocities. because it runs for about 200 minutes (three hours and twenty minutes), the movie includes several sub-plots which either highlight some passages of thomas keneally's novel or show other holocaust-specific pictures, such as the 'selection' in plaszow's camp. out of all the movies made in the last decade of the 20th century, ""schindler's list"" is probably the greatest, followed by quentin tarantino's ""pulp fiction"". this is only a 'probable', but some things are surer. for instance, this is undoubtedly steven spielberg's greatest picture, which is somehow ironic because spielberg is known for his blockbusters and action-filled movies. so, it's ironic to see that such a war drama can be considered as spielberg's definitive masterwork. but, in a sense, only spielberg could have done a movie like this. he is a jew himself and the holocaust can only have more effect on him than any other filmmaker. roman polanski did well too with ""the pianist"", but spielberg's vision and direction were just superior. from now on, anyone could try to make a movie about the horrors of the holocaust, but nobody will ever measure up to one of the most unforgettable true stories of the century: ""schindler's list"".";3 September 2006;10;['last', 'great', 'great', 'other', 'last', 'great', 'modern', 'successful', 'true', 'true', 'dramatic', 'ultra', 'realistic', 'good', 'good', 'first', 'black', 'white', 'only', 'black', 'white', 'adequate', 'inhuman', 'dark', 'abominable', 'black', 'white', 'prominent', 'colored', 'short', 'crucial', 'great', 'little', 'red', 'altruistic', 'dead', 'about', 'main', 'racist', 'absurd', 'inhuman', 'great', 'hard', 'harrowing', 'like', 'extraordinary', 'inner', 'greedy', 'restless', 'jewish', 'great', 'eponymous', 'ralph', 'unforgettable', 'main', 'attractive', 'devilish', 'several', 'other', 'specific', 'such', 'last', 'great', 'probable', 'great', 'ironic', 'ironic', 'definitive', 'more', 'other', 'roman', 'superior', 'unforgettable', 'true'];0.2335565476190476

301;jay-techie2007;"it is only twice that i have watched this movie and it definitely is one of the classics of hollywood. probably the finest work (and undoubtedly one of the finest) of steven spielberg till date. in the backdrop of nazi-occupied poland, schindler's list comprises of jews who are to be saved by an otherwise greedy and flamboyant businessman but a transformed humanitarian, oskar schindler. story (10/10): the story is based on thomas keneally's 1982 novel ""schindler's ark"". it is a story of a german businessman who went all out to save the jews who were being massacred by the nazi army post-invasion of poland. while, initially, he employed the jews to make quick money by exploiting them. however, the views of people being needlessly killed by the nazi army evokes the human inside him and that's when he decides to do whatever possible to save as many lives as possible. and while doing that, he not only has to manage the secrecy of the purpose but also justify the purpose of every single jew in his company to the bloodthirsty nazi army. the screenplay is brilliant and it couldn't have been better adapted from the novel. acting (9/10): liam neeson, playing the title role, was effortless in the projection of a greedy, money-minded and a womanizer businessman in the beginning of the movie and an emotional, humanitarian later on. one of the toughest scenes was when he is watching the jewish massacre from the top of a hill - and his expressions in that scene told a thousand words, something which is very tough. it was quite a challenging role and liam executes it like a boss. besides liam, another actor that stood out in the movie was ralph fiennes. his role and quality of acting reminded me of the role of christopher waltz in inglorious bastards. playing a role of a cruel nazi commandant of the krakow-paszow concentration camp in paszow (german-occupied poland), he was brilliant in his cold looks and depiction of hatred towards the jews. ben kingsley was commendable in his role of jewish accountant of oskar schindler. his depiction of a hesitating, unsure and under-confident person (yet rising to the occasion whenever the situation demands), largely due to the circumstances around him, was brilliant. direction (9/10): i loved the idea of steven spielberg shooting this movie in b/w which provided it a vintage feel as well as a slightly dull projection which was necessary considering the subject of the movie. ss has been great with the actors and he brings the best out of it. one negative for me was the length of the movie which was too long, especially when you have such a heavy topic. conceptualization of some of the scenes are so brilliant they stay on your mind long after you have watched the movie - something i felt when i watched ""12 angry men"". overall (9/10): definitely, one of the classics in hollywood, and a must-watch movie, if you love a little heavy but a top quality cinema.";22 August 2016;9;['fine', 'fine', 'greedy', 'flamboyant', 'transformed', 'humanitarian', 'german', 'quick', 'possible', 'many', 'possible', 'single', 'brilliant', 'greedy', 'minded', 'emotional', 'humanitarian', 'tough', 'jewish', 'tough', 'challenging', 'ralph', 'inglorious', 'cruel', 'german', 'brilliant', 'cold', 'commendable', 'jewish', 'confident', 'due', 'brilliant', 'vintage', 'dull', 'necessary', 'great', 'good', 'negative', 'long', 'heavy', 'brilliant', 'angry', 'little', 'heavy', 'top'];0.1165674603174603

307;xiaoli7377;"""schindler's list"" is a movie that both shows us the best and the worst of humanity. it's an enthralling work of cinematic mastery, and i think that it is a film that every human being should watch. that's not hyperbole or exaggeration. the atrocity that the nazi regime committed against the jewish population will always be remembered as one of the most despicable acts of history. but the film is more than scenes of brutality. we are also shown that trauma and war can often bring out the most brave and heroic actions. the film focuses on the actions of oskar schindler, played brilliantly by liam neeson. schindler runs a factory that makes pots and pans, and he is initially very cozy and close with high ranking members of the nazi party. through bribes and lavish parties, schindler is able to gain a tremendous amount of political power and he is also able to secure a source of free labor: recently displaced jews who now live in the cramped ghettoes of krakow, poland. schindler is assisted by itzhak stern (ben kingsley), a jewish accountant who manages the financials of schindler's factory. after a period of comfort and stability, amon goth (ralph fiennes) takes charge as the new commandant of krakow. goth orders the liquidation of the ghetto and the subsequent transplant of the jews to the nearby plaszow concentration camp. the rest of the film involves schindler's shift from a greedy factory runner to becoming more and more empathetic of the jewish strife. schindler's character arc is placed opposite goth's unchanging brutality and psychopathic fits of rage. there is lots of symbolism to behold in this movie. some are more obvious, such as the girl in the red dress and the candles. but i think just the contrast between schindler's and goth's differing aspects of man's treatment of fellow man is what elevates this film and moves me, personally. there are many examples within the film, scenes with schindler and goth played back to back where we see their reactions to events play out in starkly different ways. you could really tell this kind of a story in a variety of different settings, but the holocaust is definitely one that hits many emotional chords. on top of it being one of the best depictions of the holocaust in cinematic history, the deeply layered thematic storytelling, as well as top-notch acting, cinematography, and direction from the venerable steven spielberg, ""schindler's list"" is certainly one of the greatest films of all time. it's not a film that you watch for entertainment, it is one to be cherished as a work of art, and as one that will educate and move future generations to never forget our past, both the courageous and the depraved.";5 September 2020;10;['good', 'bad', 'enthralling', 'cinematic', 'human', 'jewish', 'despicable', 'more', 'brave', 'heroic', 'cozy', 'close', 'high', 'lavish', 'able', 'tremendous', 'political', 'able', 'free', 'jewish', 'ralph', 'new', 'goth', 'subsequent', 'nearby', 'greedy', 'empathetic', 'jewish', 'unchanging', 'psychopathic', 'obvious', 'such', 'red', 'fellow', 'many', 'different', 'different', 'many', 'emotional', 'good', 'cinematic', 'thematic', 'top', 'venerable', 'great', 'future', 'courageous'];0.2069605142332415
308;thesouthfamily2-552-707097;"""schindler's list"" is described as a film about the holocaust, but the holocaust supplies the field for the story, rather than the subject. the film is really two parallel character studies--one of a con man, the other of a psychopath. oskar schindler, who swindles the third reich, and amon goeth, who represents its pure evil, are men created by the opportunities of war. in telling their stories, steven spielberg found a way to approach the holocaust, which is a subject too vast and tragic to be encompassed in any reasonable way by fiction. in the ruins of the saddest story of the century, he found, not a happy ending, but at least one affirming that resistance to evil is possible and can succeed. in the face of the nazi charnel houses, it is a statement that has to be made, or we sink into despair. the film's ending brings me to tears. at the end of the war, schindler's jews are in a strange land--stranded, but alive. a member of the liberating russian forces asks them, ""isn't a town over there?"" and they walk off toward the horizon. the next shot fades from black and white into color. at first we think it may be a continuation of the previous action, until we see that the men and women on the crest of the hill are dressed differently now. and then it strikes us, with the force of a blow: those are schindler's jews. we are looking at the actual survivors and their children as they visit oskar schindler's grave. the movie began with a list of jews being confined to the ghetto. it ends with a list of some who were saved. the list is an absolute good. the list is life. what is most amazing about this film is how completely spielberg serves his story. the movie is brilliantly acted, written, directed and seen. individual scenes are masterpieces of art direction, cinematography, special effects, crowd control. yet spielberg, the stylist whose films often have gloried in shots we are intended to notice and remember, disappears into his work.";15 January 2014;10;['parallel', 'other', 'third', 'pure', 'vast', 'tragic', 'reasonable', 'sad', 'happy', 'least', 'possible', 'strange', 'alive', 'liberating', 'russian', 'next', 'black', 'white', 'previous', 'actual', 'absolute', 'amazing', 'individual', 'special'];0.0179606625258799

312;krumski;"spoilers within. don't read unless you've seen the movie. at this point, almost a decade after its release, schindler's list is what it is: it has become a cultural touchstone, and its reputation rightfully precedes it. it certainly has an aura and a cachet that goes beyond any single endeavor to praise or criticize it; therefore, i plan to do neither, but merely to share some of the thoughts i had while watching it. some will be positive, others more negative - but none of it is meant to (or will be able to) diminish what spielberg has achieved with this movie. first off, i must say that all the scenes with schindler himself i found riveting: liam neeson - not an actor i usually warm up to very well - was absolutely mesmerizing: he gave the character an authority and a charisma that was totally captivating, while still preserving the basic enigmatic nature of the man. (he reminded me again and again of a young richard burton when he was at the top of his game.) the tug-of-war of conscience in the scenes between him and stern (ben kingsley, underplaying nicely) were, though a bit schematic and obvious, nonetheless powerful - no doubt because of the enormity of the topic at hand. holocaust movies, of course, can very easily get a free pass because of that very enormity, and schindler's list is no exception: scenes that might otherwise have seemed simplistic or overplayed are imbued with power because of the context in which they occur. one scene that stuck out for me, though - and not necessarily in a good way - was the liquidation of the krakow ghetto. it is of course a tour-de-force of filmmaking and technical prowess (a foreshadowing, say, of the normandy beach sequence in saving private ryan), but its reason for being i found suspect. ostensibly - on the level of the story, anyway - it was there to bring schindler face to face with the horror and waste of the nazi policy toward the jews, and so to suggest a reason why he converted from shameless profiteer and exploiter to jewish savior. except, as such a scene, it doesn't quite wash. schindler indeed is displayed as witnessing the liquidation, but from his vantage point - a hill overlooking the ghetto - he would in no way have been able to see the scene in the detail, and in all the different locations, that the movie makes us privy to. no, this scene is designed not to be played before schindler, but to be played before us, the moviegoers. so why does that bother me? well, it seems to me a break in form. a movie that had been, up until that time, focusing narrowly on one man, suddenly opens up to wanting to display the panoply of characters and lives that were directly affected by the holocaust. problem is, by adopting such a large-scale approach, no one individual (or family) is able to claim our full attention, and so spielberg becomes guilty in his own way of 'ghetto'-izing the jews - that is, grouping them together facelessly as victims, rather than showcasing any of their dignity or humanity as individuals. my bias, i suppose, in films dealing with the holocaust, is that the enormity of it is just lost on most of us. it's impossible - unless we lived and survived through it - to do justice to both its scale and its horror. therefore, a film-maker shouldn't try. not that holocaust-themed films shouldn't be made; it's just that, to be honest and effective (not necessarily the same thing - particularly when the artist is spielberg) they should focus themselves on a small *microcosm* of it - a family, a person, a survivor - and attempt to *suggest* the full horrors, through the particulars of that person's story. actually trying to show those horrors outright (to put us, as it were, 'inside' the holocaust) is frankly impossible, and i think spielberg's ambitions to do so, through this liquidation scene and other similar ones in the movie - are, though perhaps high-minded, ultimately wrong-headed. but, as i say, when he's focused narrowly on schindler himself, the film works wonderfully - and is far more able, in my opinion, to get across the horror and waste of the holocaust than when it's concentrating on its big (but impersonal) 'herd up the jews' scenes. the making up of the list itself is extremely powerful in this regard: 'more names! more names!' schindler demands, and his mania in doing so tells us all we need to know about the absolute desperation of the times (particularly as it comes from a formerly amoral man only interested in himself). and as such, i must take exception to all those (and there are many) who find the last scene - schindler's breakdown - to be completely maudlin and ill-advised, a detriment to an otherwise marvelous motion picture. to me, it was the best scene in the movie. for, in the character's hysterical insistence that he 'could have done more' - coming on the heels of all the people we saw that he *did* save - it serves to remind the audience - in absolutely unambiguous terms - that what oskar schindler did, though momentous, wasn't'even a drop in the bucket compared to the number of lives taken and/or disrupted by the holocaust. that this man - driven to bankruptcy and ruin by his (eventual) unceasing efforts to save the jews - could claim that he 'didn't do enough,' only shows how much there was to do, and how much of it was left undone. that, to me, is the kind of moment that brings home the enormity of the holocaust - not the use of hundreds of extras to be herded onto trains and into showers. we can tell ourselves (and be right) that those scenes are fake (staged for the movie). the point made through schindler's breakdown at the end is the deepest kind of truth - the kind that never should be forgotten or cast aside.";15 June 2003;7;['cultural', 'single', 'positive', 'negative', 'able', 'liam', 'captivating', 'basic', 'enigmatic', 'young', 'stern', 'schematic', 'obvious', 'powerful', 'free', 'very', 'simplistic', 'good', 'technical', 'normandy', 'private', 'suspect', 'shameless', 'jewish', 'able', 'different', 'privy', 'large', 'able', 'full', 'guilty', 'own', 'most', 'impossible', 'honest', 'effective', 'same', 'small', 'full', 'impossible', 'other', 'similar', 'high', 'minded', 'able', 'big', 'impersonal', 'powerful', 'more', 'more', 'absolute', 'amoral', 'interested', 'such', 'many', 'last', 'maudlin', 'marvelous', 'good', 'hysterical', 'more', 'unambiguous', 'momentous', 'eventual', 'much', 'much', 'undone', 'right', 'fake', 'deep'];0.1510851098586947

320;kane_nelson;"oskar schindler (liam neeson) was an industrialist and a member of the nazi party who wanted to use the jewish people to get rich but gradually became concerned for them and used his riches to save thousands of them alongside his jewish accountant itzhak stern (ben kingsley). amon goth (ralph fiennes) enters the fray after being sent to oversee the plaszow concentrations camp and schindler befriends him and eventually bribes him. steven spielberg managed to create something that is truly spectacular but horrifying at the same time. the way this movie is directed, it all feels so surreal and like you are watching it all unfold right before you. this is also helped by the magnificent performances of neeson, kingsley and fiennes. liam neeson has never been finer in a movie, the slow change from womanizer to saviour was incredible and he portrayed oscar so wonderfully you could see it so clearly. ben kingsley performance was so raw, the look in his eyes in every scene, you could see the trauma he has been through and witnessed. amon goth was a true evil, and ralph fiennes managed to capture this evil perfectly, you just hated the site of him every moment he was on screen. oskar was not a great man before these events, he was a womanizer who used people and only cared for himself and to become rich. he told his wife that he wanted to make a name for himself and do something extraordinary and become rich. now while they both became true, he did something even more extraordinary and used his riches to make a name for himself in an even bigger way than he could have ever imagined. his story will carry on for centuries. the massacre in the streets of krakow was extremely shocking and emotional. i have never seen anything more shocking shown in a movie in my life. even after seeing this scene on numerous occasions, it never gets any easier to watch and doesn't make it any less real. a memorable scene for me during the massacre is of a nurse giving sick patients a drug to euphonize them and save them from the pain and torture of being shot dead by the nazi soldiers. for this to even be real, it must have been something truly horrific to experience. ""i could have saved one more"". this quote truly shows how much schindler had changed from the beginning of this film. despite saving thousands of jews, him breaking down, saying how he could have saved more, he could of sold his car and saved more depicts what kind of man he was. it was honestly heart-breaking and one of the most emotional ends to a film i have seen. despite being just over 3 hours, this films never becomes slow. this is truly a masterpiece of cinema and i believe everyone should witness and watch the story of oskar schindler. 10/10.";16 January 2022;10;['jewish', 'rich', 'concerned', 'jewish', 'ralph', 'spectacular', 'same', 'surreal', 'magnificent', 'fine', 'slow', 'incredible', 'raw', 'true', 'ralph', 'great', 'rich', 'extraordinary', 'rich', 'true', 'extraordinary', 'big', 'shocking', 'emotional', 'shocking', 'numerous', 'easy', 'real', 'memorable', 'sick', 'dead', 'real', 'horrific', 'more', 'much', 'more', 'more', 'emotional', 'slow'];0.1332306582306582

324;White Dolphin;"how people can call this movie 'horrible' or rate it with 1 star is really beyond me. if ever a movie has captured the cruelty and inhumanity of the holocaust this is it. horrifying scenes such as a woman being shot to death for construction mistakes that weren't her fault, a man taken out to be killed but the gun won't fire and has to hear the officer try to see what the problem is so that he can shoot. and so many many more scenes that will stay in your mind for a long long time. i didn't cry in this movie. i haven't cried in a movie since i was a kid. but this movie had a huge impact on me that when i went to sleep the night i saw this movie the images kept rolling in my mind (quite like the impact the botched execution scene in the green mile had on me). i saw a review before me (a few pages back) which said that israeli people are probably the most aware about the holocaust. but i don't believe that's true. at least not to the younger generation. one of the huge mistake people make (including many many israelis) is that the holocaust was only against jews. i personally find it a disgrace that the holocaust memorial day in israel and the famed holocaust museum in israel ""yad va shem"" refer only to the figure 6,000,000. when over 11,000,000 people fell victim to the crimes of the nazis. but hey i'm rambling here. i think this movie definitely captures the torture that the holocaust victims had to go through. the movie is in black and white, with only one girl in a red dress who is shown trying to save her life from the nazis by hiding under a bed. we later see this same girl's body taken to be burned- showing us that she obviously didn't survive. that got to me most. i don't think much of steven spielberg as a person. in fact i don't even think that much of him as a director but he did a magnificent job on this movie. i'm, sure that it will become one of the most well remembered movies of all time. people know the figures, the numbers, the years but to see it for yourself just makes you feel so happy that you were not a jew/gypsy/black/homosexual/deformed/handicaped/left-handed/communist, etc. at that time. i think everyone should see this movie. although i think it is the most powerful movie ever made, and deserves the number one spot on the imdb top 250 (over the godfather, and the shawshank redemption) it's not a movie i would see multiple times. perhaps once a year when it's shown on holocaust memorial day, and even that can be to much. it's the type of movie that it's enough to see once and sticks in your mind. 10/10.";14 January 2001;10;['horrible', 'such', 'many', 'many', 'more', 'long', 'long', 'huge', 'green', 'few', 'israeli', 'aware', 'true', 'least', 'young', 'huge', 'many', 'many', 'memorial', 'famed', 'black', 'white', 'red', 'same', 'much', 'much', 'magnificent', 'sure', 'happy', 'black', 'handed', 'powerful', 'multiple', 'memorial', 'much', 'enough'];0.1595238095238095

327;filmbuff-05706;"schindler's list is simply steven spielberg's greatest movie. i dare you to challenge this. sure, et is great, and so is jurassic park, and so forth. but out of all the movies that spielberg has directed, how can any of them top the power and importance of this one? schindler's list tells the true story of oskar schindler, portrayed wonderfully by liam neeson. he is a german who saved the lives of over 1,100 jews during the holocaust. schindler does this out of greed, making them low wage workers in his factory for his benefit, but he later does it out of compassion for his fellow man. that's the theme of the movie that echoes throughout long after the credits roll, and this is where the film's power stems from. the nazis considered jews to be ""vermin"" and not humans worthy of love, care, or compassion. oskar schindler over time sees that they are in fact worthy, and uses this basic human value to change the world. steven spielberg waited over a decade to make this movie, because even though he wanted to do it after making e. t., he felt that he wasn't ready to tackle the holocaust yet. (note that spielberg himself is jewish.) the time he took is well worth it, since he crafted the movie so well. using beautiful black and white cinematography, he makes this tragic event come alive to those who were not there to see the unspeakable event. since this movie is centered around the greatest tragedy in all of human history, the film gains an r rating for it's realistic violence. prepare for jews to be shot, burned, or gassed for what they believe in. it's hard to watch, but it's the most effective quality. there were people who took pleasure in killing millions of their own kind, and spielberg exposes this horror to perfection. this shows how schindler's list won 7 oscars, including steven's sole best picture win and his first of 2 best director wins(the other being for saving private ryan). all 7 are well earned for this fantastic movie. i first saw this in 10th grade in history class, so i was 16. i would say 15 or 16 would be the best age to see this, and i say that because while everyone should see schindler's list, it is not for the young, and historical prior knowledge is necessary. aside from the flaw of crimes against humanity, my only critique of schindler's list is that the german accents of non-german actors are so thick that i needed subtitles to follow the dialogue. apart from this, schindler's list is nothing short of a masterpiece. despite it's grim subject matter, schindler's list must be seen, even if just once. thank you, oskar schindler for your heroic act, and thank you steven spielberg for telling us his incredible story. by doing so, you have given us the best movie about the holocaust ever made. this is a powerful film that will leave a great impact on you. it should never be forgotten. if all but a few movies are erased from human memory, let schindler's list be one that remains.";6 July 2021;10;['great', 'great', 'true', 'low', 'fellow', 'worthy', 'worthy', 'basic', 'human', 'ready', 'jewish', 'worth', 'beautiful', 'black', 'white', 'tragic', 'alive', 'unspeakable', 'great', 'human', 'realistic', 'hard', 'effective', 'own', 'sole', 'good', 'first', 'good', 'other', 'private', 'fantastic', 'good', 'young', 'historical', 'prior', 'necessary', 'only', 'german', 'non', 'german', 'thick', 'short', 'grim', 'subject', 'heroic', 'incredible', 'good', 'powerful', 'great', 'few', 'human'];0.1975694444444445

(the most powerful scenes need no sound. dialogue is often in polish, german or yiddish.) spielberg tells schindler's story without a polanski edge, nor a scorcese wantonness. second, the choice of the pre-war hungarian song ""gloomy sunday"" lent authenticity as i watched, and has given me a reminder since. i can't hear other versions of this song now without thinking of this story. third, watch for the girl's red dress because that's when schindler realizes a truth, and somehow changes. at the end, watch for the woman spontaneously touch schindler's grave with her hand. in all this terribleness, something good survived.";23 March 2006;10;['superfluous', 'other', 'pleased', 'polanski', 'powerful', 'german', 'yiddish', 'polanski', 'scorcese', 'pre', 'war', 'hungarian', 'gloomy', 'other', 'red', 'terribleness', 'good'];0.1785714285714285

330;ToldYaSo;"i don't have to tell you that ""schindler's list"" is an extraordinary and important film. unanimous praise and celebration of a multi-award winning cinematic masterpiece should make it abundantly clear what a powerful film it is. to say nothing of steven spielberg's remarkable achievement of delivering in the same year the greatest box office hit to date with ""jurassic park"" and then the academy's best picture and director oscars. but everyone knows about that already. i saw this film at a second run cinema in my neighbourhood, which basically sold out each show of ""schindler's list"" for the week it was running. when my wife and i entered the theater, there seemed to be only one pair of seats available in the whole place. only after we sat down did we notice the guy in front of us was proudly brandishing a tall cowboy hat. we figured out quite quickly why our seats were available and thought we ought to explore our options. i very politely leaned forward and asked him if he was going to wear the hat during the show. with a friendly smile, the kind man in his mid-thirties assured us he'd remove it when the picture began. true to his word, he took off the hat when the lights went out. rarely have i ever seen a theater audience so transfixed on the images before them. complete devotion of attention from every patron. except one. when the ""dude"" in front of us grew tired of the film, some twenty minutes into it, he attempted making out with his girlfriend who briefly complied but ultimately succeeded in pushing him away. a number of future attempts were met with decreasing levels of success. clearly the subject matter on screen was far from romantic. weeks later, art imitated life on an episode of ""seinfeld"" when jerry's friends and family are outraged at his similar behavior which was a result of having no privacy while his parents stayed with him. back to our friend ""howdy doody"", who has failed in his amorous advances during a film about one of the most chilling, harrowing subjects in the history of mankind. when his attention span gave out, and i imagine some five year olds could put him to shame, he rested his head on the back of the seat and stared at the ceiling. he would periodically sigh loudly, a declaration of his utter boredom. not surprisingly, he drifted away and soon began to snore. i did nothing of course, and resigned myself to the fact that i'd have to watch the film again. this unfortunate sort of thing is the downside of seeing films in the theater, which i am by and large a huge supporter of in general. you never know what ""buckaroo"" you might be sitting behind, but my advice to you is simple. if you ever spot a cowboy hat, relocate.";3 August 1999;10;['extraordinary', 'important', 'unanimous', 'multi', 'award', 'cinematic', 'clear', 'powerful', 'remarkable', 'same', 'great', 'good', 'second', 'available', 'whole', 'tall', 'available', 'friendly', 'kind', 'true', 'complete', 'tired', 'future', 'subject', 'romantic', 'outraged', 'similar', 'howdy', 'amorous', 'chilling', 'harrowing', 'utter', 'unfortunate', 'large', 'huge', 'general', 'buckaroo', 'simple', 'relocate'];0.1335317460317459

'jewish town' continues that same feeling, but explores williams & perlman's impeccable talent further. this is a fine example of the perfect film score. verdict; it may be a tough subject and a difficult experience to bear, but schindler's list is a film to be seen by all. schindler's list (8/10)";9 May 2017;8;['liam', 'ralph', 'caroline', 'german', 'concerned', 'jewish', 'harrowing', 'real', 'terrifying', 'destructive', 'black', 'white', 'german', 'concerned', 'jewish', 'beautiful', 'final', 'heartbreaking', 'more', 'more', 'more', 'liam', 'raw', 'absolute', 'realistic', 'great', 'incredible', 'ralph', 'ruthless', 'negligent', 'great', 'most', 'pre', 'eminent', 'black', 'white', 'only', 'eerie', 'particular', 'little', 'red', 'disturbing', 'bloody', 'close', 'brutal', 'iconic', 'breathtaking', 'black', 'white', 'excellent', 'single', 'intricate', 'main', 'pleasing', 'distressing', 'traumatic', 'jewish', 'same', 'impeccable', 'fine', 'perfect', 'tough', 'difficult'];0.0791795550128883

341;Lee-107;"after the release of 'saving private ryan', spielberg, in one of his interviews said that the purpose of a ""war"" film was to disenchant people from war, to show it so horrifyingly that no one would ever want a repetition of what happened in wwi and wwii. spielberg's purpose in 'schindler's list' which he made five years before 'spr' is much the same. with calculated detail he drives home the horrors of war constantly. a third world war may not have the nazis but there will always be someone who will be equally brainwashed and equally cruel as the nazis were to the jews. i've seen war films before(the series 'escape from sobibor' which i think was the most vivid), but spielberg manages to show war in 'schindler's list' with such a menacing tenacity that you actually have to look away from the screen in some of the scenes. the story of oskar schindler starts in a very film noir style(especially the sequence of him in the bar), giving us the impression of him as a typical smooth-talking manipulative lady's man. but this is a very initial primary impression of a man who might be manipulative and a womanizer but whose humanity totally overshadows any of his vices. liam neeson is truly classic and magnificent in his portrayal of schindler. his facial expressions(when he's on horseback, staring as a whole town is driven to ruins because of the nazi atrocities), his whole demeanor, his voice, make schindler one of the best characters ever portrayed by an actor. liam neeson deserved an academy award that year as much as tom hanks for 'philadelphia' did. sometimes it's a good idea to have a tie for the oscar and give the award to both! because one actor's performance is just as good and commendable as the other's, especially when you have an actor like neeson playing so complex a character as oskar schindler... ralph fiennes(who is so spectacular in 'the english patient'), also gives a charged performance as amon goeth. his feelings for helen, the jewish girl who works for him are portrayed sensitively. this movie leaves you with images, you remember the camera tracking behind neeson and into the bar, you remember him looking at the destruction of a whole town watching from a hilltop, the nazi soldier playing piano as people are getting killed, the doctors and nurses mercy-killing their patients so that they'd be dead before being shot by the nazis, the little boy who saves the life of his fellow prisoners by his clever repartee to goeth, the beautiful scene between helen and schindler in the wine basement, the boy running and hiding in a sewery, the girl in red escaping and hiding under her bed...images that linger long after they are seen. janusz kaminski's cinematography is awe-inspiring! he treats us to a visual poetry in black and white, the way he did two years later in color in 'how to make an american quilt'. spielberg's decision to use black and white is laudable, it suits the subject perfectly. even where he has used color - showing the little girl's red dress, the yellow tones of the candle burning when the rabbi is chanting in yiddish - the effect is poignant and symbolic. to say that 'schindler's list' is a memorable film would be to understate its majesty. it is an altogether breathtaking cinematic experience!";17 March 2002;10;['private', 'spr', 'same', 'third', 'cruel', 'vivid', 'menacing', 'typical', 'manipulative', 'initial', 'primary', 'manipulative', 'classic', 'magnificent', 'facial', 'whole', 'whole', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'commendable', 'other', 'complex', 'spectacular', 'english', 'helen', 'jewish', 'whole', 'dead', 'little', 'fellow', 'clever', 'beautiful', 'helen', 'red', 'inspiring', 'visual', 'black', 'white', 'american', 'black', 'white', 'laudable', 'little', 'red', 'yellow', 'yiddish', 'poignant', 'symbolic', 'memorable', 'cinematic'];0.0855691056910569
342;johnmschofield;last january a friend and i travelled to kracow in poland for a long weekend and while we were there we visited a town 50 kilometres from kracow called oswiecim or what the nazis called auschwitz. had we visited that place 65 years ago i suspect what we would have seen then was graphically illustrated in this film. i do not know whether the film is historically accurate but the horror and degradation did take place and a man named schindler tried to get a number of people out of that area before they became statistics too. the film in my opinion probably describes the times for those in nazi occupied mainland europe perfectly. in order to get anything that you wanted or needed you had to deal directly with people who had the power to have anybody killed on a whim not just because they could but also because they probably liked it. oskar schindler was an extremely good actor he must have been to have done what he did. yes he paid a lot of money for these peoples lives but he had to go along with whatever happened no matter how bad to achieve what he did. the 1200 people he saved would probably not have survived but for his actions. this film may as well be a cctv tape of those times and is therefore not fiction and anybody watching the film for the first time needs to keep that in mind.;27 July 2009;10;['last', 'long', 'accurate', 'good', 'bad', 'first'];0.1
343;Theflyace;"candles slowly burn during the shabbat in a jewish household. after many hours of burning and illumination, the flame goes out and gives off ominously rising smoke and reveals the black and white image that snuck in as the candles shrunk. such is the tone that is set for the rest of the film schindler's list, steven spielberg's tribute/justice to the millions of jewish people slaughtered during the holocaust. this particular chapter of the holocaust is the portrait of the mysterious oskar schindler, and his actions during the war in poland. we see him begin as an opportunist businessman, who wines and dines with the nazi higher ups in exchange to receive funding for a factory he wishes to profit from. for both parties, jews are considered ""cheap labor,"" therefore schindler hires itzhak stern to handle rounding up a workforce in his new factory. stern is really trying to save as many people as the ""herr direktor"" will allow from certain death. over the course of the film, something changes in schindler that drives him to save ""his jews"" because he begins to realize the atrocities being committed around him, and that he must make a difference, even at the risk of losing his life in the process. every actor in this film is perfect, no matter how big or small the role is. liam neeson gives his best work here as the complicated schindler. it could have been a stereotypical ""revelation"" motivated performance, but neeson never condescends to a perfunctory level. he is complimented in his performance by ben kingsley as the loyal and determined stern. the actor who steals the film is ralph fiennes as amon goeth. he, like neeson, has the hardest task of any actor, to give humanity to someone who is morally reprehensible on paper. his is one of those performances that was robbed of the recognition it deserved. much like the film the shawshank redemption, this film delves into the souls of the people in the middle of a dark situation. schindler himself is an enigma. here we have a man who begins thinking about only himself and his money, but realizes what his actions mean in the big picture of what's going on. as the film progresses, he begins to care about the people he has saved, and pours every ounce of energy and every cent of his money to make sure that they do not suffer the same fate as those who couldn't be saved. the character of stern acts as his moral compass, convincing his boss that what he is doing is right. he does not always agree with his boss' logic, but works to make sure no one is killed or taken away to the ovens. the evil incarnate character amon goeth, is also conflicted by his feelings about this whole affair for one reason. he too hates the jews with a brainwashed passion, but ironically falls in love with his jewish housemaid. he struggles to come to terms with this fact while still managing to shoot jews at random for sport. director steven spielberg and writer steve zaillian take a really smart approach to the material, by not making the characters one-dimensional or motivated by a cheap cliche. we are never really clued into what makes schindler change his mind about his workers until the very end of the film, which is a brilliant storytelling masterstroke. there is absolutely nothing glamorous at all in this film, which lends its greater sense of verisimilitude. the cinematography is in black-and-white, as it should be. if it had been in color, it would have been all wrong. spielberg and janusz kaminski shoot this like a documentary, lending itself to far more realistic shots and actions than a straightforward drama. the violence is truly gut-wrenching and sickening, but again, it is an accurate view of what happened in real life. the disturbing image of bodies burning and the billowing smoke from the auschwitz chimney won't leave one's mind for years after seeing this film. the girl in the red coat is the most haunting image from the film, as the filmmakers wished to convey the confusion of how people didn't even know this was happening, even though it ""stuck out like a girl wearing a red coat."" spielberg knew just when to add color to the film, the moments when there is true despair or hope at the end of the film this film is made all the more haunting because of the first-rate score by john williams. backed with the violinist itzhak perlman, williams delivers one of the best scores in eternity, and one that is never overblown. both use their beauty to convey a dark passage in history, but most importantly, to highlight the success of the people saved. at a first glance, it would seem spielberg was the wrong man to make this film, as his focus in his early career was on entertainment films and escapist images. with this film, we see him blossom into a true artist. he does not mince images or words in this film whatsoever. he presents the events depicted like it was, stark and hopeless. spielberg so poured his heart into this material that it was reported that he sobbed every day during filming, but wouldn't relent in telling this story. this film is the greatest achievement in his career, not only in terms of oscars and recognition, but his transformation as an artist.";7 February 2014;10;['jewish', 'many', 'black', 'white', 'such', 'jewish', 'particular', 'high', 'cheap', 'new', 'many',

349;quin1974;in 1993 i saw this movie in the theater the day it opened here in holland, and it made such an impact on me that i was afraid to watch it ever since. now, seven years later, i watched it again, alone, on a saturday night, and again it was one of the most harrowing movie experiences of my life, even on the small screen. this one is up there among other movies about the holocaust, such as night and fog (resnais, 1956) and shoah (1985). i think that when you watch these three movies you can catch a glimpse of what these have gone through during ww2, although this of course can never be established through film, this horror. all during this movie you are bombarded in a spielberg-fashion speed with images that are so gruesome that they bring you on the verge of tears. it was only till the last scene of the real schindler jews and the actors laying stones on schindler's grave that i broke. the music, the imagery, the sensitivity with which spielberg handled this subject was so convincing and staggering that it truly made me cry. i don't think spielberg will ever make a more personal movie than this. during the screening i attended seven years ago some people found the imagery too much to handle, and walked out of the theater. it was just too much. i think 1,000 words are not nearly enough to express what i felt and still feel about this movie, so i will just say: if you haven't seen this movie yet, see it. if you've already seen it, vote for it and go see it again. 10/10;29 January 2001;10;['afraid', 'harrowing', 'small', 'other', 'such', 'gruesome', 'last', 'real', 'convincing', 'staggering', 'personal', 'much', 'enough'];-0.1361111111111111

352;tripper0;after having finally seen 'schindlers list', i can say that it is an absolutely fantastic and emotional experience. when i was finished watching the film i was left completely speechless. i couldn't actually find the words to describe it. i'll give it a try now. on technical aspects of the movie, everything was solid. it was a very beautiful film to look at. shot in black and white, there was very little color, except at the very end of the movie. also, a little color is inserted into the film highlighting the often mentioned girl in the red dress. it is a beautiful scene, but i am a little unclear as what the symbolism of it actually was. even being unclear about it, one theory i saw was that it highlighted her as an individual, and in doing so it creates and individual story, showing that every person there was an individual in and of themselves. i'm not sure if that is true, but it makes sense. i often found myself wondering about her fate, so my theory is that spielberg gave us a person to wonder about, if they had lived or died. then we may feel like all the jewish families who were not positive of the fate of there loved ones until much later on. there are way too many powerful, and at times sad and disturbing scenes to talk about right now. of these scenes, there is the all to disturbing liquidation of the ghetto. the forced labour camp scenes as well were very disturbing. they were mostly disturbing because of the head of the camps, amon goeth, a very ruthless and awful human being that just seems to shoot people for fun. just because. and its disturbing to watch the disregard with which he does it. amon goeth was played disturbingly by ralph fiennes, who should have won an oscar, but thats neither here nor there. he was some absolutley disturbing scenes that are just brilliantly played out. i can point out a few, for instance a scene when he is talking with his jewish servant(i will not tell you about what)and he does the whole conversation himself. watching him just change his tone, psychologically, in a matter of seconds is amazing. another i remember, is one when he is going to shoot a jew in the back of the head, and his gun won't work. its just a terrifying scene in many ways, but fiennes plays it in such a way that you can tell he has no morals or cares for jews, but a blood lust. other than that though, his stare, his evil stare showed nothing but hatred, and i don't know how fiennes did it, but it is a horribly evil stare. his eyes said everything. this was the highlight performance in the movie. however, liam neeson and ben kingsley put together two great performances as well. what is amazing between these two is watching their relationship change throughout the movie, until neeson(as schindler) is repentent and changed, and really sad he didn't do more, as he felt he could have. really, one of the most heart wrenching scenes in the film is when schindler feels he could have done more and that he just didn't do enough. in the film he goes from an opportunist to a true hero, an unselfish one. the gift he gets from the jews, and his embrace of itzhak stern(kingsley)are truly wonderful and, apparently real moments. its hard not to be touched. not surprisingly however, the direction was absolutely brilliant. spielberg made a movie that was close to his heart and this was a labour of love, and it will stand as his masterpiece. you can always tell you are watching the hand of a master, and i knew that when i started this film, spielberg was going to give me something special, and he did. the only mild flaw, most people seem to think, is the small portion of the film at the end that is in color. it seems a little out of place, and that spielberg added it on maybe for himself. and i think he should be allowed to do so after the three hours before hand that were extremely emotional. i didn't hate the very end like some people though, because to me it was a way to show us that this disaster, the holocaust, happened only very recently, only fifty years ago(at the time this movie was released). the fact is that some people who lived through this tragedy are still alive, and spielberg, i feel, uses the end of the film to bridge that generation gap and remind us how recently this all happened. so finally, all i can say is wow. not many movies has left me speechless. this was one of the most emotional films i may have ever seen, remembering that i ended up crying a bit in three different places. usually i might cry once, but not three times. it is subject matter that isn't taken lightly, and shouldn't. everything in its three hours are necessary and brilliant. everyone should see this movie once, if for nothing else than an education. just a brilliant film. 10 out

359;YellowManReanimated;"after helping to pioneer the blockbuster in the '70s and '80s with films such as jaws, close encounters of the third kind, raiders of the lost ark and e. t., spielberg took an extremely unexpected turn in the '90s by making this hard-hitting, powerful drama about a man's unique transformation in the midst of the holocaust. oskar schindler, played by liam neeson, is a failed german industrialist on the make. he travels to poland in order to exploit the opportunities created by the marginalisation of the jews who live there and the impending legislation which will make it illegal for them to own their own businesses. schindler wants to set up a factory which will help to produce munitions for the war but he has no capital, nor does he have any particular business acumen. what he does have, however, is charisma and an innate ability to charm and ingratiate himself among the people who possess what he is lacking. so, he makes an offer to a couple of jewish businessmen: he will enter into a partnership with them, they will provide the money and the expertise, he will provide an acceptable aryan face to front the venture. after a lot of reluctance, the proposal is accepted and schindler is up-and-running. initially he is able to be all things to all people: a friend to the jews, as they are making his scheme possible; a friend to the nazis, as he needs their permission in order to continue operating. however, placing himself so squarely between the perpetrators of mass genocide and the victims of that genocide eventually forces schindler to reflect on the horrific brutality that is being carried out around him. he evolves, genuinely and convincingly, from being a shallow, carefree individual to a concerned businessman to, eventually, being a genuine campaigner and inspiring political operator in the cause of defending as many jewish lives as possible. neeson plays the title role with both grace and deep compassion and he is deservedly revered for his performance. ralph fiennes also ought to be mentioned for his commitment to the portrayal of sadism and casual psychopathy as nazi officer amon goeth. the cinematography is timeless and crisp. the scenes we are shown are at times brutal and distressing (any film covering this topic must of course include such scenes). however, what makes this film an enduring classic is that it finds light amidst the darkness, it finds hope amidst the depths of despair. i've heard this film criticised as being a film about success when it is supposed to be covering the greatest of human failures; i disagree with this. this film explains how, as a human race, we find a way to continue existing despite the horror and destruction that we are capable of causing. it reminds us that evil exists but not at the expense of all else. schindler represents the person within us who, despite initial appearances, is capable of genuine heroism. it's at our moments of deepest darkness that we most require a light to shine. schindler's light shone during a time of insanity and barbarity. in summary, spielberg does not ignore the darkness, his genius is that he is also able to find space for the light.";15 November 2021;9;['such', 'close', 'third', 'unexpected', 'powerful', 'unique', 'german', 'impending', 'illegal', 'own', 'particular', 'innate', 'jewish', 'acceptable', 'able', 'possible', 'mass', 'horrific', 'shallow', 'carefree', 'concerned', 'genuine', 'inspiring', 'political', 'many', 'jewish', 'possible', 'deep', 'ralph', 'casual', 'crisp', 'brutal', 'distressing', 'such', 'great', 'human', 'human', 'capable', 'evil', 'initial', 'capable', 'genuine', 'deep', 'able'];0.0452380952380952

369;shattenjager777;"""schindler's list"" isn't by any means a bad film, but it's not particularly good either (a decent way of describing spielberg's entire career). some elements of the film are very good, even excellent, but it has issues that are too deep to be overcome, making it an overall mediocre work that certainly doesn't deserve the high praise it has gotten (much of which is because of spielberg's treatment of the film itself--donating his salary to charity, having the film sent to high schools around the country, etc.). the film's issues begin with its main character, who begins the film as a complex, interesting character who seems to possess a moral flexibility that would have been a great asset in such a changing society as his and then is reduced to a simple man with a conscience despite his surroundings. the transformation is unwelcome and not at all credible, since it seems to be precipitated by absolutely nothing (the holocaust has already begun around him, so that cannot be the precipitating event.) the change is made all the more ridiculous by the epilogue of schindler's later life, which makes it clear that the first version of his character is more accurate. liam neeson performs very capably in the role, especially in the vastly more interesting opening scenes, but his performance is not enough to save such a ridiculous character arc. there is also a terrible lack of focus in the film, as it spends such a large amount of time dealing with its villain, amon goeth, as to take away from schindler's presence in the film. goerth is also a more exciting character than the second schindler and performed with such an incredible menace and dark intelligence by ralph feinnes that the viewer can easily long to see more of goeth and less of schindler, which is not a good thing for a film with such moral certainty. beyond these problems, there is the visual style of the film, which is a blatant rip-off of alain resnais's ""night and fog."" the black and white past with color present footage, intended to connect the past to the present, is clumsily done, as the subject of the holocaust's connection to the present is never once broached within the film. the colorization of the red swastika and girl's jacket also adds absolutely nothing to the film. it's pointless and smacks of spielberg trying to prove his own depth. however, ""schindler's list"" does have its fine points. the film is still quite pretty to look at, including an incredibly beautiful, depressing image of jewish graves as a nazi road, and a number of other truly beautiful images that capture the sorrow of the holocaust extraordinarily well. the acting is also truly excellent, highlighted by ralph feinnes in a tragically under-noticed turn as amon goerth. finally, john williams's score is hauntingly beautiful and has an understatement the film would have done well to mimic. these are cosmetic elements, perhaps, and they certainly don't make up for the film's major flaws, but they certainly improve the film from the train wreck it might otherwise have been. overall, ""schindler's list"" is an overrated, average film. the performances and score are top-notch, but its message is not sent as vividly as it is by some other films about the same subject (most notably the aforementioned ""night and fog"") and its characterization of its protagonist leaves a lot to be desired. it's not a waste of time, but films such as ""night and fog,"" sidney lumet's ""the pawnbroker,"" roman polanski's ""the pianist,"" and roberto benigni's ""life is beautiful"" explore the holocaust much more poignantly with far less fanfare.";23 April 2007;5;['bad', 'good', 'decent', 'entire', 'good', 'excellent', 'deep', 'overall', 'mediocre', 'high', 'much', 'high', 'main', 'complex', 'interesting', 'moral', 'great', 'simple', 'unwelcome', 'credible', 'ridiculous', 'later', 'clear', 'first', 'accurate', 'interesting', 'enough', 'ridiculous', 'terrible', 'large', 'exciting', 'second', 'incredible', 'dark', 'ralph', 'more', 'less', 'good', 'such', 'moral', 'visual', 'blatant', 'black', 'white', 'present', 'red', 'pointless', 'own', 'fine', 'pretty', 'beautiful', 'jewish', 'other', 'beautiful', 'excellent', 'ralph', 'beautiful', 'cosmetic', 'major', 'overrated', 'average', 'top', 'other', 'same', 'aforementioned', 'such', 'roman', 'beautiful', 'less'];0.1593567588325652

392;heywood100;while trying to remember them off the top of my head, every other spielberg film i've seen (with the possible exception of saving private ryan) has been an over-sentimental crowd-pleaser. if you think about it, schindler's list could well be accused of the same - it's all perfectly designed to tug at the heartstrings (especially the modern-day section at the end) and i've certainly never met anyone with a bad word to say about the film. the difference, the thing that makes schindler's list different from all those others, is that no amount of schmaltz could diminish the power of oskar schindler's story. schindler's list is not a lyrical, wistful treatise on the horrors of war. for the most part it is a bone-crushingly upfront recounting of the personal and collective horrors faced by the jews during the second world war. some of the more violent scenes are reminiscent of the opening from that other spielberg classic, saving private ryan. the difference is that while many of those in saving private ryan became soldiers and put themselves in the line of fire by choice, the people in schindler's list are innocent of any crime and absent of any choice. the indiscriminate killings and attitudes of most of the germans, and particularly amon goeth (played excellently by ralph fiennes), chills to the bone, as does the well known appearance of the little girl in the red coat who provides one of the few splashes of colour in an otherwise aptly dark and dour film. oskar schindler himself makes a transformation, from cold-hearted factory-owner using the jews to make money into a man so disgusted by the crimes of his fellows that he puts his own life at risk to save others, that is so obvious and predictable that it should feel contrived. but it doesn't. and i have no doubt that there are other glaring faults throughout, but it would take a crass mind to even notice them, let alone write them down. the power and scale of this film (the amount of extras used is unbelievable, like one of eisenstein's films) are the things that win out, and will continue to win out for generations to come. if spielberg is remembered for just one film, it will surely be schindler's list.;18 March 2003;9;['other', 'possible', 'private', 'sentimental', 'same', 'modern', 'bad', 'different', 'lyrical', 'wistful', 'most', 'upfront', 'personal', 'collective', 'second', 'violent', 'reminiscent', 'other', 'private', 'many', 'private', 'innocent', 'absent', 'indiscriminate', 'most', 'ralph', 'little', 'red', 'few', 'dark', 'dour', 'cold', 'hearted', 'disgusted', 'own', 'obvious', 'predictable', 'other', 'crass', 'unbelievable'];-0.06375

400;mikel weisser;perhaps it's a clue about the sad state of our world, the inevitability of the holocausts of the past and the holocausts yet to come, that a full half of the films rated higher on the imdb top 250 than this monumental movie celebrate violence and war. blood and death are now and have always been the high art of our greedy raging world. we can pray for the future, but peace can only come true if people are willing to see the world through the vision of justice, respect for humanity and willing to sacrifice so others may live. that is why i suggest the visions of keneally, spielberg and oskar schindler. this movie is so magnificent from here on out all my grades will go down in perspective. 12 oscar noms, 7 wins (including picture and director), a host of other accolades, all amply deserved. there is just so much to admire: the mix of large scale storytelling with countless smaller story arcs (kudos to steven zaillian's oscar winning adapation of keneally's wondrous novel), hundreds of amazing and daring cinematic touches (set design, cinematography, and editing all also picked up statues) dozens upon dozens of bravura performances, monolithic sets with literal casts of thousands, impressive historical accuracy, the list is near endless, a series of beauties rising into ultimate truth: a film with a soul. perhaps the powerful beauty of this film is that spielberg does not put a hollywood polish on the fact that oskar schindler was a comprised man yet capable of tremendous goodness. in some ways this can be seen as spielberg's first mature film and it's entirely appropriate that this was the first time he collected an oscar after 5 noms. the journalist in me wants to document all the details in this well earned victory, but the humanist in me just wants to thanks everyone involved for the fact it exists. whatever else may be wrong with our planet we can still find hope in the fact that men like schindler are remembered and revered and honored in such an celebrated and immensely popular film. if my words can make you see a film or work for peace, let this one be the one, let now be the time.;6 May 2002;10;['sad', 'full', 'monumental', 'high', 'greedy', 'true', 'willing', 'willing', 'magnificent', 'other', 'much', 'large', 'countless', 'small', 'oscar', 'wondrous', 'amazing', 'daring', 'cinematic', 'monolithic', 'literal', 'impressive', 'historical', 'endless', 'ultimate', 'powerful', 'capable', 'tremendous', 'first', 'mature', 'appropriate', 'first', 'wrong', 'celebrated', 'popular'];0.2058377425044091

408;JohnBoyRoy;"i had not seen schindler's list in it's entirety for a few years. the last time that i viewed it i was a lot younger and couldn't really digest it's complexities to the full. of course i was able to appreciate the excellence of it's aethestics and formalities, but it was the great depth to the characters that confused me: when you are younger you view the world in as black and white a vision as this film itself, as everyone knows. i was mesmerised by the performances of liam ""i'm retired"" neeson and ralph fienes. even neeson's occasionally shaky accent can't hinder the fact that in his character he has realised the ambiguity and hinted capitalist, turned ever so slowly into a humanist by what should have been apparent to him all along - namely the unmotivated slaughter of his workforce. his motivations change ever so convincingly from money to conscience and by the end of the picture the most moving moment belongs to him and not to the survivors of the terror. fienes is such a complex character it's untrue. spielberg has shot the pair throughout the film as equals-and-not-quite oposites. they are frequently intercut going through the same actions and mostly in the same space on screen) shot with an equally spaced two-shot. this brotherhood means that fienes is hard(er) to detest than you might think. at times he appears to take on board schindler's advice and passificity. he doesn't really hate the jewish people eiether - he's a massacist, a lover of violence and a generally nasty bloke who just needs an excuse to abuse and kill. at one point we see him distressed at a gun misfiring again and again - it is not the gun not working, but the fact that his resolve to kill is failing after the first click of the trigger that is distressing him, i feel. at heart he is a vulnerable coward. the various acts of violence are perfectly integrated into the flow of the picture and therefore as unexpected and unmotivated as their real-life counterparts, unlike polanski's 'pianist' in which they were insulting setpieces. spielberg's film has a much greater feel of authenticity than polanski's and is much more powerful. it is full of touches in which you can relate to and understand, moments the summarise the best (and worst) in human nature, whereas the pianist will feel like just one big cliche of the holocaust, after viewing 'sl'. this really is a powerful film, its just a pity that nobody seems to have learned from what it is based on. 8/10";5 May 2004;8;['few', 'last', 'young', 'full', 'able', 'great', 'young', 'black', 'white', 'liam', 'neeson', 'ralph', 'shaky', 'apparent', 'unmotivated', 'moving', 'complex', 'untrue', 'same', 'same', 'det', 'jewish', 'nasty', 'distressed', 'first', 'vulnerable', 'various', 'unexpected', 'unmotivated', 'real', 'polanski', 'great', 'powerful', 'full', 'good', 'bad', 'human', 'big', 'powerful'];0.0586206896551724

413;willwoodmill;"in the early 90s steven spielberg had built a reputation as being the master of kid-friendly family films like e.t., jaws, the indiana jones trilogy, close encounters of the third kind, hook, the list just goes on and on. sure today he has films like munich and saving private ryan under his belt so spielberg making a non kid-friendly film isn't very strange to us, but back then it was unheard of. so considering his previous career, schindler's list might be the biggest departure from style any director has made in the history of film making. even if you are among the more ""experienced"" film goers, meaning people who have seen several incredibly violent, disgusting, and down right disturbing films, schindler's list will still make your stomach turn, and you'll want to look away at some of the more graphic moments in the film. stephen spielberg really does not hold back, and tries to give an uncompromising depiction of the holocaust, which in the earlier 90s was not something that was commonly done, sure you had films like night and fog, and shoah, but your average, everyday joe wasn't going to ever see those films. and there were films like sophie's choice, and judgement at nuremberg, but they really focused on the after math, and didn't really directly confront their audience the same way that schindler's list so boldly did. schindler's list is a biopic about oskar schindler, a member of the nazi party, who is runs a factory, in german occupied poland, that uses jews as workers. oskar schindler is played ever so greatly by liam neeson in what is definitely his best role yet (in my opinion tom hanks robbed him of the best actor oscar). one of the best things about schindler's list is the character of oskar schindler, oskar schindler was obviously not a righteous hero throughout the entirety of the film. after all he was a member of the nazi party, and some viewers may take issue with this, but the film would be so much more dull and lose its complexity and depth, if schindler was a straight forward hero fighting the bad guys. the way stephen spielberg presents it is far more interesting, (after all stephen spielberg said he was drawn to the paradoxical nature of oskar schindler) and far more accurate to the real life oskar schindler, and accuracy is something that schindler's list strives for. the film was based upon the real life testimonies and accounts of the people who survived the events. steven spielberg at first did not want to direct schindler's list, he didn't think he was ""mature"" enough to handle something as serious as a holocaust film. but eventually decided to do it himself when he saw the rising number of holocaust deniers. which is probably why he also wanted the film to be as close to reality as possible, he wanted something that would challenge the audience, confront them with the true horrors of the holocaust. earlier i talked about how great liam neeson's performance was, but ben kingsley, (who plays a jewish account, who works for oskar schindler) and ralph fiennes (who plays an s.s. officer in charge of a work camp.) both do amazing jobs, ralph fiennes was even nominated for best supporting actor at the academy awards. the cinematography, done by janusz kaminski who would later do saving private ryan and minority report, is also perfect, it is probably among the greatest looking contemporary black & white films out there. the film is also scored by the legendary john williams, (which is all you really need to know) after john williams first saw the film, he said it was to beautiful and he was not worthy to score it, the only people that were worthy were dead. schindler's list won the academy award for both cinematography and soundtrack. schindler's list was also the first time steven spielberg ever won an actual oscar. (he had previously won the irving g. thalberg award but that is just a lifetime achievement award.) schindler's list was films on a relatively small budget of 22 million dollars, and steven spielberg did not accept any money for making the film, he said it would be like accepting blood money. but you would never be able to guess that schindler's list was shot on a budget a 1/3 of the size of jurassic park. the sets are so massive and pay such close attention to detail, and the film was actually shot in the real life locations of where it takes place. the reason schindler's list was shot on such a small budge was because the steven spielberg and the producers thought a holocaust film might bomb, and steven spielberg was not known for making r rated films. the film did not bomb it grossed over 320 million dollars world wide, which is over 1/2 a billion dollars in 2016 dollars. i'm not going to pretend that schindler's list is flawless, perhaps its biggest flaw is the fact that 90% of the film is in english, which really clashes with spielberg's intent to keep the film as close to reality as possible, and really can take you out of some scenes. though i could see this not bothering most viewers, because the actors do such a great job portraying the people their playing that it would be hard to imagine anyone else in their roles. steven spielberg accomplished his goal of making a holocaust film that would not only be as close to the actual events as physically possible, but he also made it accessible to all audiences, (but for some of the more sheltered viewers, it would be a bit much.) 9.4/10";17 February 2016;9;['early', 'kid', 'friendly', 'close', 'third', 'sure', 'private', 'non', 'kid', 'friendly', 'strange', 'unheard', 'previous', 'big', 'experienced', 'several', 'violent', 'disgusting', 'disturbing', 'graphic', 'uncompromising', 'early', 'sure', 'average', 'everyday', 'after', 'same', 'german', 'liam', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'righteous', 'dull', 'straight', 'forward', 'bad', 'interesting', 'paradoxical', 'accurate', 'real', 'real', 'mature', 'enough', 'serious', 'close', 'possible', 'true', 'great', 'liam', 'jewish', 'ralph', 'amazing', 'ralph', 'good', 'private', 'perfect', 'great', 'contemporary', 'black', 'white', 'beautiful', 'worthy', 'only', 'worthy', 'dead', 'first', 'actual', 'small', 'able', 'massive', 'such', 'close', 'real', 'small', 'flawless', 'big', 'possible', 'most', 'great', 'hard', 'close', 'actual', 'possible', 'accessible', 'sheltered', 'much'];0.1542929292929292

419;j30bell;"""gawd bless you mister schindler"", is one of the few phrases not to appear in schindler's list, which is useful in that it enables us to distinguish it from a frank capra film. well, to be fair, the phrase ""shoot her now, on my authority"" isn't in it's a wonderful life either. schindler's list - the story of a war profiteer who saves the lives of over a thousand jews from krakow ghetto during wwii - is one of the sacred cows of modern cinema. this is partly because of its subject matter, the excellent performances of the three lead actors, and the epic length and flashy direction of stephen - ooh what a long film i'm making (it's in black and white y'know) - spielberg. schindler's list is a good film, and there are some performances of real note. kingsley reprises his role as gandhi and fiennes and neeson look fab in black and white. there is also nice mutual tension and understanding between schindler and goeth, which makes their scenes together really watchable. having said all that, the film can be really infuriating. why, for instance, does spielberg try to blur the film/history distinction by shooting it in black and white and having real holocaust survivors turn up at the end? does the film really need this kind of ""legitimacy"" for audiences to take it seriously? and where are the jewish characters? i can almost hear spielberg with his screenwriters... ""woody, hi, i'd like you to do schindler and goeth"". ""ah, but, you know, like, that sounds great! but what about the jews huh - i think i could do really good job with some of the jewish characters"" woody allen replies. ""yeah, hear what you say woody, but i've promised that to my old buddy george lucas - he's getting in some practice for a project he's working on called the yellow peril, or the phantom menace or something"". one review of schindler's list describes stern as ""schindler's conscience"" and that's just about it. spielberg has outsourced his casting for jewish characters to jimny cricket, which is a real shame because, apart from anything else, it denies them their humanity. in fact, you don't have to be a particularly attentive viewer to see spielberg's less-than-light touch all over this film. you get the sophisticated monster cliche, with the stormtrooper playing mozart (suspiciously well) on an old upright piano during the liquidation of the krakow ghetto. you get the violent guard cooing over a jewish baby ""ein kind, ein kind!"" you get the goeth proving how evil he is by hitting his maid. and, of course, you get that ridiculously over-sentimental ending where schindler makes his final transition to avatar of the almighty. then there's the death. young girls and boys are killed, women are killed, old folk kick it - i wouldn't be surprised if the tragic death of a young girl's fluffy rabbit only just made the cutting room floor. but, you know, i struggle to remember any adult jewish man between 18 and 60 killed on camera. did these deaths not count? david irving would be delighted. however the holocaust has been used subsequently, it remains one of the most significant and tragic events in european history. it deserved a great film treatment and it nearly got it. tragically, though he got great performances from his cast and had one of the best stories going, spielberg was unable to forget he was the same director that brought us et and close encounters. surely the point about schindler's story is that, however bad a person is, and however black the times are, everyone has a responsibility to do good when the world is going bad. the danger of this film is that the mtv generation might regard it as a clarion call for inaction there'll always be a saint like oscar schindler along to do the good work for you. 7/10.";20 December 2004;7;['few', 'useful', 'frank', 'capra', 'fair', 'wonderful', 'sacred', 'modern', 'subject', 'excellent', 'epic', 'flashy', 'long', 'black', 'white', 'good', 'real', 'neeson', 'black', 'white', 'nice', 'mutual', 'watchable', 'black', 'white', 'real', 'jewish', 'woody', 'great', 'good', 'jewish', 'woody', 'old', 'yellow', 'phantom', 'stern', 'jewish', 'real', 'attentive', 'less', 'light', 'sophisticated', 'stormtrooper', 'old', 'upright', 'violent', 'jewish', 'evil', 'sentimental', 'final', 'young', 'old', 'surprised', 'tragic', 'young', 'fluffy', 'jewish', 'delighted', 'significant', 'tragic', 'european', 'great', 'great', 'good', 'unable', 'same', 'close', 'bad', 'black', 'bad', 'good'];0.0906249999999999

423;lucasaq-1;"""this is very cruel, oskar. you're giving them hope. you shouldn't do that. *that's* cruel!"" hope, that is the key to getting through this powerhouse film from steven spielberg. he holds not bar on showing the violence surrounding the holocaust and in that he could have gotten bogged down in despair, but he keeps the pacing a flurry like his most frantic works and creates well-defined character who despite being horrifying to degree, especially ralph fiennes' amon goeth, offer some glimmer of humanity. the time is 1940's and the war is gripping europe and in poland the beginning of the holocaust has occurred as the jews are herded into a ghetto to live a very limited life for time. into this time of despair and exploitation comes a showman of sorts, oskar schindler who sees an opportunity to make a fortune from the misfortune of the jews. he first builds a rapport with high officials in the nazi army, knowing later he will need their support. next he offers the jews with something left their option to having hope of some life after the war. he does this with the help of a jewish accountant itzhak stern who becomes both his conscience and his friend. as schindler is building a well off business off of cheap jewish labor, ss officer amon goeth comes in to jump start the process of concentration camps for the jews and it is he how heads up the liquidation of the ghetto. the film chronicles the whole journey of all the characters from the start of the holocaust all the way to the end of the war and it does it expansively and personally taking note of many excruciating situations most often leading up to death. the film is held together by a fantastic timing by spielberg which mixes grief with hope and death with life. add to this some of the best performances of the modern age from liam neeson as a towering oskar schindler, ralph fiennes as the odious and delirious amon goeth, and ben kingsley as the conscience of schindler, itzhak stern, and you have one of the most powerful movies ever made. liam neeson performance is great because it has such a great transformation that he expresses brilliantly and almost brings you to tears by the end. he starts out as an indifferent business man, a profiteer intent on making his fortune. but he ends up getting very close to his works and thus gaining a heart which is broken by the end of the film by the horrors he witnesses. on the other hand, ralph fiennes performance offers different strain of powerful as he pulls the string of the evil character as he shows a sadistic taste for killing from the start. when he first arrives in the film he is approached by a jewish architect who informs him that they need to rebuild a building because the foundation is not right. he takes a second to look over what she tells him and then and tells his officers to shoot her. even though her advice he does heed, having them rebuild it after shooting her in the head, he says he could not tolerate dissent. it is terrifying performance as he hides his love for a jewish maid by repeatedly beating her. finally ben kingsley performance offers the purest of the performances as kingsley plays the straight arrow, the man ever with the heart from the beginning to the end showing an ever willingness to do what he can to make life easier for his people. he is schindler's conscience in forcing him to see the hope his enterprise is effecting for the jews. the film is shot in a stark grain of black and white thus tempering some of the violence, but it is still extremely potent as the cinematography gets into the faces of the people showing their etched emotions as well as the horrifying deaths of so many. streets filled with bodies and ash ridden streets. this stands as one of the most emotionally draining films ever created and is technically outstanding from the powerfully moving cinematography to the softly straining score by john williams and the towering performances.";22 June 2008;10;['cruel', 'cruel', 'frantic', 'ralph', 'limited', 'high', 'jewish', 'cheap', 'jewish', 'ss', 'whole', 'many', 'excruciating', 'fantastic', 'good', 'modern', 'liam', 'ralph', 'odious', 'delirious', 'powerful', 'liam', 'great', 'great', 'indifferent', 'close', 'other', 'ralph', 'different', 'powerful', 'evil', 'sadistic', 'jewish', 'right', 'jewish', 'pure', 'straight', 'easy', 'stark', 'black', 'white', 'potent', 'etched', 'horrifying', 'many', 'ridden', 'outstanding'];0.0915699404761904

429;stefanbe;"the medium of film can be used to present both fact and fiction, with realistic portrayals of historical events littered in the multiplex among the fantasy adventures. steven spielberg is renowned for his special effects-laden blockbusters, but even more so for his world war ii epics that are meant more to inform and remember rather than to entertain. his most accomplished film is schindler's list, based on the true story of a man who saved over a thousand jews from extermination. those renting the dvd just to have a fun time would be best to look elsewhere. those who are looking to view a perfect take on a very depressing time in european history will find it in schindler's list. this is not oscar bait, like so many people claim it to be. this is a upsetting and heart-wrenching motion picture that is sure to bring some people to tears. with an excellent cast, a beautiful score and harrowing camera-work, schindler's list succeeds on so many levels. set in poland during world war ii, the film centers on oskar schindler (liam neeson), a member of the nazi party who wishes to open a pots and pans factory in krakow. due to jewish workers being much cheaper than poles, he hires an accountant called itzhak stern (ben kingsley) to help roll up jews to work in the factory. soon, more and more of them are hired and while schindler originally saved the jews for profit, now he wants to save them from being gassed in the concentration camps. meanwhile, schindler meets amon goeth (ralph fiennes), a nazi soldier who takes pleasure in shooting jews. however, he also has a relationship with helen hirsch (embeth davidtz), a jewish woman who is sometimes abused, but also sometimes loved by goeth. these two stories are also connected with those of the prisoners in the ghettos and concentration camps, who are hired and saved by schindler. the images of schindler's list are very depressing and upsetting, but it could not have worked any other way. spielberg portrays nazi-occupied poland accurately and thus, it's quite possibly one of the saddest films ever made. it's not an easy film to watch, but it should certainly be mandatory viewing. schindler's list is not just a movie, it's a call for an end to prejudice. the holocaust was one of the most horrific events of the twentieth century and it is perfectly filmed by director of photography janusz kaminski. the majority of the film is in black-and-white, a very intelligent decision on spielberg's part, which actually makes the film look more realistic than if it was entirely in colour. many scenes, including one involving a jammed gun, make us stop and think that maybe we shouldn't take things for granted. steven zaillian's screenplay is tight and manages to portray these real-life people very well with excellent dialogue. in addition, john williams' score adds even more heartbreak to this tremendous film. yet, it is the actors who truly sell the film. liam neeson shows plenty of range as a man, who starts off as greedy and only looking for profit and then slowly changes into a hero. schindler is a man who wants to make money, but also wants to save lives and neeson perfectly shows a man who can't have his cake and eat it, too. ben kingsley gives very subtle work as stern, a man who is in two worlds: that of the ghettos and concentration camps and then working alongside a man who can save his fellow jews. while schindler is giving him instructions, we see that stern is secretly pulling the strings as much as he can. finally, ralph fiennes truly shows that he is one of britain's finest young actors with his role as the ruthless goeth. we see in his eyes a man who is not ""just following orders"" like some nazis were at the time, but really somebody who does believe a lot in der fuhrer's evil ideas. fiennes portrays his love for hirsch very well, showing him at a crossroads. on the one hand, he hates jews and believes them to be scum, but on the other, he has a deep admiration for helen. yet, he feels he must show his meaner side to the follow soldiers. fiennes not only shows an evil man, but a man truly in love as well. steven spielberg is the master behind this brilliant production and everything about it is composed so well. he proved with this film that he has the ability to direct serious, dramatic films and this is the film that most people will view him upon. it is the story of triumph and how if you try, you can help save the world and lead to the end of racism and violence. after all, as the talmud says, ""whoever saves one life saves the world entire."" this quote can be applied to people of all religions, not just those who oskar schindler saved years ago. that is what schindler's list is most of

432;TonysLittleFriend;"adapted from the best-selling book by thomas keneally and based on a true story, filmed in poland with an emphasis on absolute authenticity, spielberg's masterpiece ranks among the greatest films ever made about the holocaust during world war ii. it's a film about heroism with an unlikely hero at its center--catholic war profiteer oskar schindler (liam neeson), who risked his life and went bankrupt to save more than 1,000 jews from certain death in concentration camps. by employing jews in his crockery factory manufacturing goods for the german army, schindler ensures their survival against terrifying odds. at the same time, he must remain solvent with the help of a jewish accountant (ben kingsley) and negotiate business with a vicious, obstinate nazi commandant (ralph fiennes) who enjoys shooting jews as target practice from the balcony of his villa overlooking a prison camp. schindler's list gains much of its power not by trying to explain schindler's motivations, but by dramatizing the delicate diplomacy and determination with which he carried out his generous deeds. as a drinker and womanizer who thought nothing of associating with nazis, schindler was hardly a model of decency; the film is largely about his transformation in response to the horror around him. spielberg doesn't flinch from that horror, and the result is a film that combines remarkable humanity with abhorrent inhumanity--a film that functions as a powerful history lesson and a testament to the resilience of the human spirit in the context of a living nightmare. schindler's list is filmed in black and white, with one notable exception: a little blond girl running around in a red coat. this is where schindler's transformation begins, and when the true horror of war, will sink deep and hit you hard as a moment you will never forget. the whole film has stuck with me for about 6 years now, and that one particualr scene(s) that involve the child, i'll never forget. schindler's list is to me, a life altering experience, and is much more than a movie. ****/****";4 September 2004;10;['good', 'true', 'absolute', 'great', 'unlikely', 'catholic', 'bankrupt', 'more', 'certain', 'german', 'terrifying', 'same', 'solvent', 'jewish', 'vicious', 'ralph', 'much', 'delicate', 'generous', 'remarkable', 'abhorrent', 'powerful', 'human', 'black', 'white', 'notable', 'little', 'blond', 'red', 'true', 'hard', 'whole', 'more'];0.0451278659611992

444;btodorov;i had avoided to see the movie for a decade. the holocaust is so absolute an act of cruelty that it does not give good food for originality. i underestimated herr schindler, just as i naively underestimated herr spielberg. no other movie has so boldly approached a fundamental ethical controversy of this size. was herr schindler a prudent man or a remorseless exploiter? did he help or use his workers? didn't he decide to save them only when realizing he would be hunted down by the soviets? schindler is depicted as the most human of humans - his conversation with amon goeth over the real meaning of power and control can easily be included in college syllabi. and yet being so human, he is neither good nor bad: there are forces beyond him - his greed and his love of life, that allow him neither to refrain from war-time profiteering nor to subscribe to the absurd legal degradation of the jews into lesser beings (are they less kiss-able just because they carry the yellow star, would ask schindler?). but still, schindler plays only the supporting role in his own story. the central figure is itzhak stern - the bookkeeper who turned himself into a voluntary slave to the arrogant schindler in order to be able to protect his kin. the scene in which stern was brought out of the train taking him to the concentration camp, and apologized to his boss for his absent-mindedness - he got arrested because he had left his work permit - is of true biblical proportions. what is the message contained in stern? that salvation does not come by itself. schindler's jews did not beg for mercy, they negotiated with him on their own terms, they made themselves useful to him, they invested in their own physical preservation. so the movie is not about schindler being a hero or not, it is here to prove that good has a price and we cannot expect salvation for free - a moral philosophy inherent to capitalism and incomprehensible for both the feudal or the social welfare states in which benefaction from above, be it from the feudal lord or from the all-powerful bureaucratic state is conceived as the necessary condition for man's survival.;23 October 2005;10;['absolute', 'good', 'other', 'fundamental', 'ethical', 'prudent', 'remorseless', 'real', 'human', 'good', 'bad', 'absurd', 'legal', 'less', 'able', 'yellow', 'own', 'central', 'voluntary', 'arrogant', 'able', 'true', 'biblical', 'own', 'useful', 'own', 'physical', 'free', 'moral', 'inherent', 'feudal', 'social', 'feudal', 'powerful', 'bureaucratic', 'necessary'];0.1876666666666666

451;StoryCharts;schindler's list is about the idea that good triumphs over evil. small gestures of kindness can overcome the inconvenient irks of everyday life, but absolute good must rise to the occasion to meet absolute evil, no matter the cost. in this story, there is no question about the absolute evil: the innocent victims of the holocaust (the appeasement of which implicates us all, see the rise and fall of the third reich). in the backdrop of this absolute evil, our hero is not without guilt. he is a nazi party member, an unabashed adulterer and war profiteer. but when history gives him the chance, he chooses to pursue an absolute good, the saving of a thousand innocent jews from certain death. and this absolute good, pursued to the cost of his entire fortune, redeems him of all the other ills he had accumulated over his life. to give this idea life, the story's main plot is that of schindler saving the jews. to show the cost of this success, another plot tracks his fortune which is given up to save the jews. two other internal plots depict the morality of schindler and goeth. to make us experience the idea, absolute evil is given a face, a personality and a humane charm. the choices goeth and schindler make highlight the inner battles that must be won to strive for the absolute good. this story is so powerful, it's meaning so relevant, that its experience is almost beyond words. this is why movies should be made. its special resonance comes from the fact that given the ideas of such absolutes, the hero and villain are not depicted as black and white. the same story could easily have veered to a didactic history lesson, instead it is a shared experience that makes the world a better place by reminding us of what the human species is capable of doing to itself. my story chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca.;15 August 2013;9;['good', 'small', 'inconvenient', 'everyday', 'absolute', 'absolute', 'absolute', 'innocent', 'third', 'absolute', 'unabashed', 'absolute', 'innocent', 'certain', 'absolute', 'entire', 'other', 'main', 'other', 'internal', 'absolute', 'humane', 'inner', 'absolute', 'powerful', 'relevant', 'special', 'such', 'black', 'white', 'same', 'didactic', 'well', 'human', 'capable'];0.0928571428571428

466;nbwritersinbox;"i notice schindler's list is a patchwork of stories retold through the eyes of holocaust survivors. this felt entirely appropriate and gives the film a unique perspective. many outstanding wwii dramas have been made, but so few will equal this detailed, historically revealing one about those so directly affected. anecdotal encounters with german soldiers are re-enacted here: the young man who clears suitcases from a ghetto street, only surviving due to approaching nazi soldiers finding this amusing. a factory worker who survives only due to commandant goeth's pistol failing. the young boy stepping forward and pointing to an inmate the commandant has just shot, informing him this was the chicken thief. only a jewish film director should have made this film, and i wonder if it was a painful experience for spielberg at some points? he deals sensitively with a plethora of barbaric scenes including german soldiers stripping inmates, or pushing them in frustration onto the mangled bodies of less fortune kin. spielberg does not veil the horror here. we see how heads explode when a 9mm luger is discharged at point blank range. not a fan of violence, i found myself forgiving the director here, because the destruction by nazi soldiers against unarmed civilians is evidential. the nazis also tried hard to cover-up the extent of their war crimes. the screenplay tends towards the sentimental, but right at it's heart is a fascinating dichotomy of personality. the unprejudiced approach of schindler in contrast to commandant amon goethe's hate-driven, psychopathic one. unfortunately, psychopaths thrived in nazi germany and it's evident goeth (pronounced ""gort"" in german) was responsible for thousands of deaths. personally, i believe nazis hated the jews because of the desperate poverty many germans experienced after world war one. the building of the extermination camps (auschwitz being one of them) was a twisted, yet banally logical step in the process of nazis ensuring everything was taken from their chosen scapegoats... a defenseless, civilian population. the holocaust will remain one of humanity's deepest tragedies. we need to understand why it happened and schindler's list helps us all do this. those sacrificed for the sake of economic expediency was a hateful, unnecessary war crime. i sobbed uncontrollably for the last 15 minutes of this film... favorite film moment: has to be when schindler questions the use of a one-armed machinist. the superb ben kingsley as sober plant manager, stern simply raises his hands saying: ""very useful... success!"" as schindler drives away. black comedy at its finest. favorite performance: embeth davidtz as victimized housemaid ""helene hirsch"" (who had to deal daily with the violent and unpredictable goeth) is outstanding in her scenes. i cannot believe she did not receive an oscar in this role. she deserved one - despite being part of an impressive, solid cast. most haunting scene: the now famous girl in red coat scene is one of the best pieces of film direction i have ever seen. that little girl wandering amid the bullets, confusion and murder is cinematic symbolism at its finest. the soundtrack changes to children singing during this part of the film. spielberg shows us the affects of evil on the innocent with remarkable skill here. no corny dialogue, no over-acting. just undiluted representation of the consequences of hatred.";25 March 2013;10;['appropriate', 'unique', 'many', 'outstanding', 'few', 'detailed', 'anecdotal', 'german', 'young', 'ghetto', 'due', 'amusing', 'commandant', 'young', 'jewish', 'painful', 'barbaric', 'german', 'less', 'blank', 'unarmed', 'evidential', 'fascinating', 'unprejudiced', 'psychopathic', 'evident', 'pronounced', 'german', 'responsible', 'desperate', 'many', 'twisted', 'logical', 'defenseless', 'civilian', 'deep', 'economic', 'hateful', 'unnecessary', 'last', 'favorite', 'armed', 'sober', 'useful', 'black', 'fine', 'favorite', 'housemaid', 'violent', 'unpredictable', 'outstanding', 'impressive', 'solid', 'most', 'famous', 'red', 'good', 'little', 'cinematic', 'fine', 'innocent', 'remarkable', 'undiluted'];0.1519557823129252

472;John-423;i admit, i have never been a big fan of steven spielberg. i must also admit however that i have a great deal of respect for his charming and subsequent brainwashing of hollywood, and how easily he has made himself a brand name that always commands respect despite having made some of hollywood's most overrated and tired films. with schindler's list he truly created some powerful images, thought provoking and inciting in how they make you react...but... that's about where it ends. the talent of steven lies in his ability to pull the strings of an audience, and in placing his propaganda so effectively, yet in this film with such a weak cast (other than ralph fiennes who was very effective as opposed to the generally weak and painful to watch liam neeson) and tired subject he breaks no new ground. not to say it did not have its beautiful scenes, the executions and murders were poignant and well done, but lost much of their effect being coupled with so much overdone melodrama and sap. its about time hollywood wakes up, we need new directors who are bold yet sensible enough to know that there is no such thing as too far, but are intelligent enough to make a film that can rely on something other than pure shock, and that sometimes just a little is not enough and this is perfect evidence of that point. this film would have been excellent had a master such as stanley kubrick made it, but as it stands schindlers list garners a 2 out of 10 in my eyes and is one of spielberg's better films, but if nothing else its far superior to et and the wretched saving private ryan.;9 November 2002;1;['big', 'great', 'charming', 'subsequent', 'overrated', 'tired', 'powerful', 'weak', 'other', 'ralph', 'effective', 'weak', 'painful', 'tired', 'new', 'beautiful', 'poignant', 'much', 'much', 'new', 'bold', 'sensible', 'such', 'intelligent', 'other', 'pure', 'little', 'enough', 'perfect', 'excellent', 'such', 'well', 'superior', 'wretched', 'private'];0.1743873685837971
473;snakejenkins;there is a reason steven spielberg is a household name. he is, quite simply, the greatest director in the history of the medium. he understands film and how it works, but more importantly than that, he understands his audience. he understands how he can best communicate the story he wants to tell to the masses, without sacrificing truth and his own identity. schindler's list is a glowing testament to that fact and it is spielberg's finest work to date. do i ever think he'll surpass schindler's list? it's possible i suppose, but i think the story was so personal, that he won't really want to. this is steven spielberg's magnum opus. there are conflicting truths about oskar schindler and what type of person he was. when you compare the movie to what his family say about him, there are small inconsistencies. before i had seen the film i had heard both sides of the argument and felt fairly safe in feeling that both sides of that man were represented on screen. the business man, and the savior. i think the film portrays him as a business man who doesn't really understand the good he's doing until it's almost done. i like that. that's truth. that's human. that's who i'd bet oskar schindler was. looking back on the film, i'd say it's one of the best looking films i've ever seen. that's not to say it's pretty. it's high contrast black and white was an inspired choice. i'm partial to black and white anyway. there's something mysterious and nostalgic about it. but the lighting and cinematography by janusz kaminski (his first collaboration with spielberg) are a glory to watch. i particularly liked liam neeson's performance as oskar schindler. it was quiet and reserved until it needed to be loud and booming. i liked how he was able to shift character to blend with the nazis then right back to dealing with his workers. it was a very nuanced performance. one of his best. all in all schindler's list is a powerful film about saving lives. one man spends all his life making a fortune, then spends every cent of it to bring safety to 1,100 jews. that is beauty. within schindler's list there is a small bit of dialog about what power actually is. honestly the answer doesn't come until the end of the film. whoever saves one life, saves the world entire.;7 August 2004;9;['great', 'own', 'fine', 'possible', 'personal', 'magnum', 'conflicting', 'small', 'safe', 'good', 'human', 'good', 'pretty', 'high', 'black', 'white', 'partial', 'black', 'white', 'mysterious', 'nostalgic', 'first', 'quiet', 'loud', 'booming', 'able', 'good', 'powerful', 'small', 'entire'];0.1682716049382716
474;philfromno;to say that you don't like speilberg is almost unamerican, certain to get you dismissed as an arty naysayer. how could you not love jaws, raiders of the lost ark, close encounters of the third kind, and schindler's list? indeed, how could you not. they are all honed and perfected in every possible way. anything that you might not enjoy, that might not contribute to your complete and utter passive entertainment, has been sandpapered away, leaving a smooth, coated lozenge of american moviemaking. they are perfection personified. and while that makes these films impossible to hate, it also makes them impossible to love, at least in the way that i love movies. i want my favorite films to push back, to argue with me, and with themselves. what has been lost in the process of perfection is personality, the willingness to fail, to be boring, or slow, or stupid, or half-baked. to write a line of bad dialogue, to cut a scene too short or too long. to risk an ugly shot in search of a mind blowing one, or to move the camera and risk a shaky scene. godard, the anti speilberg if there ever was one, did all of these things over and over. to watch a godard film, even a truly awful one (and there were quite a few), is thrilling. to watch a bad speilberg film (say, 1941) is numbing and unbearable, as the lack of personality simply shines through. and then there is schindler's list, speilberg's 'art' film. visually, it makes all manner of stylistic references to everyone from kurosawa to bergman (two decidely risk taking filmmakers), but spiritually it's closer in spirit to lean's lawrence of arabia or doctor zhivago, 'quality' films where even the beauty is stifling. it seems designed, much like his action blockbusters, so that there is nothing bad you can say about it. great photography abounds, but never in a way that makes you want to sit up and notice. it's like a series of postcards from the holocaust. it's emotionally wrenching, at times, but never in a way that demands that you become uncomfortable. and it builds up to a treacly ending that rings so false that it's almost embarrassing. so there you go. i'm sure i've made some people hate me, but so be it.;13 September 2002;6;['unamerican', 'certain', 'close', 'third', 'possible', 'complete', 'utter', 'passive', 'smooth', 'american', 'impossible', 'impossible', 'least', 'favorite', 'boring', 'slow', 'stupid', 'baked', 'bad', 'short', 'long', 'ugly', 'shaky', 'anti', 'godard', 'awful', 'few', 'bad', 'unbearable', 'stylistic', 'decidely', 'close', 'bad', 'great', 'wrenching', 'uncomfortable', 'false', 'embarrassing', 'sure'];-0.2408289241622574

477;Bob_647;schindler's list is based on a 1983 novel, schindler's ark. it tells the story of the efforts of oscar schindler, a german, to help jews during the holocaust. played by liam neeson, oscar is not an easy character to comprehend. it takes you time to fully understand who he is. he is a person who might come across selfish to you at first. he is an opportunistic businessman. he comes across as one who, even during the wartime, is trying to find opportunities to make money rather than worrying about people's lives. but deep inside, he has a heart bigger than the most and at a time when jews were struggling to find a helping hand, he helped more than a thousand jews. he is not a person who will give you sympathy for you are going to lose someone close, but he is one who would take actions to save your closed one and not tell you when he does. you can see this in the movie when a jewish lady approaches him begging to get her parents out of the concentration camp and into his factory. at first, he not only denies her help but also lashes out at his assistant showing frustration how his for-profit factory has come to be known to people outside as a charitable harbor for jews. but you can hear the pain he feels for that lady and all the other jews in his frustrated voice. later in the scene, the lady's parents are shown being escorted out of the concentration camp into his factory. the holocaust is a dark and touchy subject for many. many believed it never happened, despite meticulous records kept by the nazis themselves. those who lived through it were scarred forever, and even now can barely bring themselves to discuss its horrors. despite the controversy around the event, there is one thing for certain, steven spielberg created a masterpiece with schindler's list. it is a film that will find no equal in terms of bleak, crushing drama. it sets out what it intends to do marvelously and leaves the viewer emotionally drained and questioning humanity itself. schindler's list is a difficult film to watch. when you see the true atrocities of the holocaust, your jaw drops. when you see the pain that all of the innocent people were going through, the only thing you can do is cry. the true goal of all holocaust films is to make you feel sorrowful, and schindler's list did that to me. if you want to see the best depiction of the holocaust, make your way towards schindler's list. as oscar is setting up his factory, the german schulz staff is brutally evicting all the jews out of their houses and moving them to ghettos and later to labor camps. as oscar and his wife helplessly watch eviction of a ghetto from a hill overlooking it, he realizes the dreadfulness of the war and that he needs to look beyond the factory profits and help the jews. the atrocities that the jews face will touch your heart. in a scene of a labor camp, as little children are being taken away by german schulz staff guards from their mothers, a child runs away to hide. he tries a few places including outhouses but finding them occupied by other children, he dives through a toilet seat in a toilet pit to hide. the fear of life on the face of the little child as he settles in the toilet pit will bleed your heart. despite the dark and sad story-line, the movie has many snippets of humor. as oscar's manager is cleverly hiring jews in the factory by keeping the ss in dark, he also hires an old man without a left arm as a metal polisher. the state of the old man is sad and the act of the manager is kind. but the subtle humor in the situation is difficult to miss when oscar comes to know about the old man and frustratingly asks his manager how the old man is useful for the factory. the film is in black and white, a very conscious choice by the director that makes the subject matter, already disturbing, even more so bleak and harrowing. the movie depicts concentration camp life is fairly dismal, with constant brutal oppression by nazi camp guards and the sadistic amon goeth, with a terrifying portrayal by ralph fiennes. what is most amazing about this film is how completely spielberg serves his story. the movie is brilliantly acted, written, directed and seen. individual scenes are masterpieces of art direction, cinematography, special effects, crowd control. yet spielberg, the stylist whose films often have gloried in shots we are intended to notice and remember, disappears into his work. neeson, kingsley and the other actors are devoid of acting flourishes. there is a single-mindedness to the enterprise that is awesome. overall, schindler's list is a heart-touching and a powerful movie that will force even a cold heart to warm for a moment. the movie is engaging and will keep you engaged for the entire three hours. it is a must-watch.;14 June 2020;9;['easy', 'selfish', 'opportunistic', 'big', 'most', 'more', 'close', 'closed', 'jewish', 'charitable', 'other', 'frustrated', 'dark', 'touchy',

480;brendanpzz;all i can say about this film is it needs to be seen by all. this film should be made as history lesson to schools everywhere to say and show how we can never let this happen in mankind ever again. this film is so well acted and just draws you in slowly and slowly till its got you in a vice grip and you can't stop watching and can't believe what you are seeing and believing. i've seen this film over 5 times now and still one of my favourites as it makes you feel so grateful for the life we live today. i honestly struggle not weep everytime at the end of this film when you see oskar break down at the end thinking to himself to save more and how he could of done it. a man that always but on a brave face shows what he feels he failed but didn't. a man that only could do with the time and money he had. and for liam neeson at the end paying respect to him at his grave bought a tear to my eye just such a respectful farewell. this film will be remembered for years and years to come as it is a masterpiece in its own creation and sends such a powerful message to the world.;5 January 2021;10;['grateful', 'more', 'brave', 'liam', 'respectful', 'own', 'powerful'];0.5399999999999999
481;FilmLiquet;let me start off by saying that schindler's list is a very heavy film to watch. it is not meant for everyone and not every member of the audience will able to appreciate it. the gut-wrenching, horrifying scenes that represent the real events happening during the second world war in krakow, poland, are hard to watch. the film being three hours long, tests your patience and ability to put up with the inhumane events on screen. the film is about a businessman oskar schindler (liam neeson), who arrives in krakow in 1930, ready to make his fortune from the new world war. after joining the nazi party for political immunity, he re-opens an old factory, using jewish workers, as they are cheaper than any other person at the time. when the ss begins exterminating jewish people in the ghetto, schindler tries to save his workers, in order to protect the operation of his factory and what starts as a selfish reason becomes a noble cause to save innocent lives. the film is in black and white, however the opening sequence for some reason is in colour. the film's events are very realistically shown, up to the point where it becomes infuriating and sickening to watch the tragedy unfold. the human emotion portrayed by the actors is too believable, it physically brings you to the place of the events and shows us the horror that the jewish people experienced during the horrific events. this is the sole focus of the film.;25 November 2018;9;['heavy', 'able', 'real', 'second', 'hard', 'inhumane', 'ready', 'new', 'political', 'old', 'jewish', 'cheap', 'other', 'jewish', 'selfish', 'noble', 'innocent', 'black', 'white', 'tragedy', 'human', 'believable', 'jewish', 'horrific', 'sole'];-0.0107378129117259
482;fwgrhouse;i saw this movie on dvd afew months ago and when i saw it it just grabbed me by the heart. i gave it a 10 because for one reason, it grabs people's attention and makes you think about the holocaust and what the jew's and other people went through during that horrible time. another reason is because it shows what a great sacrifice a man made to save a bunch of people that he didn't know. it also takes you inside the holocust and the terrible things those people went through like having to strip naked in front of people, then have their heads shaved, and be forced to do hard labor with little or no food until they were too weak to work and were sent to the gas chambers. i would recommend this film for anyone over the age of 13 because of all the realistic violence, language, strong nudity and sexual activity. but i can guarantee you that once you have seen this film, you will think differently about the holocust.;30 April 2006;10;['other', 'horrible', 'great', 'terrible', 'naked', 'hard', 'little', 'weak', 'realistic', 'strong', 'sexual'];-0.0981060606060606

487;RJ-21;i found schindler's list a wonderful movie. it is one of very few movies which are watchable over three hours. moreover, one of even fewer which are moving, fascinating and entertaining over its three hours. it comes second to la vita e bella in terms of presenting the real holocaust, though - not in terms of realism but because in lveb, we care more about the victims. in sl, we care about helen and stern, but not too many others. in lveb, we care about the family, and so it is even sadder when the holocaust takes its toll on them. the most powerful parts of sl are either the scenes without dialogue where we see mass suffering, or where liam neeson places his demands for schindler's jews. the balance of sentimentality just wasn't right. in most of spielberg's work, there is too much (i did fear it and when we got shots of the children, i almost felt like walking away) but in sl there was not enough. however, i gave it a 9, because the film as a whole was more than these flaws.;8 June 1999;10;['wonderful', 'few', 'watchable', 'few', 'fascinating', 'real', 'helen', 'stern', 'many', 'sad', 'powerful', 'mass', 'liam', 'right', 'most', 'much', 'enough', 'more'];0.2571428571428572

503;Tet-5;everything about schindler's list is impressive. never before have i seen a more painful portrayal of the holocaust. the horrible images about the humiliation, the fears and the pain of the jews are combined with the extraordinary absorbing story about oskar schindler, great camerawork, music and acting, both from the principal characters as the minor characters. a quiet, but nevertheless very impressive scene was the one in which the personal belongings of the jews, who just had been put on transport, were sorted out. the first time i saw schindler's list, this shot just seemed to go on and on, and thus gave me an idea of the enormous extent of what happened to the jewish people. we witness how war can bring out the worst in men, like it did in amon goeth. men like him were given the power, the opportunity, to develop the evil qualities in their characters. luckily, spielberg didn't portray only the evil side of goeth, he also showed his audience that this horrible man still was capable of feeling something for another human being, even though he didn't want himself to. thanks to the superb performance of ralph fiennes, the amon goeth character is in every way believable. we see how war also can bring out the best in men, like it did in oskar schindler. spielberg very subtly develops the relationship between schindler and stern. they both know schindler's feelings changed during the war, but neither of them talks about that. but still, the audience knows, just as schindler and stern know. liam neeson was very impressive, ben kingsley gave one of the best performances in movie history. many people say that saving private ryan is spielberg's best movie, but i don't agree. schindler's list has much more depth, and touched me far more deeply. it's a real masterpiece. a tip: read the book! it gives a lot of details spielberg couldn't show us, because of the limited length of the movie. it's worth your effort.;25 December 1998;10;['impressive', 'painful', 'horrible', 'extraordinary', 'great', 'principal', 'minor', 'quiet', 'impressive', 'personal', 'first', 'enormous', 'jewish', 'bad', 'evil', 'evil', 'horrible', 'capable', 'human', 'superb', 'ralph', 'believable', 'good', 'stern', 'impressive', 'good', 'many', 'private', 'good', 'more', 'real', 'limited', 'worth'];0.1353858784893267

'schindler's list is about the true story of czech born oskar schindler, a businessman who tried to make his fortune during the second world war by exploiting cheap jewish labour, but ended up penniless having saved over 1000 polish jews from almost certain death during the holocaust.' steven spielberg's best film, by far! his camera work in the film is unique.40% of this film is used with a hand-held camera. there were no steadicams or crane shots used. his efforts were to make it look more like a documentary and his effects were great! the black and white effect used only adds to the depression. the editing of colour throughout is very powerful, examples include the candles burning, the girl in the red coat and the ending sequence. the acting presented is amazing. liam neeson brings an academy award worthy performance to the screen. his transition from a greedy business man to humanitarian is marvellous. ralph fiennes is also great in the film. he plays amon goeth, an ss officer who is sadistic and psychopathic, frequently murdering his prisoners for fun. a performance not many can accomplish. ben kingsley is amazing portraying itzhak stern. he makes my favourite scene. as stern figures out that schindler is using his own money to rescue jews, his face expression says it all. very emotional. the score in this film is magic. in my opinion, it's the music that brings out the most of the emotion in the film. john williams is brilliant! schindler's list will not only go down as the best holocaust film ever made but one of the best films in the history of cinema.";23 January 2013;9;['entire', 'true', 'second', 'cheap', 'jewish', 'polish', 'certain', 'good', 'great', 'black', 'white', 'powerful', 'red', 'amazing', 'liam', 'worthy', 'greedy', 'humanitarian', 'marvellous', 'ralph', 'great', 'sadistic', 'psychopathic', 'many', 'amazing', 'favourite', 'stern', 'own', 'emotional', 'magic', 'most', 'brilliant', 'good', 'good'];0.3887896825396825

518;Steevh;"i'm going to have to agree with a previous comment that 'people only liked this because it was seen as unwise' to objectively comment. this was a 'cause movie'- and as such is no better, or no worse, than the others. like 'amistad' that followed it, it's plodding, pretentious and badly shot. the black and white cinematography lends nothing to it except the illusion of reality; which it isn't: it's a film. it's a story. not a documentary. it's a constructed series of events, with 'characters' and a 'narrative' and a 'script'. the fact that the holocaust-survivors laud it as 'how it was' is the ultimate expression of its failure. the novel left you thankful that you weren't there, but never once made you feel like you were. spielberg's film tricks you into imagining that it shows how terrible the holocaust was- it doesn't. and can't. many have stated that they 'understand' the events of hitler's germany through the movie. by giving them this false 'understanding'; spielberg has cheapened it, and made it more comfortable than it should be. subjectively, for many, this grants them leave to display false, *constructed*, grief for something that no amount of 'grieving' can in any way come to terms with. as a film; a piece of fictionalised narrative, it suffers from hammy performances... most obviously the ridiculous ralph fiennes with his sitcom nazi- a safe, comfortable idea; neatly slotting him into the 'bad guys' package that drama utilises, but 'real life' finds no easy place for. a film shot in black and white that regrettably uses these absolutes in its storytelling. an effective parable? perhaps. but a worrying one. steev";13 August 1999;3;['previous', 'unwise', 'such', 'well', 'bad', 'pretentious', 'black', 'white', 'ultimate', 'thankful', 'terrible', 'many', 'false', 'comfortable', 'many', 'false', 'hammy', 'ridiculous', 'ralph', 'safe', 'comfortable', 'bad', 'real', 'easy', 'black', 'white', 'effective', 'parable'];-0.0373015873015872

521;timmyminh;this was the only and i mean only time a film has made me cry ugly like a baby. there has been films that make me emotional to the verge of tears but never to make me bawl like an actual baby. i mean... the holocaust... just wow... pure evil, such evil. needless to say, this film exacerbates my contempt and anathema towards nazism. and the worst thing about this is that the nazis weren't just some foreign diabolical entity from some other dimension, they were humans. the stars of this film are the victims (or survivors) of this ordeal. spielberg has done a great job making it so, and he uses different techniques to make these characters memorable to us. for example, how helen hirsch has to constantly repeat her name to the officer when her character was first introduced. this was as if this was spielberg's way of making us remembering her name because her story will be very crucial and very shattering later. spielberg also uses other methods, particularly the heartbreaking and sublimely powerful tribute to the survivors and the victims at the end... i could never stop crying at that. we have a lot to learn from spielberg as film students. i think personally spielberg is my favorite director when it comes to camera movement and schindler's list is a treat for those interested to enhance their camera movement techniques. particularly spielberg's use of eye-tracing, such as at the beginning when introducing schindler at the party, that was so intelligently done. then of course, we have the highlighting of the girl in red, showing innocence wandering seamlessly amidst animosity and inhumanity. spielberg also was a master in this film for the contrast technique. specifically the two consecutive cuts of schindler shaving then of goeth shaving side by side. this was meant to show two opposing spirits. one yin and one yang. then if you notice, the cinematography done on schindler's face is almost bright and flare-like whilst the cinematography done on goeth is dark and ralph fiennes' eyes deadly and fiendish. additionally, there was another scene where the workers are onboard the train to schindler's factory and feeling crammed and couldn't breathe, schindler was wearing an all white business outfit while the other officers wore your typical dark ss uniforms. again, another contrasting technique showing schindler being almost an element for good and the other for evil. but the best is that spielberg never tried to portray schindler as an all-good saint, he is not without with flaws: a drunk, a careless businessman, a materialist, a womanizer. and yet, he acknowledges that amidst all these attributes, he could've done better. he wasn't someone who'd stand in front of hitler's desk pounding on the table shouting this was wrong... but he wished he could've. the score by john william is probably one of the best piece of music ever composed. how john williams fine-tuned the orchestra to a krakow-like haunting tune that cries for the wasted lives of this stupid war. john williams is one hell of an underrated composer and yes i know he won like 4 oscars for best original score before but ask yourself how many aspiring film score composers know him? this film was criticized by terry gilliam for being sort of a positive happy ending kind of movie that does not show the painful magnitude of the holocaust. i'd have to very much disagree because i think i miss the happy ending of schindler's list somewhere. the fact that spielberg made this and jurassic park at the same time is beyond me. overall, this film is well in my top 10, that 8.9 on imdb is 100% well-deserved. boy, a titanic of a film...;13 December 2020;10;['only', 'emotional', 'actual', 'pure', 'such', 'needless', 'bad', 'foreign', 'diabolical', 'other', 'great', 'different', 'memorable', 'helen', 'crucial', 'other', 'heartbreaking', 'powerful', 'favorite', 'interested', 'such', 'red', 'consecutive', 'bright', 'flare', 'dark', 'ralph', 'deadly', 'fiendish', 'crammed', 'white', 'other', 'typical', 'dark', 'other', 'good', 'good', 'careless', 'wrong', 'good', 'like', 'stupid', 'underrated', 'good', 'original', 'many', 'positive', 'happy', 'painful', 'happy', 'jurassic', 'same', 'titanic'];0.0823144335339457

523;Science_Fantasy_Guy;"oskar schindler was not a good person in the strictest sense of the word. a member of the nazi party, he drank like a fish, gambled, conducted dealings on the black market and cheated on his wife innumerable times. yet he found salvation by doing something so great even he could not comprehend its greatness: he changed himself for the greater good, saving the lives of more than 1100 jews employed in his munitions factory from the hatred of the nazi regime. 1993 was arguably the greatest year of steven spielberg's life. first he made the rip-roaring jurassic park, a still technologically astounding movie that revolutionized special effects and paid for his kids' educations for the next thirty years. but later, he presented us with schindler's list, a film as remarkable as schindler's achievement that beat nearly all other '90s historical dramas into submission and finally bagged him the best director and best picture oscars for which he had long been unfairly passed over. and if he still hadn't won it would have probably spawned conspiracy theories. spielberg has said that the filming of schindler's list ""was the most satisfying experience of my professional career,"" claiming it is the best film he has ever made. even if i do say so myself, he's absolutely right. working from steven zaillian's masterfully constructed adaptation of thomas keneally's novel schindler's ark, he elicits an outstanding performance from liam neeson as schindler (who justifiably lost at the oscars to tom hanks in philadelphia), and ralph fiennes pulls off what is easily one of the scariest performances in cinema history as amon goeth, the ss commandant and director of the auschwitz-birkenau labor camp whose favourite pastime was using jews for target practice. however, this is unquestionably spielberg's greatest directing job. utilizing grainy black-and-white cinematography, spielberg cleverly uses lots of wide panning shots and hand-held cameras to evoke just the right amount of shock and sympathy for holocaust victims in each scene. also, he seems to have realized that in order to completely nail a film of such depth and importance as this, you shouldn't even attempt to glamourize the holocaust or answer the questions it has left in modern society. all you have to do is assess what happened and get the facts right. in the production notes in the schindler's list dvd, spielberg writes: ""no one can do anything to fix the past - that's already happened. but a picture like this can impact us, delivering a mandate about what must never happen again."" now i know the chances of you reading this are devastatingly low, but if you are, mr. spielberg, you need not worry because as a result of this powerhouse masterpiece you have single-handedly re-awakened awareness of the holocaust, ensuring that it (hopefully) will never be repeated or forgotten. you are a god among giants, sir.";19 August 2006;10;['good', 'strict', 'black', 'innumerable', 'great', 'great', 'more', 'great', 'rip', 'astounding', 'special', 'next', 'remarkable', 'other', 'historical', 'good', 'good', 'satisfying', 'professional', 'good', 'right', 'novel', 'outstanding', 'liam', 'ralph', 'scary', 'favourite', 'unquestionably', 'great', 'grainy', 'black', 'white', 'wide', 'right', 'such', 'modern', 'right', 'low', 're', 'awakened'];0.3208949096880132

528;nathanielqwilson;"what i really dislike about this movie is that it i think i was really mislead about what it was. whether the movie itself, its marketing or just word of mouth is to blame i can't say. i believed it was meant to be the story of oskar schindler saving some jews. which i was fine to see. but what i got instead was some candid exhibition of the holocaust with the schindler plot kind of tacked on for good measure. i can agree that we should have a really well-made holocaust movie out there but it's the duplicity of the picture that sits unwell with me. the scenes are disconnected and episodic which would have been appropriate if only it could have been established that this experience was the focus of the movie but since there is a pretence of a linear plot that we only get glimpses of they just feel like filler. i barely remember how this thing of saving anyone developed or how he did it. it was really just a marketing gimmick and is in its own right really not that interesting beyond its premise. maybe if it had been some kind of hybrid of ""shoah"" with ""waltz with bashir"" it really could have been something; with real people relaying their experiences which were then dramatized. but because of the way these episodes are contextualized, they just seem pornographic in the sense it is more about a sadomasochistic voyeurism on this example of genocide, relying way too much on its production values and the gruesomeness of what it is showing so to me it is basically just a slasher than rips off reality. at least ""friday the thirteenth"" tried to be original. another design flaw is the film's desperation to show you things to make you recoil. once you establish crimes against humanity to be on the stakes, the endless parade of candid shootings just seem redundant. it doesn't matter how bluntly they the lady gets shot, the apathy to human lives already blatantly obvious. it's just ""what's going to happen? oh? another person got shot? shocking..."" this candour is also jarringly contrastive to strangely lyrical dialogues and monologues that make it very unclear what tone the movie really wants. powerful moments asides, it's a very sugary experience, and the horror of its subject matter does not excuse the handling. as you can tell from the cover art used on this website. i respect the use of black and white, it's very appropriate and usually the colour against black and white thing would greatly appeal to me, but it focuses on a little girl which is just pandering. the same kind of physiognomy that nazi propaganda used. maybe i'm slow but the point that it was to personalize the impersonal nature of mass killings was lost on me. perhaps most insultingly of all, the movie, despite how keenly it fetishizes holocaust imagery, doesn't give any kind of reflection on why the holocaust happened. no one is entirely sure but there is surely something to say about it. it's happy to talk about why people went along with it, but the mentalities of the axis peoples are lacking. that these people don't have more of a presence is a big hole in this movie. also, it's in english, which costs it a whole point out of ten from me. it should be in german. i am not german. as snooty as this must sound, i am inclined to think that this movie was a case of people really falling for a sentimental, well produced collage of an historical even we all like to hold in mind but not really think too carefully about that compromised the art (and the very story it was supposed to tell) for artsiness.";25 August 2018;3;['mislead', 'fine', 'candid', 'good', 'disconnected', 'episodic', 'appropriate', 'linear', 'own', 'interesting', 'real', 'pornographic', 'more', 'sadomasochistic', 'least', 'original', 'endless', 'candid', 'redundant', 'human', 'obvious', 'shocking', 'contrastive', 'lyrical', 'unclear', 'powerful', 'sugary', 'subject', 'black', 'white', 'appropriate', 'black', 'white', 'little', 'same', 'slow', 'impersonal', 'sure', 'happy', 'axis', 'more', 'big', 'whole', 'german', 'german', 'snooty', 'inclined', 'sentimental', 'historical', 'very'];0.1424768518518518
529;andrewtowne-1;"yet another pretentious, overblown ""meditation"" on a serious subject by a hollywood director. that is how i would sum up ""schindler's list."" but maybe my view is skewed by the fact that i have actually seen other movies that deal with this subject -- from ""l'enclos"" (out of print) to ""the pawnbroker."" ""the pawnbroker"" is a devastating indictment of man's inhumanity to man. ""schindler's list"" pales by comparison. looking at the details of ""schindler's list"", the movie opens promisingly with a wonderful assortment of authentic german cabaret songs coupled with black and white period scenes meant to evoke the raciness and fun of berlin before the nazis rose to power. all well and good. but then the movie falls apart in its depiction of a drunken, debauched and undisciplined ss concentration camp commander whose romps take place in a cliff-hanging house overlooking the camp. this is so far from the reality of what took place in the camps, and the way they were organized, as to be silly. schindler's rescue of the jews is decently portrayed, but the movie goes into ""overblown"" mode with its drawn-out portrayal of the train approaching the gates of auschwitz. were there crashing cymbals, a hundred violins playing, and trumpet fanfares to signify to the audience that this moment was tragic in case they hadn't already figured that out? i don't remember. let's just say that spielberg's approach -- in this and some of his other movies -- is the very opposite of subtle. now, i really have nothing against this movie otherwise. it's okay, that's all. but i'm amazed at the adulation it is receiving from an apparently uncritical cadre of adoring fans. turning the holocaust into what amounts to a soap opera and an ego trip for the director strikes me as pathetic. it seems that too many young directors in spielberg's generation were given gold stars before they really deserved them. not unlike kids in school today getting a's ""just for being you.""";26 June 2008;1;['pretentious', 'overblown', 'serious', 'other', 'devastating', 'wonderful', 'authentic', 'german', 'black', 'white', 'good', 'drunken', 'silly', 'overblown', 'tragic', 'other', 'opposite', 'subtle', 'okay', 'amazed', 'uncritical', 'ego', 'pathetic', 'many', 'young', 'gold'];-0.0666666666666666

534;slayerholmes;"first: is this a great and an important movie? of course it is, like all the films about the holocaust. truly, have you ever seen a bad movie (or series, or even a document for that matter) made about the subject? i haven't. like most great, based-on-facts tragedies, stories about concentration camps require too much serious thinking, talent and at least adequate budget to start with before anything happens. filmmaker just couldn't fail with real-life drama of this magnitude in his hands. neither could mr. spielberg. well, still, even considering above-mentioned, spielberg did an excellent job. ""schindler's list"" is technically brilliant: beautifully shot with its vast use of different camera distances and angles, and stark b/w realization (which always adds extra-interest for modern day film-enthusiastic). cast is also superb (liam neeson to me is almost the very personification of 'trustworthy') and set design perfect, naturally, due to on-location shooting in poland. the only, but nevertheless quite notable complaint is length; the movie is by definition unnecessarily overlong. so, why did oskar schindler do it? now, i'm a finn with some german-swedish heritage, and there's very unlikely one jewish cell in my body. and i'm no bleeding-heart liberal either, pretty much vice versa. but i'm an intelligent guy with very strong comprehension what comes to 'right' and 'wrong'. so, given the same opportunities, money and influence, i would had for sure at least attempted the same kind of rescue-mission schindler accomplished. because i couldn't bear either just stand aside and watch an absolute and continuous torment of innocents. that's the very and simple reason for schindler, a human being, too: he had the money and chance to save those people and he did. only it took courage and an ability to successfully deal with crazy monsters (nazis). and i, too, think that when there's a decision between life and death to be made, money means nothing. so it's so easy for me to identify with oskar schindler. only the world this rotten and greedy even questions his motives. still, one possible and a little more cynical explanation, which i anyway think must had played at least minor part considering schindler's (and also that german officer's in ""the pianist"") motives: germany had already clearly lost the war. one can only guess if they would had acted exactly the same way in other circumstances...";26 January 2005;10;['great', 'important', 'bad', 'great', 'serious', 'least', 'adequate', 'real', 'excellent', 'brilliant', 'vast', 'different', 'extra', 'modern', 'enthusiastic', 'superb', 'liam', 'very', 'trustworthy', 'perfect', 'only', 'notable', 'german', 'swedish', 'unlikely', 'jewish', 'much', 'intelligent', 'strong', 'right', 'wrong', 'same', 'sure', 'least', 'same', 'absolute', 'continuous', 'very', 'simple', 'human', 'crazy', 'easy', 'rotten', 'greedy', 'possible', 'little', 'cynical', 'least', 'minor', 'german', 'same', 'other'];0.1369739756367664

540;neal-57;"despite thomas keneally's excellent book and steven spielberg's awe-inspiring film, many people still avoid the story of oskar schindler and his famous ""list,"" because they fear reading about, or watching, the holocaust. they shouldn't, though, because this is a story where the ""good guys"" win--german industrialist schindler and the more than 11,ooo jewish workers he kept safe in his brinnlitz, czechoslovakia factory, while their brethren were being systematically slaughtered all around. a number of viewers find it difficult to accept that the film is liberally laced with humor. but why shouldn't it be? humor is one of the most effective weapons with which man on earth is armed, and, for the oppressed, humor can literally mean the difference between survival and destruction. some of the more humorous moments in ""schindler's list"" include: ...the scene in which poldek pfefferberg (for those who haven't noticed, the same pfefferberg who, as an older man, first told the schindler story to author thomas keneally) and his fellow black marketeers are arguing about the quality of the merchandise: ""that's not my problem,"" ""that's not his problem,"" et cetera. ...the scene in which wilhelm nussbaum and his family have been thrown out of their luxurious home and relocated in a ghetto hovel: his wife remarks ""it could be worse,"" nussbaum thunders ""how could it possibly be worse?!?"" and then, as the other new residents of these wretched quarters come filing in politely, he sees exactly how it can be worse. ...the scene in which schindler holds auditions for a secretary: applicant after applicant is gorgeous but can't type for beans (hilariously, he shows one how to return the cartridge!)while the final candidate is a cigarette-smoking battle-ax who types with effortless efficiency--and in the next shot, he has hired them all! ...the scene in which emily schindler tells her husband that she'll stay with him in krakow if he can guarantee that no doorman or maitre d' will ever mistake her for a mistress, followed by an immediate cut to her departing on the train--the cut is so abrupt, it's almost slapstick. ...a similar scene in which schindler is seeking permission to search a trainload of deportees for his manager stern: he takes the names of the officer and the nco who are blocking his way, assuring them that they will soon be serving on the russian front, and cut, the two germans are shouting for stern! ...the many scenes in which oskar pours drinks for himself and the taciturn stern, then ends up drinking them both--scenes which, of course, set up the poignant moment when stern finally shares a drink with schindler--just before schindler makes his fateful decision to draw up the list. and, lest the viewer object to ""manufactured"" humor in a serious story, three scenes are taken verbatim from fact: ...the scene during the clearing of the ghetto when poldek pfefferberg is trapped by goeth and his officers and salutes them, declaring that he has been ordered to clear the passageway. goeth is so amused by the ""little polish clicking soldier"" (poldek had, in fact, been a polish officer before that army was wiped out) that he allows him to live. ...the scene in which goeth accuses rabbi levartov, the hinge-maker, of being a slacker, and drags him outside to shoot him, only to have not one, but two guns misfire, after which goeth stalks off in disgust and the rabbi is spared. ...the scene is which the women from the schindler factory have been mistakenly sent to auschwitz-birkenau. clara sternberg is ready to give up and throw herself against the electrified fence. mrs. dresner tells her friend, ""don't do it, clara! you'll never know what happened to you!"" again, a human life is saved. these scenes are sharp, and funny, and add immeasurably to the power of ""schindler's list."" such is the quality of this story that the viewer is compelled to identify: with the hero, the victim, and, yes, even the villain. the hero, at first reluctant but later coming to embrace the role, is schindler, played with avuncular warmth by liam neeson. the victim is embodied by ben kingsley as the jewish accountant/manager itshak stern. kingsley virtually ""becomes"" stern, just as he ""became"" mohandas gandhi in that outstanding biopic. and finally, ralph fiennes is so incredibly effective as the villain, the sadistic nazi commandant amon goeth, that he lingers in the viewer's memory much as the real goeth haunted the dreams of his charges (and may still). when i first saw the film, i wondered why spielberg had followed up the scene of a shirtless goeth shooting prisoners at random from the balcony of his villa, with a scene of him walking to the toilet and urinating. why, i wondered, did we have to watch the man taking a whiz? then it came to me that the key word is that question is ""man."" spielberg is graphically demonstrating that the nazi commandant is not some demon from the depths, not some alien creature from another world, but a man. a man who has a pot belly, as so many of us do. a man who has to pee, as we all do. and a man who kills without compunction, as we are all capable of doing. this may explain why so many, to this day, deny that the holocaust ever occurred: they don't want to admit, they cannot admit, that they themselves are capable of such evil, so they desperately deny the truth they find so unacceptable. that's the true glory of fiennes' performance: he reveals the beast that dwells in all of us, and must always be guarded against. because the beast denied is not the beast vanquished. it merely waits, and watches, and observes the opportunity. it is always ready to emerge again, in any government, in any nation, in any people. constant vigilance is required to empower the cry of the holocaust survivors: never again.";8 July 2006;10;['excellent', 'many', 'famous', 'good', 'german', 'more', 'jewish', 'safe', 'difficult', 'laced', 'effective', 'armed', 'oppressed', 'humorous', 'same', 'old', 'fellow', 'black', 'luxurious', 'ghetto', 'bad', 'bad', 'other', 'new', 'wretched', 'bad', 'applicant', 'gorgeous', 'final', 'next', 'immediate', 'abrupt', 'slapstick', 'similar', 'russian', 'many', 'taciturn', 'poignant', 'stern', 'fateful', 'serious', 'little', 'polish', 'polish', 'ready', 'electrified', 'human', 'sharp', 'funny', 'such', 'first', 'reluctant', 'avuncular', 'jewish', 'outstanding', 'ralph', 'effective', 'real', 'shirtless', 'random', 'urinating', 'key', 'alien', 'many', 'capable', 'many', 'capable', 'such', 'unacceptable', 'true', 'ready', 'constant'];0.1154772727272727

573;Mr-JAFO;"i must confess that when i first saw this film in theater, and the followin' few times i saw it on tv, i became a passionate defender of it and so i tried 2 tell everybody who asked me y i liked it. but, in time, i became disappointed: the film is good, compared with the trash we're accustomed 2 watch these days (& almost all last decade), but it doesn't deserve the consideration of an ""all-time classic"", because it isn't. it's a subjective story told from a personal & subjective point of view (steven spielberg is jew), & it tries 2 emphasize the violent side of it, but payin' few attention 2 anything else. some scenes r disconnected from the rest of the plot, it contains nudity & sex scenes that don't fit 2 the tale (sexual relationships among mr. & ms. schindler, between amon goth & her lover) & make the movie become rather vulgar instead of true classic. it's got sometimes the taste of a documentary, but the connection between the general scenes & the fictional (particular) ones is not very well made. the violent scenes (especially shootin') r too explicit (there's no need 2 place a camera & stop it above a dead body bleedin' 4 showin' us the crimes that were committed). the idea of shootin' the film in b&w, i think it's actually because that was very ""in"" those years & it only took a good excuse 2 do it. if spielberg really wanted 2 make a rigor approach 2 the matter the same way it was told by those media, he would have also made the film with analog mono sound, & with less explicit violence. definitely, watch it if u want, but don't expect a timeless classic.";20 February 2004;4;['few', 'passionate', 'disappointed', 'good', 'accustomed', 'last', 'subjective', 'personal', 'subjective', 'violent', 'few', 'sexual', 'vulgar', 'true', 'general', 'fictional', 'particular', 'violent', 'explicit', 'dead', 'good', 'rigor', 'same', 'explicit', 'timeless'];-0.0685185185185185
574;lars_hendrikx;this is one of the most moving movies ever made in my humble opinion. i'm sure this will be remembered as one of the best movies of all time. first off, the acting. liam neeson is a great actor overall and shows his excellence in this movie, playing oskar schindler. for me, the best actor in this movie is ralph fiennes. his role as amon goeth is simply amazing. i once read one of the survivors of the holocaust visited the set and started shaking when she met ralph fiennes because he portrayed such a resemblance of amon goeth. i can completely understand that. the way he acts in this movie, the way his character thinks are very well thought of. ralph fiennes is truly terrifying in this movie, which is a remarkable feat and an honor to witness. secondly, i applaud the choice of stephen spielberg to film this movie in black and white. it makes the entire war seem sinister, dark and intriguing. the tiny aspect of the movie in color, the young girl in the red coat is beautiful. just that small thing made my mouth drop, it works really well. in the end,stephen spielberg made a lot of excellent, top-notch movies. in my eyes, this one is his best. i don't think he will ever beat the degree this movie is in. if he does i will be flabbergasted. this movie blew me away. without any doubt in my heart, 10/10.;20 June 2013;10;['moving', 'humble', 'sure', 'good', 'great', 'good', 'ralph', 'amazing', 'ralph', 'ralph', 'remarkable', 'black', 'white', 'entire', 'sinister', 'dark', 'intriguing', 'tiny', 'young', 'red', 'beautiful', 'small', 'excellent', 'top', 'good'];0.2968253968253969
575;waittilnextyear;"a lot of people are under the assumption that either citizen kane or vertigo is the best motion picture in human history. and, while these are undoubtedly in the discussion, and one can say that orson welles and alfred hitchcock are certainly in the top 10 best directors in history, neither of these are the best movie of all time. citizen kane is an epic piece of semi-fiction clustered around the life and times of hearst, mccormick, insull and a few others. this film broke ground in so many technical ways--flashbacks as the primary source of telling a story, multiple narrators, deep focus shots, intense shadows and lighting effects, and camera angles shot from the floor at times. also, this was probably the most highly controversial film ever made, since william randolph hearst tried furiously to snuff it out, and hollywood moguls approached orson welles and rko productions to reimburse him for the costs of the film just to simply destroy it. however, although citizen kane might be the most innovative film of all time (save for the first motion picture, the first color motion picture, and the first with sound), it is not the best picture or all time. this is largely because the story is quite dated, and almost no one can connect with a newspaper mogul in today's society. sure there are enduring themes here, but ultimately this picture doesn't have the soul to grab us as viewers and pull us in. without going into similar detail for vertigo, suffice it to say that this is another picture that is technically revolutionary (vertigo effect), but the story just doesn't have the level of humanity and soul that one would expect for best movie ever. two other pictures that are commonly viewed as contenders include imdb's own #1 the shawshank redemption as well as imdb #2 the godfather. and while these movies are much more soulful story-wise than vertigo or citizen kane, neither rises quite to the level of technical brilliance exhibited by the other films. so, there appears to be a quandary at the top of the movie hierarchy, where we have two brilliant, technical masterpieces that don't have quite enough soul, and we also have two brilliant cinematic masterpieces that might not be as technically/visually stunning as one would expect from the best movie ever. enter schindler's list. schindler's list is a movie that, although it is comfortably amongst the top movies on imdb (#8 currently), no one ever seriously mentions it for best movie. and this is really a crime, because it deserves that title, and is by far spielberg's best work. the acting is a++ in this movie--what we have is liam neeson, possibly the most underrated actor of the last quarter century, delivering his finest performance as protagonist oskar schindler. alongside this performance, is ralph fiennes also giving his finest career performance as antagonist amon goethe. there is not a single line spoken, nor facial gesture made, nor flourish with a prop (cigarette, shot glass, deck of cards) that is anything short of mind-blowing. the scene between schindler and goethe discussing the difference between power and justice, with power coming the ability to not exercise that very power, or make a pardon, was phenomenal. and then goethe's being so influenced that he becomes obsessed with trying on that version of ""power"" for size before ultimately discarding it was haunting. aspiring actors be on notice, this movie can teach you to win an oskar (intentionally misspelled) someday. ben kingsley fills his role sublimely as the necessary cog in the schindler machine (and ultimately the one who goads schindler into realizing there is more than business at stake), itzhak stern. additionally, casting european and jewish actors and actresses only makes this tale that much fuller with realism and soul. the sound, music, and cinematography is simply on another level, and this is what sets it apart from the shawshank redemption and the godfather. seeing krakow from a distance at night, with machine gun fire intermittently lighting up rooms with murders was extremely effective, as were all the set pieces that showed intricate hiding places and how the nazis had come to use stethoscopes to defeat this jewish strategy. the cat and mouse game between hunter and hunted was very well done. what's more, the emaciated bodies of people who played some of these roles looked like they were actually taken out of holocaust footage. it was disturbing and stunning all at once. throw in an amazing, beautiful, and tragic score with superb sound editing, beautiful panoramic shots, and compelling grayscale to yield an artistic, audiovisual feast. as if to cement its status as best film ever, the attention to detail, the script, and the utter despair felt at every turn was breathtaking. you cannot help but be awe-struck at every horrified expression, every pained look, every exactly delivered line. though this is a 3-hour-long epic, there is not a single extraneous line in the entire movie. there is not a single gratuitous scene. every scene absolutely belongs, and every spoken line fits like a jigsaw puzzle. the mood of this film gives it soul, like you find in films such as casablanca and the shawshank redemption, but darker and haunted. this feeling just makes you want to root like hell that everyone makes it out unscathed. and when that train full of women is mistakenly sent to auschwitz, a knot forms in your throat--so close, but yet so far from salvation. and, even liam neeson as schindler is not immune, as he gives a bravura final performance where he weeps and questions the value of a life--could he have done more? it's become his sickness, his addiction, and though he did so much, it is certain not being able to turn his nazi gold pin into even a single additional life will haunt him forever.";23 February 2013;10;['vertigo', 'good', 'human', 'alfred', 'top', 'good',

592;sadrec1;"schindler's list is a profound film that gives an eye opening look at one of the darkest, most despicable periods of the 20th century, the halocaust. it unflinchingly tells the story of 1,100 jews, who, when millions upon millions of their brethren were systematically murdered by the nazis, survived, due to the actions of a greedy businessman. steven spielberg definitively proved his talents to the world when he made this film. no longer was he merely a sap-seller who made visually stunning summer films about alien landings, swashbuckling archaeologists, and sadistic semi trucks. he proved he could direct a harrowing, serious film which from every corner oozes artistry. i can't tell how much i love the fact that the film is in black and white. the medium works perfectly in presenting this grim time many of us only know of in shocking old photographs. more brilliant still are the sporadic uses of color. much has been said about the moment when oscar schindler watches a young girl in a red dress walk quietly through the horror of the krakow liquidation, but not as much has been noted about my favorite instance of color. in the first scene, a jewish family is gathered around a table to observe the sabbath. the father reads a prayer, and the camera slowly moves in on the candles on the table as the family fades out of the scene and color slowly dissipates. soon, only the orange flame of the candles are in color, and they are soon extinguished. this, to me, represents the hope that was snuffed out by the nazis during the halocaust. later in the film, oscar schindler, at his new artillery factory, allows some of the jews to observe the sabbath. they too gather around a candlelit table to read a prayer, and the flames of the candle glow orange; now that these jews are safe, this is hope for them again. the performances are fantastic. i both applauded and scolded liam neeson as the alternatively brave and selfish oscar schindler, seethed with anger at ralph fiennes as the detestable ss officer amon goeth, and felt immense pity for ben kingsley as the sorrowfully noble itzhak stern. of course one of my favorite things about the film is the music. not the traditional plagerized pomposity of john williams earlier scores, the music for this film is carried by a gentle, sorrowful melody, often played by master violionist ithzak perlman. this is a film i believe all should see. schindler's list will, hopefully, open your eyes to the immense evil that man carried out against his fellow man during the halocaust.";16 February 2006;10;['profound', 'dark', 'despicable', 'greedy', 'stunning', 'alien', 'sadistic', 'semi', 'harrowing', 'serious', 'black', 'white', 'grim', 'many', 'shocking', 'old', 'brilliant', 'sporadic', 'much', 'young', 'red', 'much', 'favorite', 'first', 'jewish', 'orange', 'new', 'safe', 'fantastic', 'liam', 'brave', 'selfish', 'ralph', 'detestable', 'immense', 'noble', 'favorite', 'traditional', 'early', 'gentle', 'sorrowful', 'immense', 'fellow'];0.0955067920585162

604;Doctor_Mongoose;"shindler's list is supposedly steven spielberg's greatest achievement, however i cannot say that i agree. of course there are a lot of good points about the film, it goes without saying that the documentary style and use of black and white gives it a very authentic edge, but it still has its fair share of faults. the main problem with shindler's list is the length. i'm of the opinion that when watching a film less is more and if you are going to do a film that is over 3 hours long every scene should be as relevant and important as the next one. in shindler's list, in my opinion, there are many scenes that repeat each other, giving us no new revelation or insight into the character's emotions or actions. it was probably spielberg's intention to show us so many scenes of torture and abuse of the jews to help show the horrific scale of the events that took place, to show us how many were killed without emotion or reason, but i feel he got too emotionally involved and went over the top, getting to a point where with each random killing he lessened the impact to the audience because you've seen the same thing happen earlier. another major problem i have with the film is that some parts come off as strangely comedic, which in my opinion completely goes against the idea of the documentary style. scenes like when schindler threatens the guards so they help him find his accountant and when amon goeth ""pardons"" himself in the mirror were extremely ill judged as in my opinion you should not be made to laugh in a film that covers such serious subject matter. the film is also very biased in a sense that it gives all the jews a personality and character development whereas every single nazi in the film is shown to be pure evil and mechanical, enjoying every last little thing they did. obviously i am not saying anyone committing these atrocious acts should be absolved from our condemnation and scorn, however it would have been interesting to see how the bosses of the labour camps would have dealt with guards who actually had a moral compass and refused to act upon these orders of such brutality. not doing this, unfortunately, takes a bit of credibility away from the film as it makes it seem only those who are wealthy, only schindler, had any respect for the jews or were against the war. however, despite its faults there is indeed a great deal of tragic beauty to the film. apart from the scene at the end where schindler breaks down and cries, which seemed extremely over-acted and quite awkward to watch, the film really does manage to evoke very real emotions. it opens your eyes to the pain and suffering of the holocaust and gives you a fly-on-the-wall style view into what happened. when you watch from such a close up perspective it really makes you feel that you are there in the film, someone who is standing by and doing nothing to stop the dreadful events that are happening so close to you. this style really helps amplify every emotion you feel to great effect. a lot of credit must also go to the actors. it is key that in a film like this that you believe what is happening on screen and all the actors do a very good job, especially ben kingsley as itzhak stern who really manages to capture the emotions of skepticism and hopeless inevitability flawlessly. liam neeson does a really good job as schindler himself, but lets himself down in the final scene where he is just makes you cringe and think ""this is acting"". overall i found the film very entertaining, but there were a lot of minor quibbles with it that lessened my enjoyment somewhat along with a few major problems that i feel cheapened the overwhelming emotional experience that i received. the film is 100% essential viewing and will definitely stand the test of time, but in my honest opinion is not the masterpiece or the demonstration of perfection that many people laud it to be.";22 July 2009;7;['great', 'good', 'black', 'white', 'authentic', 'fair', 'main', 'more', 'relevant', 'important', 'next', 'many', 'other', 'new', 'many', 'horrific', 'many', 'random', 'same', 'major', 'comedic', 'ill', 'such', 'serious', 'subject', 'biased', 'single', 'pure', 'evil', 'mechanical', 'last', 'little', 'atrocious', 'interesting', 'moral', 'such', 'wealthy', 'great', 'tragic', 'awkward', 'real', 'dreadful', 'great', 'key', 'good', 'hopeless', 'good', 'final', 'entertaining', 'minor', 'few', 'major', 'overwhelming', 'emotional', 'essential', 'honest', 'many'];0.0940715534465534

""what made these people so monstrous, was that they were not monsters."" that is the true horror. ordinary people during this time period were just doing there ""jobs"". in other words, what was so horrible about the holocaust, was not that these people were deviants, but that they were so ordinary, and that this happened in our lifetime. in the movie oskar schindler starts out as an opportunist. he realizes that he can become very rich by moving to poland and taking advantage of the desperate situation that has arisen there. he does this in a masterful way, and soon becomes very rich. gradually he realizes what is going on around him he decides that he has to make a choice. the choice is incredibly courageous. what was so extraordinary about his choice was that so few people like him did so during this time period. after the war, most absolved themselves of their responsibility by saying, ""i was only following orders."" an amazing story. highest possible rating. offbeat trivia about this movie this movie was also written into a script of seinfeld. jerry and his current girlfriend haven't been able to be alone. he decides to take here to a movie to make out. what movie does he take her to? this one! this has to be one of the funniest scenes ever in a comedy series. who could write a scene that is potentially so offensive, but yet hysterical. much hilarity ensues when jerry is spotted making out during the movie by a relative.";29 November 2009;10;['great', 'fundamental', 'fundamental', 'extraordinary', 'basic', 'powerful', 'rare', 'most', 'easy', 'moral', 'tough', 'dangerous', 'stuck', 'monstrous', 'true', 'ordinary', 'other', 'horrible', 'ordinary', 'rich', 'desperate', 'masterful', 'rich', 'courageous', 'extraordinary', 'few', 'amazing', 'high', 'possible', 'offbeat', 'current', 'able', 'alone', 'offensive', 'hysterical', 'much'];0.0567624521072797

632;cowboykalira;"schindler's list to this day stands out for being one of the most impressive movies made about the holocaust. spielberg went the extra mile in every aspect of this movie. superior cinematography, lots of historical references (which, although not always completely accurate, give a good sense of what the holocaust was like for the jews), brilliant actors, brilliant score, amazing screenplay. people have criticized it for being too sentimental, and i can understand their problems with that, but i can't agree with them. the subject matter is still one of the darkest periods in living history. now we have a film like ""der untergang"" which shows the story from inside the nazi high command at the end of the war, and that movie is even more haunting than this one. it doesn't focus however on the victimization of the entire jewish community, and therefore does not have to deal with the emotional burdens of the people who had to live through these conditions. another point is that if you want to show the holocaust in a drama film, you have to think of your audience as well. although many people still know what it was like, there are also large groups of people who haven't got a clue about the war. they heard the figure, 6 million jews killed in concentration camps, but know nothing about the ghettos, the slave labour, the slow descent from being deprived of the right to have certain jobs, to being murdered just because you are a jew. schindler's list makes this history accessible to the masses. spielberg does this expertly, by balancing the sentimental with the downright cynical and horrific. where a film like der untergang focuses more on the human weaknesses of the nazis, this film poses the nazis outright as the pure evil that jews had to deal with in the war. this is a very different approach, that can be classed as a more conventional narrative. good versus evil. oskar schindler stands alone as the ""good german"". in reality there were others like him of course, but in the reality the protagonists of this movie faced, those ""others"" played no part, so it is not necessary for the movie to work to emphasize this. what more can be said? well a criticism has also been that the jews are being portrayed as little more than meek victims, and that no heroism from them is shown. unfortunately the war didn't offer many heroic opportunities for the jewish people. there are exceptions to this rule, but most of them suffered without hope, without a chance to fight back. you can look for the exceptions, and criticize spielberg for not showing that side. would that be fair on history? maybe, but let's face it, the exceptions were far and few between, through no fault of the jews themselves, but because the nazis had such a firm grip on the third reich that a deed of defiance by one hero, could cost the lives of many bystanders who had nothing to do with it. most jews simply had to bear every degrading action undertaken against them, and there was nothing they could do about it. all in all you have to be quite cynical not to be impressed by this movie. it is just too powerful for that. yes, in the end much is made of making schindler into a true hero, especially the scene before he flees, where he cries that he could have saved more. some people hate this scene, and think it schmaltzy, over-sentimental, sanctimoneous crap. i think that it is a great scene, although this scene is very hollywood, and most probably not an accurate portrayal of the way schindler fled the factory. but it ends the development of his character, as he finally realises the mistakes he made. he therefore goes from being a cynical crook at the start of the movie, to a man who reluctantly saved people, to a man who enjoys his role as saviour, to finally coming to terms with what he did, and what more he could have done, if he hadn't been busy showing off. this movie is a true classic. if you can watch it without shedding a tear, please check your heart's temperature, because it probably is frozen solid.";24 June 2012;9;['impressive', 'extra', 'historical', 'accurate', 'good', 'brilliant', 'brilliant', 'amazing', 'sentimental', 'subject', 'dark', 'high', 'entire', 'jewish', 'emotional', 'many', 'large', 'slow', 'certain', 'accessible', 'cynical', 'horrific', 'human', 'pure', 'different', 'conventional', 'good', 'alone', 'good', 'german', 'necessary', 'more', 'little', 'more', 'many', 'heroic', 'jewish', 'most', 'fair', 'far', 'few', 'firm', 'third', 'many', 'most', 'degrading', 'cynical', 'powerful', 'true', 'more', 'sentimental', 'sanctimoneous', 'great', 'hollywood', 'accurate', 'cynical', 'more', 'busy', 'true', 'solid'];0.1916220238095238

636;GanzEhrlich;i am probably still too young to understand the real reasons why sl is hailed as one of the greatest films ever made. it was mostly shot in black and white while virtually all other movies in the decades before and since are in colour, adding even more of a sense of realism to the film. schindler's list is a story of a man's change of heart and attitude alongside themes of survival, hope, brutality (mostly served by ralph fiennes' murderous amon goth)and countless other situations for hundreds of jews. in black and white, the bloody, graphic summary executions of jews throughout the film were overwhelming, the images freezing me in my seat and imprinting themselves in my mind to this day, but they justifiably implied to you the horrors of the holocaust like no other movie. the girl in the red coat seems to symbolise, as her fate suggests, that there is no escape from the dominant force. the acting is spotless. liam neeson should have won an oscar for portraying schindler (i must admit, i am yet to see tom hanks in philadelphia) with an emotional tone, the performance launching him into super-stardom once and for all. ben kingsley and ralph fiennes also played their parts with the right touch, especially fiennes whose character also seems to change within, halfway through the film, but only slightly, his insanity still alive as in one scene he randomly snipes numerous jewish workers from his bedroom. but the star is director steven spielberg, who in 1993 made maybe not his most famous movie, other projects such as e.t., saving private ryan, ceottk, the indiana jones saga also rising forward. but without question, maybe with the exception of saving private ryan, schindler's list is spielberg's finest work.;19 August 2014;9;['young', 'real', 'great', 'black', 'white', 'other', 'more', 'ralph', 'murderous', 'countless', 'other', 'black', 'white', 'bloody', 'graphic', 'overwhelming', 'other', 'red', 'dominant', 'spotless', 'liam', 'emotional', 'ralph', 'right', 'alive', 'numerous', 'jewish', 'famous', 'other', 'such', 'private', 'private', 'fine'];0.068040293040293

638;johnterrell-67238;when i first watched schindler's list, i was completely amazed. no movie has ever moved me the way it did, and i don't think ever will. it manages to be both beautiful, horrifying, hopeful, and depressing all at the same time which is incredibly hard to do. with this film, spielberg really shows what masterful director he is. liam neeson also gives a jaw dropping performance as oskar schindler. i can say without a doubt that this is one of the greatest acting performances i've ever seen. every single line, ever single emotion, liam neeson acts it out perfectly. the next great performance is what i consider to be the greatest performance of all time: ralph fiennes as amon goeth. ralph fiennes' plays this character so good, that amon goeth is arguably the most unlikeable, despicable character to ever appear on screen. (amon goeth being a real person makes his performance even more stomach wrenching). this is a once in a generation performance. ben kingsley also has an incredible performance in this, playing itzhak stern. in my opinion, schindler's list is the most powerful, emotional and important movie ever made. schindler's list really is a movie that everyone needs to see. it is truly one of the greatest movies ever. 10/10;4 October 2018;10;['amazed', 'beautiful', 'horrifying', 'hopeful', 'same', 'hard', 'masterful', 'great', 'single', 'single', 'liam', 'next', 'great', 'great', 'ralph', 'ralph', 'good', 'unlikeable', 'despicable', 'real', 'incredible', 'powerful', 'emotional', 'important', 'great'];0.3597338935574229

652;rserrano;"what makes this film truly remarkable is the personal transformation which oskar schindler under goes just past the mid-point of the movie in a series of incredibly subtle scenes. early on, schindler is driven only by selfish desire for money, women and influence. others may benefit from his actions, but it is purely a by-product. never does he help someone to his own detriment. he narrowly rescues itzhak stern from a train to a death camp and then scolds him, saying ""if i had been five minutes later, then where would i be?"". but by the end of the movie, schindler willingly loses all his personal wealth and repeatedly risks his life in order to save others. the inflection point takes place at a meeting between schindler and stern at the plaszow work camp. it's night and oskar leaves a nazi party to see his accountant. at the end of a brief conversation stern says "" don't let things fall apart. i worked too hard for this"". he is pleading with schindler to take personal responsibility. as stern walks away a search beacon shines over his shoulder and fills the screen with a blinding white light. the camera cuts to oskar. he is engulfed by the light. he smiles of deep satisfaction. this sets off an amazing sequence of scenes: - schindler comes to the aid of a metal presser. - he gives protection in his factory to a traumatised boy, despite the fact that he has no skills. he gives up his own silver lighter and cigarette case to make these two events happen. - he comforts amon goeth's abused maid. they sit beneath a cone of white light. at a point where he could easily take advantage of her, instead he helps her renew her will to survive. - in a discussion with goeth after a party, he explains that true power comes not from control or the ability to kill, but the ability to forgive. this could be further interpreted as ""success in life comes not from pursuing personal gain, but from rising above it"". goeth is amused and intrigued by this but in the subsequent tragic ""bath tub stain"" scene, we see that he is pathetically incapable of internalizing anything that was said. - in perhaps the most powerful scene of the film, a women comes to schindler and begs that he take her skilless, aged parents into his factory to save their lives. he appears from on high at the top of a long stair case. she tells him "" no one ever dies here. it is a haven. they say that you are good"". one can easily substitute the word ""heaven"" for ""haven"" and ""god"" for ""good"". in rage, schindler throws her out. but then he goes to see stern. he tells stern that there is good in all people but that war brings out the worst in them. he uses this to rationalize and forgive the behavior of goeth. we fully expect that he will now use this to rationalize his own selfish behavior. instead he takes the watch from his own wrist and gives it to stern to use to buy the lives of the two elderly parents. the irony is that war has borough out good in schindler that might never have emerged otherwise. from here on out schindler performs a continuous series of selfless acts. moreover,despite the huge personal risks he takes, we feel good about the choices he makes and therefor we are transformed a little bit, along with him.";15 March 2004;10;['remarkable', 'personal', 'subtle', 'selfish', 'own', 'personal', 'brief', 'personal', 'white', 'deep', 'amazing', 'own', 'light', 'white', 'true', 'personal', 'subsequent', 'tragic', 'incapable', 'powerful', 'aged', 'long', 'good', 'good', 'stern', 'stern', 'good', 'bad', 'own', 'selfish', 'own', 'elderly', 'good', 'continuous', 'selfless', 'huge', 'personal', 'good', 'little'];0.1690656565656565

655;ventery;"so i watched schindlers' list on saturday and must admit while i found it rather disturbing, i could not look away for the whole duration of the film. it is no secret that i have always been drawn to movies with a powerful message and find myself searching for existential meaning in almost everything i am exposed to, however, the holocaust did not only mark a pivotal point in our human history but symbolised the most disturbing and darkest side of our human nature; our insatiable appetite for power and control, and the hateful disregard for human life. consequently, we are repeatedly reminded of the extent to which our human indecency can go which often leaves us wondering when it will happen again. by now you would have guessed that the movie is about oskar schindler; a german businessman and member of the nazi party, who, after witnessing the deplorable way his jewish factory workers were being treated by the nazi soldiers, set out to help them. liam neeson was flawless in his portrayal of oskar schindler and gave the character the angelic finesse he deserved. i am almost certain that oskar schindler would have been pleased with spielberg's choice of acting talent. i found myself drawn to the character in a very intimate, yet spiritual way, something i am still unable to explain. and ralph fiennes who played the role of amon goeth; the model ss soldier who became commandant at plaszow and was responsible for the liquidation of the krakow ghetto; was outstanding. as i watched his character transform from a devoted ss soldier to a sadistic commandant, i felt spielberg's choice was quite fitting and became somewhat captivated by fiennes's performance. i could almost feel the immense hatred he had for the jews and found myself hating him back. whilst the content of the movie was very heavy, the cinematography was, in a word, flawless. the decision to shoot the film in black and white gave it a vintage feel and added an extra layer of frightening truthfulness. the iconic soundtrack triggered many emotions which led to many uncontrollable crying moments. fair warning though, the genuine portrayal of violence in the film might scar some sensitive viewers and should not be taken lightly. furthermore, i found myself questioning whether or not any of the ss soldiers went through existential moments where they questioned the ethical nature of their orders and by extension their actions. there must have been times when they were emotionally distraught and unable to complete the orders that were given to them. i cannot imagine that none of them struggled to sleep at night knowing that they were murdering, no, slaughtering innocent people on a daily basis. it is unfathomable that so many people were brainwashed into believing the ridiculous antics of one monstrous man. and finally, there were three scenes which stood out throughout the movie. the first was the scene with the little girl in the red dress. it is believed that she represented the innocence of the jewish people, which i feel is correct, however, i also think that she represented the horrifying truth of what was to come. the second was the scene where the jewish prisoners were ordered to exhume the bodies of their fallen comrades and told to push them into a bonfire in order to dispose of them. oskar is present at the cremation and notices a wheelbarrow containing the bodies of children, amongst them, the little girl in the red dress who he had spotted running into a building in the ghetto when he watched the ss soldiers liquidating the ghetto. i believe this may represent the loss of innocence and symbolised the complete lack of regard for human life. the final scene was the scene where oskar breaks down after he is handed a gold ring that the jews he saved had made for him to say thank you for saving them. this is probably one of the most iconic scenes in the movie because it speaks volumes as to the horrors that oskar had witnessed and the empathetic human nature during times of hardship.";5 October 2018;10;['disturbing', 'whole', 'powerful', 'existential', 'pivotal', 'human', 'disturbing', 'dark', 'human', 'insatiable', 'hateful', 'human', 'human', 'german', 'deplorable', 'jewish', 'flawless', 'angelic', 'certain', 'pleased', 'intimate', 'spiritual', 'unable', 'ralph', 'commandant', 'responsible', 'outstanding', 'devoted', 'sadistic', 'fitting', 'immense', 'heavy', 'black', 'white', 'vintage', 'extra', 'frightening', 'iconic', 'many', 'many', 'uncontrollable', 'fair', 'genuine', 'sensitive', 'ss', 'existential', 'ethical', 'distraught', 'unable', 'innocent', 'daily', 'unfathomable', 'many', 'ridiculous', 'monstrous', 'first', 'little', 'red', 'jewish', 'correct', 'horrifying', 'second', 'jewish', 'present', 'little', 'red', 'ss', 'complete', 'human', 'final', 'iconic', 'empathetic', 'human'];0.0542729591836734

661;bunny_hater66;i thought that the film was excellent, i thought it was a brilliantly realisation, fiercely controlled and restraint treatment of a true story, the film had a great atmosphere of a kind of documentary, harsh and compassionate and avoid sentimentality until the end. and felt as though spielberg escaped the great and family films like e.t and idiana jones and was successful. spielberg also does an uncommonly thing and keeps our attention for 185 mines. what i also liked was the rich black and white cinematography. the music helped move a lot of the scenes. i also liked the acting by liam neeson and ralph fiennes. i also feel that the film and the script are well constructed. i also liked the lighting when schinder is at the party strobing across his eyes hiding the rest of his face. i liked the scene when all of schindler's female workers were dropped of at the concentration camp, the scene when they were put in the showers, this scene was good but suspenseful with shot reverse shot from the screaming women to the shower heads as they thought that they had been put in the gas chamber. i felt that spielberg kind of personified the gas chambers as though they were the real killers and the executioner and the nazi's were just the jury. i also felt that another scene that was key was when ralph fiennes was going to kill that man behind the factory for not making enough door hinges and the gun jamming, as later on in the film liam neeson discusses with ben kingsley about the machinery have found to been faulty and he also made a point that he wants the weapons not to work, also with the scene later on we find out that the man is a rabbi and so this could be that god was trying to save him, one of the officers said that it was impossible that all of the guns were jamming at the same time which made me think was the rabbi just plain lucky or was he being protected.;7 March 2008;9;['excellent', 'brilliantly', 'true', 'great', 'harsh', 'compassionate', 'great', 'successful', 'uncommonly', 'rich', 'black', 'white', 'liam', 'ralph', 'female', 'good', 'suspenseful', 'shot', 'real', 'key', 'ralph', 'enough', 'faulty', 'impossible', 'same', 'lucky'];0.2397058823529412

684;thomas2193;schindler's list is a film that showcases the true horrors that occurred during the second world war, and manages to captivate them in the most realistic way that's possible. although the film was produced in 1993, most of the film has been shown in black and white, which adds to the time period. this is a true masterpiece released by steven spielberg, and you can feel the emotion and fright from the actors involved. it must be horrifying beyond any recognition to live in such mortal danger as people did back in the second world war, but spielberg exactly knows how to portray the story on the big screen, in a perfect manner. the film lasts longer than three hours and even looks like a live filmed documentary instead of a film, but it's truly magnificent and the story, especially the second half of the film, will really suck you into it so you never get the feeling it lasts too long. there's a deep message involved in the film, which schindler makes clear towards his friend, war criminal goeth. power is not just control, it's to know when not to abuse your power. or in a different definition, power is to know when to spare a life instead of taking one. that's what schindler believes, and that's what makes him one of the most heroic germans during the second world war. he was indeed a member of the nazi party, but yet, he doesn't agree with the crimes that the german's commit against the jews. during the film, your'e able to witness his growing envy of the holocaust and his fellow german nazi participants. the first step he takes and when his true colors start to reveal themselves, is when he wants a jewish accountant to run his company. the jew, isac stern, tells him that schindler might not be aware of the situation, since he's a jew. we find out that schindler couldn't care less, since he simply replies with the answer: ''yeah, and i'm a german''. while the company is able to expend, more jews start to come over to schindler's company and start to embrace him like he's a saint to them, because the jews that are able to work for him, are saved from death. after a while, when his entire company has to dissolve and his workers have to leave for auswitzch, he buys each and every single worker in his company, to save them from the concentration camp. that's truly heroic, in my opinion. there's isn't a damn thing he could've done more for his fellow humans. all of the people in the company, that are on schindler's list, are being transported to tjesch slowak, but the woman end up in auswitzch due to a mistake made during the train transport. he saves them by handing the guard a couple of diamonds, and the women are able to head for tjesch slowak. schindler tells the german guards they will not shoot without permission, nor enter the work floor without authorized permission from him. stern tells schindler that the company isn't doing well and that the granate shells aren't good enough which will inevitably lead to bankruptcy. schindler again shows his true colors by simply replying: ''i would be very unhappy if my company would actually make decent grenades''. after the war is over, schindler has to flee because he'll be seen as a criminal, although he certainly isn't in my mind, as well as in the minds of every single saved jew from the 1100 he managed to save. schindler falls down into tears, and despairs that he could've saved at least one more live. that's the moral to the story: how much is a human worth to you? that's something to think about.;8 September 2014;9;['true', 'second', 'realistic', 'possible', 'most', 'black', 'white', 'true', 'such', 'mortal', 'second', 'big', 'perfect', 'long', 'live', 'filmed', 'magnificent', 'second', 'deep', 'clear', 'criminal', 'different', 'heroic', 'second', 'able', 'fellow', 'german', 'first', 'true', 'jewish', 'aware', 'german', 'able', 'more', 'able', 'entire', 'single', 'heroic', 'damn', 'more', 'fellow', 'slowak', 'able', 'german', 'authorized', 'granate', 'good', 'true', 'unhappy', 'decent', 'single', 'least', 'more', 'live', 'moral', 'much', 'human'];0.1884695165945165

697;k-08062;"why do we shed tears? a person we have never heard of is very far away from us to die, will you shed tears, cctv news often reported that the death of leaders i am mostly senseless, not i am not patriotic, after all do not know. people are sentimental animals don't know how to talk about sadness, so to make the audience cry for the character you must let the audience have a deep impression on the character. schindler's list has more than 120 characters, although the audience may not remember all, but remember 20 to 30 is still not a problem, to give a few supporting examples: female servant helen; the jewish female engineer; the little girl wearing glasses and her mother; clever little boy; one-armed grandfather; little girl in red and so on each makes the audience impressed like an acquaintance, then when they are in danger killed the audience will be absolutely sad. the first person the nazis killed in the film was his one-armed grandfather, and spielberg's death of the one-armed old man who would not ""kill innocent people"" opened the prologue of the holocaust. let's look at how the choreographer creates a simple and foolish image of the old man with one arm, and let the audience have feelings or even tears for it. it was spielberg's first show of his cruelty in this film. what kind of character is most touching? is it the kind of person who's almost perfect without flaws? not necessarily, sometimes the existence of small shortcomings but strengthen the role of our domestic film is different, we must distinguish between good and evil bad people must be bad to the bone, good people must be tall and powerful, this is not interesting, now the main theme of the main theme of the anti-japanese drama are so positive not convinced. the jews in this film are honest and honest, ignorant and servile, but they are sympathetic, such as the one-armed old man, who feels very real because he is approachable. the hero schindler was eating, and the secretary told him that someone wanted to see him as a token of gratitude. schindler was already very unhappy to see the other person was disabled, but had not yet appeared in the face, the one-armed old man was very uninteresting verbose, talking and halting, so finally schindler sat in his chair to twist his face to the side of the old man, the atmosphere is very funny and awkward. although schindler did not say a dissatisfied line but composition and performance betrayed his heart, the composition of this scene is very wonderful subtext is expressed through composition, because the film is black and white film lost color contrast emphasis, so the composition and lighting requirements are higher. after the old man left the camera to schindler again, it was a quiet scene is very awkward atmosphere, schindler's dissatisfaction jumped on the screen. schindler felt that such a disabled person should not enter his own factory, and his angry face was black and blue and he did not even want to talk to his secretary. this is a further addition to the old and schindler's image more plump for the next turning point. it was precisely because of this meeting that the audience and schindler remembered the simple and honest old man, and both felt sorry for his death. it was the death of the jews who let schindler love and hate that inspired the conscience and made him determined to save these ""lowly"" jews. besides, the choreographer took a lot of effort to shape";30 March 2020;9;['senseless', 'patriotic', 'sentimental', 'deep', 'more', 'few', 'female', 'jewish', 'female', 'little', 'clever', 'little', 'armed', 'little', 'red', 'impressed', 'sad', 'first', 'armed', 'armed', 'old', 'innocent', 'simple', 'foolish', 'old', 'first', 'touching', 'perfect', 'small', 'domestic', 'different', 'good', 'evil', 'bad', 'bad', 'good', 'tall', 'powerful', 'interesting', 'main', 'main', 'anti', 'japanese', 'positive', 'convinced', 'honest', 'honest', 'ignorant', 'servile', 'sympathetic', 'such', 'armed', 'old', 'real', 'approachable', 'unhappy', 'other', 'disabled', 'armed', 'old', 'uninteresting', 'halting', 'old', 'funny', 'awkward', 'dissatisfied', 'wonderful', 'black', 'white', 'high', 'old', 'quiet', 'awkward', 'disabled', 'own', 'angry', 'black', 'blue', 'further', 'old', 'plump', 'next', 'simple', 'honest', 'old', 'sorry', 'determined', 'lowly'];0.0640063680281071

700;plutokennedy;by making this movie, spielberg reportedly wanted to increase awareness of the holocaust. in this regard, he probably succeeded. but that should not cloud the fact that this is a very mediocre to bad movie. the acting is, save for kingsley, stale and in some instances, such as the train to auschwitz scene, almost aching to an ed wood movie (i assume these women were not professional actors). the story is clumsily told, the symbolism (red dress) heavy handed and the psychology of some characters (such as goetz's scene in front of the mirror) very simple minded. a few scenes did work for me. i thought that the shower scene was well done and intense, and i do not feel that it was too exploitative in the context of the movie. also, the shot of the smoking chimney was eerie, but this has been lifted from other movies. what really did bring the film to its knees was the speech at the end. my god! this was even worse than steven seagal's at the end of 'fire down below'. if you want to learn about the holocaust, pick up a history book or watch some of the many documentaries on the subject. it will not be pleasant, but you'll learn so much more than from this movie.;23 December 2001;3;['mediocre', 'bad', 'stale', 'such', 'professional', 'red', 'heavy', 'such', 'goetz', 'simple', 'minded', 'few', 'shower', 'intense', 'exploitative', 'eerie', 'other', 'bad', 'many', 'pleasant', 'more'];-0.0939814814814814

706;sohylejain;"released in the year 1993, schindler's list is undoubtedly one of the best works of steven spielberg, based on the book by thomas keneally, which has won over seven academy awards including another 74 wins and 26 nominations. basically dealing with the jewish persecution by the nazis during world war ii in poland, schindler's list is a american epic historical period drama and biography of oskar schindler, who gradually becomes concerned for his jewish workforce after witnessing their persecution by the nazis. shot in black and white, with the odd carefully chosen touches in color, the horror of the holocaust is laid bare and speaks for itself. the documentary style allows spielberg to deliver his message without preaching. the clever use of light and shade also makes it visually stunning. in krakow during world war ii, the germans had forced local polish jews into the overcrowded krakow ghetto. oskar schindler, played by liam neeson, an ethnic german, arrives in the city hoping to make his fortune. a member of the nazi party, schindler lavishes bribes on wehrmacht (german armed forces) and ss officials and acquires a factory to produce enamelware. to help him run the business, schindler enlists the aid of itzhak stern, played by ben kingsley a local jewish official who has contacts with black marketeers and the jewish business community. to highlight the incongruity of this self-serving attitude, spielberg contrasts schindler's increasing prosperity with the declining fortunes of a handful of jews. schindler is careful to cultivate mutually profitable relationships with a number of high-ranking german officers, one of whom is amon goeth (ralph fiennes), the commandant of paszow concentration camp. one of the movie's strengths is that it attempts to gain some understanding of the motivations of a character like goeth, rather than taking the easy route of simply portraying him as an unthinking nazi monster, and fiennes is frighteningly convincing in his depiction of a deeply disturbed man who is all too aware of and haunted by his own shortcomings. i personally felt the movie was a little slow paced at times, but i thoroughly enjoyed it from the beginning till the very end. this movie has morals and emotion which one can hardly ignore. filled with violence and gore, it was uneasy to watch it a couple of times. dialogues were amazing, as well as the acting by liam neeson and ralph fiennes, especially was impeccable. it did not even once occur to me that i had been watching a black and white two decade old movie the whole time, thanks to the brilliant cinematographer janusz kaminski and the editor micheal kahn. among the dialogues, ""power is when we have every justification to kill, and we don't."" was the one which appealed to me the most. the movie begins with a calm feeling and ends with the same calm, but during the whole time we pass through a lot of emotion, which brought tears to my eyes, blew my mind, ultimately leaving me speechless. the movie is beautiful and a magnificent work of art, which is a sheer pleasure to watch. last but not the least, music by john williams adds a lot to the various emotions as well, without which the movie would not be the same. a terrible chapter in humanity's history but one told so well by spielberg and company. while schindler's list is ultimately an uplifting story, it's also an incredibly harrowing and emotionally draining movie. a classic movie which needs to be watched by every single person, to know how lucky we are and what 'life' is all about yet again.";15 April 2017;10;['good', 'jewish', 'american', 'epic', 'historical', 'concerned', 'jewish', 'black', 'white', 'odd', 'bare', 'clever', 'stunning', 'local', 'polish', 'overcrowded', 'ethnic', 'german', 'armed', 'local', 'jewish', 'black', 'jewish', 'careful', 'profitable', 'german', 'ralph', 'paszow', 'easy', 'convincing', 'disturbed', 'aware', 'own', 'little', 'slow', 'very', 'uneasy', 'amazing', 'liam', 'ralph', 'impeccable', 'black', 'white', 'old', 'whole', 'brilliant', 'most', 'calm', 'same', 'whole', 'beautiful', 'magnificent', 'sheer', 'last', 'least', 'various', 'same', 'terrible', 'uplifting', 'harrowing', 'classic', 'single', 'lucky'];0.1382531584062196

728;baileykerr;"i understand that as someone who considers herself a movie buff, it is a great sin that i had not seen steven spielberg's schindler's list before last sunday afternoon. in my defense though, the film came out when i was one year old. i was too young to understand the subject matter much less to bring into a movie theater. well, i have atoned for my sins and finally watched the movie. i turned it on expecting it to be a film that i know i should admire but for some reason am not grabbed by. on top of that, i have usually associated steven spielberg with jurassic park, e.t., and hook before i can even allow myself to recall that he directed saving private ryan much less other films on its same level of dramatic intensity. point being, i was not expecting schindler's list to move me. well, not only did it hurt me to watch for all of the intended reasons, it stirred up an anger and sympathy in me unlike any film i have ever seen before. this is the only true masterpiece that i have seen by steven spielberg. here he develops a careful touch in evoking outrage and fear through the quieter and even more casual (for lack of a better word) moments. he does not take the easy way when it comes to getting the audience to sympathize with the victims of the holocaust. he shows every excruciating detail, emphasizing that the most horrifying aspect of this section of history was not what was being done to the jews, but how the people committing these crimes against them felt about it. he does not even paint our main hero of the film to be a morally superior individual looking to change the world. oskar schindler (played splendidly by liam neeson) is the main hero of this film (as i'm sure you could guess). he is the reason that 1,100 jewish men, women, and children were able to escape the damnation of auschwitz. he uses an artillery factory in czechoslovakia as a cover to give these people work, keeping them out of the government's clutches. however, he is no martin luther king, jr. helping people is only his main priority in the last third of the film. beforehand, jewish people were, at best, cheap employees for his startup enamelware factory. in one early scene, a gentleman comes into schindler's office to profusely thank him for the job. soldiers of the s.s. nearly killed him, but his status as an employee at oskar schindler's factory made him ""essential to the war"" thus sparing his life. schindler shows little acknowledgement of the gratitude. quickly shaking this employee's hand then waving him off. the impression this moment leaves on schindler is only to inquire with his accountant, ""did you notice that man had one arm? how is he useful in my factory?"". who would have guessed that this insensitive individual would turn out to risk and spend everything in the name of saving the lives of others? later mourning that he did not save enough people? i certainly wouldn't have. ralph fiennes playing amon goeth puts the film on a level of brutal historical honesty that i have never seen before. he wakes up in the morning and goes to his bedroom balcony, carrying his rifle like a fresh cup of coffee. he carefully aims at one of the prisoners then shoots, killing her merely for target practice. after patting himself on the back for keeping up his skills with a gun, goeth goes back inside thinking nothing more of the murder he has just committed. this is his morning routine in the same way that anyone else would wake up, check their watch or phone, then get up to make coffee, etc. strangely enough, thanks to spielberg's marvelous direction, this is not amon goeth's most sickening scene. during one his shifts, goeth is rampaging a jewish ghetto. in this mass, stroboscopic shooting which lights up the hallways like a fire, goeth takes a cigarette break complaining to a colleague ""i wish this night were over"". his colleagues agree; they would like their shifts to end so they can go home to their wives and families, to read their books, put on music, anything just as long as it means they get off work as it is being a particularly annoying shift this night. there is no word to describe the level of consternation, anger, disgust, and countless other similar emotions that i felt in that singular moment. i had to pause the movie and collect myself, remembering that goeth and his cronies cannot hear me screaming at them, condemning them for not only what they did but for feeling no remorse. in some of the best holocaust movies i have seen, the nazis are loud, filled with pride for their blonde-haired, blue-eyed glory, and become quickly frustrated with any jews who they come in contact with. there is little to their characters except for the uniforms. in this film, they are parallel to humanity. they enjoy music, partying, joking, and complaining about work like most people. to the rest of the world, their work is one of the most unforgivable crimes in history, but to them it is a day at the office. it is ""paperwork"". the fact that steven spielberg takes the time to bring up that side of them is profoundly poignant. it is through those less obvious moments of atrocity that schindler's list ascends to a whole new level worth of respect. the best film i have ever seen about the holocaust and probably one of the best movies i have ever seen period. thank you steven spielberg for your time, effort, and dedication toward respecting the victims of this heinous and hellish event in history. for more reviews, please visit my blog art scene state at the following link: http://cinemasmarts.blogspot.com/";18 August 2016;10;['great', 'last', 'old', 'young', 'less', 'private', 'less', 'other', 'same', 'dramatic', 'only', 'true', 'careful', 'casual', 'well', 'easy', 'excruciating', 'horrifying', 'main', 'superior', 'main', 'sure', 'jewish', 'able', 'main', 'last', 'jewish', 'good', 'cheap', 'early', 'essential', 'little', 'useful', 'insensitive', 'enough', 'ralph', 'brutal', 'historical', 'fresh', 'more', 'same', 'marvelous', 'sickening', 'jewish', 'annoying', 'countless', 'other', 'similar', 'singular', 'good', 'loud', 'blonde', 'haired', 'blue', 'eyed', 'frustrated', 'little', 'parallel', 'most', 'unforgivable', 'poignant', 'obvious', 'whole', 'new', 'worth', 'good', 'good', 'heinous', 'hellish', 'more'];0.082550505050505

731;amillerz3;"schindler's list is based on the true story of oskar schindler, an affluent german businessman who made his fortune in the pots and pans industry during world war ii. after recognizing the atrocities committed by his fellow germans towards the jews, he hires as many jewish day laborers as possible, paying off officer after officer, in order to ensure their safety and freedom. i am a guy who likes to watch movies more than once: first to watch and enjoy, and the second to analyze and pinpoint the meaning of everything the director does. however, this film leaves such an impact and is so traumatic and horrifying that i could only watch it once. from the little german girl's foreshadowing words, ""goodbye, jews!"" to the death of the girl in the red dress, this movie depicts the abhorrent horrors of the holocaust, like innocent men, women and children being sent off to their inevitable death in cattle carts. the liquidation of the ghetto was, in my opinion, the most petrifying and tear-jerking sequence ever attempted. everything you think you know about common decency and humanity is just thrown away: you are sucked into this world where everyone is a potential threat, and where you can die at any given second for doing some petty, meaningless little thing, like stepping out of line. steven spielberg is honestly the bravest man in the history of filmmaking. he took a tragic era in world history and displayed it for everyone to see. people know the facts: 6 million jews were killed over the course of 6 years, the gas chambers, the incinerators, the concentration camps, etc. what people don't (or should i say didn't) know are the stories. who was friends with whom? where did they live? what was their number in the concentration camp? who lived, and who died? that is what spielberg reveals to us. he shows us the horrors and hardships suffered by a specific group of people over the course of 5 or 6 years. then, oskar schindler enters the picture. he, at first, appears to be a greedy man whose only concern is money. however, then the horror show begins, and people begin to die at his feet. at first, he only saves the jews because they are cheap labor. then, he realizes that it is his calling to save them, not for money, but for humanity. he spends his entire fortune saving jews, and in the end, he still thinks that he could have done more. ""this car. why did i keep this car? ten more people."" in one of the best acted scenes in the history of film, oskar schindler, a strong, emotionless man, breaks down into tears when he sees what more he could have done. although he is told over and over that he did enough, he keeps on thinking that he could have done more. in the end, it isn't about who he didn't save. it's about who he saved, and statistically speaking, there are more descendants of schindler's jews (as they are called) than jews living in poland. that just shows the impact that oskar schindler had on the jewish population. as my hebrew school teacher always said, ""saving one man is like saving an entire world.""";11 May 2012;10;['true', 'affluent', 'german', 'fellow', 'many', 'jewish', 'possible', 'second', 'traumatic', 'little', 'german', 'red', 'abhorrent', 'innocent', 'inevitable', 'petrifying', 'common', 'potential', 'petty', 'meaningless', 'little', 'brave', 'tragic', 'specific', 'greedy', 'only', 'cheap', 'entire', 'more', 'more', 'good', 'strong', 'more', 'more', 'more', 'jewish', 'hebrew', 'entire'];0.1315104166666666

733;gedachtniskirche;"very difficult to make a generic and objectively assess to this movie, which there are some righteous doubts in the authenticity of the historical background in. but steven spielberg, preferring to take on faith a history of the german businessman oskar schindler, with his characteristic royal scope, built his own ""spielberg's"" version of the story, that impressed him, editing the storyline, characters and types of the main actors in accordance with his personal and commercial considerations. only abstracting away from the doubts in plausibility filmed story, i can appreciate enjoy a film with unbiased perception. it is possible even to seek assistance with a particular extent of delight under such stipulations. a beautiful and moving story of selfless and honest german businessman, member of the nazi party, oskar schindler, a brave, daring, going against the system. but importunate and suspicious taste of something unnatural and inedible prevents obediently to chew and swallow the product prepared by spielberg,having never choked. what was guided by steven spielberg, forcing him to stop his choice on a candidature of ralph fiennes for the amon goeth's role? maybe his diabolical sexuality? but, pardon me, the real amon goeth evoked a completely different impressions! he inspired fear and trembling! make-up artists vainly tried to abundantly dye in a dark the reddish color of the face's ""vegetation"" of the actor; the actor vainly rehearsed in front of the mirror the most disgusting and frightening cruelty's ""symptoms"" on the his face; he vainly stuck out his unnaturally drooped, due to excessive ""guinnes"" consumption, belly, - ralph fiennes was hopelessly far from a real amon goeth. the spielberg's idea was realized! the director's idea to draw the increased attention to historical-biographical drama of the female audience with the help of the charming ""bad boy"", who gracefully shoots, as morning exercises, the jews, frightened to death, from his villa's balcony, - is failed to cheer him. it was successful so well, that we don't feel fair disgust and loathing for fiennes's character. on the contrary, sometimes we laugh over his comic remarks and ridiculous pomposity. so where disgust will undertake from, if the adventurous director turned cruel, mentally unbalanced alcoholic into polished glamorous ss-dummy!? women are thrilled and fall into a hypnotic trance from his painted bottomless black eyes, men delightedly appreciate elegant ss-uniform, perfectly tailored fit, and negligent, but so graceful possession of firearms. that's a truly excellent and win-win move! it's hard to call the real goeth even a little attractive and charismatic. especially in the years when he became a commandant of plaszow. overweight, with a huge shivering belly, with a bloated of regular alcoholic libation, lop-eared, balding guy with the loathsome appearance, he doesn't distantly even remind the noble thoroughbred appearance of the british actor. the question is, why tim roth's candidate, originally proposed for the role of plaszow's commandant didn't please spielberg? that's really who would fully embody this odious image, having forced the audience to feel hate and contempt for his character. having conveyed the impeccability and truthfulness of the story, the director wouldn't receive delights and falls of thankful sobs. his ennobled and presumptuous oscar schindler had to be pleasant to the audience by all means, having excluded any suspicions in decency and unselfishness of his true outbursts. his glossy and dandified amon goeth, also should not have caused the unanimous disgust among spectators, but finely contribute to the commercial success of the film. and these characters were undoubtedly successful! with the only one amendment: they are hopelessly far from their real prototypes. why the eminent director so responsibly and meticulously approached to selection of the skinny and too exhausted men and women, participating in the crowd of prisoners of concentration camp, but so ridiculously missed with the main embodiment of the evil in the movie? just only one steven spielberg knows, why the main characters and story lines of the screened story are so mercilessly deformed, while the secondary moments are scrupulously and meticulously closed to the reality but as a result, everybody remained happy: the director didn't manage to count the box office and receive enthusiastic praises of film critics choking with impressions, actors ""coin boxes"" were replenished with new characteristic roles, and the audience that believed in a fairy tale of good and unselfish german businessman, didn't manage to change handkerchiefs, become impregnated through with their fluids of snot and drool. what in general to create the caricatures on tragical, historical and biographic dramas for? the talented spielberg has many excellent movies in different genres, from the same military and to science fiction, so it is possible to turn around in the full extent of his inexhaustible and rich imagination within the screenplay. but no, he prepared his project for years, diligently and concentrated studied biographies of heroes, met with eyewitnesses of events, carried out an actor's castings, so the audience saw the upside down turned story in the end. the story, where we with equal degree of sympathy treat both charming oscar schindler, and deliberately comical and not less charming amon goeth, with manicured fingers and porcelain face from the excess of make-up. and, by the way, ""schindler's list"" - is one of the movies-the champions of the number of absurd and rude goofs. alas, it often happens, that the grandiose plan is realized in the same grandiose project, it interferes the deep perception with it's coverage and the grandiloquent announcement, programming the ""consumers"" for quite expected unanimous, just weak-sighted admiration. by the way, roman polanski ignored the search of weedy and bony actors for his crowd scene in his ""the pianist"" , but he is fully focused on the main thing, creating almost identical to the real cinematic images. the director honestly conveyed the authenticity of the story, without romantic embellishment and alternative finals. but steven spielberg believes that he has all the reasons to rewrite the history.";8 July 2013;5;['difficult', 'generic', 'righteous', 'historical', 'german', 'characteristic', 'royal', 'own', 'main', 'personal', 'commercial', 'unbiased', 'possible', 'particular', 'such', 'beautiful', 'selfless', 'honest', 'german', 'brave', 'daring', 'suspicious', 'unnatural', 'inedible', 'ralph', 'diabolical', 'real', 'different', 'reddish', 'disgusting', 'frightening', 'excessive', 'ralph', 'real', 'historical', 'biographical', 'female', 'charming', 'bad', 'successful', 'fair', 'comic', 'ridiculous', 'adventurous', 'cruel', 'unbalanced', 'polished', 'glamorous', 'hypnotic', 'bottomless', 'black', 'elegant', 'fit', 'negligent', 'graceful', 'excellent', 'hard', 'real', 'little', 'attractive', 'charismatic', 'huge', 'regular', 'alcoholic', 'loathsome', 'noble', 'thoroughbred', 'british', 'odious', 'thankful', 'ennobled', 'presumptuous', 'pleasant', 'true', 'glossy', 'dandified', 'unanimous', 'commercial', 'successful', 'only', 'real', 'eminent', 'exhausted', 'main', 'main', 'secondary', 'happy', 'enthusiastic', 'new', 'characteristic', 'good', 'unselfish', 'german', 'general', 'tragical', 'historical', 'biographic', 'talented', 'many', 'excellent', 'different', 'same', 'possible', 'full', 'inexhaustible', 'rich', 'studied', 'upside', 'equal', 'charming', 'comical', 'charming', 'absurd', 'rude', 'grandiose', 'same', 'grandiose', 'deep', 'unanimous', 'weak', 'sighted', 'weedy', 'main', 'identical', 'real', 'cinematic', 'romantic', 'alternative'];0.1542290280857353
734;snawx;this work of art is as much of a masterpiece as people say it is. beforehand, i thought it was merely overrated. but that, i can tell you, is absolutely not true. this is a masterpiece, empowered by amazing acting, directing, filming and attributes. i've been taken through a rollercoaster of emotions. from fear, to anger, to joy, to grief. schindler's list (1993) is an amazing movie, so i wasn't surprised that it was directed by steven spielberg. liam neeson has done a very good job acting as oskar schindler. he has portrayed his emotions very well, helplessness as well as showing true power. ralph fiennes hasn't disappointed me either as he showed us great insanity throughout the movie. while oskar schindler himself was a man of innocence, he was not innocent at all. he had taken part in the entertaining side of nazi activities willingly. many will say it was done for the greater good. people who actually watched the movie, will know that a big part of schindler himself told him that he's acting dangerously and should stop helping humanity but rather help his bank account. but an even bigger part took out on his emotions and actually helped the schindler jews - later on in the movie. i'm very happy that the good side of oskar schindler took over. he said himself, 'war brings out only the bad in people. just the bad.', ironically! the little details throughout the whole movie have very much amazed me. every gory scene showing massacred jews, intense shooting scenes, ss activities and so on. his list looked just like names. his golden nazi pin looked just like gold, not like a person. but actually seeing the bad that was done to innocent jews, has made a huge difference up to this day. still, i am more touched by visuals than by mere numbers. actual persons, actual blood and actual pain. it was all shown, and i'm glad it was. it makes one realise what the war was actually like. even the noir filming did not matter. everything came out just as emotional. i absolutely recommend this movie to everyone who wants to know what a powerful but good man does during the second world war, or how jews were treated.;31 March 2018;9;['much', 'overrated', 'true', 'amazing', 'amazing', 'surprised', 'good', 'helplessness', 'true', 'ralph', 'great', 'innocent', 'entertaining', 'many', 'great', 'big', 'big', 'happy', 'good', 'bad', 'bad', 'little', 'whole', 'amazed', 'gory', 'intense', 'golden', 'bad', 'innocent', 'huge', 'mere', 'actual', 'actual', 'actual', 'glad', 'like', 'emotional', 'powerful', 'good', 'second'];0.2089285714285714

739;silly-7;schindler's list is undoubtedly one of spielberg's finest films, and there countless reasons why. spielberg is able to portray oskar schindler(liam neeson) as a womanizer, shrewd businessman, and profiteer of the war in a way that does justice to the character's complexity. through the use of black and white he brings you back to the time of the holocaust, while using color in the present to bridge the gap between past and present. in particular, the use of black and white to identify the holocaust is appropriate given the brutal nature of the event. people dream in color, but they have nightmares in black and white. the scenes themselves help show the facelessness of the holocaust and the horror it brought to its victims. in particular, there is one scene in which a number of jews are forced into a shower expecting to be gassed. the looks on their faces, along with the moving music, makes this scene one of tremendous fright. although in this scene the jews are not gassed, the message of this scene is there- even when jews were not being killed, they were subject to horrors beyond the imagination of the human mind- everyone was a victim, including those who were not killed. all in all, spielberg uses the medium to his advantage and recreates in vivid detail much of the holocaust, while also telling a story of how one overcomes his ignorance to help others in the end.;7 June 1999;10;['fine', 'countless', 'able', 'shrewd', 'black', 'white', 'present', 'particular', 'black', 'white', 'appropriate', 'brutal', 'black', 'white', 'particular', 'tremendous', 'subject', 'vivid', 'much'];0.0481481481481481

756;retasulover;it's difficult for any one person to pick one movie by spielberg that stands above all his others. however, if i had to choose his greatest movie when it came to sentimental value, and pure power, schindler's list is that movie. it's very painful for anyone to see such authentic acting displaying the mistreatment and sorrow of european jews during wwii in nazi germany, but it is especially hard for me, as i am actually jewish, and my grandfather was a german soldier in wwii in russia. schindler's list is a very faithful and powerful film send up of the novel of the same name. liam neeson delivers an incredibly devoted and emotional role as oskar schindler, who is indeed one of histories few true heroes. the slow transformation in oskar schindler from greedy businessman to savior throughout the movie, is one of the greatest character developments in film history. it's rather difficult to pull off a memorable villain role when it comes to being historically accurate, but ralph fiennes pulls it off as the sadistic and crafty nazi officer, amon goeth. ralph fiennes truly knows how to chill the viewers to the bone when his presence is nearby, especially when he is upset, and therefore probably going to kill a few jews just to shake off his bad mood. the scene where a hungover amon wakes up with a naked woman still in his bed and he wordlessly grabs a sniper rifle from his villa balcony and snipes a few working jews in the camp at the foot of the hill is especially shocking, showing just how heartless this man truly is. one of this films strongest points, is the masterful soundtrack that is made up of a slew of traditional jewish folk songs, and a heart-wrenching violin score by john williams and itzhak perlman. an especially emotional scene where the music is at its best is of course, the finale when the war in germany has officially been declared finished. oskar notifies the 1,100 jews he had saved from auschwitz by taking them to work in his factory that the allies will come looking for him and most likely kill him. perlman's violin score is almost able to send goosebumps up your spine as schindler leaves for his car and is given a solid gold ring made from one of his jews' golden teeth as a token of gratitude, and he breaks down crying, while lamenting that he didn't save more. truly, this is liam neeson at his best. anyone who couldn't find any good points for this film, would either have some very strong nazi beliefs, or not truly appreciate what a good film really is. for any spielberg devotees like myself, this is a film that i strongly recommend. let it be known lastly, that this is a very emotional movie, and it was just the same backstage too, as spielberg has noted that he was actually crying while behind the camera on multiple occasions while filming schindler's list. this is one of the greatest movies ever made, and should always be recognized as such.;20 February 2009;10;['difficult', 'great', 'sentimental', 'pure', 'painful', 'such', 'authentic', 'european', 'hard', 'jewish', 'german', 'faithful', 'powerful', 'same', 'devoted', 'emotional', 'few', 'true', 'slow', 'greedy', 'great', 'difficult', 'memorable', 'accurate', 'ralph', 'sadistic', 'crafty', 'ralph', 'nearby', 'upset', 'few', 'bad', 'naked', 'few', 'shocking', 'heartless', 'strong', 'masterful', 'traditional', 'jewish', 'emotional', 'good', 'finished', 'able', 'solid', 'golden', 'more', 'liam', 'good', 'good', 'strong', 'good', 'emotional', 'same', 'multiple', 'great', 'such'];0.1345496894409938

761;LallaHolti;"the story of oskar schindler saving 1100 jews is fortunately not only a story made up by a few writers from hollywood, but it is true. the fact that this story is true shows on the one hand the greatness of people, even existing in a regime like the third reich, but as well the horrors of the holocaust. this movie shows with a lot of respect for the victims, but without any blinders the real horror and the madness of the third reich. it really teaches one about the insanity possible in a person. but next to the shown insanity one can also learn so much about the power of one single person trying to move something. the movie teaches one really that if you really want to achieve something that you can do it, even under the worst circumstances possible, even when you have to risk your own safety and life. you really have to believe in yourself and in your actions. if you do so, your plans will work. of course not to forget are the unbelievable actors. all of them did a phenomenal job and it would be unfair to mention only one of them. so instead of giving every single name, generalizing will do. the cast was just unbelievable good, especially imagining what kind of movie they made and with which piece of history they had to deal. to sum things up one can say that this movie is really about fighting for your believings and fighting for those people, who need your help. and i think it is also an enormous tribute to an unbelievable brave man: oskar schindler. just as they did in the movie i think the best sentence to say at the end is a quote from the talmud: ""whoever saves one life, saves the world entire."" it describes the actions of oskar schindler in the best way, in which it could be done in words.";20 February 2007;10;['few', 'true', 'true', 'third', 'real', 'third', 'possible', 'much', 'single', 'bad', 'possible', 'own', 'unbelievable', 'phenomenal', 'unfair', 'single', 'unbelievable', 'good', 'enormous', 'unbelievable', 'brave', 'good', 'entire', 'good'];0.1094155844155844
762;SpiralWire;"schindler's list is truly a excellent movie, not simply the way in which it is shot, but also the way it conveys exactly what it meant for one man to save a few lives. oskar schindler, a nazi industrialist, employs jews and ultimately negotiates for their diversion from auschwitz and into his factory. on the outset we are given the impression that he is merely a businessman, regarding the jews as nothing more than money-making tools. but we are able to slowly learn that it is only by giving this cold-hearted impression to the nazi officers he barters with that he could be successful - to simply fight the cause of the jews would probably have seen him hanged. no, schindler is cleverer than that, and manages to save the lives of over one thousand doomed jews; men, women and children. his humanity slowly emerges throughout the film, sometimes in palpable acts of kindness such as insisting that the trains carrying jews on a hot day are hosed with cooling water. in stark contrast, the nazi commandant in charge of the labour camp, amon goeth (ralph feinnes), is a psychotic killer whose methods of operation run to arbitrary killings and a total hatred of the jew race. it is he who schindler must befriend and gain trust from in order to save as many people as possible. the film avoids simply documenting a piece of history that we have heard before. by focusing on a handful of personal experiences, an emotional anchor is provided for the audience with which we can go much deeper into the meaning of what is happening. the atrocities carried out principally by amon goeth and by other nazi officers, which involve harrowing scenes of fear and suffering are integrated with the importance of recognising how important each individual person is. whilst we see goeth taking pot-shots at working jews in the morning from his balcony, and thus demonstrating his total indifference to jewish lives, we are shown schindler, who at the end, weeps for every single life he couldn't save. this is manifested superbly by him looking at his gold pin badge: it would have bought him one more person to be saved. and so we learn that schindler's acts were not about numbers, since as his jewish assistant reassures him, saving one life is saving everyone.";4 June 2005;9;['excellent', 'few', 'more', 'able', 'cold', 'hearted', 'successful', 'clever', 'doomed', 'palpable', 'such', 'hot', 'stark', 'ralph', 'psychotic', 'arbitrary', 'total', 'many', 'possible', 'personal', 'emotional', 'deep', 'other', 'harrowing', 'important', 'individual', 'total', 'jewish', 'single', 'more', 'jewish'];0.1026014109347442

767;Robbo-3;this film is a must see for anyone, it is based on the true story of oskar(oscar) schindler and his brave heroic saving of many lives during and after world war 2. there is no way to explain how much schindler did and must have gone through to achieve what he did. this is not a sci-fi film but a film of one mans manipulation of using evil people to save lives. the way schindler risks his own life by cleverly ensuring that he has made friends of the most powerful nazis in the area he lives and works in, to ensure that if things go against him he has an 'escape route' shows the mans intelligence. one of the main things that has to be said about schindler was that he certainly never could ever be classed as a racist, or as some have suggested using the jewish people to save his own skin. this as shown in the film is far from the truth, schindler is awake to the evil actions of the nazis and their intentions to wipe them from the face of the planet. for anyone thinking of watching this great film that is in two minds as to whether to or not - the answer is go for it you will not be dissapointed. the film as i say is based on fact and not to be sniffed at when looking at what schindler did for the jewish people, he saved the lives of many many jews and of course their offspring, many jewish families today owe their lives to oskar schindler. one of the best films ever made in my opinion and will always be rated as such..........;14 June 2002;10;['true', 'brave', 'heroic', 'many', 'much', 'evil', 'own', 'powerful', 'main', 'jewish', 'own', 'awake', 'evil', 'great', 'jewish', 'many', 'many', 'many', 'jewish', 'good', 'such'];0.2640350877192982

785;insano-1;"some spoilers steven spielberg's 1993 masterpiece, 'schindler's list' is not only a historical account of the atrocities of world war ii, but also a passionate tale of survival and finding humanity over greed that all films dealing with the holocaust must live by. ""schindler's list"" is about nazi war profiteer, oskar schindler , who, with help from jewish accountant itzak stern attempts to save money in his pot and pan producing factory by using cheap jewish labor. through the story, his motives change from earning gains to preserving life, as he uses his factory as a safe haven for jews who otherwise would not have been saved; such as the elderly, young, handicapped. the film is a historically educational as it is emotionally scaring, launching the audience far past the point of tears to the edge of gut wrenching so powerful, it makes them want to vomit from the horrors committed on the innocent by fellow man. i, myself, am a weeper when it comes to movies, and no matter how hard i try, can't seem to muster the strength to not cry like a ten year old girl by the end at schindler's emotional breakdown on the footsteps of his factory; casting aside a pin that could have saved one more life, or a car that could have saved ten. the film itself is as close to perfect as a movie can get, and by no means, a casual watch.";3 January 2004;10;['historical', 'passionate', 'jewish', 'stern', 'cheap', 'jewish', 'safe', 'such', 'elderly', 'young', 'handicapped', 'educational', 'powerful', 'innocent', 'fellow', 'old', 'emotional', 'more', 'close', 'casual'];0.14

788;Avenge85;"---minor spoilers within--- it is amazing to believe that in 1993 steven spielberg was responsible for creating two of the most influential films of the last number of decades. with great aplomb he produced 'jurassic park' - a film reflecting the calibre of his imagination and the potential of computer generated imagery in order to enhance the realism of film. 'schindler's list' on the other hand was never intended to be a show-case for imagination and new technologies. in fact, it strives to demonstrate the suffering caused by both of these factors when they are within the grasp of 'the wrong hands.' imagination and the ability to generate differences that do not exist is a core-factor that has led from one attempted genocide to another. during the second world war and the occupation of europe it became clear that fictional differences were driving the operation to eliminate the jewish people. the second factor, technology allowed mass-movement of the state's victims and their extermination - mechanisms lubricated by the contemporary propaganda of radio, film, rallies and posters. this film is about two men, not one, who stood against the grain of the nazi propaganda machine and eventually set their differences aside. these men were oskar schindler and itzhak stern - a nazi party official and an accountant. within this iconic piece of film their relationship is strengthened through functionality and trust. oskar schindler is introduced as a reserved, womanising, money-wielding and disloyal industrialist. he wines and dines those in high positions, throwing lavish parties (whilst people die at his feet in the ghettos) in order to acquire future business contacts and 'friends in high places.' the prime concern in his life is his wealth and profit. his early opinions are summarised by his quote: ""now i see, in the past my businesses have failed as there was no war."" over the years however, oskar grows to love the jewish people working in his industrial factory knowing that he and only he has the power and contacts to save them. itzhak stern was the jewish accountant employed by schindler to operate the economic necessities of the factory, he was responsible for the employment of the jews - insisting that they would save money and could be swiftly trained to operate the machinery. stern was the modest protector of his people, and frequently hires those who would not last in the harsh conditions outside the factory. stern leads to one of the most joyful and sorrowful moments of the film - the hiring of an old, one-armed man as a machine-operator insistent on thanking mr schindler personally. ""of what use is a one-armed worker?"" cried schindler ""he has valuable skills"" replied stern - ""he's a metal press operator."" ""very skilled."" this in itself was amusing, but i cried when schindler himself uses stern's reply to defend the worker when quizzed by a nazi official. schindler was touched by stern and the honest of his people, his slow change of outlook became evident as the film progressed. the film itself is magnificently well paced allowing timely plot and character development under various settings and scenarios. the black and white footage with the selective hint of colour allows the viewers to look on this dreadful event without distraction or confusion. the 'snow' scene is the pinnacle of cinematic shock and many of the following scenes make you wince with fear for the people which, on-screen you have inexorably bonded with. i feel that the tagline of the film: ""whoever saves one life, saves the world entire."" a line taken from the inscription engraved on the ring gifted to schindler by the people he had harboured owes greater relevance to stern. itzhak had saved the life of schindler from the greed of money - now long spent on buying the freedom and food for 1,100 jews. oskar was liberated from his mind bent on profit - which had now been retrofitted to manufacture love and understanding. as stern saved one life - schindler could save hope for the world entire. there is always good within every evil created by man and money. an accurate expression of the elegant truth within a context of differentiation. andrew n. mcvea";25 April 2004;10;['amazing', 'responsible', 'influential', 'last', 'great', 'other', 'new', 'wrong', 'second', 'clear', 'fictional', 'jewish', 'second', 'contemporary', 'iconic', 'disloyal', 'high', 'lavish', 'future', 'high', 'prime', 'early', 'jewish', 'industrial', 'jewish', 'economic', 'responsible', 'modest', 'harsh', 'joyful', 'sorrowful', 'old', 'armed', 'armed', 'valuable', 'stern', 'skilled', 'amusing', 'honest', 'slow', 'evident', 'timely', 'various', 'black', 'white', 'selective', 'dreadful', 'cinematic', 'many', 'entire', 'great', 'good', 'accurate', 'elegant'];0.1483259423503326

798;Kyle007;first of all it is a reminder of the crimes committed in the times of world war ii, and second it is a homage to schindler, something that he really deserved and he wasn't always recognized for what he did. at the beginning of the story, schindler is with no doubt another nazi, with the same mentality of them, and so he decides to take double advantage of the war, not only manufacturing things for the armies but also hiring jews to pay them less than he should , so his benefits were going to be spectacular, he really makes lots of money doing so, but with the course of the war he sees with his own eyes what was actually happening to the jews and he begins to change his mind about that, it is true that the character played by ben kingsley helps to the change even though with a low profile, so that's when he realizes that he can save people instead of taking advantage of them, how? when he hires jews he is automatically saving them from death, so he does so, but only in secret he knows the real reason of jew-hiring otherwise, he would be accused of betrayal against the germany.he even gets to pay money to the nazi's to hire jews, and that's when he makes a sacrifice and invests the money he made from the war, and so he proofs once again why he is worthy of acknowledgement. all that is about the plot, but i have to say that the way spielberg carries the story is really interesting and makes you stay still in front of the tv, he shows us a view of world war ii from another perspective than the traditional of the battles, it shows us how much that group of people suffered in that particular period of history and why we shouldn't forget the past to don't make the same mistakes in a future. first, when the movie is just beginning you wonder why is it in black and white, but then you realize it is some kind of history lesson, and spielberg didn't actually need the colour for this movie, it had no special effects and was focused in the plot, and the development of it. in this movie he demonstrated why cinema is considered as another art. for all this is that this movie deserves to be with the greatests movies ever, and mainly because the story told is true and no fiction.;3 March 2005;10;['same', 'double', 'less', 'spectacular', 'own', 'true', 'low', 'real', 'worthy', 'interesting', 'traditional', 'much', 'particular', 'same', 'black', 'white', 'special', 'true'];0.1931547619047619

801;moisesalexramirez;"although there have been many attempts through numerous mediums to capture the horror, the inhumanity, the helplessness of the holocaust, only through the eyes and hands of spielberg has this black phase in the history books become the foundation for a superb masterpiece, a work of art that is also a tribute and a remembrance to those that perished and those that still live to this day and were unfortunate enough to live this savagery. schindler's list is likely to make you cry, and if it doesn't, it will definitely not make you feel happiness, as you slowly watch the brutality of men take away what little joy you had before and during the show. its realistic and relentless substance generates grief and reflection that not many films can offer, and it is present in every minute. any sensitive people are advised to be emotionally and mentally prepared. spielberg's vision for the second world war and the depressing take on its participants (and ultimately victims) and their environments is unmatched. the cinematography stands out as some of the best that spielberg has shown us, and never seems to disappoint throughout the entirety of the film; it does justice to those who most needed justice and their tale to the world. the admirable and tragic life of oskar schindler, the manner in which it is portrayed by an excellent script and an outstanding performance by liam neeson, and the decisions he ultimately makes will probably make a small percentage of the viewers reevaluate their beliefs and outlook on life, but even if it fails to do so with the rest, it achieves the objective of history classes in schools: to learn not to make the same mistakes, and it does so with marvelous execution on a subject that is sometimes forsaken. it transcends as both a study and a visual art. john william's score is nothing short of magical, majestic in a harrowing, yet spellbinding way. it is an essential addition to an already beautiful piece; the connection between the score and the film is the epitome of chemistry between the two that many other filmmakers should study. schindler's list may disappoint as a date film or as a family addition, but it will never fail to give us a glance of a subject that, although controversial, should serve as a lesson of why history is important to learn.";13 April 2016;10;['many', 'numerous', 'black', 'superb', 'unfortunate', 'likely', 'little', 'realistic', 'relentless', 'many', 'present', 'sensitive', 'second', 'depressing', 'unmatched', 'good', 'admirable', 'tragic', 'excellent', 'outstanding', 'small', 'same', 'marvelous', 'visual', 'short', 'magical', 'majestic', 'harrowing', 'essential', 'beautiful', 'many', 'other', 'controversial', 'important'];0.1961206896551724

823;johnno74;"schindler's list is based on the novel schindler's ark by thomas keneally and on a true story about a german factory worker, oskar schindler, who is a member of the nazi party and due to his decreasing number of employees, employs the jewish residents in his factory. schindler's list explores the true dark side of the second world war. unlike most world war two based movies, schindler's list is based on the holocaust; the cruelty of the jews during the period. the film is also a history lesson; it explores all the years of the war; starting from 1939, the start of the war, to the very end, although the main focus is oskar schindler whose actor is liam neeson (star wars episode 1: the phantom menace, a-team movie). the character, not only is represented as a womanizer and laid-back, but he is obviously the odd one out; he does not see the jews as bad people unlike the other nazis and because it is his job to employ factory workers, cannot resist temptation in saving the jews from the camps, where the jews are imprisoned. this shows the message that working on the evil side is the only way to rescue innocent people, which is what would have occurred during a brutal era like world war two. this is why the film deservedly won the academy award for best picture. john williams' incredible score links very well with the german jewish culture, but also represents sadness and bleakness in the story, because it tempts the viewers to feel sympathy for the jews. the black and white tone also suggests the darkness of the story, but also links with the 1940s setting when most films used the colour tone. even if it looks older than other nineties movies, schindler's list was definitely a modern film; for one reason, the film combines black and white with colour; the first shot consisting of a group of jews paying respects to oskar schindler is filmed using colour and the viewer will easily spot a tiny amount of colour during one of the crowd scenes. another reason is due to the following actors in the film; ben kingsley (gandhi, thunderbirds movie) who plays ishaak stern, ralph fiennes (wallace & gromit in the curse of the were-rabbit) as amon goth and caroline goodall (hook) the actress of emilie schindler. schindler's list was directed by steven spielberg who won an oscar for best director and is considered one of his best works ever. it proves that steven does not just direct thrilling adventure movies!";4 January 2011;10;['novel', 'true', 'german', 'jewish', 'true', 'dark', 'second', 'most', 'very', 'main', 'liam', 'phantom', 'odd', 'bad', 'other', 'evil', 'only', 'innocent', 'brutal', 'good', 'incredible', 'german', 'jewish', 'black', 'white', 'most', 'old', 'other', 'modern', 'black', 'white', 'first', 'tiny', 'due', 'stern', 'ralph', 'good', 'good', 'direct'];0.0747474747474747
824;paultd;"standard classroom issue for high school students across the world, schindler's list is a poignant reminder of the holocaust. masterminded by steven spielberg and enriched with lamenting tones from itzhak perlman, the hearts of these sons of zion went into the making of this film of films. the viewer is spared none of the harrowing realities of the holocaust. jews with proper education were hated the most, and were killed viciously. some were spared and mocked rather than killed, as long as they provided entertainment for nazi soldiers. not all german officers were iron-hearted. some were driven mad by the slaughtering. as schindler said best, ""war always brings out the worst in people."" in only a few hours, the film exposed more truths than months spent reading history textbooks. meticulous attention is paid to the development of characters. at the start, schindler is shown to be a self-serving, wily businessman who takes advantage of jewish labour to the benefit of his factory. by the end, the horror he witnesses has transformed him into a saviour. he forgets every dream of wealth he ever held, and agonizes over being unable to save more jews. amon goeth, the commander at the concentration camp in krakow, is a mirror-image of hitler. goeth possesses a blind and irrational hatred of jews. he kills them for pleasure and considers them to be worthless, yet he is attracted to one named helen hirsch. hitler's similar hypocrisies need not be explained. we are given such polar personalities to consider in this portrayal of the human condition. we are witness to inexplicable kindness and ruthless savagery. through it all, neeson and fiennes give such dynamic performances that we forget we are looking at actors, not men. this is a thoroughly disturbing film. children who barely know the definition of hate participate in the verbal and physical bombardment of jews. in countless scenes, families are ruthlessly separated. when jews are mercilessly shot, the action is quick and brutal. there are no ""hollywood"" deaths. the sequences are all realistically frightening. another sickening scene shows amon goeth sniping jews from his balcony simply for enjoyment and target practice. it is hard to imagine such twisted men could exist. elsewhere, jews rub their own blood on their faces to look livelier and stand a better chance of being selected for work. why? unselected individuals are gassed. after a shake of our heads, we realize that these horrifying details are a testament to the film's true quality. there is good reason for the lack of colour. it helps emphasize key moments of the story featured in colour, such as the vibrant candles that are lit for a jewish couple's marriage. colour signifies hope, and is used sparingly as hope is not something that existed in any great quantity during those days. in many ways, this is a unique film for spielberg. he has departed from providing glowing, satisfying, heart-warming cinema. yet there are bold elements of action and adventure passed on from his earlier works. look how schindler's suspenseful dealings with suspicious german officials are played out. see how he dramatically saves the jews on numerous occasions. we are kept to the edge of our seats by methods only spielberg could conjure. steven zaillian provides an immaculate script. nothing feels out of time or place. a few have complained that the spoken language is unauthentically english. does it matter what language the holocaust is portrayed in? can the impact be reduced in any way? nothing is changed, for the message is universal. when one thinks back to the holocaust, one thinks of despair. within the hopelessness rose an unlikely hero. this movie is a tribute to the jews, to their struggle, and to the gentile who lent a righteous hand.";16 June 2006;10;['standard', 'high', 'poignant', 'harrowing', 'proper', 'most', 'german', 'hearted', 'mad', 'good', 'bad', 'few', 'more', 'meticulous', 'wily', 'jewish', 'unable', 'more', 'blind', 'irrational', 'worthless', 'helen', 'similar', 'such', 'polar', 'human', 'inexplicable', 'ruthless', 'neeson', 'such', 'dynamic', 'disturbing', 'verbal', 'physical', 'countless', 'quick', 'brutal', 'hollywood', 'frightening', 'hard', 'such', 'twisted', 'own', 'well', 'unselected', 'horrifying', 'true', 'good', 'key', 'such', 'vibrant', 'jewish', 'great', 'many', 'unique', 'satisfying', 'bold', 'early', 'suspenseful', 'suspicious', 'german', 'numerous', 'few', 'spoken', 'english', 'universal', 'unlikely', 'righteous'];-0.0399382716049382

857;HaydnEngel;strong and persuasive without being visceral. schindler's list touches on the lives of many without feeling too sentimental to its subjects. it wants to be objective and given what we have seen throughout the history of cinema, propaganda and jingoism. one needs an honest look at the tragedies of humanity. be: it is spielberg's masterpiece, and like coppola, he spent the first little while trying to emulate it and then decided to just shoot whatever he wanted. the film is pure vision and drive. everyone on set put in their best performance, and as always spielberg's sequencing is outstanding, and most should be jealous with how easily he pulls it off. the editing is high class. with only a few issues here or there. it is incredible to think in a 195-minute movie that there are not huge chunks that you could remove, but somehow the editing has kept this behemoth of a film moving along at a steady pace. w: the dialogue is quite good, but one cannot help but feel that there is a touch of the hollywood pen in the script, and it is zaillian writing, so that goes without saying. other than the faux tension ratching, it is very decent. c: arguably kaminski's best film, though the argument against that is saving private ryan. so you can decide for yourself. that said, other than a few stutters with the camera. like in the shot where they are bringing the lens down from the bridge to the boat. the film is shot perfectly for how you want this story to be portrayed, and that is what cinematography is supposed to do, it is supposed to accentuate the story. and the girl in red scene shall remain one of my favourites of all time. the shower scene aside, the visual effects excellent. a: liam neeson's best role, before he showed the world that much like harrison ford, he plays the same character in almost every film. thankfully at this point, he is still fresh. ralph fiennes built a career from this role, and he would remain a constant in parts in need of snivelling yet powerful monsters for years after, but no character has matched his performance in schindler's list and rightly so it is a convincing portrayal of a man lost in his convictions yet still has a shred of the humanity that existed in him before the war. kingsley is excellent with a subdued performance, which is usually the best kingsley, sexy beast aside. it gives neeson's performance something to bounce off and allow for a better emotional understanding of the character. s: the sound is excellent, and the score is terrific. so much so it does make me ponder whether spielberg's film would be the same without it? williams builds tension that spills morosely over tragedy and celebratory fatigue. pd: is excellent save for the few touches in the concentration camps and only the most anal filmgoers are going to pick up on that. ba: authentic and eye-catching, though does fall victim to the standard nerd mistakes and the black-white filming does prevent it from being a little higher as it could be hiding a plethora of errors, but as is seen, it is well done. evo: this is not a relaxing tuesday flick, but it is a flick anyone with a love of films or humanity should see. i have not seen many people who have disliked it, rita kempley aside. it is a tough watch for some, but it is rewarding in its own way. notes: this film is one of the ones that made me realise there needs to be a standard with critics they do not need to follow mine, but they need to explain what they are ranking. the reality is their review is 90% evo and with no thought put in. take rita kempley who wrote for the washington post. she gave schindler's list a 60, pulp fiction a 70, supergirl the 1984 movie was given an 80, mary reilly was a 70, splash a 100, so splash is a perfect movie whereas schindler's list is barely passable under what metric? she also ranks the wedding singer at 70 and das boot as a 60. all i learned from her reviews is that she likes crappy romantic comedies and does not appreciate long drawn out films, and if she was some person on imdb filling out a review that would be fine. but when you are the film critic for supposedly one of the best newspapers in the usa. it looks foolish, with no sense of purpose. when you are ranking summer school (1987) as an arguably better film than schindler's list than maybe you should not be a film critic. which raises the question of what are film critics judging?

865;Mr_White101;"""schindler's list"" (1994) schindler's list is an academy award, golden globe, bafta and grammy winning 1993 movie based on the book schindler's ark by thomas keneally. adapted by steven zaillian and directed by steven spielberg, it relates the tale of oskar schindler, a sudeten-german catholic businessman who was instrumental in saving the lives of over one thousand polish jews during the holocaust. the title refers to a list of the names of 1,100 jews whom schindler hired to work in his factory and kept from being sent to concentration camps, and falling victim to nazi officer amon goth, a sociopath who perceives jews as ''vermin''. whilst steven spielberg's breathtakingly superb masterwork schindler's list contains a vast amount of stunning shots, the one that sticks in my mind the most is found about half the way through the picture, an image of amon goth and oskar schindler sitting atop a balcony over goth's concentration camp. the shot captures the most prolific of contrasts contained in the film. firstly, a man so sadistic we instinctively see him as a human embodiment of 'evil'. then on the other side of the frame is a man caught between two extremes, gradually discovering who he is and the power of the individual. usually of course, we don't have such roles, just simply 'the good' and 'the bad'. although this is not this case here, as we are given characters built up imaginatively and yet realistically and as a result remain incredibly deep and complex personas throughout. the majestic depiction of power in this image is so significant that the viewer can sense the stench of sovereignty coming off these people- but the mastery of the two men differ drastically. we have one who relishes in the rewards of his immorality and the scale of his power and influence. and then we have our protagonist, if you can call him that at this point in the film, at war with his own conscience, giving us the centrepiece and motivation for one of the most exquisitely told tales in the history of cinema. a superb piece, which presents massacres as real events, not figures, and portrays a complete moral transition subtly and believably, as opposed to cliche smiles and corny montages. schindler's list works primarily on obvious aspects; it's ability to capture the holocaust on a grand, monumental scale, it's glorious character study and it's staggering cinematography. but this you all know, or can decipher within your first viewing. this isn't to say these traits aren't spectacular, but we find several examples of greatness, such as the passionate directorial effort, the historical accuracy, the career-highlighting performances, the light- hearted comedic moments, the schindler/stern relationship and the film's emotionally stirring closing sequence, to name a few. at one point we are shown the interior of a krakow church, which artistically transcends beauty- and yet, within seconds, we are shown the shady deals of crooks and hustlers in the rows of seats below, contrasting wonderfully. another example is present in a a foggy shot of the jewish ghettos, a visually stunning image, contrasted immediately by gunshots and killings. it is as if the literal contradictions mirror schindler's moral conflict. schindler's character is, in a sense, the centre and heart of the movie. he is an example of good will, hope and ultimately help in a helpless situation. despite this, schindler is a womaniser, a gambler, greedy and out for himself- he isn't a leader, an idol or a superhero. he is a businessman. midway through, a spot of colour is dashed onto the pallet, as a young girl sports a red coat, standing out immaculately over the black and white background. does this mark schindler's change of heart, his transcend to goodness, his epiphany? of course not, such an occurrence wouldn't generate a total change of belief so suddenly. the image marks a realisation schindler has about the horrors going on around him, perhaps even tapping into his conscience, but it is much later in the film that he actually acts on this in total selflessness. the motivation behind schindler's decision is gradual, he is not a hero, nor does he wish to glorify his position as a saviour. he just truly wishes to help people, something portrayed in total realism, making it even more heart-warming. such a pure character development creates not just a good film, but a powerful example of cinematic brilliance. the film is shown on an epic scale, and admirably remains intimate and touching simultaneously. it is beautiful yet harrowing, heart-warming yet heart-wrenching, inspiring yet dismaying and all the way through displaying excellence. schindler's list is undoubtedly a contemporary classic, and rightly so. it's ability to take us into the heart of darkness and capture the essence of hope is simply breathtaking. whether granting lives or taking them away, brilliance is present in every shot. 10/10";31 May 2007;10;['golden', 'grammy', 'sudeten', 'german', 'catholic', 'instrumental', 'polish', 'superb', 'vast', 'stunning', 'most', 'sadistic', 'human', 'evil', 'other', 'such', 'bad', 'deep', 'complex', 'majestic', 'significant', 'own', 'real', 'complete', 'moral', 'obvious', 'grand', 'monumental', 'glorious', 'staggering', 'first', 'spectacular', 'several', 'such', 'passionate', 'directorial', 'historical', 'comedic', 'stern', 'stirring', 'few', 'shady', 'present', 'foggy', 'jewish', 'stunning', 'literal', 'moral', 'good', 'helpless', 'greedy', 'young', 'red', 'black', 'white', 'total', 'total', 'gradual', 'total', 'more', 'pure', 'good', 'powerful', 'cinematic', 'epic', 'intimate', 'touching', 'beautiful', 'harrowing', 'dismaying', 'contemporary', 'breathtaking', 'present'];0.1502747252747252

868;mjpimpin91;this is one of the few films that has ever made me cry. first off, i have to say that the cinematography in this film is beautiful, and the acting is off the charts. liam neeson gives a heartfelt performance, and steven spielberg's directorial skill give this movie and edge not to be messed with. i have to say, this movie touches your crying spot with the final scene, showing all the surviving members of the list. absolutely amazing film. another comment on cinematography was the girl in the red dress. i applaud spielberg's choice of allowing her dress to show, highlighting her in the crowd and the later when bodies are being loaded, her dress shines bright among the dead. this proves to be the catalyst that makes schindler's quest all the more important. the last act when all the jewish people are freed and schindler goes on the run, one word comes to mind for this...enthralling. liam neeson hits the character spot on, and his heartfelt sentiments at not being able to save more induces tears in your eyes. bravo. bravo.;12 October 2008;10;['few', 'beautiful', 'liam', 'heartfelt', 'directorial', 'final', 'amazing', 'red', 'bright', 'important', 'last', 'jewish', 'enthralling', 'heartfelt', 'able', 'more'];0.2576923076923077

872;SuperCritic;"well i just saw this movie in 2005, 12 years after it came out, for the first time. i had expected much, much better. things i didn't like. 1. the long sequence depicting the jews getting hauled out of the ghetto, as schindler watches from a hill-top on horse-back for seemingly at least a half hour (in movie running-time). totally took the movie off course, and steered it away from the story of schindler and his factory, and turned it into a historical account of the holocaust (with nothing to do with schindler). this tries to do too much at once, and is one of the reasons the movie is too long. the movie should stick to being a movie about schindler's jews. 2. the germans shooting bullets upwards through the ceiling in to the rooms above, shortly after their fellow nazi soldiers had run upstairs to root out the jews. made no sense. classic spielberg goof up. 3. schindler kissing helen. this came out of nowhere. why did he walk downstairs in goeth's ""villa""? oh, right, to get the wine. then he just randomly decides to have a long conversation with her? the conversation was long, as is implied to be actually longer than was shown, as we see a cut in the scene at one point, and when we return, helen is in the middle of a story she is telling to schindler. this whole scene made no sense, and it is supposed to be some kind of turning point for schindler (now he's sympathetic to the jews). just after talking to helen? 4. goeth's instant ""transformation"" into mr. nice guy after schindler talks to him, and tells him that ""real power"" is forgiving people or whatever. totally unrealistic and too fast a transformation. it makes you think that either goeth is an idiot or spielberg is an idiot. i think it's a bit of both. i'm not sure why it has such a high rating. perhaps because of the emotional feelings it can induce, and because it tells a story about a horrific historical event. it is a great story, spielberg just didn't do a great job telling it. roberto benigni's, la vita e bella is just superb. focuses very squarely on one story, and doesn't deviate. i give the movie a 6/10";26 July 2005;6;['first', 'much', 'well', 'long', 'least', 'half', 'historical', 'long', 'fellow', 'classic', 'long', 'long', 'whole', 'sympathetic', 'instant', 'real', 'unrealistic', 'fast', 'sure', 'high', 'emotional', 'horrific', 'historical', 'great', 'great', 'superb'];0.1026086956521739

877;Silver_Dollar;the film which centres on the courageous deeds of a german industrialist who shelters his jewish workers from impending death is one of the finest films ever made. not just because it was about the holocaust.even if one were to divorce the holocaust from the film - or put it more simply, as holocaust deniers would have us believe that it never happened - this simply remains one of the finest executed films . right up there with other greats such as amadeus. the decision to shoot the film in a quasi documentary black and white style is skilfully handled by the cinematographer janus kaminski, and for the whole three hours never lets the attention wonder off. the screenplay brilliantly explores the complexities of oscar schindler showing his zest for life and his humanity, and the arch nazi amon goeth cannot hide his attraction to his jewish maid whilst harbouring hatred towards her race. the film intricately shows how schindler starts his factory from nothing, peddling money from jews from the ghetto, succeeding as an entrepreneur and then deciding to sacrifice all of it to save his workers. the interplay between schindler and the various nazis who he charms and bribes is brilliantly performed by liam neeson. sir ben kingsley gives a fantastic low key performance as the keen accountant who quietly paves the way for more workers to be protected within the factory under the nose of his boss. the score by johnwilliams is definitely a career best as is every aspect of the film.;20 April 2005;10;['courageous', 'german', 'jewish', 'fine', 'fine', 'other', 'such', 'quasi', 'black', 'white', 'whole', 'oscar', 'arch', 'jewish', 'various', 'fantastic', 'low', 'key', 'keen', 'more'];0.1094444444444444

887;KidWithOpinions;schindler's list is a cinematic masterpiece and steven spielberg's best film. this is a perfect movie, so i am giving it an a+, for its amazing story, flawless performances, cinematography, and its great score. this movie is the best 90s best picture by a lot. now the 90s was the worst year for best picture choices, think about all the movies that should have won the award. saving private ryan ( spielberg's second best film) should have beaten shakespeare in love, l.a. confidential should have beat titanic, really anything could have beaten titanic. pulp fiction, the shawshank redemption or quiz show should have beaten forrest gump, and finally, the one the pissed me off the most was how goodfellas should have beaten dances with wolves, one of the worst movies ever made. but i do agree with american beauty, unforgiven, the silence of the lambs, and this movie winning best picture. i would like to talk about the acting schindler's list because let me tell you, it was flawless, it hurts me to know that tommy lee jones beat ralph fiennes in the academy award for best supporting actor. now tommy lee jones did a great job, but comparing the type of role that jones and fiennes did, fiennes did a better job acting. i think that ralph did the best job acting in schindler's list. now i can see why liam neeson did not win best actor because he was up against tom hanks in philadelphia, also neeson did a good job in the role but he could have done better. ben kingsley delivers another amazing performance as itzhak stern, he is oskar's assistant, he almost dies about three times, i was sad that kingsley did not get a nomination because again he gives the audience an amazing performance. what i found interesting about schindler's list was that spielberg had originally pitched the idea to martin scorsese and roman polanski because how tough the subject was. spielberg did not think that he was up to make a movie about the holocaust. but to be honest i think that only spielberg could have made schindler's list and that is saying something because i am a big scorsese fan. the way schindler's list was made is flawless, it is a mostly black and white film, but the way allan starski and ewa braun ( the art directors) incorporated the use of color and black and white is excellent. schindler's list is a long movie, so if you plan on watching it you should take three hours out of your day. it starts out with a jewish family singing a song before dinner, they light a candle and you see the flame but everything else then turns black and white. you then watch oskar ( schindler) get ready for a party hosted by the nazi party, and that is where you find out who oskar is. the next twenty minutes is watching oskar make connections with nazis' and jews'. fast forward 20ish minutes, and you get to watch the liquidation of the ghettos, now this scene is pretty intense and it is the most violent scene in the movie. schindler's list is an essential movie to watch, and you will probably watch it in school. i will say that you can probably show this movie to your kids when they are going into freshman year of high school, because watching movies for the first time in school gives the movie a certain reputation, and people end up not liking it. now that does not go for all movies, but most. if you plan on showing schindler's list to your kids, just remember to wait until they are going into high school, that they know about the holocaust, and that they can sit through it respectively. keep in mind that schindler's list is still rated r for a reason, the big reason it is rated r is that of the ongoing violence and intense scenes. but there is still sexuality and nudity spread out through the movie. the nudity in schindler's list is both sexual at some points but also non-sexual, in fact, most of the nudity is nonsexual. just keep that in mind before showing this to your kids. also if you don't like your kids hear vulgar language, there are twelve f word uses in the movie along with other bad words. schindler's list reminds me of roman polanski's 2002 holocaust drama the pianist because it tells a story about the struggle for survival during the holocaust. but that is the only movie it reminds me of. now when i told people that, they were surprised that i did not think it was like the boy in the striped pajamas, and it does not, the only thing schindler's list and the boy in the striped pajamas have in common is that they are both about the holocaust, and to be completely honest i really did not like the boy in the striped pajamas. to end the review, i would like to say that i think schindler's list is a cinematic masterpiece and the best 90s best picture, and how it is one of the best movies ever made. my final grade for schindler's list is an a+, for its amazing story, flawless performances, cinematography, and its great score.;10 August 2018;10;['cinematic', 'good', 'perfect',

891;Mr Lombardo;i've watched this film about half a dozen times over the last five years and i still don't really understand what spielberg was trying to do. was he trying to outline the horrors of the holocaust or was he trying to examine schindler himself - why the man did what he did? maybe both. in neither case does he succeed. one can't help but feel the atrocities were greatly toned down for this film thus not really reflecting the true horror of what really happened, and he fails completely in exploring the character of schindler. why did schindler do what he did? the man was a philanderer and a shrewd business man who didn't exactly go out of his way to be nice. did witnessing what he did make him wake up to himself or perhaps there was an ulterior motive? spielberg looks at none of this and serves up a modern day saint. it is kind of ironic that spielberg shot this movie in black and white because that is the approach he has taken to his subject material. he gives us the saintly schindler, the stereotypical evil nazi, the honourable jew and none of the complexities that made these people what they are. this was spielberg's attempt to become accepted as a serious film-maker but yet he takes exactly the same approach to making this as he did with his marvellous popcorn movies resulting in a rather dictatorial film that has more answers than questions!;24 April 1999;1;['last', 'true', 'shrewd', 'nice', 'ulterior', 'modern', 'ironic', 'black', 'white', 'subject', 'saintly', 'stereotypical', 'evil', 'honourable', 'serious', 'same', 'marvellous', 'dictatorial', 'more'];-0.0243589743589743

900;DapperDuck713;"in 1993, audiences around the world received two of director steven spielberg's most influential and critically acclaimed films. one, an enthralling dinosaur adventure with ground-breaking visual effects that captured the imagination of an entire generation; the other, a harrowing recreation of true-life events centring around the most vile and evil moments in human history and the true heroes that rose from the ashes of destruction and genocide. ""schindler's list"" is a meticulously constructed, horrifying and disturbing film that, if you are human, will definitely make you cry at least twice during its mammoth 3 hour 15 minute run time! the decision to film the majority of the picture in black and white was an ingenious move; it adds a stark and bleak reality to the events of the film, the lack of colours and soul-crushing score reinforces the powerful message that is being told. the most outstanding technical features of ""schindler's list"" all won an academy award, giving the film a total of seven oscars. from the film itself (best picture), to the direction (best director), the script, the sets, cinematography, editing and music; all of the talented people behind this masterpiece deserved the recognition and respect that they received. the talented cast all deliver some of the best and most moving performances of their careers. the ever brilliant liam neeson plays every element of his complex and multi-layered character perfectly. sir ben kingsley brings a warmth and likeability to an otherwise stone-cold story; the usually charming ralph fiennes plays quite possibly one of the most disgusting and malicious characters in modern cinema. this film sticks out like a velociraptor in a kitchen when compared to spielberg's earlier projects. his most popular works were entertaining adventures which occasionally played with dark themes. ""jaws"", the ""indiana jones"" trilogy and ""e.t. the extra-terrestrial"" had cemented spielberg as a master of thrills (indy), chills (""jaws"") and spills (the emotional ""e.t."" scenes.) however, ""the colour purple"" and ""empire of the sun"" presented a director that could also craft excellent historical films, thus leading to ""schindler's list."" the new-found maturity in his career is one of the many reasons why spielberg is my favourite director. whilst i personally prefer his more accessible romps such as ""duel"", ""indiana jones"" and ""catch me if you can"" over his gritty dramas, i admire a filmmaker who has the range and talent to create such vastly different works. the fact that the man who directed ""hook"" also made ""saving private ryan"" is astounding; in which other director's filmography can you find such a stylistic divide?! ""schindler's list"" is about a nation turning a blind eye to the horrors that were being inflicted upon good, ordinary people. it is a movie that is still relevant today (which makes all the more tragic), which is why ""schindler's list"" must be seen and talked about to prevent anything on the level of the holocaust ever happening again! i saw this film three years ago yet every traumatic scene still feels raw in my mind. i never ever want to see ""schindler's list"" again, not because it's bad, but because it is so unsettling and disheartening.

903;neokatsapas;"i had only seen spielberg's not depressing movies before this, so one thing about schindler's list which truly caught me off guard is how well it depicts violence. this isn't a particularly graphic film in any way, but any minor showcase of violence here is still very well executed, without any close ups or annoying music queues. the violence is captured in a way which isn't gratuitous but still manages to properly present the stakes in the plot, as it knows when it's more effective to show something, and when it's more effective not to show something. i also didn't expect this to be anywhere near as visually striking as it is, because the cinematography here is really great, with some very well coordinated long takes. the contrast between slow and fast editing is incredibly purposeful, and i'm also genuinely shocked to say that the black and white presentation of this movie actually works, and doesn't come off as an annoying gimmick. the production value is phenomenal too, and although this might seem like a strange thing to mention, i really love the staging here; the way the characters are placed in the frame and the way they move around it is very well thought out. the one minor issue i do have with this films presentation however is the volume of background sounds during a lot of moments. i know it doesn't matter or anything, but i do seriously find it difficult to get immersed in a scene when the characters are talking at a normal volume in a church when everyone else is singing. in real life the entire choir would look at you and tell you to shut up, and if spielberg just told the actors to whisper i would find that scene way easier to take seriously. it's a tiny detail, but it's also just so easy to fix that i really wanted to mention it. now i'm not going to deny that this is a 'normie' movie, as it's a film which basically anyone can enjoy, but i still never felt like the script was dumbing itself down just to be more easily accessible. no character comes off as too oversimplified, and nothing is so black and white that it seems melodramatic. the protagonist here may have a somewhat predictable arc, but what matters to me is the presentation, and although the presentation isn't completely flawless, as there are a few cheesy moments, it's still absolutely fantastic. because even though schindler's arc goes the way we expect it to, and hits all the beats we expect it to, i would still consider him to be a fantastic protagonist, because every beat his character hits doesn't come off as forced, and still feels like a natural progression for him as a person. schindler's list tackles multiple story lines with a runtime of three hours and seventeen minutes, and i still never found it messy in the slightest. the dialogue couldn't be any more engaging, and the performances couldn't be any more compelling. and although yes, it does end in a monologue to show off the actors abilities with sad music to make the audience cry, it's just so well developed and so well earned that it never comes close to being forced or sappy. overall, i wouldn't consider schindler's list to be the sixth best film of all time (like on imdb), but it's still amazing, and definitely worth watching, if you haven't seen it already.";29 March 2021;10;['depressing', 'graphic', 'minor', 'close', 'annoying', 'gratuitous', 'effective', 'effective', 'striking', 'great', 'long', 'slow', 'fast', 'purposeful', 'black', 'white', 'annoying', 'phenomenal', 'strange', 'minor', 'difficult', 'normal', 'real', 'entire', 'easy', 'tiny', 'easy', 'normie', 'accessible', 'black', 'white', 'melodramatic', 'predictable', 'flawless', 'few', 'fantastic', 'fantastic', 'natural', 'multiple', 'messy', 'slight', 'engaging', 'compelling', 'sad', 'developed', 'sappy', 'sixth', 'good', 'amazing', 'worth'];0.0835271317829457

908;claudegrimaud;"(please ignore my previous comment as it contained some errors) let me begin by saying that the thousands of you out there who worship ""saving private ryan"" should think twice about labeling it 'the best spielberg film of all time'. schindler's list is by definition a masterpiece and in my opinion spielberg's finest work to date. unlike spr, it focuses on true events and not only uses true locations and dates. spr has a group of men risking their own life to save one whereas sl has one man trying to ""save the world entire"". which one is far fetched though? both, you would say unless you are historically inclined and know that oscar schindler(neeson) did in fact exist and save more than 1100 people during the holocaust. miller and his team, although loosely based on true characters do not depict an accurate incident in the chapter of world war 2.thus we find schindler's list more gratifying to watch as a film but also absorb as a historical guide. the acting mind you, is exceptional in both cases and hadn't there been charming old bennigni hopping and bouncing on the chairs of the academy - hanks would have certainly taken oscar (forgive the pun) home to meet his other two brothers. schindler's list is deeply moving, and in every scene you get the feeling that you are there living in that misery and thanking your lucky stars that you have pulled through another day. what is most disturbing (and equally ingenious of spielberg) is the way the jews are killed. sometimes they are lined up and shot at to save bullets, other times they are wounded and then shot in the head to make up for the 'mistake' (the scene where the woman dies in the hands of her husband spraying her blood all over him after the shot, is one of the strongest in the film). but spielberg's genius does not emerge through the portrayal of gratuitous violence. it emerges through the way he shows what has to be shown. at times he creates tension by not showing an actual death (like the scene of the boy who couldn't clean the stains out of goeth's bath and then gets killed by his sniper rifle) or else when you think someone is going to die - and they don't (the rabbi ) such subtleties always leave us uncertain as to what is going to take place next and always leaves us on edge. the girl is the red dress contrary to what many think, is also a stroke of genius. spielberg includes her for two reasons : 1) we are taken on a journey through which we can relate and through which we can feel what is happening around 'us'. because she is marked her in red, we can easily follow her through the streets of the ghetto and not get lost in the violence which takes place around her. 2) she becomes a symbol of lost innocence when later in the film she is seen in a pile of corpses. had she not been in red ( a very empathic colour) we might have not recognized her, or we would not have focused on the tragedy of her murder. when the flames later on in the film are lit to celebrate the sabbath (notice they to are coloured) we get the impression that hope is re-emerging and good will triumph in the end. i particularly admire the scene where a german plays mozart on a piano to the rhythm of stuttering guns being fired around him. this not only creates a macabre atmosphere but it also shows how cold blooded some germans where (""is that bach? no mozart"").it is not surprising however that the film is praised in germany today because most german's disassociate themselves rightly with the atrocities their ancestors committed against the six million jews murdered.(one must notice the scene where the german soldiers decide to ""go home as men rather than murderers"", showing that not all nazis where nazis, if you know what i mean.) the portion in colour at the end then, always sends goose bumps down my back. probably because we are seeing real people (the actors and actual characters still alive today (well 1993) like {amazingly enough} the girl schindler kisses at his birthday party!) the very last scene then, where the road built from gravestones is panned on and ""directed by steven spielberg"" appears, has me sighing and thinking ""wow"". add to all this a great character analysis (the typewriter's audition scene is amusing because we learn more about schindler's character, and the scene where fiennes says 'i forgive you' to the mirror shows us how hatable he really is) and development throughout as well as a heart pounding score by john williams and what you've got is a film which i would surely beat myself to death for not rating it: ***** (excellent) so i will (rate it 5 stars that is).";17 January 2002;10;['previous', 'private', 'good', 'fine', 'spr', 'true', 'true', 'own', 'fetched', 'inclined', 'more', 'true', 'accurate', 'gratifying', 'historical', 'exceptional', 'charming', 'old', 'pun', 'other', 'lucky', 'disturbing', 'ingenious', 'other', 'strong', 'gratuitous', 'actual', 'such', 'uncertain', 'red', 'contrary', 'many', 'red', 'empathic', 'good', 'german', 'cold', 'surprising', 'most', 'german', 'german', 'real', 'actual', 'alive', 'last', 'great', 'amusing', 'more', 'hatable', 'excellent'];0.2445833333333333

917;vibhutius;the greatest masterpiece of veteran director steven spielberg, schindler's list is an emotional and harrowing account of the holocaust during the second world war. the movie delves deep into the darkness of human heart and depicts the metamorphosis of a shrewd businessman and womanizer into the greatest philanthropists humanity has ever seen. the movie is almost entirely shot in black and white which gives it a grim and timeless look, a remarkable effort by the cinematographer janusz kaminski. the acting is brilliant. liam neeson as oskar schindler has given his career best performance for which he received an academy award nomination. ben kingsley has also stood well with him in his role of his jewish accountant itzhak stern. however, it is ralph fiennes who has stood apart in his portrayal of amon goeth, a sociopath nazi officer without a moral code. unfortunately, he did not win a well deserved academy award for supporting actor. furthermore, john williams has come up with a brilliant score bringing out the misery, horror and tragedy of the holocaust. schindler's list is spielberg's unforgettable piece of art that makes one cry many times over, especially in the final moments of the three hour seventeen minute epic. its a must watch.;23 February 2013;10;['great', 'emotional', 'harrowing', 'second', 'human', 'shrewd', 'great', 'black', 'white', 'grim', 'timeless', 'remarkable', 'brilliant', 'good', 'jewish', 'ralph', 'moral', 'deserved', 'brilliant', 'unforgettable', 'many', 'final'];0.2931372549019608

938;tmfc-65132;how did steven spielberg make this and jurassic park at the same time. spielberg has had some misses in his collection of films, but this is one of his best. however this film would not be the same if it did not have the outstanding cast it has. liam neeson in my opinion is incredibly underrated mainly because of films like the taken trilogy and the phantom menace, but his performance in this is so believable as schindler. ben kingsley and ralph fiennes also are amazing in this and very convincing. this film is powerful in it's message and certain scenes could be hard for most people to watch, but this really happened to so many people in the second world war it's almost unbelievable as it's so extreme. i think this film definitely deserved all the oscars it received as it is one of the most emotional and powerful films to ever be made.;27 June 2017;9;['jurassic', 'same', 'good', 'same', 'outstanding', 'underrated', 'phantom', 'believable', 'ralph', 'amazing', 'convincing', 'powerful', 'certain', 'hard', 'most', 'many', 'second', 'unbelievable', 'extreme', 'emotional', 'powerful'];0.2322128851540615
939;ryangrogers;schindler's list film review after viewing schindler's list, there is only word to describe the film-powerful. steven spielberg is able to take history, make it a gripping story, and bring it to the camera. the movie showcases the forgotten horrors of the holocaust in such a dark way, at times, it can be hard to watch. however, this is one of those films that truly everyone should view at some point in life. yes, from a filmmaking standpoint the movie is very good but the message proclaimed is even better. the story of human spirit prevailing over such evil makes schindler's list a simply incredible tale. oskar schindler (liam neeson) is an up-and-coming businessman in krakow, germany planning to make a fortune at the start of wwii. over time, he gains power and respect within the nazi regime. he buys a factory and begins to mass-produce products the german military needs, hiring jews from the local ghetto to make him a profit. business begins to thrive until one day, the nazi ss clears out the ghetto and sends all of the jews to concentration camps. at first, schindler attempts to get his workers back as he is only focused on making money for himself. however, as he witnesses the horrors occurring in the krakow concentration camp, schindler must make the decision to put his life-earnings second and make the lives of his innocent jewish employees first, one life at a time. steven spielberg's goal was to make schindler's list as simply as possible from a technological standpoint. there were no cranes, zoom lenses, or steadicam at all used in the film and the entire thing is in black and white. spielberg's choice to make a black and white holocaust film in a time when color film was the norm stands out and also enhances the movie. it creates a sense of horror and pure darkness that victims of the holocaust actually faced while also making the movie gritty and brutal. for several hours, it took the emphasis away from the filmmaking industry and put it solely on the story. every film is a product of its time and this is exactly what spielberg was trying to accomplish. historical accuracy cannot be the only thing that makes a movie special. it also takes quality actors that can give superb performances and liam neeson and ralph fiennes are able to do exactly that. the two men are foils in the film, neeson being the symbol of morality and fiennes, the epitome of pure evil. in his performance, neeson is able to embrace everything the real oskar schindler stood for. his character is believable, dynamic, and someone that an entire audience can feel for. viewers can see how emotionally torn schindler is. it is very impressive when an actor can become a man hated by so many. the task is certainly not easy. but fiennes embraces his role as amon goeth, the despised nazi in charge of the camp in krakow. he becomes the man that killed so many and excels at doing it. the special effects are another element of the film that excels. spielberg and his effects crew make each gunshot and fatal wound seem so real that it seems like each one is happening in real life right in front of the viewer. the scenes of death and violence provide realism that gruesomely hit hard. all of these elements allow schindler's list to thrive both as a film and as an educatory device on the holocaust. some people were outraged by the movie saying it exposed women due to the amount of nudity on camera. others stated that spielberg made all of the jews supporting characters with no real background instead of the main characters of the movie. although these are among a few of many complaints, the movie truly has no flaws and is extremely well made. unfortunately, this film cannot and should not be watched by some simply because of the pure evil and brutality depicted. despite this, its importance in historical film is evident and needs to be seen so something incredibly evil can be learned from and therefore, never repeated. steven spielberg is considered one of the best directors ever and schindler's list proves why. the film is worthy of a 10 out of 10.;6 October 2016;10;['powerful', 'able', 'dark', 'hard', 'good', 'well', 'human', 'such', 'incredible', 'up', 'mass', 'german', 'military', 'local', 'innocent', 'jewish', 'possible', 'technological', 'entire', 'black', 'white', 'black', 'white', 'pure', 'gritty', 'brutal', 'several', 'historical', 'only', 'special', 'liam', 'ralph', 'able', 'pure', 'able', 'real', 'believable', 'dynamic', 'entire', 'impressive', 'many', 'easy', 'despised', 'many', 'special', 'fatal', 'real', 'real', 'real', 'main', 'few', 'many', 'pure', 'historical', 'evident', 'evil', 'good', 'worthy'];0.1635610766045548

951;vikisepyan;take aside all controversies, i would like to review the cinematography aspect that was brought by this schindler's list movie. first thing first, as you know that kaminski did other great jobs as well on such a lot great movies (the terminal, catch me if you can, ready player one, etc). but those experience he had might start from this one documentary-like movie. i do really like all unsteady shots this movie has. those bring war-time atmosphere well. i could feel the fast movements, the soldiers rush, people frightened, and so on. take an example from the shoot from behind the neck of mr. schindler at the beginning when he tried to explore the whole room. or the shoot from the mr. amon's point of view when his first time come to krakow. those are great! i want to point out the scene while mr. schindler chose his secretary for the def too. kaminski tried to show how the time goes by shooting the exact same set but the actors changing positions. and the greatest of them all is how spielberg managed with idea to send a girl in red coat to give the audience some red line of the story. we could see at the middle of the movie this girl went back an forth amidst chaotic operation by germany soldier. after that, we see her back when the situation a little bit under control while she was walking calmly and holding hand with her parents. then later we see the scene while she was dead and about to be burned. and after that, mr. schindler's was motivated to save as many jews as he could put on his saving list. last but not at least, some music during the chaotic operation, from the slow violin, then silent, then fast piano played by the soldier on the set. accompanied by some firing light that fit to the beat of the music tempo. brilliant in short. that's all. i could just give 10 stars for the movie. but i gave out one star for the controversies.;27 October 2018;9;['first', 'other', 'great', 'great', 'ready', 'like', 'unsteady', 'fast', 'whole', 'first', 'great', 'exact', 'same', 'great', 'red', 'red', 'chaotic', 'little', 'dead', 'about', 'many', 'last', 'least', 'chaotic', 'slow', 'silent', 'fast', 'brilliant', 'short'];0.2098958333333333

954;syd-27;this film trivialises the holocaust. unlike most of your reviewers, and like most normal people, i did know a bit about the subject before schindler's list came out. i didn't need to be told that this was a shameful episode in history, and that it should not be repeated. the existence of this film won't make a toss of difference when the next crackpot decides to kill whichever race he has a grudge against, and it won't activate his acquiescing public. spielberg obviously set out to enlighten us on the holocaust, but for me it made it more distant. we barely got to know any jewish character that was immediately under threat, and the only character that was explored with any depth was schindler, the hero - the most audience-friendly element. to film in black and white was a ridiculous decision - tantamount to spielberg just saying, 'yes, i know that this is a serious subject, but i'm going to deflect your attention and make the whole experience less real.'. such is the way of cinema.;9 October 1999;6;['most', 'most', 'normal', 'shameful', 'next', 'acquiescing', 'distant', 'jewish', 'only', 'friendly', 'black', 'white', 'ridiculous', 'serious', 'whole', 'real', 'such'];0.056547619047619

962;praveen1013;when i first learnt about schindler's list, i had great expectations on how spielberg would have made the greatest ever human tragedy. i expected big shots like hitler, himmler, eichmann... but spielberg had made the movie with stern, helen heitsh, schindler and goeth. when i first saw the movie i thought spielberg had missed quite a lot of incidents. i thought some scenes in the first 1 hour could have been cut to accommodate other incidents and i felt the movie was overrated. but only after watching the movie a second time i realized that the movie was 'schindler's list' and not a documentary on holocaust. i also appreciated how important each and every scene was and got convinced that there couldn't have been a better version of the movie. while scenes like burning synagogues would have been sensational, it would have provoked outrage. but spielberg had given this movie an emotional and human touch. schindler's transformation from a corrupt flirt profit-minded businessman to a great saviour has been fabulously portrayed. this movie, though not a great tearjerker, has a lot of emotional dialogues and scenes. schindler viewing the ghetto liquidation from the top of a cliff, schindler's soothing words to helen, schindler trying to change goeth by telling about power,schindler's talk to stern after orders on special treatment, schindler thinking on what to do one fine night, schindler saving the ladies and subsequently the children and many more of these scenes simply break you to give a wet eyes. observe neeson's body language on all these circumstances and you'll understand how nobel a heart he was and what kindness actually means. the scene where schindler gets furious with a jewish woman and later brings her parents to his factory is my best in the movie. goeth's split personality was frightening. the background score of music during the liquidation of the ghetto was moving. the lead trio of liam neeson, ralph fiennes and ben kingsley have performed exceptionally well in the movie. its quite sad that none got an oscar. thank god that the reich officials were corrupt otherwise the schindler jews would have perished at auschwitz and the world would have missed this great masterpiece.;11 October 2006;10;['great', 'great', 'human', 'big', 'stern', 'helen', 'first', 'other', 'second', 'important', 'well', 'sensational', 'emotional', 'human', 'corrupt', 'minded', 'great', 'great', 'emotional', 'ghetto', 'special', 'fine', 'many', 'more', 'wet', 'furious', 'jewish', 'good', 'split', 'frightening', 'lead', 'ralph', 'sad', 'corrupt', 'great'];0.2140567765567765

978;paladeen;"schindler's list is one of the most overrated films of all time: it won seven oscars. it is the 6th highest rated film on imdb. the critics loved it, and the internet is flooded with reviews where people rave about being ""deeply moved"" or ""touched."" ultimately, the film is a shallow failure. a good drama film needs several qualities. of these, the most important is the exposition of characters and their interactions. schindler's list flops spectacularly in this respect. we start out following the tale of oskar schindler, an opportunistic, profiteering businessman. but midpoint in the film, this schindler persona has disappeared, and we have a new character clothed in the same flesh -- a self-sacrificing philanthropist who spends his entire amassed fortune to save the jew workers. how did we get from one to the other? how did schindler transform from the evil mr. hyde to the benevolent dr. jekyll? steven spielberg certainly doesn't show us -- maybe it happens via magic, like the bicycle ride in et? and what about amon goth, the representative nazi? a ""grotesque caricature"" if there ever was one. he's an evil, sadistic, jew-hating nazi bastard -- but do we get to know why he wakes up every morning, takes a swig of booze and snipes jew prisoners for fun? no. spielberg thinks the answer is obvious -- he's a nazi, and nazis don't have reasons for the things they do. they're just rabid dogs out for blood, utterly devoid of any moral dimension. but this sort of shallow political correctness can't possibly cut any slack with intelligent viewers. we want to know why goth hates the jews so much that he fires his pistol into a pile of decimated corpses, but we never get to know. apparently, he does it because he's an evil nazi, and that's all there is to it. the attempt to add depth to goth's character by dwelling on his twisted love affair with a jewish girl is easily seen for what it is -- a cheap exposure of nazi hypocrisy. how about trying to dwell on real issues here, spielberg? how about trying to pass these people off as genuine (albeit twisted) human beings? this shortcoming is not restricted to spielberg. when will hollywood own up to the fact that the men who ran the third reich were not mindless monsters? some of them were cultivated intellectuals and scientists, others compassionate family men and devoted friends. germany was the best educated country in europe when the nazis rose to power. the true intrigue of the holocaust does not lie in the brutality, but rather in hannah arendt's ""banality of evil"". how can a man (or millions of men) arbitrarily narrow the moral sphere to exclude people seemingly no different from neighbours, friends and family? how can a man fall under the sway of a dispassionate and cruel ideology while leading a normal life of compassion? needless to say, none of these issues are explored by spielberg. another peeve of mine: accents. there are english-speaking films and then there are german-speaking films. schindler's list, on the other hand, does not belong to either of these categories. instead, spielberg opted to have the characters speak english with a german accent. what the hell? listening to liam neeson strut about trying to sound like an anglicised german is just pathetic. : spielberg's trying to please hollywood audiences by making the film accessible to them (and hence, no spoken german), but for the love of god! we get the point! they're in nazi germany. yes, hitler's in charge. yes, it's a nasty, genocidal regime. please, no cheesy accents. one of the truly unforgivable aspects of the film is the ending. a mildly touching speech by schindler about being a war criminal on the run, wanted by the victors of the war, set just the right mood. it would have been perfect. but no, spielberg couldn't resist messing it up -- he had to have schindler break down, bawl and cry, grief-stricken and lashed by pangs of conscience. spare me the anguish, spielberg. the grief should have been that of the jews, not schindler. when schindler took off his gold ring and blubbers out ""i could have saved one more"", i experienced a feeling of mild revulsion. look, the guy did a great job, he saved a lot of lives. no point in getting all worked up about the fact that he didn't literally sell the skin of his back to save people he didn't know. what does this film leave us after 195 minutes of running time? let's see: * the nazis were *really evil* * there was a man called schindler who didn't care about anything but money at first, and then for some reason he started to care about saving the jews. brilliant, spielberg. positively brilliant. all of the above-mentioned flaws are bad enough -- but the way the film manipulates the viewer really takes the cake. shots of emaciated, shaved potential holocaust victims starving and screaming, with tragic violin music to boot. it has been done in many films before, and will be done again. it doesn't take skill for a film-maker to coerce the viewer into sorrow -- it takes skill to produce the same feelings without resorting to cheap, melodramatic trickery. the pianist is a superb counter-example. a journey of the mind is so much more satisfying than a journey of the senses... like most of spielberg's films, schindler's list is technically outstanding. it captures the mood of wartime germany perfectly. the sets, costumes and cinematography are all top-notch, and the acting is not too bad either. however, none of these things can overcome the fact that spielberg is a director of extremely limited vision. his moral and intellectual depth is that of a child. stick to making films for children, spielberg. stick to making children's films. you're out of your depth.";2 August 2008;5;['overrated', 'high', 'shallow', 'good', 'several', 'important', 'opportunistic', 'new', 'same', 'entire', 'amassed', 'other', 'evil', 'representative', 'grotesque', 'evil', 'sadistic', 'obvious', 'rabid', 'devoid', 'moral', 'shallow', 'political', 'intelligent', 'decimated', 'evil', 'twisted', 'jewish', 'cheap', 'real', 'genuine', 'twisted', 'human', 'third', 'mindless', 'devoted', 'true', 'moral', 'different', 'dispassionate', 'cruel', 'normal', 'needless', 'german', 'other', 'german', 'liam', 'neeson', 'anglicised', 'pathetic', 'accessible', 'spoken', 'nasty', 'genocidal', 'unforgivable', 'touching', 'right', 'perfect', 'more', 'mild', 'great', 'evil', 'brilliant', 'bad', 'potential', 'tragic', 'many', 'same', 'cheap', 'melodramatic', 'superb', 'satisfying', 'most', 'outstanding', 'top', 'bad', 'limited', 'moral', 'intellectual'];0.0016502583438067

1005;tlm3;"rating: 9/10 schindler's list takes place during world war ii. it revolves around the germans and the jewish ghettos. oskar schindler (liam neeson) is an influential business man in the nazi party, looking to make an enormous profit due to the was. schindler brings several hundred jews onto his work crew and starts manufacturing. schindler runs into trouble a few times with keeping his work crew from being killed by nazi rule and their general way of running things. schindler hires a jewish accountant to run his business for him and keep track if the business. the focus of the movie revolves around schindler's relationship with his workers and their struggle through the war. schindler's list is a black and white movie which turns a lot of people off, however it was a wonderful concept that was executed very well. schindler's list made more of an impact being in black and white. it gave the movie more of a sense of actually being involved in the war era. spielberg did a good job at directing this movie, but could have altered a few things to make the movie less awkward and more focused. for instance, there were a few shots of nudity that were completely unnecessary and could have been avoided and modified and still effectively portray the concept being presented. the nudity with a few individual lovers of nazi members, for this movie, took the film from an engaging story with meaning to a meaningless question and cheap entertainment thrown in to captivate the audience. in my opinion the film did not need to be ""perked up"" to keep the audience awake. however, there was mass nudity during a few scenes, both male and female, which i felt was completely necessary and helped in presenting a more real illustration of the camps the jews were forced to dwell in. schindler's list was an excellent film that did an extraordinary job at portraying the jewish struggle and nazi politics during world war ii.";2 July 2000;9;['jewish', 'influential', 'enormous', 'several', 'few', 'general', 'jewish', 'black', 'white', 'wonderful', 'more', 'black', 'white', 'more', 'good', 'few', 'awkward', 'focused', 'few', 'unnecessary', 'few', 'individual', 'meaningless', 'cheap', 'awake', 'mass', 'few', 'male', 'female', 'necessary', 'real', 'excellent', 'extraordinary', 'jewish'];0.0568965517241379

1033;roryboo;"i've been aware of the film for a long while and watched it somewhere in june this year. so it took me no less than two months to think the thing over and compose this review. a lot is quite certain about sl - for example, it's an exceedingly good movie, well-made and harmonious. there are people saying that spielberg is a professional, he knows how to influence his audience, that's why you like his movies. i can't say whether it's true or not, since the only other spielberg movie i've seen is one of the films about indiana jones and it's impossible to compare these two genres. so i just enjoyed (as much as it's possible to enjoy a movie about the holocaust) the film; it didn't seem repulsive to me or too distressing - it didn't even make me cry. i thought the topic to be well-told, all major parts wonderfully performed and the right conclusions made in the end. but 'something was missing', as schindler himself says in one of the episodes - though in this case it's neither war nor luck. something that stayed my hand when it moved to give sl 10/10 on imdb. something that made me re-watch the film and separate episodes all over again. something that excludes all possibility of blind, excited praise-singing. later i gave sl 10 points nonetheless but only because in me it evoked an interest in the holocaust, wwii and everything connected with them. i no longer tried to avoid this subject and understood that without any knowledge about this dreadful catastrophe there's no understanding of history. that's all very well but it doesn't free sl of certain drawbacks. generally, they all are about character study. with oscar schindler it's ok. it's a nazi that shifts from blind money-making and using cheap labor of the jews to the true understanding of the situation, to compassion and at last to saving over 1000 human beings from certain and cruel death. liam neeson's performance was good though not exceptional (there's ralph fiennes to compare him with). we see what he was at the beginning - through his manners, style, conversation. he changes gradually, and it's not true with goeth. what a shame - such amazing a performance and such shallow a look at human psychology. yesterday goeth shot people from his balcony without breaking a sweat, today he decides to become 'a good emperor' and pardons everybody he happens to meet. then, he looks at his nails and all of a sudden he's the main villain again. i love this scene though - the look in goeth's eyes changes dramatically and betrays his true nature at once - that's more than professional acting. but all the same such a quick and shallow change couldn't befall a personality like this. that's what concerns the main counterparts of sl - schindler and goeth. they represent two chief lines of behavior and world-view in the movie. they are friends and enemies at the same time. one is the savior, the other is the torturer. one is capable of compassion and understanding, the other does his bloody duty without questions and his sole attempt to act otherwise is a failure. but who are they saving and killing? to whom the movie is dedicated? where are the jews? you can say - here they are, stern, helen hirsch, poldek and mila, the rosners, the dresners... yes, they are here, all of them with their own names and destinies - but at the same moment they are absent. no jew could become a main character in a movie about oscar schindler, for the latter would overshadow him; there had to be a good nazi and a bad nazi and a humble mass of people they are struggling over. but who if not a jew should be the main hero of a holocaust movie? you can say - what about stern? isn't he the third point of view, the third power, so to speak, equal to those of schindler's and goeth's? well, he's surely a very significant character, but he is not shown and told about as deliberately as schindler, for instance. izhak stern is not much looked into. the viewer can't penetrate into his inner nature and personal life. he's just the chief representative of the jews, who - especially nearer to the end of the movie - become just examples, not characters, even helen hirsch. while stern is reserved and strong, helen is weak and tortured but that's all we can say about her. if the film had been based upon the opposition goeth-helen there would have been the possibility of telling about what were her losses, what were her hopes and and thoughts. unfortunately or not, that's not the case. helen too remains an example. the main hero is schindler and this determines the specificity of the film. this also makes the phrase 'in memory of the more than six million jews murdered' a bit illogical. it is clear that the line should be 'in memory of oscar schindler, a nazy who found strength and will to oppose the killings and saved more than one thousand jews'. that would've been more appropriate.";20 August 2010;10;['aware', 'long', 'less', 'certain', 'good', 'harmonious', 'professional', 'true', 'only', 'other', 'impossible', 'possible', 'repulsive', 'distressing', 'major', 'right', 'separate', 'blind', 'excited', 'dreadful', 'certain', 'ok', 'blind', 'cheap', 'true', 'last', 'human', 'certain', 'cruel', 'good', 'exceptional', 'ralph', 'true', 'such', 'amazing', 'such', 'human', 'good', 'main', 'true', 'more', 'professional', 'same', 'quick', 'shallow', 'main', 'chief', 'same', 'other', 'capable', 'other', 'bloody', 'sole', 'stern', 'helen', 'own', 'same', 'absent', 'main', 'latter', 'good', 'bad', 'humble', 'main', 'stern', 'third', 'third', 'equal', 'significant', 'inner', 'personal', 'chief', 'near', 'helen', 'strong', 'helen', 'weak', 'tortured', 'main', 'more', 'illogical', 'clear', 'more', 'appropriate'];0.0940734989648033

1036;Abhiminator;as a millenial, the happenings of world war 2 and the holocaust was probably one of the least understood topics of our generation. this movie takes the viewers right into the gruesome but realistic happenings of the holocaust, in the backdrop of the second world war. steven spielberg has done a fantastic job of making this movie as close to perfection as possible. the direction, the acting, especially that of liam neeson deserves applause and the black and white portrayal makes it even more heartening and gives a sense of timelessness, adds more to the 'hopelessness' theme as other reviewers here have mentioned. the movie is pretty long, about >3 hours but every second spent on this movie is worth. the story-line develops smoothly. it tracks the journey of a man named oskar schindler from a war profiteer to that of a man who'd go on to save over a thousand jewish lives from the horrors of the holocaust. it also gives a very realistic portrayal of the life in nazi occupied poland. there's one particular scene that will melt away the toughest of hearts. i won't spoil it for you, but it's about a girl in red! overall, it's one of the best movies made in the history of hollywood and it's the best movie about world war 2 and the holocaust. worth watching, every bit. personally for me, it's one of the best movies ever. go watch it. 10/10.;26 October 2015;10;['least', 'gruesome', 'realistic', 'second', 'fantastic', 'possible', 'liam', 'black', 'white', 'more', 'more', 'other', 'long', 'worth', 'jewish', 'realistic', 'particular', 'tough', 'good', 'good', 'worth', 'good'];0.1223544973544973

1045;Wade_Kingston;schindler's list is one of spielberg's finest films in most respects. the story, cinematography and attention to detail are arresting. spielberg's use of light is never less than extraordinary, with many superb examples of it in this black and white film. it won a deserved oscar for best picture, and the subject matter--one man's attempt to save jews from the horrors of the holocaust (vividly depicted)--makes it required viewing, especially to deniers of that entire part of history. but i did find it a bit of a slog to get through. it's a film i haven't watched more than once. this doesn't make it a bad film, just one i appreciated once and let go. for one thing i felt it could have been more severely edited and still have kept its impact. in short, i felt its length. for another, i felt a curious detachment from the character of schindler himself, as well as other characters. it seemed as if i were on the outside looking in, as opposed to being there in the action. perhaps that was deliberate, but it kept me at arm's length. the result was that it often felt more like a documentary than a drama. perhaps some of that is unavoidable. in order to depict the grim reality of man's inhumanity to man, maybe we do need to be kept at arm's length. i also felt the music (sad and beautiful violins) became heavy-handed after an hour or so. again, probably spielberg's exact intention, but i did not care for it. to me, the highest-rated films are those i will gladly watch over and over. so, i give schindler's list 10 stars on its merits. it is excellent, it is important, it should be seen. i give it 8 stars for repeat watch-ability, or 9 overall.;26 March 2019;9;['fine', 'most', 'less', 'extraordinary', 'many', 'superb', 'black', 'white', 'deserved', 'good', 'subject', 'entire', 'more', 'bad', 'short', 'curious', 'other', 'deliberate', 'unavoidable', 'grim', 'sad', 'beautiful', 'handed', 'exact', 'excellent', 'important', 'overall'];0.1532608695652174
1046;linkin_park_radio_head;"judging a 1993 movie in 2016 &especially that's been adapted from a book is somewhat unfair to the director steven spielberg(who,being a jewish,to my mind,will in anyway show jewish in better light & nazis as ultimate evil).world & cinema & presentation of stories has changed a lot since 90s after all where producers & directors played to the audiences & for their thrill rather than cater to an actual storyline. the fact that this biography is set in backdrop of world war ii & how he viewed the events is somewhat taken away is overlooked too in light of the persecution of jews & tragedy that a war is.""things are omitted"" or ""it looks a simplistic version of a complicated,deep thing"" is often heard but it remains one of the best representations of holocaust on movies ever.point is,things get lost in adapting a book into a screenplay & spielberg does add his own tidbits to make it more dramatic.if you want to explain how main characters, oskar schindler(neeson),amon goethe (fiennes)& itszhak stern(kingsley) suddenly change colors or how they thought is explained better in the book rather than any movie that adapts the book.this review is keeping that in mind. it's a largely black&white movie that attempts to make movie look bleak with greyscale colors in 1993 to take viewers back to 1939 & that's an innovation worth commending.it also tries to make the story of the book into an narrative documentary about the people in it(not quite there,but does well enough). story takes central character schindler from krakow,poland to auschwitz,germany to his hometown,zvitaw-brunnlitz.he arrived in krakow as failed businessman &with nothing & a member of socialist nazi party & a can-do attitude.he saw world war as a great profiteering opportunity with cheap jewish labor from ghetto settlement created after blitzkrieg demolition of polish armies.his investment in metalwork&enamelware is run by him after ruthless bargaining in goods instead of cash from ghetto&bribery of occupying ss officers & he employs his jew accountant stern to keep them in line with a similar philosophy.from there on,he changes a little&protects jews in his employ,initially to protect his workforce & profits &later after imploring of his valued stern(who uses schindler's factory as cover to get ""essential"" workforce from oppressed helpless jews,thus making them indispensable) &pleaders who approach him,once he's perceived as a hero & haven-provider due to stern's efforts.his actual & final transformation into a sympathizer occurs when he witnesses violent liquidation of krakow ghetto by ss army,in particular,by a little girl in red in all the black & white he sees running around & later on die once ghetto residents are ordered to move to auschwitz.this is liam neeson at his best acting skills even if story itself seems to be cliche towards the end. best acting is however,by ever-underrated & great ben kingsley(overshadowed by other actors in native india as well as hollywood) as stern & a young,expressive ralph fiennes as ss kommandant amon goethe.only a book explains how stern was a real hero in background while giving credit to schindler & escaping attention but kingsley does that implied part justice.also,fiennes in a role of sadistic butcher who made a sport of hunting jews is outstanding.his cruelty & hedonistic pleasure is even apparent in his hitting,yet protecting&loving a jewish maid,helen(embeth davidtz) who he wouldn't send to concentration camp or wear a star. apart from these central characters,story itself moves to given bleak series of events & cinematography which is excellent.it's a movie that deserves it's place & prizes in spite of better contemporary movies & as one of all-time greats out of hollywood.that faceless ""girl in red"" is highlighted just to underline what it was that changed schindler &jews placing stones on his grave in the end to pay tribute in vibrant color(&thus out of bleak scenario)is a very 90's spielberg idea to just simplify it to audiences & catch their attention.deliberately put even if unneeded.an attempt to make a bleak movie lighter since it can't really be enjoyable.i liked it. music&props in the movie are understandably full of gaffes if you nitpick.a 50s billie halliday's song playing in 40s or krakow with post-war invented stuff is something producers will simply have to turn back time for.90s krakow can't have 40's stuff lying around everywhere even in makeover.most glaring one is the railway with electric lines being used to transport jews in prominent scenes.so,forget nitpicking & just see how great acting using those props & movie is.kudos for a great movie & acting all round otherwise.";31

1048;hacoach;it was the perfect story, the perfect backdrop to show the un-showable, to reveal the horror of horrors and spielberg knew it. this man schindler, this vain, greedy, con man, his transformation from a nobody trying to scheme the system, into one of the great heroes of modern times, is the magic trick that delivers the movie. how did it happen, how did this man of all people, throw a fortune away, and risk life and limb in the very heart of evil, that is the question. so many did nothing, so many did evil in the name of duty, so few heroes, but there were heroes, heroes of the type that saved humanity by showing even under the worst possible circumstances, mankind has the capacity to rise to the occasion. evil is in abundance, and schindler is outnumbered, but many heroes emerged in the holocaust, not just schindler, many hid jews, many spirited jews to safety but few were as outnumbered and at the very heart of the holocaust as schindler. how do you protect, and keep 1,100 people from being murdered, and do it all out in the open, only the best conman could have done it, its almost as if schindler trained his whole life, all his cons, all his act and charisma finely tuned, just so he could pull off the greatest scheme of them all, tricking the nazi's out of 1,100 jewish souls. while schindler and goth battle it out miles above the jews like new gods, one with the complete power of life and death over the jews, the other working as hard as he can to save them. it is itzhak stern ( ben kingsley who is superb) who is the soul of the movie, the classy and dignified stern is a jewish man who overnight has lost his rights to be called human, the nazis have stripped him of everything but that humanity, which he somehow manages to cling to. it is through stern that we see the transformation in schindler, as first stern will not even take a drink with schindler by the end stern looks at schindler with an almost spiritual reverence reserved for the greatest of people. the reverence held for very very special people. we see the slow transformation of schindler, jump started by a fateful horse ride in the polish countryside, it is here that schindler first see's the little girl in the red coat, a beautiful angelic child relegated to extinction by hitler and his monsters, this is the beginning for schindler, the push, the horror is revealed to him. the second time he see's the girl in the red coat, she is among the dead in a wheel barrel full of corpses being wheeled to a fire to be incinerated. her life snuffed out like a candle. this is the moment when schindler knows he must act, that all the money in the world is worthless to a man who cannot sleep at night., or escape the guilt of not acting when so much depended on people acting. from that moment on schindler is relentless in protecting his jews, the schindler jews, he overcomes every obstacle the nazi's place in front of him, he bargains with the very devil himself, and wins. but not till the last day of the war, and even then can he rest. the nazi's were relentless in their thirst for jewish blood and schindler had to be just as relentless. a masterpiece and a historical look at mankind's darkest hour, which will live for a thousand years as testament , the thousand years the nazis thought their reich, which ended in flame, destruction and the embarrassment and blight on the character of mankind. thankfully there were men like schindler to show the other side of what mankind was capable of, and can aspire to be.;21 April 2017;10;['perfect', 'perfect', 'showable', 'vain', 'greedy', 'great', 'modern', 'magic', 'very', 'many', 'many', 'few', 'bad', 'possible', 'many', 'many', 'hid', 'many', 'spirited', 'few', 'very', 'open', 'good', 'whole', 'great', 'jewish', 'goth', 'new', 'complete', 'other', 'superb', 'classy', 'dignified', 'jewish', 'human', 'first', 'stern', 'spiritual', 'great', 'special', 'slow', 'fateful', 'polish', 'little', 'red', 'beautiful', 'angelic', 'second', 'red', 'dead', 'full', 'worthless', 'relentless', 'last', 'relentless', 'jewish', 'relentless', 'historical', 'dark', 'other', 'capable'];0.206652315076228

1102;lihobabenkopavel;"at the end of 1993, the premiere of the black-and-white film ""schindler's list"" took place, which unexpectedly paid off for its creators at the global box office and brought universal pictures a huge profit. the studio did not hope for such a success, assuming that a heavy historical drama would not be able to attract a large number of viewers - representatives of the film company even wanted to go for a trick by releasing a color version of the film on videotapes. spielberg was categorically against it. according to him, the mass extermination of jews by the nazis was recorded exclusively on black-and-white film, footage from which was included in the documentary chronicles, therefore, a feature film about those events could not be painted in bright colors. the director turned out to be right - whole halls in different parts of the world were filled for sessions with schindler's list, thanks to which he became the most commercially successful black-and-white tape in the history of cinema. unlike other popular paintings, ""schindler's list"" raised painful historical questions, showing how a terrible genocide took place. this affected the audience much more than any strategies of the film company, which tried to introduce an enticing element. the main character of the tape is a real-life german businessman oskar schindler (played by liam neeson in the film), who comes to krakow in 1939. oskar's only goal is to establish contact with high-ranking ss members and, taking advantage of the unstable situation in the city, open his factory. to make his task easier, he hires an accountant and a member of the jewish council, yitzhak stern (ben kingsley), to whom schindler entrusts the management of production. at this time, the nazis relocated polish jews to the ghetto, depriving them of real estate and the right to free movement. in order to help at least one of them, yitzhak stern employs jews, telling schindler that their labor force will cost the businessman less. oskar schindler's entire attention is focused on money and women, until he witnesses the bloody liquidation of the krakow ghetto under the control of ss officer amon goeth (ralph fiennes). after seeing how the nazis mock the jewish people and cynically destroy them, schindler decides to devote himself to saving the jews. the film ""schindler's list"" lasts three hours, during which the viewer is completely pulled out of modern reality. starting with beautiful shots of oscar's social life, spielberg smoothly moves to the streets of krakow, showing unfair treatment of jews. gradually, plunging into the atmosphere of the triumph of nazism, the director demonstrates the massacre of the weakest. so, step by step, the tape is approaching the reality of concentration camps. and this is an indescribably creepy sight, which, as we understand, was much scarier in real life.";19 January 2022;10;['black', 'white', 'universal', 'huge', 'heavy', 'historical', 'able', 'large', 'mass', 'black', 'white', 'bright', 'right', 'whole', 'different', 'successful', 'black', 'white', 'other', 'popular', 'painful', 'historical', 'terrible', 'more', 'enticing', 'main', 'real', 'german', 'liam', 'only', 'unstable', 'easy', 'jewish', 'polish', 'real', 'least', 'entire', 'bloody', 'ss', 'ralph', 'jewish', 'modern', 'beautiful', 'social', 'unfair', 'weak', 'creepy', 'scary', 'real'];0.0095833333333333

1114;tooraj-jamal;"1. oskar schindler (played brilliantly by liam neeson, ""batman begins"") was a sudeten german industrialist, a wealthy womanizer who wasn't afraid to throw his money around. always bearing his nazi party badge proudly, schindler would often frequent nightclubs, extravagantly showering high-ranked nazi officers and their girlfriends with champagne and caviar. with impeccable connections in the black-market, there was little that he couldn't get his hands on, and he was a good person to know. buying friends was something that schindler could do well, and he would often use these newfound alliances to aid his own business ventures. when thousands of the polish jew population was relegated to the krakow ghetto in 1941, schindler saw an opportunity for further success, enlisting desperate jewish investors and employing jewish workers (who were substantially cheaper to employ) to open an enamelware factory. his connections in high places ensured lucrative army contracts, and schindler need only have watched as his personal fortune grew, despite doing little to run the company beyond offering it ""a certain panache."" 2. it is clear from the beginning that oskar schindler does not harbour any racial prejudices. when schindler requests the services of itzhak stern (a superb ben kingsley, ""gandhi""), a clever, humanitarian jewish accountant, stern declares that, ""by law i have to tell you, sir, i'm a jew."" ""well, i'm a german, so there we are,"" replies schindler indifferently, before getting straight to business. it is not race that he is concerned with, it is himself and, of course, his money. stern does not enjoy running schindler's business, and he initially acquires little satisfaction from it. when schindler attempts to convey his genuine gratitude for his profitable services with a glass of whiskey, stern absentmindedly refuses to drink it, and an embittered schindler drinks it himself before ordering stern to leave. 3. film's sequence also marks the celebrated appearance of the little girl in the red coat. an ingenious plot device, the character was based upon a real girl named roma ligocka who, unlike her film counterpart, survived the war, and wrote a memoir entitled ""the girl in the red coat: a memoir"". the embodiment of innocence, schindler spots the small girl wandering amongst the black-and-white chaos of the krakow ghetto, and we follow her as she retreats into a building and takes shelter under a bed. when schindler later notices her disheveled corpse carted past him to be incinerated, he is understandably horrified, unable to understand how the soldiers could possibly destroy something so innocent. this event memorably signifies the turning-point of schindler's attitudes towards the carnage, fuelling his desire to save as many jews as possible. 4. it was a smart idea for steven spielberg to make this film in black- white because it made the movie more bleak, emotional, hopelessness. but you see small patches of color -- a candle and a child's coat bringing the evilness of the tragedy into a agonizing focus. 5. this movie is more than just something for us to watch for 3 hours and 17 minutes, it is something for us to never forget, to teach us a lesson and to remember those who died needlessly along with those who tried to help those same people survive. 6.

1118;Eric_Ruan;"the story is about the efforts that oskar schindler (liam neeson), a world war ii profiteer, put out in order to save the jews from plaszow concentration camp. let us make it very clear: from the starting point, schindler has no interest in saving the jews. his sole interest, at first, was to make money. how was this man converted from being an opportunistic businessman into a courageous human soul who was willing to save thousands of lives? he even appeared initially unaffected when ss-lieutenant amon goth (ralph fiennce) blissfully murdered innocent jews. how, then, could this man break down at the end of the film because he could not save just one more life is baffling. agreed that he was surrounded by good jews, but the probable reason for his transition (encountering a dead jews who thanked him) was utterly self-congratulatory. was he even terrified by the murders that were going on (if he was, he never showed it on screen any way)? perhaps, only the extraordinary schindler himself could help spielberg realize it. or did spielberg care about strong characterizations, at all? there was no complexity here. however, liam neeson's schindler was given pretty decent treatment when you consider the other elements in schindler's list. particularly was, the vicious monster of the story, lieutenant amon goth. was he the only one who killed (or loved killing) jews throughout this whole affair? i had this question on my mind when the film exclusively focused on him insanely shooting random jews from his bedroom. giving a mad figure the special treatment of being the leading culprit of this mass murder is a laughably simplistic way to make sense of the holocaust. and it fits into the general audience's banal understanding of the event. the key to holocaust is the diffusion of responsibility among the persecutors and the lack of moral convictions on the very part of the human race. those complex concepts were given no treatment in schindler's list. instead, everything is reduced to insanity. the very possibility of the holocaust, therefore, remains alien to a whole audience, who, perhaps, come to see the film just to feel a sense of grandness and liberal guilt. raplh fience was terrific in his performance. however, his role, sadly, served as a springboard for the audience to blindly put their blame on. how revealing! in short, the treatment of both schindler and goth shed no light on the ambiguity of human nature. schindler suddenly became ""good"" while goth was inherently ""bad"" (this only makes the visual comparisons between the two men all the more exploitative). everything seems pretty common sense, and obviously very digestible. however, if there is a most deplorable injustice being done here, it was the presentation of the jewish community. perhaps, everyone who has watched this film can recall the scene of a little girl splashed in red that schindler spotted during the liquidation of the concentration camp. anyone could have been fooled by this imagery, whether a film amateur or a veteran film fan. however, if you sit back to think about it, the image is pretty fortuitous. what does this present exactly? hope? love? future? or even blood? this middle-browned attempt to convey some visual meanings does not succeed in any meaningful way. worse still, it is an exploitation of the bathos of childhood innocence, which does not make sense in this circumstance. we are dealing with the jewish community as a whole, not some selective individuals that were singled out from this whole in order for us to dwell on 'sophisticated' feelings of loss and hope. if there is a lesson that is unforgettable about the holocaust, it is the unjustified prejudice and hatred inflicted upon the jewish community as a race, not just the brutality and violence that any particular jew experienced (if you want to know about brutality and trauma, you can ask the 20 million russians who were dead also). why not color every jew red then? any selective visual presentation in this case is misguiding; and manipulative. even the sequence that precedes it, a moral struggle between mother, daughter and childhood friend during evacuation does not feel like a climax. it is so trite, so predictable that one might just allow himself to rumble with all the emotions that spielberg has designed for him. it feels as if, the audience is told what they already know, and all they need to do is sit there, ruminating like an act. the saddest thing is that at the end, when the credit rolls ""in memory of the 6 million jews who died during the holocaust"", i wonder what the whole film has to do with those 6 million deaths. if you are inattentive and easy-going, you would freely accept it as an earnest tribute to them. but really? telling the cliche story of a thousand who were alive is the tribute to the 6 million who were dead? what does this film have to do with the dead anyway? the desperation, the horror, the pain, the shame and the doubt of those who went dead were not adequately conveyed. oh, just tell the marvelous story of saving lives to make the audience open their mouths and wonder. and we can forget about those who were dead. what a lovely tribute that spielberg made! the real story is extraordinary. but there must be a way of telling it without this pretentious sense of self-importance that makes it so easily consumed by an uninformed audience. at no point in this film, do i feel a sense of desperation, that sense of ""needing to get out of this horrible nightmare"". it was just like watching a prodigious show that make you feel ""wowed"" (and admire, and cry?). but remember that grandness cannot replace substance. indeed, holocaust is a very difficult subject matter. it needs to be approached first with intelligence. but spielberg evidently failed to do so.";11 May 2012;4;['clear', 'sole', 'opportunistic', 'courageous', 'human', 'willing', 'unaffected', 'ralph', 'innocent', 'more', 'good', 'probable', 'dead', 'congratulatory', 'extraordinary', 'strong', 'decent', 'other', 'vicious', 'only', 'whole', 'random', 'mad', 'special', 'mass', 'simplistic', 'general', 'banal', 'moral', 'very', 'human', 'complex', 'very', 'alien', 'whole', 'liberal', 'raplh', 'terrific', 'short', 'human', 'good', 'bad', 'visual', 'exploitative', 'common', 'digestible', 'deplorable', 'jewish', 'little', 'veteran', 'fortuitous', 'present', 'future', 'middle', 'visual', 'meaningful', 'bad', 'jewish', 'selective', 'sophisticated', 'unforgettable', 'unjustified', 'jewish', 'particular', 'dead', 'red', 'selective', 'visual', 'manipulative', 'moral', 'trite', 'predictable', 'sad', 'whole', 'inattentive', 'earnest', 'alive', 'dead', 'dead', 'dead', 'marvelous', 'dead', 'lovely', 'real', 'extraordinary', 'pretentious', 'uninformed', 'horrible', 'prodigious', 'difficult'];-0.0214023109243697

1131;gurur-cicekoglu;schindler's list is a 1993 american epic historical period drama film, directed and co-produced by steven spielberg and scripted by steven zaillian. it is based on the novel schindler's ark by thomas keneally, an australian novelist. the film is based on the life of oskar schindler, an ethnic german businessman who saved the lives of more than a thousand mostly polish-jewish refugees during the holocaust by employing them in his factories. it stars liam neeson as schindler, ralph fiennes as schutzstaffel (ss) officer amon goth, and ben kingsley as schindler's jewish accountant itzhak stern. ideas for a film about the schindlerjuden (schindler jews) were proposed as early as 1963. poldek pfefferberg, one of the schindlerjuden, made it his life's mission to tell the story of schindler. spielberg became interested in the story when executive sid sheinberg sent him a book review of schindler's ark. universal studios bought the rights to the novel, but spielberg, unsure if he was ready to make a film about the holocaust, tried to pass the project to several other directors before finally deciding to direct the film himself. principal photography took place in krakow, poland, over the course of 72 days in 1993. spielberg shot the film in black and white and approached it as a documentary. cinematographer janusz kaminski wanted to give the film a sense of timelessness. john williams composed the score, and violinist itzhak perlman performs the film's main theme. schindler's list premiered on november 30, 1993, in washington, d.c. and it was released on december 15, 1993, in the united states. often listed among the greatest films ever made,[4][5][6] it was also a box office success, earning $321.2 million worldwide on a $22 million budget. it was the recipient of seven academy awards (out of twelve nominations), including best picture, best director, best adapted screenplay, and best original score, as well as numerous other awards (including seven baftas and three golden globes). in 2007, the american film institute ranked the film 8th on its list of the 100 best american films of all time. the library of congress selected it for preservation in the national film registry in 2004.;26 September 2016;10;['american', 'epic', 'historical', 'novel', 'australian', 'ethnic', 'german', 'more', 'polish', 'jewish', 'liam', 'ralph', 'jewish', 'interested', 'executive', 'sid', 'universal', 'ready', 'several', 'other', 'principal', 'black', 'white', 'violinist', 'main', 'great', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'original', 'numerous', 'other', 'golden', 'good', 'american', 'national'];0.2138888888888889

1197;jlvilandre;poor oskars's remarkable and more than brave endeavor in saving human lives during the dark days of ww2 in europe almost immediately takes a back seat to the lamentations of the filmmaker in perpetuating the plight of a certain group of people on which unspeakable atrocities were perpetrated upon. a film that helps promote liberties taken over the years by that certain group of people from anything to a good seat at the opera to unabated attempts to destroy other people's beliefs and right to exist. this film is (unfortunately), not about a man's humanitarian well-meant efforts to do what he could to help to save a group of desperate and obviously(for most of them) doomed to their certain death, people. the point that came across was visually witnessing the random acts of a certain person committing atrocities and exaggerating them to an extent that diminished what really happened to those people. in trying to add visual credibility via sensationalism made a mockery and a not so subtle message that a certain group of people have rights forever to commit atrocities to avenge what befell them over the centuries. if there is such a thing as a hate film, well this is it, generalizing 40 million people as monsters for the actions of a handful of lunatics sanctioned by the so-called allies that were still full of boast and smugness and let's face it, blindness to what was going on. in short, the filmmaker's point was very subjective, to put it mildly.;26 July 2006;1;['poor', 'remarkable', 'more', 'brave', 'human', 'dark', 'back', 'certain', 'unspeakable', 'certain', 'good', 'unabated', 'other', 'humanitarian', 'desperate', 'most', 'certain', 'random', 'certain', 'visual', 'subtle', 'certain', 'full', 'short', 'subjective'];0.1220521541950113

1223;clermontd;i first saw schindler's list on it's opening weekend. the theater was full. one of the most remarkable things i observed was the stone silence of the audience, i felt awkward just picking up my soda. as a person who has a great deal of interest in the holocaust and wwii in general and has been to both the holocaust museum in washington and yad vashem in jerusalem, i found this film realistic and deeply moving. for those who found the film 'boring' or yet another opportunity to question spielberg's ability i am sorry that they missed a great movie. the appeal of this film is that it is based on a true story. if this were not so, it would not be anywhere near the top ten as a movie. the power of this film comes from the fact that oskar schindler and his list actually existed. this powerful reality of 'schindler's list' overrides the lack of whiz bang entertainment or the minutia of fine film making. i judge a film by how i feel about it immediately afterward and again the next day. normally, i stand up, grab my keys and get back to reality. in the case of schindler's list i didn't shake it for a while, i wasn't even conversational for probably an hour. i also would like to address the issue of the little girl in the red coat. the value, to me, in this twist was to point out that each death was a personal tragedy, that these were individuals, not merely faceless masses from a black and white documentary. if any of us sat and wondered about her individual story, even for a second, spielberg was successful. i will leave the analysis of character development, casting, and spielberg himself to the pseudo-intellectuals who frequent this site, but to me schindler's list was a powerful film.;27 July 2001;10;['full', 'remarkable', 'awkward', 'great', 'general', 'realistic', 'boring', 'sorry', 'great', 'true', 'top', 'powerful', 'fine', 'next', 'conversational', 'little', 'red', 'personal', 'faceless', 'black', 'white', 'individual', 'second', 'successful', 'powerful'];0.1338768115942029

1241;heatherfeather-2;i've read a lot of the comments on this movie and while everyone is entitled to their opinion, it pained me to see that many people missed the point of the movie altogether. many people have labeled this as a horrible movie simply because it was made by spielberg. others criticize the way he used black and white film (with the exception of the girl in the red coat) and still others claim that there was no schindler. just because a movie is made by spielberg, doesn't mean it's going to be trash. this has to be the first movie of his i've seen that i actually really learned something from and left me wanting to make the world a better place. maybe that seems stupid to some people, but knowing what schindler did makes me believe that maybe one day i can help someone too. as for the black and white film, i think it fit beautifully. in the 30's and 40's there really wasn't a lot of color film used, especially for journalism and the news. it fit with the time period very well. also, the little girl in the red coat was a wonderfully sentimental touch. there actually was a little girl wearing a scarlet coat the day of the karkow liquidation that caught schindler's eye and it completely disgusted him that people could commit such atrocities in front of a child. what happens later is symbolic of what was happening to the millions of people (jewish, gypsies, homosexuals, etc.) and the fact that no one was standing up for them. the little girl and seeing her running through the crowd and what happens later helps to open up schindler's eyes in the movie. many people here have claimed that the character of oskar schindler was completely fabricated so that sielberg could get some money. fortunately enough for those 1,200 people, there was a real schindler and he really did help them. he wasn't the best of men and he certainly had his faults. he drank excessively, he was a renowned womanizer, he supported slave labor, and he was a member of the nazi party. . . but despite all that, he still did something good for other people. oh, and contrary to what some people have claimed, while schindler did in fact make a fortune during the war, he spent practically all of it to save the jewish workers. he lost everything he had gained during the war to save them. liam neeson, i felt, did a great job portraying schindler and ralph fiennes was brilliant as amon goeth. fiennes in particular was rather frightening at how well he portrayed such a feared member of the nazi party. there is a lot of nudity in the movie. some people complain about that, but honestly, what do you expect? do you really think that the nazis told them that they'd turn away while they got changed? no. the nudity in the film (as portrayed by the jewish and other victims) was necessary because it helps to demonstrate exactly what these poor people had to endure. in closing, don't listen to all the negative reviewers out there claiming it's bad because of nudity, spielberg, or any other number of things. this is truly a movie that you can't judge until you've seen it for yourself.;24 June 2007;10;['many', 'many', 'horrible', 'black', 'white', 'red', 'first', 'well', 'stupid', 'black', 'white', 'little', 'red', 'sentimental', 'little', 'scarlet', 'such', 'symbolic', 'jewish', 'little', 'many', 'real', 'good', 'renowned', 'good', 'other', 'contrary', 'jewish', 'great', 'ralph', 'brilliant', 'particular', 'frightening', 'jewish', 'other', 'necessary', 'poor', 'negative', 'bad', 'other'];0.0029040404040404

1246;igorlindberg-41541;the best movie i've ever seen about the oppression of the jewish people during world war ii. spielberg's decision to make the film in black and white was excellent. steven spielberg is the greatest director who has made more than a dozen good films. but this particular film is the best, as it seems to me there is little that can compare with this film at all. the way all the pain and suffering that the jewish people endured is conveyed to the viewer. let's move on to the story. the whole movie is set in poland during world war ii. the german businessman oskar schindler arrives in krakow to set up a factory. with the help of his eloquence, schindler quickly negotiates all the mishaps with the german military. seeing the deplorable condition of the jews, oskar decides to invite them to his factory because they are willing to work for less. and so schindler becomes richer and richer. his business becomes more and more profitable. the imprisonment of the krakow jews in a concentration camp is the beginning of schindler's evolution. oskar schindler saved, during world war ii, over 1200 jews. knowing that this is all based on real events, it makes you feel even more sorry for the jews, who had to endure so much suffering and humiliation. as for the cast, i was impressed by the acting of three actors at once. liam neeson, aka oskar schindler. liam did a great job as oskar. i did not like his character immediately. in the beginning, he was neutral about the appropriation of the jews. but closer to the middle of the film, he realizes the complexity of the situation and realizes that he can save people's lives. and after that, he gives up almost all of his money to save as many people as he can. ben kingsley, aka itzhaku stern. yitzhak was oscar's accountant, and thanks to yitzhak, so many lives were saved, both old people and children. rafe fiennes, aka amon goeth. this is one of my least favorite characters of all the movies i've seen, and there are over 2,000. rafe did such a great job with his role as the villain. his character was hated by almost everyone when watching the movie, the way he is cruel to the jews. it's just awful, all the things he did, i don't understand how a person is capable of acting like him. the soundtrack in the film is gorgeous. i also want to highlight the strongest dialogues, which take you to heart. steven has made a truly iconic film that is one of the best of his decade. <ul><li>that car - hertz could have bought a car - why did i keep it? it's... ten people... ten people... ten more people... this badge is two people. it's gold... two more people. they wouldn't give me two, at least one. one more could have been saved. one more... one more... for that... i could have saved one more, one more... and i didn't do it... i didn't do it...</li></ul> this is an excerpt from one of the last dialogues in the film, and it really gets to the heart, a special kudos to liam neeson for the wonderful acting, who gave it his all in every dialogue. a great movie that runs for 3 hours, but that time passes unnoticed. for those of you who have been putting off seeing this movie, i suggest you watch this movie the first chance you get. i am sure you will enjoy it. 10 out of 10.;19 January 2022;9;['good', 'jewish', 'black', 'white', 'excellent', 'great', 'more', 'good', 'particular', 'good', 'little', 'jewish', 'whole', 'german', 'german', 'deplorable', 'willing', 'less', 'rich', 'rich', 'profitable', 'real', 'sorry', 'much', 'great', 'neutral', 'many', 'many', 'old', 'rafe', 'least', 'favorite', 'great', 'cruel', 'awful', 'capable', 'gorgeous', 'strong', 'iconic', 'good', 'more', 'more', 'least', 'more', 'more', 'more', 'more', 'more', 'last', 'special', 'wonderful', 'great', 'unnoticed', 'first', 'sure'];0.2647261904761905

1248;pukh-86716;"spielberg's best film, and the best directorial work of all time. the film was shot in black and white, as spielberg said he always associated this theme with black and white documentaries. by and large, there is nothing original in the film, it simply shows a difficult and terrible period in people's lives, which is based on real events. but fortunately, steven spielberg is just a directing maniac, he tries to get the most out of each of his films, and in this film he simply does the impossible. the film is simply stuffed with ingenious directorial cinema moments that are simply amazing. there are ingeniously filmed difficult moments in the film: where the corpses of people are burned in a fire, where a dead girl is being transported on a cart, attention on which was focused at the beginning of the film. the moment where a man is dragging a barely alive woman on himself, a soldier tells him - ""drop her, it's all over with her"", to which he replies - ""no, she can go"", then the soldier shoots her in the face. there are also bright moments (my favorite movie moment of all spielbuerg's films): ralph faens leads a man to be shot, but no matter what he does, the gun just doesn't shoot, this movie moment is filmed with especially high quality and ingeniously, as if there was a divine intervention and god himself stood up for the life of an innocent person. the film is shot very high quality, spielberg, having already trained in dramas ('the color purple', 'always' and 'empire of the sun'), but still not being recognized as a good drama director, makes 'schindler's list', a film that puts him in the category of the most talented directors of all time, who, in addition to good blockbusters, also makes brilliant serious films that make the viewer turn on the brain while watching. ""schindler's list"" is the biggest breakthrough for spielberg, it was after watching this film that for me the word director became associated with his name. as i said, personally, i have never seen such a high-quality and masterful director's work that spielberg did in this film, for me this is the pinnacle of directing, no one has been able to do such high-quality directing, spielberg beat kubrick, lynch, van sant with this film, tarkovsky, just knocked them all out and made the most brilliant film in terms of directing. he shot it right after another fresh blockbuster ""jurassic park"" - the highest grossing film of the year. from this follows the conclusion that 1993 in the world of cinema belonged to him entirely - the highest grossing and most oscar-winning film of the year was shot by him. it's hard to believe that the director of ""jaws"" and the ""indiana jones"" trilogy made such a movie - these are just two different universes. ""schindler's list"" in some places simply screams that only spielberg could make such a movie, in some of its moments one can feel his signature approach to the film, the same moment with the unsuccessful execution of a worker, when watching it, it is clear that only one person could have made such a movie . if the list had been directed by another director, then it is clear that the film would not have such high-quality directing that just cuts into the viewer's brain. roman polanski failed to make his ""pianist"" so convincing and brilliant. experiments with color are very pleasing, the candle fire and the girl's red jacket are shown in color in the film, it reminds me of the film ""europe"", but unlike this masterpiece of cinema in schindler's list, color effects are used much less frequently, and of course there are no film effects trier's hallucinogenic techniques, but still there is something similar in the films. the actors in the film are just wonderful, especially ralph faens and liam neeson. the music by john williams is beyond praise, especially the music in the credits, when the camera smoothly pans over broken tombstones on the ground with raindrops on them. the film is generally almost perfect, and it does not want to change a single frame. it is worth saying that the film is very difficult emotionally, but every person must watch it at least once in order to understand a small part of the horror that the second world war carried in itself. this is one of my top 10 favorite films.";19 January 2022;9;['good', 'good', 'directorial', 'black', 'white', 'black', 'white', 'large', 'original', 'difficult', 'terrible', 'real', 'most', 'impossible', 'ingenious', 'directorial', 'amazing', 'difficult', 'dead', 'alive', 'bright', 'favorite', 'ralph', 'high', 'divine', 'innocent', 'high', 'color', 'good', 'talented', 'good', 'brilliant', 'serious', 'view', 'big', 'high', 'masterful', 'able', 'such', 'high', 'brilliant', 'fresh', 'high', 'grossing', 'high', 'hard', 'different', 'same', 'unsuccessful', 'clear', 'clear', 'such', 'high', 'roman', 'convincing', 'brilliant', 'pleasing', 'red', 'hallucinogenic', 'similar', 'wonderful', 'ralph', 'liam', 'broken', 'perfect', 'single', 'worth', 'difficult', 'least', 'small', 'second', 'top', 'favorite'];0.2036077481840194

1256;mayanktyagi05;based on a true story, steven spielberg's schindler's list stars liam neeson as oskar schindler, a german businessman in poland who sees an opportunity to make money from the nazis' rise to power. he starts a company to make cookware and utensils, using flattery and bribes to win military contracts, and brings in accountant and financier itzhak stern (ben kingsley) to help run the factory. by staffing his plant with jews who've been herded into krakow's ghetto by nazi troops, schindler has a dependable unpaid labor force. for stern, a job in a war-related plant could mean survival for himself and the other jews working for schindler. however, in 1942, all of krakow's jews are assigned to the plaszow forced labor camp, overseen by commandant amon goeth (ralph fiennes), an embittered alcoholic who occasionally shoots prisoners from his balcony. schindler arranges to continue using polish jews in his plant, but, as he sees what is happening to his employees, he begins to develop a conscience. he realizes that his factory (now refitted to manufacture ammunition) is the only thing preventing his staff from being shipped to the death camps. soon schindler demands more workers and starts bribing nazi leaders to keep jews on his employee lists and out of the camps. by the time germany falls to the allies, schindler has lost his entire fortune -- and saved 1,100 people from likely death. schindler's list was nominated for 12 academy awards and won seven, including best picture and a long-coveted best director for spielberg, and it quickly gained praise as one of the finest american movies about the holocaust.;30 January 2015;10;['true', 'liam', 'german', 'military', 'ghetto', 'dependable', 'unpaid', 'other', 'commandant', 'ralph', 'embittered', 'polish', 'only', 'more', 'entire', 'likely', 'good', 'good', 'fine', 'american'];0.2032051282051281

1278;philwhite-411-828978;well, what an incredible piece of work from spielberg. the subject, of course, is a matter of posterity. probably the darkest moment of recent human history, the film is presented in a flat, matter of fact way. this isn't a criticism. the usual flair for storytelling that spielberg shows, wouldn't have been appropriate here. the one moment that the director indulged himself a little too much, was the much talked about shower scene. in this sequence, it felt as though the emotions of the audience where being wrenched in an artificial way. i have heard a story of something similar happening to some escapees, but not at auschwitz. anyway, it's a small criticism. the character of schindler is masterfully played by liam neeson, someone who i have always felt is a capable, but not remarkable actor. he displays an earnestness and dignity here which i have never seen him replicate in his career since. ditto for ralph fiennes as goth, who far from being a typical film villain, is both heinous and banal. a vile, hideous creature, but a well rounded, three dimensional one to boot. i would like to have seen one or two of the jewish character's, more at the forefront. it seems a little trite to portray a major event in the holocaust/shoah and have the jewish characters be almost fodder in the backdrop. the girl in the red, the little boy who hides in the toilet and the mother and daughter are all memorable, but more due to circumstance, rather than resolve. and screen time. the violence and tention on screen is masterfully achieved. for me though, the most harrowing scene features no violence at all. it's the moment when the parents at the camp see the jeeps taking the children away, and the blissful unawareness as they wave at their adults, (who react with understanding horror and rush the jeeps) that punched me straight in the heart. overall it's a work of art, that is seminal, and will rightly stand the test of time. i can highly recommend the bbc mini-series, auschwitz, as a companion piece to this, for those who wish to dive deeper into this horrendous time period. let us hope we never see the likes of it again..;12 August 2019;10;['incredible', 'dark', 'recent', 'human', 'flat', 'usual', 'appropriate', 'little', 'much', 'shower', 'artificial', 'similar', 'small', 'capable', 'remarkable', 'ralph', 'goth', 'typical', 'heinous', 'banal', 'vile', 'hideous', 'rounded', 'dimensional', 'jewish', 'more', 'little', 'major', 'jewish', 'little', 'memorable', 'due', 'harrowing', 'blissful', 'seminal', 'horrendous'];0.0493055555555555

1286;SantaEma;though i rather like to think it did. there is a moment at the end of the movie where oskar is about to leave in order to escape being arrested. he is surrounded by the jews and is accompanied of course by his wife. the dialogue is as such (according to the quotes page): oskar schindler: i could have got more out. i could have got more. i don't know. if i'd just... i could have got more. itzhak stern: oskar, there are eleven hundred people who are alive because of you. look at them. oskar schindler: if i'd made more money... i threw away so much money. you have no idea. if i'd just... itzhak stern: there will be generations because of what you did. oskar schindler: i didn't do enough! itzhak stern: you did so much. *schindler looks at his car* oskar schindler: this car. goeth would have bought this car. why did i keep the car? ten people right there. ten people. ten more people. *removing nazi pin from lapel* oskar schindler: this pin. two people.this is gold. two more people. he would have given me two for it, at least one. one more person. a person, stern. for this. *sobbing* oskar schindler: i could have gotten one more person... and i didn't! and i... i didn't! ~ it is during this moment that oskar appears to have a moment of so much regret and remorse and yet, you can't help but think--oskar, you did something! you did something more than so many people bothered to do. and that is better than doing nothing at all, no? so, i give this movie (though it is a ruthlessly manipulative spielberg adaptation) ten stars, for this scene more than any other scene in the entire film. i do not know (and to some extent highly doubt) whether this conversation actually took place. but despite the fact that i know deep down it probably did not, i like to imagine it did. and i like to imagine that even if it didn't, the emotion behind it was present during the actual event that this scene portrays. it is this that makes me feel as though this movie deserves the ten star rating. this scene alone. even if it is perhaps the most manipulative scene in the entire film, i can not describe how deeply i love this scene. how much i cried over this scene. again, i realize this is the talking-down-to-the-audience technique so often seen in such big blockbuster historical non-fiction films like this, but i can not help but feel so much for just this one particular moment and i guess i can not explain why. i hope that the quote itself explains it enough. and i hope whoever sees or has seen this movie will perhaps understand why this scene is so important. at the present time i am in the process of reading the book from which this movie is adapted and eventually perhaps i will see the documentary. but for now, this is something. oskar, you did something!;11 July 2015;10;['about', 'such', 'more', 'more', 'more', 'alive', 'more', 'much', 'more', 'more', 'least', 'more', 'stern', 'more', 'much', 'more', 'many', 'well', 'manipulative', 'other', 'entire', 'doubt', 'present', 'actual', 'manipulative', 'entire', 'such', 'big', 'blockbuster', 'historical', 'non', 'fiction', 'much', 'particular', 'important', 'present'];0.2184027777777778

1288;ajaysingh0402;the holocaust during world war ii forms the backbone of the plot in this highly-acclaimed, heart-touching movie. oskar schindler is introduced as an opportunistic and avaricious businessman, who hires jews as workers merely because they constitute cheap labor. but, soon enough, his greed is subdued by his attachment to them and he plans to save them from hitler's persecution, even if he has to throw away his hard-earned savings as bribes to the nazi officers. a very commendable job by the writers makes the character come alive very convincingly. liam neeson cannot be given any less credit for portraying the protagonist and ben kingsley as stern adds a cherry to the cake. but, the portrayal of the setup actually used by nazis to slaughter the jews, makes the audience shiver with fear and disbelief. the detailing and hard-work put by spielberg is quite evident in the scene where the jewish children try to elude the nazi soldiers by hiding in places inconceivable to any ordinary man. another such instance is when the jews are transported in trains, huddled like cattle without enough space to take even a whiff of air. an unbiased judge may opine that there were quite a few instances where the protagonist may have been idealized in order to make the people really adore him. this can be defended by accepting that the real oskar schindler acted only as a source of inspiration for the role, and the rest had to be cooked up as per the appetite of the audience. all in all, the movie stands today as a masterpiece made once in a lifetime.;18 August 2014;9;['opportunistic', 'avaricious', 'cheap', 'commendable', 'alive', 'less', 'detailing', 'hard', 'evident', 'jewish', 'inconceivable', 'ordinary', 'such', 'enough', 'unbiased', 'few', 'real'];0.0037878787878787

""schindler's list"" transcends ""citizen kane"" in brilliant film-making and acting, however. its pure believable humanity has such effectiveness that people can be changed by its horrors, drama, and feel-good appeal. suspense has never been at the level throughout movies as it is in ""schindler's list"". hitchcock made some suspenseful movies, especially ""rear window"", but the auchwitz scene in this film has suspense on a level i have never seen before. the elements of horror, drama, suspense, and especially humanity throughout this movie are enough to make it comparable to ""citizen kane"". however, what makes it better are the stellar performances given by every actor throughout the performance. liam neeson is brilliant as oskar schindler, and he becomes mr. schindler in such a way that other actors throughout cinematic history would have died for to achieve. even better is ralph finnes as amon goeth, a man just as vicious as hitler who was portrayed in one of the great film performances in history. the only reason this movie does not have the same regard as films such as ""casablanca"" or ""citizen kane"" is because it is so young. thirteen years is not enough time for a movie to age the same way movies such as the classics of the 30s and 40s evolved into what they are today. in another 40 years however, schindler's list will be among the company of ""citizen kane"" and ""casablanca"". this is my pick for the greatest film ever made.";3 March 2006;10;['die', 'hard', 'possible', 'main', 'brilliant', 'pure', 'believable', 'such', 'good', 'suspenseful', 'rear', 'auchwitz', 'enough', 'comparable', 'stellar', 'brilliant', 'other', 'cinematic', 'ralph', 'vicious', 'great', 'only', 'same', 'such', 'young', 'enough', 'same', 'such', 'great'];0.1630952380952381
1322;camisandrade;a live film that transports the audience to a dark time when intolerance was taken its worst consequences. the film directed by steven spielberg and starring liam neeson, ben kingsley and ralph fiennes deserve all the received awards, nominations and critical success achieved. the schindler's list tells the story of oskar schindler, played by liam neeson, a german businessman who during the holocaust saved the lives of over a thousand jews by employing them in his factory. the film addresses the vision of two main characters antagonistic to one another, oskar schindler and the ss officer amon goeth, played by ralph fiennes. throughout the movie is noticeable the conflict experienced by oskar who finds himself in the dilemma between saving lives and keep your business out of sight of nazi officials. the character liam neeson tries not to show their feelings to factory employees and presents the most of the time a serious man. the curious thing was that oskar schindler was a member of the nazi party, a fact that leads him to escape the red army with the end of the german army and war, it is still noticeable humanity of his character in contradiction to ralph fiennes character. both main actors confuse the viewer a little early because of the physical resemblance of them. the look of the film, to be in black and white makes it seem more real scenes of a past that should not be forgotten. the girl in the red dress is one of the most intriguing characters in the film representing from the blood of the jewish people to hope. a long film that had to be split in two but that still was not enough to show all the suffering experienced by the jewish people. many stories are told throughout the film, a way to revive the memory of those who were in this sad episode in the history of the world. one of the most beautiful scenes of the film, when oskar needs to get away and all factory workers meets all their assets in gold, melt and transform into a ring given to schindler in their match, he dressed in pajamas that thousands of jews dressed. in this moment, oskar gets emotional embarrassed, thinking he could have done more and thus save more lives. the final finish is given in the last scene and more exciting when some of the characters in this tragedy played in the film comes up together in a field and find the actors that interpreted. creepy. movies like this make us think how humanity can be cruel. impossible not to be moved.;22 April 2016;10;['live', 'dark', 'bad', 'ralph', 'received', 'critical', 'german', 'main', 'antagonistic', 'ss', 'ralph', 'noticeable', 'most', 'serious', 'curious', 'red', 'german', 'noticeable', 'main', 'little', 'physical', 'black', 'white', 'real', 'red', 'intriguing', 'jewish', 'long', 'enough', 'jewish', 'many', 'sad', 'beautiful', 'emotional', 'embarrassed', 'more', 'more', 'final', 'last', 'exciting', 'cruel', 'impossible'];0.001985766758494

1437;lillianmckellan;"schindler's list is one of those movies that elicits such a strong reaction not only the first time one sees it, but every subsequent time that people often respond without fully being able to think through what they are saying. personally, it is one of my favorites, as i have emerged from each viewing of it exhausted, torn, and enlightened from an experience explores many sides of humanity during one of the most terrifying times in recent history. some, however, have responded very negatively to what they term historical inaccuracies, lack of focus on the real issues, or for others, overblown sentimentality. not being spielberg, i have no idea what his intentions were, but i would argue that no single movie can ever truly capture the experience of an entire continent during a six year period or war, much less a 13 year period of nazi rule in germany. regardless of how incredible schindler's list is, it should only be the first of many holocaust movies to be made. thus, i agree with people who argue that there was more to the holocaust than this film, but to not recognize the greatness of this film for that reason is simply ridiculous. this movie explores human nature, therein lies its true greatness. it asks each and every one of us to search the depths of our character, and ask ourselves what we would do in a situation where our moral, spiritual, and physical beings were threatened from every direction. do we really expect film to be reality? i don't. i go to movies to make me think, to make me look inward and learn something about myself, to tell explore a part of reality that i had not ever seen before. schindler's list does exactly this better than almost any other film through nearly flawless acting, beautiful cinematography, and a fantastic story, historically accurate or not. i don't want to relive the holocaust, i consider myself quite fortunate that i have never had, and hopefully never will have, to make the decisions facing either stern, goethe, or schindler. instead, the holocaust should be taught and learned about to discover more about humanity, hopefully to reach an understanding of ourselves that we can use in the future. that's what this film does; it's better than eat";7 March 2020;10;['strong', 'first', 'subsequent', 'able', 'torn', 'many', 'terrifying', 'recent', 'historical', 'real', 'overblown', 'single', 'entire', 'less', 'incredible', 'first', 'many', 'more', 'ridiculous', 'human', 'true', 'moral', 'spiritual', 'physical', 'well', 'other', 'flawless', 'beautiful', 'fantastic', 'accurate', 'fortunate', 'stern', 'more', 'well'];0.2150656814449918

1440;ulanbek_k;"the definition of a norm described by robert axelrod in his article ""an evolutionary approach to norms"" brings me the case of oscar schindler when i try to understand the term. the definition is that ""a norm exists in a given social setting to the extent that individuals usually act in a certain way and are often punished when seen not to be acting in this way"". well, in my view oscar was not punished after all. or maybe he was? oscar schindler, the main protagonist who saved hundreds of jewish people's lives during the world war ii time in poland, seems as an outsider in the story or in the society where the story goes on. the story goes on in poland, where an austrian businessman who runs a factory and needs a labor force. thus he comes to a labor camp and gets several jew people for his factory to work. as the plot continues, and thousands are jewish people being killed, something changes in oscar and he starts to save his jewish workers. the history of a holocaust is bloody and terrifying, however, the story of jews who worked for oscar schindler, ironically, could be counted as lucky for staying alive. now the question of norms comes out, what kind of norms holds the story? and why i call oscar schindler an outlier in this story? schindler is a rich and ""not jewish"" man whose beginning purpose was money and business, however, during the story, he changes his actions of using his privileged identity. helping and saving jewish people, hiding them would count as abnormal in this story and he commits those abnormal actions and saves lives. the motives of his actions can just be guessed by me but not explained, because when it comes to the norms that powerful and key people accepted, there is no question of the ""humane"" and ""not humane"" acts since those are very subjective terms. in ""schindler's list"" the terms of norms and question of being humane contradicts, in my view. if the norms are, even temporarily only for that period of time and only in that region, getting rid of jewish people and it is considered as normal phenomena by people - the scene where a soldier shot a jew because he had ""that mood of killing"", - but the ""being humane"" is oscar schindler who's probably conscience suddenly got awaken. the discussion of norms and behaviour under those norms often connected to the values. in this movie's case, the values of a particular character, mr.schindler got changed overtime - from money and wealth to people's lives. this switch can be seen and understood by his words at the end of the film when he says "" i could have get more out. if i'd made more money..why did i keep the car? ten people right there. ten people. ten more people.""";14 March 2020;10;['evolutionary', 'oscar', 'social', 'certain', 'main', 'jewish', 'austrian', 'several', 'jewish', 'jewish', 'bloody', 'terrifying', 'lucky', 'alive', 'rich', 'jewish', 'privileged', 'jewish', 'abnormal', 'abnormal', 'powerful', 'key', 'humane', 'humane', 'subjective', 'humane', 'jewish', 'normal', 'humane', 'particular', 'more', 'more', 'more'];0.0699675324675324

1483;harrisbrettj;"schindler's list is a film that shows self-reflection and change are important. the main character, oskar schindler who is played by famed actor liam neeson, setting up a factory in nazi germany. in the begging of the film we, as an audience, see oskar behave in a very selfish and self-serving way. in the first scene where oskar is at the party, he is very confident and walks into a room full of people he does not know in order to obtain what he needs. throughout the film we see oskar use the nazi's control of the jewish people to make the most profit possible. in the next couple of scenes, the viewer gets the sense that oskar is starting to think less and less about his profits. this is shown especially well in the scene where the ghettos are being evacuated and oskar is overlooking the whole thing. you can see the change in his expression when he notices the small girl in a red coat. this is the first instance of color being used in the entire film. it is quite clearly used to show a moment of significance for oskar and his self-reflection. when the shot is cut to oskar's face you can see the smile fade away as the girl in red runs around in the chaos of the ghetto cleaning. another example of color being used to show times of self-reflection is during the mass burial and burning. the child in the red coat is seen in a gurney or wheelbarrow. this is a huge moment in schindler's character development. he is finally aware of everything going on in these camps. i believe this is almost a direct reason he chooses to ""buy"" all of his workers in the end. another technique used by the director, steven spielberg, to show self-reflection is juxtaposition. in the scene where the jewish people are moved from their nice expensive homes to the ghetto for the first time. schindler is laying in a nice expensive bed saying ""it could not be better"" versus the jews in their new home saying ""it could be worse"". this shows the selfish side of oskar that we saw in the first couple of scenes which gives him room for development. in the same scene where schindler sees the girl in the red coat for the first time. first, we see the chaos of loud german soldiers breaking down entire blocks of housing. then a direct cut to oskar riding his horse through the countryside with his significant other. two polar opposites in terms of mood and energy. when schindler sees what is happening, he obviously has second thoughts on what he is doing but not enough to change. with juxtaposition and use of color spielberg shows us that self-reflection leading to change is possible and important for everyone.";21 March 2021;8;['important', 'main', 'famed', 'selfish', 'first', 'confident', 'full', 'jewish', 'most', 'possible', 'next', 'whole', 'small', 'red', 'first', 'entire', 'red', 'ghetto', 'mass', 'red', 'huge', 'aware', 'direct', 'jewish', 'nice', 'expensive', 'first', 'nice', 'expensive', 'well', 'new', 'bad', 'selfish', 'first', 'same', 'red', 'first', 'loud', 'german', 'entire', 'direct', 'significant', 'other', 'polar', 'second', 'enough', 'possible', 'important'];0.0743112947658402

1489;saadatjoomajid;"there have been numerous documentaries and dramatic productions focusing on the holocaust, including a television mini-series which many consider to be the definitive work. as a result, in deciding to film schindler's list, director steven spielberg (jurassic park) set an imposing task for himself. his vision needed to differ from that of the film makers who preceded him, yet the finished product had to remain faithful to the unforgettable images which represent the legacy of six million massacred jews. those who see this motion picture will witness spielberg's success. the film opens in september of 1939 in krakow, poland, with the jewish community under increasing pressure from the nazis. into this tumult comes oskar schindler (liam neeson), a nazi businessman interested in obtaining jewish backing for a factory he wishes to build. he makes contact with itzhak stern (ben kingsley), an accountant, to arrange financial matters. for a while, there is no interest and nothing happens. march 1941. the krakow jewish community has been forced to live in ""the ghetto"", where money no longer has any meaning. several elders agree to invest in schindler's factory and the def (deutsche emailwarenfabrik) is born - a place where large quantities of pots are manufactured. to do the work, schindler hires jews (because they're cheaper than poles), and the german army becomes his biggest customer. march 1943. germany's intentions towards the jews are no longer a secret. the ghetto is ""liquidated"", with the survivors being herded into the plaszow forced labor camp. many are executed, and still others are shipped away by train, never to return. during this time, schindler has managed to ingratiate himself with the local commander, amon goeth (ralph fiennes), a nazi who kills jews for sport. using his relationship with goeth, schindler begins to secretly campaign to help the jews, saving men, women, and children from certain death. spielberg elected to film this motion picture in black-and-white, and it's impossible to argue with his choice. director of photography janusz kaminski has made effective use of shadow and light, meticulously limiting the application of hue. the opening scene is in color, as is the closing sequence (which features the surviving ""schindler jews"", each accompanied by the actor who played their character, placing a stone on their savior's grave). there are also two instances when color is allowed to bleed into the blacks, whites, and grays. one little girl's jacket appears red so that she stands out from the masses, and a pair of candles burn with orange flames. when color is used, it makes a point and an impression. schindler's list gives us three major stories and a host of minor ones. first and foremost, it tells the tale of the holocaust, presenting new images of old horrors. these are as ghastly and realistic as anything previously filmed, and spielberg emphasizes the brutality of the situation by not pulling punches when it comes to gore. the blood, inky rather than crimson in stark black-and-white, fountains when men and women are shot in the head or through the neck. the second story is that of oskar schindler, the nazi businessman who saved 1200 jews from death. schindler starts out as a self-centered manufacturer, concerned only about making money. he hires jews because they're cheap, not because he likes them. but his perspective changes, and he risks losing everything to save as many lives as he can. his eventual lament that he couldn't save more is heartbreaking. the third story belongs to amon goeth, the nazi commander of krakow, a man who teeters on the brink of madness. despite his intense hatred for jews, he is inexplicably attracted to his jewish housekeeper, helen hirsch (embeth davidtz). disgusted by his feelings, he lashes out at her with a display of violence that is almost scorsese-like in its blunt presentation. as written, goeth could easily have become a conscienceless monster, but spielberg works carefully to show unexpected depth and complexity to his character. often, the experiences of the minor characters provide the most lasting images. helen's story is memorable, as is the plight of young danka dresner and her mother as they strive to avoid death while staying together. there's a jewish couple that marries in the plaszow camp, even though their chances of survival are dim, and a rabbi who survives a close encounter with a nazi gun. of course the holocaust images are grim, but scenes of mass graves and exhumed bodies are not unique to schindler's list. while it's impossible to deny their power, potentially more distubing are the instances of callous, individual murder. spielberg doesn't spare his audience when it comes to sudden violence or the dehumanizing factors involved in such events. after all, jews were viewed as ""vermin."" schindler's list is replete with moments like this. the acting is uniformly excellent. liam neeson's schindler is shown in all his complexity, and his transformation is played with studied control. this is no sudden reversal of philosophy, but a matter of conscience that slowly dawns on the man. with a keen sense of schindler's character, neeson depicts the metamorphosis from self-centered businessman to driven messiah. ben kingsley, whose gandhi transfixed audiences years ago, has the movie's most understated role -- one that he acts with simple sincerity. equally as impressive is embeth davidtz, who snares the viewer's attention during her limited screen time as helen hirsch, the object of amon goeth's twisted affection. speaking of goeth, ralph fiennes stuns with his intricate, savage portrayal of the nazi commander, a man fascinated by power and murder. fiennes' goeth has the rare ability to both mesmerize and repulse, and this is a performance that will long be remembered. despite the grisly subject matter, this movie is essentially about uncovering a kernel of hope and dignity in the midst of a monstrous tragedy. the story of oskar schindler's sacrifices for the jews sets this apart from other holocaust dramas. uncompromising in its portrayal of good, evil, and all the shades in between, schindler's list offers a clear view of human nature laid bare: hatred, greed, lust, envy, anger, and, most important of all, empathy and love. because this film touches us so deeply, the catharsis has a power that few -- if any -- other moments in film history can match. and that's what establishes this as a transcendent motion picture experience. reelviews movie.";19 May 2021;10;['numerous', 'dramatic', 'many', 'definitive', 'finished', 'faithful', 'unforgettable', 'jewish', 'interested', 'jewish',

1490;shashanc;"without a shadow of a doubt, schindler's list is the finest film spielberghas ever made; it is also, comfortably, the most important and is a movie everybody should make an effort to see, not just because of it's quality as a film but because of the message it carries with it. everyone must surely now know the basis of the film - war profiteer oskarschindler, a nazi party member, works to save the lives of over a thousand jews during the holocaust, risking his own life in doing so. it is a story that, told incorrectly, could have been overly sentimental or that could have failed to make the points it needed to make about the holocaust.instead, it is told so well, it transcends the boundaries of it's media and has become both a vital historical document, cataloging the terror of the nazis in a way everyone can understand, and a salient warning for our future. the strength of the film lies in the fact that it makes no attempt to preach to the person watching it. the primary characters are painted in shades of grey. schindler is a womanizer, a drinker, a profiteer who seemingly puts money before morals much of the time. he laughs and jokes with nazis, including the primary villain, plaszow commandant amon goeth,who himself is never presented as entirely evil. throughout, the viewer is presented with a document of the actions of the characters and left to make up their own mind. spielberg shot the film in black and white, often using hand-held cameras,to give it the appearance of a documentary, and it works. coupled with the realities of the characters, and the fact that spielberg neither draws back from the brutality of the nazis nor uses the script to preach about it, this gives the film ""the ring of truth"". one of the hardest things in film-making is to take the truth, make no major changes to it and then make it believable on the screen; here spielberg succeeds in this totally. the central performances in the movie are immense. liam neeson, ralphfiennes and ben kingsley give utterly convincing performances in the lead roles and the scenes where they appear with each other pin the film together and carefully chart the development of schindler's sympathies.they are the final link in a film that has no weaknesses. this is a dark film though - how could it be otherwise with it's subject matter? it is upsetting and deeply moving and anybody who watches can'help but be changed in some way. the emotional climax of the film, in auschwitz itself, is one of the most harrowing scenes ever put on celluloid. spielberg handles the ending wonderfully as well, avoiding cloying sentimentality but still managing to provide some hope after all the darkness that has come before. the final scene, involving some of the people schindler saved, is profoundly moving. if you haven't seen this film and are considering buying it, do so. quiteaside from the fact that this is one of the finest movies ever to come out of hollywood anyway, it also stands alongside books like 1984 and thegrapes of wrath, and films like the battle of algiers, as being""entertainment"" that is far more important than the genres which spawned them. the 2-disc set is beautifully packaged, and somehow this seems important for once. there is a deeply moving documentary included featuring interviews with survivors from schindler's list. the transfer of the film to dvd is excellent as well - clear, bright and smooth. the choice of starting point for the second part of the film on the second dvd is also well made and poignant. for those who wish to further their knowledge of history's darkest hour,the best starting place is martin gilbert's book the holocaust. alsorecommended are primo levi's books if this is a man, the sixth day and ifnot now, when; roman polanski's film the pianist and, in music, gorecki's3rd symphony and shostakovich's babi yar. equally important is another martin gilbert book, the righteous, which catalogers the actions of some of the 17,000 other people so far recognized by the council of yad vashemin israel as righteous people who risked their lives to save jews during the holocaust. all these works help further tolerance and understanding,as does schindler's list and that, surely, is the film's greatest credit and testimony.";5 February 2007;10;['fine', 'important', 'own', 'sentimental', 'vital', 'historical', 'salient', 'primary', 'much', 'primary', 'commandant', 'evil', 'own', 'black', 'white', 'hard', 'major', 'believable', 'central', 'immense', 'convincing', 'other', 'final', 'dark', 'subject', 'emotional', 'harrowing', 'final', 'fine', 'important', 'important', 'excellent', 'clear', 'bright', 'smooth', 'second', 'second', 'poignant', 'dark', 'good', 'primo', 'sixth', 'roman', 'important', 'righteous', 'other', 'righteous', 'further', 'great'];0.1717708333333333

1502;buzoncontacto;"it is quite an intriguing thing how people react to this movie, judging by imdb comments: either they label it ""masterpiece"" or ""a sappy, manipulative banalization of the holocaust"". either 1 or 10 score. i can't understand it. to me, schindler's list has both merits and flaws. it is a technically perfect film, for example. i think no director can beat spielberg on that. he is able to film such an overwhelming, astonishing scene as the warsaw ghetto raid and simply...well, simply make you buy it. he can offer you a conventional scene, like that jewish fugitive trying to deceive his nazi chasers, and provide you a glimpse of his terror so intense that you can even feel it. no other director that i am aware of is able to take advantage of modern technology in a way even remotely close to spielberg. no one else has the power to offer us wonders, to leave you speechless, to make the unbelievable believable. he did it in schindler's list, then in prince of egypt, then in private ryan (perhaps the most amazing visual experience in my life). even munich shrinks your guts in the shooting scenes. unfortunately for spielberg, though, there is more in movies than technical ability. the man has a knack for sappiness, for easy morals. now come on, a movie about the holocaust, focusing on the jews? yet one more mouthful of the same porridge that we have been spoon-fed for decades? and then ""la amistad"", a film intended to teach that slavery is wrong? private ryan, which focuses on how heroic american soldiers were during wwii, support our troops and honor the vets? not exactly controversial matters, i am afraid. to make things worse, spielberg doesn't make the least attempt to blur the simplistic premise. his germans are devils, his victims (jews, black slaves) are pure, noble and innocent all along and without exception. and critics are right: he is too sentimental, too sappy. it grows just awkward, in some extreme cases (i have in mind a couple scenes from private ryan, right now). and then there is the annoying (to me, at least) political undertones of his films. in schindler's list, for example, the final scene is very revealing. the jews escape the factory and meet a soviet soldier. ""what can we do"" ""if i were you, i wouldn't go east. they don't like you there. neither i would go west"". next scene: we see all the survivors in modern israel. get it? israel is the shelter of jews against the intolerance of...well, of everyone else, east and west alike. it would be enough to show that some jews became traitors and betrayed his ilk, it would suffice to show that many interns (millions) in the camps were not jews, it would make the film much more complex and deeper if we were offered some hint that, well, camps were run in a good measure by the interns themselves, the kapos, who could be as ruthless as the ss. in fact, we are not even allowed to understand that the 30s and 40s were a time of strong political commitment and that many of those jews were socialists or communists, and that they often created support nets inside the very camps. does mr. spielberg fear we would fail to sympathized with the victims if we understood that they were three-dimensional human beings? does he really regard his viewers that dumb?";27 July 2007;7;['intriguing', 'sappy', 'manipulative', 'perfect', 'able', 'overwhelming', 'astonishing', 'conventional', 'jewish', 'intense', 'other', 'aware', 'able', 'modern', 'close', 'unbelievable', 'private', 'amazing', 'visual', 'more', 'technical', 'easy', 'mouthful', 'same', 'wrong', 'private', 'heroic', 'american', 'controversial', 'afraid', 'bad', 'least', 'simplistic', 'black', 'pure', 'noble', 'innocent', 'right', 'sentimental', 'sappy', 'awkward', 'extreme', 'private', 'annoying', 'least', 'political', 'final', 'revealing', 'soviet', 'next', 'modern', 'enough', 'many', 'complex', 'deep', 'good', 'ruthless', 'strong', 'political', 'many', 'very', 'dimensional', 'human', 'dumb'];0.0684311224489796

1508;ebsable-1;"i think the strength of schindler's list comes from its illustration of how the value of jewish life to oskar schindler changed throughout the movie, and steven spielberg's way of channeling most of the horror of the holocaust we see in terms of oskar schindler's reaction to it. schindler starts out as a relatively greedy man, in search of money. it seems that he will stop at nothing to make it, and mistreat any jewish or polish person in his quest for it. he opens a factory producing ""pots and pans"", choosing jewish workers because they cost the least of any on the market. he sees jewish people only as items of his factory, and ultimately there simply for his profit. there is a one-armed man working for oskar schindler. he is executed by nazi soldiers because they see no practical use for him. we see him shot in the back of the head. parallel to this, schindler is talking to an official about it, complaining, and the dialogue is constant, but the scene continues to alternate between schindler and the official, and the dead jewish man. we see a close up of the man lying on his back, his blood soaking into the snow, while schindler talks of the loss of the man in terms of the money it will cost him. schindler continues to have this outlook, while stern, his accountant, is secretly recruiting jews from krakow ghetto who are inevitably going to be killed to schindler's factory, knowing their lives will be spared. schindler realizes this, and becomes angry at stern for doing this. although he is angry, there is some indication that his views are changing because he makes it evident to stern that he is angry because he is afraid german officials will find out it is happening. there is a turning point for oskar schindler that occurs when he overlooks the liquidation of the krakow ghetto. he witnesses first hand the cruelty, and inhumane acts his country is carrying out. here is also the most brilliant idea i have ever witnessed a movie use, and that is having the coat of one little girl in the ghetto be in color. in the midst of all the chaos ensuing around the ghetto, we see a red object moving around, and realize it is the coat of a little girl, who's parents have probably either been killed or taken away, and she is trying to find a place to go. schindler spot her as well, and she disappears from sight into a building. though he doesn't, we see her hide under a bed in the upstairs portion of a home. the next shot is the look on schindler's face, and we get a sense of his character change. the following portion of the movie revolves around horrific, true events that occur. a powerful strategy of schindler's list is to show unblinkingly some of the inhumane acts done by the nazis on the jewish people, and to use this violence in a way that will help contribute to a world-wide assurance that events like those during the holocaust will never happen again. though they are hard to watch, they serve an incredibly purpose, and are justified in their presence in the movie. there is a scene called ""make me a hinge"", where we see a man about to be executed for not making hinges at a pace that is satisfactory. amon goeth, the main nazi military leader in the movie, is about to execute him by shooting him in the head when the gun jams, probably because of the cold weather, and does not fire. he tries another gun, but it too does not work. the life of the man is spared, only because the guns will not fire. this is the difference between life and death for the man; a simple annoyance to the nazis. schindler continues to gradually jews as people, and to value their lives, and is growing increasingly sympathetic toward them. now, as all of the jews around are about to be shipped to concentration camps, it is apparent to him that he has an opportunity to save some of them. now the tables have turned, and schindler begins to spend money in order to save the lives of jews, by buying them from nazi officials, and bribing others as well. in the start of the movie, schindler saw the loss of a jewish life as a waste of money. now, he is wasting all his money in order to prevent as many jewish deaths as he possibly can. what happens for the remainder of the movie is a miraculous true story of the survival of more than 1,100 jews because of oskar schindler's brave, self bankrupting actions. when the war ends, he is forced to flee because he is technically a criminal, buy the allies' standards. there are two images in schindler's list that i will never forget. the first is seeing the little girl in red later in the movie, as her dead body is being hauled away to be burned, her coat still illuminated on the screen in bright red. the second is when schindler's car is driving away from his factory at the end of the movie. there is a shot where we see his reflection in the window. out the window, we see jews lined on the side of the road, passing by, all alive because of him. steven spielberg refused to receive any kind of payment for directing schindler's list. with the funds from it, he helped found one of the largest memorial foundations today, the shoah foundation, to preserve the memory of the millions who died during the holocaust. there is not a movie that i consider to be more important than schindler's list, nor is there a director who i consider to be more honorable than steven spielberg.";17 February 2008;10;['jewish', 'most', 'greedy', 'jewish', 'polish', 'jewish', 'least', 'jewish', 'armed', 'practical', 'parallel', 'constant', 'dead', 'jewish', 'stern', 'angry', 'angry', 'evident', 'angry', 'afraid', 'german', 'inhumane', 'brilliant', 'little', 'red', 'little', 'upstairs', 'next', 'horrific', 'true', 'powerful', 'inhumane', 'jewish', 'wide', 'hard', 'about', 'satisfactory', 'main', 'about', 'cold', 'simple', 'sympathetic', 'about', 'apparent', 'jewish', 'many', 'jewish', 'miraculous', 'true', 'more', 'brave', 'first', 'little', 'dead', 'bright', 'second', 'alive', 'large', 'memorial', 'important', 'honorable'];-0.0067336309523809

1535;hazrry;a masterpiece. that is how i would describe schindler's list in a few words. schindler's list is based on the real life story of oskar schindler (liam neeson). of course when we think of a film based on a real life we usually think that it is just a ploy to gain people's attention, but this film really does bring real events back to us such as the horrors of the nazi death camp at auschwitz and the how people like amon goeth (ralph fiennes) would indiscriminately kill men, women and children just because they are jews. steven spielberg came at this film with the right respect and didn't even receive a salary to direct citing that it would be 'blood money'. he choose to make it as realistic as possible not leaving out a single crying child, a single drop of blood or a single horror anywhere. many parts of this film are difficult to watch, but if they weren't then this film wouldn't be a masterpiece. don't get me wrong though, this is not an action film but more of a thriller. to say that the music 'fits' into this film would be a crime. john williams's scores don't fit the film but make the film. if you wanted to get an oscar in a film you had made then all you would have to do is get williams to do the music for you, it wouldn't matter how bad the film was his music would make it come to life. also there is a mix of both diegetic and non-diegetic music like when the krakow ghetto is being liquidated a sad monotonous jewish song is being sang by children which is clearly non-diegetic as no singing could take place in the confusion and death of the ghetto and also shows what a horror the nazis were committing. the music then stops for a while as the nazis wait for the jews in hiding to come out and as the shooting starts a piece of diegetic music also starts which is in total contradiction to what is happening as it is jolly and 'bouncy'. the piece of music is by beethoven and is being played by a german soldier trying to escape the real world where all the death is happening. the direction is genius to say the least. this film shows just how good spielberg can be when he wants to be. it creates a very dark subtle humour which messes with your emotions. such as, going back to the liquidation scene, when the nazis soldiers are searching for hidden jews and they shine a light round the room and it reveals a cluster of them and they all raise their hands which brings a smile to your mouth until you realise in horror that those jews would die and you had found it funny. he also builds expectations that make you think one thing is going to happen and then he makes another thing happen instead. an example of this is the day when goeth tries to take schindler's advice on power is when you have every right to kill but don't. the first thing that happens is that goeth saddle is on the floor and you expect him to shot the guy looking after the horse but he doesn't. after he comes back from horse riding, the jew who is supposed to be cleaning his bath reports that it couldn't be cleaned. now you think he won't kill him because he's on a good day and at first the film goes along with that but then as the jew is walking away a bullet hits the ground at his feet. this makes you think that he is going to kill him but then he misses again and you think he is just playing with him changing your emotions again, and the final bullet hits him in the back of the head killing him instantly. fiennes plays goeth beautifully here and in the rest of the film but in this particular scene he makes the warped personality come out extremely well in because goeth had no reason to kill the jew and had just 'pardoned' him and yet after he touches the mirror and his nail gets chipped which makes him kill the jew. spielberg also gets an excellent performance out of liam neeson portraying him as the bad guy in the beginning before bringing in goeth who is a character so bad he makes anyone look good. this is neeson's greatest performance by far. spielberg also uses the popular genre of neeson's characters as a mentor to great effect getting him to comfort the jews with opaque realism and develop his own character into someone we can emphasize with and makes us think what we would do in the same situation. the script is an amazing piece of work. the plot doesn't lose a single second of interest in it's over 3 hour running time. this is a feat in itself but then it doesn't just keep your interest but holds itself in your memory forever. whenever you see that it is being shown on tv you plan to watch it days before it's on and then make sure nothing will interrupt you in that entire time. each time you watch it you find something you didn't notice before and you can never watch it to many times. the script paints the background of the victoria falls in a master piece and leaves the foreground for spielberg to paint the butterfly. perfection is not something that easily comes to humans and is something only really found in the night's sky, the largest rainforests and the deepest oceans. it eludes us like a frightened cat and speeds past us like a rocket. this film has not achieved perfection but as the spice train past by it grabbed a handful of perfect and is seasoned all over with it.;24 February 2008;10;['few', 'real', 'real', 'real', 'such', 'ralph', 'right', 'direct',

1546;hayden65;i first saw schindler's list in my r.studies class but since it runs for 195 minutes or round abouts, and my r.studies classes only went on for 60 minutes, i could not watch the whole film but within the first 60 minutes you see the main character of the film, oskar schindler, a real man who actually did most of the things as depicted in this film. so after about 2 years of first seeing the film my brother purchased the dvd schindler's list, the first day he had it and watched it. from the start you see a seemingly greedy and uncaring business man who cares only for money, he is also a member of the nazi party, the infamous political party ruling germany at that time led by none other than adolf hitler. nazi ideolgy stressed the greatness of the german people and race, they hated peoples such as jews, slavs, roma and homosexuals, jehovah's witnesses, the mentally or physically disabled, communists, liberals, and social democrats along with other ethnicities. so from the the moment you know schindler is a nazi the general reaction is that he is an unlikeable characters and and through common perception of nazi-ism, a cruel man. but his character shows not much of the sort, in the scene where he is dancing, laughing and drinking with friends you see him to be a joyous and fun man. throughout the film oskar schindlers character steadily changes from the greedy, uncaring nazi businessman to the selfless humanitarian who, in fact, lost everything to save his jewish workers ( now known as schindlers jews ). liam neeson portrays oskar schindler very well indeed and his acting in this film is testament to his overall success as an actor and is, in my opinion, his best film by far. i like how the character amon goeth played by ralph fiennes, is used to personify nazi idealism, nazi cruelty, bruttality and a complete lack of respect for human life and humanity itself with scenes such as the ones where he wakes up in the morning, picks up his sniper rifle and hunts down jews as if they are animals, as if its a sport and when he just point-blank shoots jewish men without remorse or mercy. on the whole, schindler's list is a powerful and emotional film which is testament to steven spielberg's directing skill and is a must see.;16 July 2008;9;['round', 'whole', 'first', 'main', 'real', 'most', 'first', 'greedy', 'infamous', 'political', 'other', 'german', 'such', 'disabled', 'social', 'other', 'general', 'unlikeable', 'common', 'cruel', 'much', 'joyous', 'fun', 'greedy', 'selfless', 'jewish', 'overall', 'good', 'ralph', 'complete', 'human', 'such', 'blank', 'jewish', 'powerful', 'emotional'];0.0293103448275862

1548;jon_hughes78;"schindler's list and saving private ryan share similar questions: in the former, how much money is a life worth; in the latter, how many lives is a life worth? very good questions, and spielberg ham-handedly beats a response out of us in each film. he employs two story-telling techniques, both to the utmost extreme: visceral sensationalism and morbid sentimentality. to turn the focus on the movie being reviewed - schindler's list uses a horror film approach to movie-making to keep us properly frightened and cowering in the corner. at some point it stops being about somber remembrance and turns into a gruesome series of predictions: he'll be shot - he's too overly sympathetic; he'll make it - he had too much screen time to be executed; she'll die - the violin telegraphs it... and so on. spielberg's greatest sin is that he underestimates his audience. we don't need to be bludgeoned into three minutes of silence. the atrocity was great, and sixty years later the wounds are still painful. all we need is to be simply ushered into a fresh realization of the holocaust - and schindler's story is a particularly poignant way to accomplish this. at some point during the movie schindler speaks of true power - the ability to pardon. yet spielberg drags this movie past the three hour mark, emotionally executing each and every viewer. my edit of this movie would have excised the sloppy and insincere sentimentality, and spared (pardoned) the audience so many streams of blood that the scenes lost any impact the victims' deaths might have contained. (not to mention, my edit wouldn't try so hard to convince that all women in wwii slept topless!) i also fault the movie for setting schindler up as jesus christ (we're bought with a price!). i'm still trying to decide if spielberg wants to insult or convert the jews he is sympathizing with. after schindler dropped his cross... er, ring in the sand i half expected him to be crucified for war crimes. i give the film credit for a tremendously impacting ending. we see, and can truly honor for enduring hell, the jews whom schindler saved. for a properly restrained and truly honoring treatment of the topic of the jews during wwii, watch episode 9 of band of brothers. thanks for that anyways, steven.";27 October 2007;4;['private', 'similar', 'former', 'much', 'worth', 'latter', 'many', 'worth', 'good', 'utmost', 'visceral', 'morbid', 'frightened', 'somber', 'gruesome', 'sympathetic', 'much', 'great', 'great', 'painful', 'fresh', 'poignant', 'true', 'sloppy', 'insincere', 'many', 'impacting', 'restrained'];0.1629629629629629

1550;gowrikanth-1;a close friend of mine had recommended this movie to me. for long i did not watch it thinking it was just another movie with a 'war' theme. when i eventually watched it, i was kicking myself that a movie buff like me took so long. schindler's list is based on the 'holocaust' era where jews were hated and brutally killed in nazi regime. the movie begins with the relocation of jews from the neighboring areas to ghettos just after world war has commenced. in parallel, we see oskar schindler, a german businessman (and a womanizer) trying to cash in on opportunity to make profits. he hires an accountant itzhak stern and uses his skills to expand. during the course he also befriends ss lieutenant amon goeth who is responsible for overseeing the krakow ghetto. during the course of amon's governance we witness the brutal killings of jews. specially we get to see how the nazis selected their jewish work force (retaining skilled laborers and murdering old/unhealthy ones). this is the point where schindler decides to splurge his fortune to save the jews. the rest of the movie shows on how he goes about accomplishing this. performances are top notch. liam neeson as schindler is natural and brilliant. the scene in the end where he makes a speech and eventually breaks down is touching. amon goeth as the ruthless lieutenant is equally good. i was a little surprised that neither of them won an academy for the efforts. the supporting cost is headed by the ever dependable ben kingsley. technically the movie scores on several grounds. shooting the movie in b&w makes it chilling especially the scenes in ghetto. along with the (haunting) background score, some of the scenes stay in your mind forever. above all, the real star is the genius steven spielberg. towards the end of the movie, ben kingsley tells schindler 'the pages with names is life'. that is what this movie is about. it is about humanity and it has no boundaries. ***whoever saves one life saves the world entire***;24 February 2012;10;['close', 'german', 'responsible', 'brutal', 'jewish', 'skilled', 'old', 'unhealthy', 'top', 'notch', 'liam', 'natural', 'brilliant', 'ruthless', 'good', 'little', 'surprised', 'dependable', 'several', 'real'];0.0523437499999999

1554;ViddyG;"after many a year producing films of high entertainment, but lesser intellectual class, steven spielberg finally created a true masterpiece of our time. consistently overlooked for oscars for his previous films, the academy had no choice but to pour glittering praise over this cinematic adaptation of thomas keneally's best-selling book. i will not go into the details of the story as this should be imprinted into the mind by the images of the film itself. rather, i would like to make special commentary on the direction of spielberg, the screenplay of steven zaillian and the excellent cinematography by janusz kaminski. the controversial decision to film in black and white must also be specially commended, as it adds to the atmosphere of the film greatly. the thing which sets the film apart from any i have seen before or since, however, is in the quality of acting. in parts, you lose the fact that it is only a film, and not a live-action documentary. of particular note is the exceptional british acting trio of liam neeson (oskar schindler), ben kingsley (itzakh stern) and ralph fiennes (untersturmfuhrer amon goeth). although the performances by the first two were magnificent, i do not believe i have ever seen an acting performance to rival that of fiennes in his role as the komandant. it is all the more remarkable considering that this was his first role in a major film, having being plucked out of relative obscurity by spielberg having seen his performance in the television movie ""a dangerous man: lawrence after arabia"" the previous year. it was an absolute travesty that none of these acting performances were rewarded with an academy award, showing the oscars for the shambles that they really are. i would like to end by making the point that i have never been left so astounded by any film as schindler's list. some may say that it is part of the propaganda machine that spielberg has also used in other films, such as saving private ryan, and there may be some truth to this. however the simple truth is that this film depicts life during the holocaust as closely as we could imagine it sixty years on. humanity would learn a great deal if our young were taught about the mistakes of the past, and films such as this should be a part of the educational curriculum in every country in the world (as is the case in countries such as great britain and new zealand, where schindler's list is a mandatory part of every 15 year old's history lessons). finally, if i were to find one fault with the film, it would be the final credit of the film - ""dedicated to the six million jews who died in the holocaust"". spielberg seems to have conveniently forgotten the five million gypsies, physically handicapped, mentally handicapped etc. who were also murdered by hitler's death squads. i believe the film should be dedicated to these people also, truly reflecting the thankfulness we should all have for a world in which nazism did not prevail.";11 December 2002;10;['many', 'high', 'less', 'intellectual', 'true', 'previous', 'cinematic', 'special', 'excellent', 'controversial', 'black', 'white', 'live', 'particular', 'exceptional', 'british', 'ralph', 'first', 'magnificent', 'remarkable', 'first', 'major', 'relative', 'dangerous', 'previous', 'absolute', 'astounded', 'other', 'such', 'private', 'simple', 'great', 'young', 'such', 'educational', 'such', 'great', 'mandatory', 'final', 'dedicated'];0.2016020322270322

(how ironic that only recently polanski was justly honored for his great work for directing the pianist, which i think is the best film since titanic). i can understand why there is a continual debate about the significance of this film, but it cannot be denied that it is a necessary work of art and a very valuable history lesson, particularly now that we are once again a nation at war with anti-semitic totalitarianism. i support anyone's right to free speech, but i am truly appalled that many americans want to deny that there was even a holocaust, or wish to forget what happened in the past, and find personal satisfaction in condemning this movie as overrated or mere jewish propaganda to downplay any other horrific crimes committed by other nations in times of war throughout history. i was not at all surprised when titanic became such a huge hit (the biggest in fact since gone with the wind) that even schoolchildren began doing book reports on the subject and the entire movie-going planet seemed to erupt in titanicmania. common sense will tell anyone willing to take the time to think about it that the holocaust was the titanic at least five thousand times over, and to be honest, i would rather drown in freezing ocean water two miles deep in the dead of night than face death in the gas chambers of auschwitz. i still think it was ridiculous that james cameron asked for a moment of silence for the victims of history's most celebrated shipwreck at the end of his oscar acceptance speech, when steven spielberg merely (and politely) asked that the nation's schoolteachers ""please teach this in your schools"" when he was so honored for making a film about the most ghastly crimes of the millennium. there is a huge difference between escapist entertainment and serious enlightenment when it comes to movie making. just ask steven spielberg, who has also directed some of the biggest blockbusters ever made. his heart's desire is clearly the driving force behind all of his films; schindler's list most of all.";6 April 2003;9;['first', 'favorite', 'great', 'delighted', 'great', 'last', 'top', 'great', 'more', 'poetic', 'good', 'good', 'special', 'top', 'liam', 'ralph', 'black', 'white', 'effective', 'roman', 'ironic', 'polanski', 'great', 'good', 'titanic', 'continual', 'necessary', 'valuable', 'anti', 'semitic', 'right', 'appalled', 'many', 'personal', 'overrated', 'mere', 'jewish', 'other', 'horrific', 'other', 'surprised', 'titanic', 'huge', 'big', 'entire', 'common', 'willing', 'titanic', 'honest', 'ridiculous', 'celebrated', 'oscar', 'honored', 'ghastly', 'huge', 'serious', 'big', 'most'];0.2205703211517164

1575;vickyscr2007;schindler's list is a 1993 american epic historical drama film directed and co-produced by steven spielberg and scripted by steven zaillian. it is based on the novel schindler's ark by thomas keneally, an australian novelist. the film is based on the life of oskar schindler, a german businessman who saved the lives of more than a thousand mostly polish-jewish refugees during the holocaust by employing them in his factories. it stars liam neeson as schindler, ralph fiennes as schutzstaffel (ss) officer amon goeth, and ben kingsley as schindler's jewish accountant itzhak stern. ideas for a film about the schindlerjuden (schindler jews) were proposed as early as 1963. poldek pfefferberg, one of the schindlerjuden, made it his life's mission to tell the story of schindler. spielberg became interested in the story when executive sid sheinberg sent him a book review of schindler's ark. universal studios bought the rights to the novel, but spielberg, unsure if he was ready to make a film about the holocaust, tried to pass the project to several other directors before finally deciding to direct the film himself. principal photography took place in krakow, poland, over the course of 72 days in 1993. spielberg shot the film in black and white and approached it as a documentary. cinematographer janusz kaminski wanted to give the film a sense of timelessness. john williams composed the score, and violinist itzhak perlman performs the film's main theme. schindler's list premiered on november 30, 1993, in washington, d.c. and it was released on december 15, 1993, in the united states. often listed among the greatest films ever made,[4][5][6] it was also a box office success, earning $321.2 million worldwide on a $22 million budget. it was the recipient of seven academy awards (out of twelve nominations), including best picture, best director, best adapted screenplay, and best original score, as well as numerous other awards (including seven baftas and three golden globes). in 2007, the american film institute ranked the film 8th on its list of the 100 best american films of all time. the library of congress selected it for preservation in the national film registry in 2004.;5 December 2014;9;['american', 'epic', 'historical', 'novel', 'australian', 'german', 'more', 'polish', 'jewish', 'liam', 'ralph', 'jewish', 'interested', 'executive', 'sid', 'universal', 'ready', 'several', 'other', 'principal', 'black', 'white', 'violinist', 'main', 'great', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'original', 'numerous', 'other', 'golden', 'good', 'american', 'national'];0.2138888888888889

1582;narcissadoll;"i rented this movie not knowing quite what i'd be getting into, and was rewarded quite pleasantly -- i'm aware it's not the most historically accurate of films, but it is quality. the screenplay, cinematography, and acting bring a sort of grace to the film that wouldn't be evident otherwise. the chiefly black-and-white film with only the coloured accent of a girl's red coat may seem unnecessarily artsy, but i like artsy. it's a matter of opinion. schindler's list is a depressingly beautiful film that stirs up some kind of emotion in everyone (even if that emotion happens to be hate) -- one of those films that's either loved or hated. ralph fiennes's portrayal of amon goeth alone makes the movie worth watching time and time again. schindler and stern, the ""saints"" of the film, sort of fall into the shadows when goeth is on-screen -- the man has presence. even out of uniform, when he walks into the room one thinks ""this is the commandant"". fiennes's acting skills are unrivaled, owing to an amazingly three-dimensional character who has style, presence, and is smoulderingly attractive in that well-groomed sort of way. it's clear that goeth's character is a sadistic nazi officer -- however, spielberg and the script-writers (as well as fiennes himself) shy away from the ""big bad heartless goon"" stereotype -- in fact, the very first scenes in which he appear make him seem rather petulant and whinging. he barely listens to hujar's rundown of the basics of plaszow, instead complaining, ""that's not a villa. that's a house!"" throughout the film, he proves himself to be quite the character -- a cruel sadist, but not exactly brutal -- the way he conducts himself holds too much style and arrogance to be considered barbaric. a man who, from the mouth of schindler himself, ""loves good food, good wine, the ladies, making money -- and killing."" he smokes, he drinks, he sleeps around, he's a nazi officer who kills people for work and for fun, oh, and on top of that he's capable of real love. despite goeth's sadism, the crew still persists to nudge the character shy of the ""inhuman"" stereotype with, among other things, his love for helen hirsch and the fact that instead of letting it redeem him, he denies it, even hurts her. he's amazingly 3d -- a second, third, fourth look at the film will only pronounce it further. in my opinion, the ""i pardon you"" plot arc was by far the best addition to the film. one knew it was over when we saw goeth's tainted hand poke the gun out the window -- unlike schindler, goeth isn't pointlessly redeemed by one scene. in fact, he dies loyal to hitler's cause, and clings to his life to the point where the crate has to be *manually broken in half* by two officers. goeth and his amazing portrayal are by far the best aspect of the movie. even if i found the rest horrible (which i certainly didn't!), i'd watch it time and again simply for that. he was cheated out of an oscar. oh, and ralph fiennes has lovely hands. 10/10.";14 September 2003;10;['aware', 'accurate', 'evident', 'black', 'white', 'red', 'artsy', 'artsy', 'beautiful', 'ralph', 'worth', 'unrivaled', 'dimensional', 'attractive', 'clear', 'sadistic', 'big', 'bad', 'heartless', 'first', 'petulant', 'cruel', 'brutal', 'much', 'barbaric', 'good', 'good', 'capable', 'real', 'shy', 'inhuman', 'other', 'helen', 'second', 'third', 'fourth', 'good', 'loyal', 'amazing', 'good', 'horrible', 'ralph', 'lovely'];0.1072222222222222

1596;alina_bav;schindler's list is a 1993 american epic historical drama film directed and co-produced by steven spielberg and scripted by steven zaillian. it is based on the novel schindler's ark by thomas keneally, an australian novelist. the film is based on the life of oskar schindler, a german businessman who saved the lives of more than a thousand mostly polish-jewish refugees during the holocaust by employing them in his factories. it stars liam neeson as schindler, ralph fiennes as schutzstaffel (ss) officer amon goeth, and ben kingsley as schindler's jewish accountant itzhak stern. ideas for a film about the schindlerjuden (schindler jews) were proposed as early as 1963. poldek pfefferberg, one of the schindlerjuden, made it his life's mission to tell the story of schindler. spielberg became interested in the story when executive sid sheinberg sent him a book review of schindler's ark. universal studios bought the rights to the novel, but spielberg, unsure if he was ready to make a film about the holocaust, tried to pass the project to several other directors before finally deciding to direct the film himself. principal photography took place in krakow, poland, over the course of 72 days in 1993. spielberg shot the film in black and white and approached it like a documentary. cinematographer janusz kaminski wanted to give the film a sense of timelessness. john williams composed the score, and violinist itzhak perlman performs the film's main theme. schindler's list premiered on november 30, 1993, in washington, d.c. and it was released on december 15, 1993, in the united states. regarded as one of the greatest films ever made, it was also a box office success, earning $321.2 million worldwide on a $22 million budget ($35.6 million in 2014 dollars). it was the recipient of seven academy awards (out of twelve nominations), including best picture, best director, best adapted screenplay, and best original score, as well as numerous other awards (including seven baftas and three golden globes). in 2007, the american film institute ranked the film 8th on its list of the 100 best american films of all time. the library of congress selected it for preservation in the national film registry in 2004.;19 January 2014;10;['american', 'epic', 'historical', 'novel', 'australian', 'german', 'more', 'polish', 'jewish', 'liam', 'ralph', 'jewish', 'interested', 'executive', 'sid', 'universal', 'ready', 'several', 'other', 'principal', 'black', 'white', 'violinist', 'main', 'great', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'original', 'numerous', 'other', 'golden', 'good', 'american', 'national'];0.2138888888888889

1624;jellybean1129;"i have never come across a film that had as a profound and lasting effect on me. this film is perfect in so many ways. it truly depicts the terrible nature of the holocaust and one of mankind's darkest hours very beautifully. the film starts out by showing us oskar schindler, a member of the nazi party who you would want to be friends with if you were alive at the time. he has money, connections, and charm. who wouldn't want to be on his good side? oskar is shown as a womanizing, egotistical, opportunist who is looking to make money off of cheap labor, aka the jews. if someone were to watch this movie before knowing anything about schindler and what he did, they might dislike him at first. however, he's also one of the few people in the movie who never despises the jews. he did not care about the fact that his accountant, itzhak stern, was jewish, even before he made the decision to save as many jewish people as he could. he doesn't hate them, but at the same time, he doesn't feel he owes them anything. as the movie moves forward, you gradually see schindler's change in attitude, brought on by his accidental witnessing of the ghetto liquidation. like many of us, his eyes follow a young girl in a red coat as she walks through the streets and runs into a building to safety. in my foolishness, i genuinely thought she had a chance at making it. seeing her rather gruesome looking body being carted off to be incinerated was extremely disturbing for me because of that. that is also the scene in which schindler really came to realize what a horrible regime this was. he looked horrified when he saw her body. soon after, he begins to develop his list, paving the way for the rest of the movie. there are so many moving scenes in this film. the ones that made me either want to cry or actually cry were the result of a build up of emotions from earlier in the film. for example, i can never hold in my emotion when schindler and his wife are about to flee the country. seeing him cry over the fact that he didn't give up even more and save just one more life really told me what this film was trying to get across; every human life is precious. the scene when each survivor and the actors who portrayed them put a rock on his grave also made me cry. when emilie schindler, his widow, came up to put it on his grave, she couldn't even reach it from her wheelchair, so the actress who played her did it for her. when she was being wheeled off, she looked back at his grave with an expression i can't even describe, like she wished she didn't have to leave her husband's grave, yet she also looked proud of what he had done. liam neeson's performance as oskar schindler was phenomenal. he used just the right amount of charm and emotion needed for this character. his natural charm shows through, making him even more perfect for this character. in him, i can sense schindler's confusion, doubt, and the obligation he feels to save 'his people'. his portrayal was oscar-worthy. my absolute favorite portrayal in the film was ralph fiennes as the brutal, real life ss officer amon goeth. to put it lightly, the man was a psychopath who murdered anyone he desired, usually just for the heck of it. it was extremely hard to watch him shooting people at point blank-range because they simply did a small thing to set off his violent temper. the creepy obsession he had with his his jewish maid, helen hirsch, made his character even more complex. he hates himself for feeling these things for a jew, so he takes it out on her by beating her brutally. it's hard to believe such a nightmarish character actually existed and did even more gruesome things than showed in the film. survivors on set found it difficult to be around fiennes because he reminded them so much of the real amon goeth. if you have not seen this film, please do, it will be worth it and if you truly understand what messages they're trying to convey, it will stay with you for a very long time.";16 March 2013;10;['profound', 'lasting', 'perfect', 'many', 'terrible', 'dark', 'alive', 'good', 'egotistical', 'cheap', 'few', 'jewish', 'many', 'jewish', 'same', 'accidental', 'ghetto', 'many', 'young', 'red', 'gruesome', 'disturbing', 'horrible', 'horrified', 'many', 'about', 'more', 'human', 'precious', 'proud', 'phenomenal', 'right', 'natural', 'perfect', 'oscar', 'worthy', 'absolute', 'favorite', 'ralph', 'real', 'hard', 'blank', 'small', 'violent', 'jewish', 'helen', 'complex', 'hard', 'nightmarish', 'gruesome', 'difficult', 'much', 'real', 'worth', 'long'];0.0482142857142857

1647;tanja-mahmoudkhan96;"review on schindler's list the highly emotional movie schindler's list (1993) is inspired by the novel ""schindler's ark"" by thomas keneally, that was based on real events. during world war ii oskar schindler saved 1,200 jews through the use of powerful nazi friends. holocaust survivor poldek pfefferberg was one of the jews that was saved by schindler and he inspired the keneally with his first hand experience of these events. the film, which is directed by the epic steven spielberg, has received seven oscars and is also rated seventh of all movies ever on the site imdb, which i think shows how great this movie truly is. schindler's list can be placed within the categories drama, history or biography. the movie is mainly focused on the character oskar schindler, played by liam neeson, a business man who hires jews because they are cheaper employers than other ones. in the beginning it is all about the money but after schindler gets to know some of the jews he eventually gets an entirely different goal for his business; to save his employees from hitler. i think this development of schindler is significant, not only for his employees but also himself. he evolves from caring about his own wealth and women to prioritizing other people and ultimately becoming a better person. another important character is amon goeth, played by ralph fiennes, a highly ranked nazi. i think the purpose of this movie is to elucidate and educate people on these horrendous events during world war ii. perhaps its meaning is to give us hope and show us that there will always be good hearted people. from watching this movie i think we can learn a lot about important parts of our history, but also about solidarity. i think it is important to be aware of how hard it must have been to save all those people and how great schindler truly was! in the movie you could see he had a lot of obstacles. one thing i really liked with the movie was that it was in black and white because it is really rare nowadays and it makes the movie unique. it also created an illusion that made the movie more realistic and, if possible, even more sad. an explanation spielberg gave to why the movie was in black and white was that all the documentaries he had seen about the holocaust were in black and white and that he wanted schindler's list to be in this documentary style so people could understand that the events in this movie were real. at the end of the movie you could see the real persons that schindler saved. they walked to schindler's grave and put a rose on it together with the actors/actresses that played them in the movie. i think this was a great ending of the movie to give the viewers some perspective and show them that the second world war did not happen that long ago. oscar schindler and this movie based on his great accomplishments shows us that one man can make a difference and that gives all of us a little hope in this cold hearted world of ours.";15 March 2015;10;['emotional', 'real', 'powerful', 'first', 'epic', 'seventh', 'great', 'cheap', 'other', 'different', 'significant', 'own', 'other', 'well', 'important', 'ralph', 'horrendous', 'good', 'hearted', 'important', 'important', 'aware', 'hard', 'great', 'black', 'white', 'rare', 'unique', 'realistic', 'possible', 'sad', 'black', 'white', 'black', 'white', 'real', 'real', 'great', 'second', 'great', 'little', 'cold', 'hearted'];0.1834558823529411

1649;Aidie-Palmer;"absolutely great film. very moving and definitely a must see. shot in black and white, with the odd carefully chosen touches in colour, the horror of the holocaust is laid bare and speaks for itself. the documentary style allows spielberg to deliver his message without preaching. the clever use of light and shade also makes it visually stunning. when oskar schindler visits a night club, he looks like a 1930s movie star as his cigarette smoke spirals above his head, his eyes hidden in the shade. it is the story of german businessman oskar schindler which captivates right to the end. he is transformed from physically imposing, charismatic philanderer to the humbled man, wishing he had saved more lives. you watch nervously as he tries to save over a thousand jews from almost certain death in concentration camps by getting them to work in his factory. he bribes officials and befriends nazis including evil camp commandant, goeth, played brilliantly by ralph fiennes. spielberg has cleverly juxtaposed goeth and schindler as two sides of the same coin. they both love the finer things in life, easily swayed by money and women. playing on this, schindler tries to show his contemporary that power can be better served by sparing people's lives rather than taking them. it is an idea that goeth acknowledges, but is destined not to adhere to for long. the film finishes on a powerful note in present day with the real schindler survivors and their descendants visiting his grave. it is the final reminder that this is a true story of one man's bravery and that in ""saving one life, you save the entire world"".";21 July 2013;8;['great', 'black', 'white', 'odd', 'bare', 'clever', 'stunning', 'german', 'charismatic', 'more', 'certain', 'evil', 'ralph', 'same', 'finer', 'long', 'powerful', 'present', 'real', 'final', 'true', 'entire'];0.1051378446115288
1650;aurora7459;"perfection. there are films, admittedly few, that transcend themselves. in fact, they transcend even the art of filmmaking. sometimes, these films are simply grand on a scale not before seen...films such as ""titanic"" and ""lotr"" may well qualify here...other times, these films achieve such utter perfection that they simply take on a life of their own...still other times, the films become a symbol of the times. these are the films that make the perfect statement at the perfect time in life. finally, there are films such as ""schindler's list."" films such as these, perhaps the most rare of all, are films that touch the soul of all humanity with a universal truth that is so profound and so vividly presented that it becomes an icon unto itself. ""schindler's list"" is, indeed, an icon of american cinema. steven spielberg's 1993 story of oskar schindler, a man whose greed, vanity and self-indulgence is somehow transformed during the nazi holocaust into a self-sacrificing, humanitarian existence saving the lives of 1100 jews from the auschwitz death camp, is a powerful, deeply insightful, brutally honest and constantly moving film that transcends itself by bringing to light with great clarity one of the most troubling times in global history. ""schindler's list"" is not necessarily a comfortable film to watch and i dare say the casual film-goer might not rate it highly. it is not, to the casual eye, an entertaining film. only the film-goer who is well versed in cinema and dedicated to the mastery of filmmaking will most likely consider this film entertaining, though many others will still appreciate it. there are, quite simply, films that are not meant to entertain. they are not designed for our pleasure, but for much grander purposes. ""schindler's list"" is a challenging film but a deeply healing one. virtually every aspect of ""schindler's list"" achieves perfection from performances to production quality to script to direction. it would be most challenging to find a film that achieves such balanced perfection. as oskar schindler, liam neeson presents a multi-faceted performance of great depth with a unique balance of self-indulgence and self- sacrifice, shallow materialism with generous offering. neeson offers a schindler who is confident yet often indecisive. what makes this performance remarkable is its pacing...so often, in these humanity films we get a ""superhero"" approach or a man who suddenly and immediately transforms into mr. wonderful. schindler's transformation here is a quieter, more subtle transition that allows the audience to watch him change...watch him struggle with this change. it's a remarkable, controlled performance in what could have been a stereotypical ""tour de force."" while neeson clearly takes the lead here, the supporting roles are simply outstanding including ben kingsley as accountant itzhak stern, a man who works with schindler yet remains wary of him and the nazi's. ralph fiennes offers, perhaps, the ""tour de force"" performance as amon goeth, a sadistic nazi whose callous brutality is disturbing yet, in many ways, very complementary to schindler. the list could go on and on in terms of exemplary performances...yet, it's so hard to single out individuals when truly every aspect of this film is perfect. the score of john williams is magnificent, blending perfectly the desperation of the situation with the moments of great life and the moments of great rage...the cinematography of janusz kaminski utilizes perfectly the use of color (largely black and white) with tremendous shading and just the perfect mix of brutality and hopefulness. the film's attention to detail is astounding, including the music, costuming, language and production design. yet, in many ways, watching ""schindler's list"" makes me not want to comment on any of its production values. this film is so much more than its acting or its writing or its anything else...it is a film that transcends, truly, the art of filmmaking and becomes a story and a film and an experience for the entire world. yes, it truly is that grand. ""schindler's list"" inspires, and yet, simultaneously horrifies. it is, in my opinion, spielberg's finest work and one i doubt he will ever top.

""you don't think i know what you're doing?"" he shouts. harboring jews ""is dangerous"" he rails. schindler calms down after a few minutes. then, oskar schindler removes a note from his pocket. he reads the names of the girl's parents and tells stern to ""bring them over"". then he hands stern his expensive watch which stern is to use as a bribe to the nazis. schindler seems to almost sigh with the realization that he is now locked into a path from which he cannot escape. his life's purpose has changed irrevocably. in his heart he knows that his schindler jews are fully his responsibility and he must do anything and everything to protect them. an extraordinary love and the courage that comes from that love now rule oskar schindler's life. from now on, he no longer wants wealth for himself. instead, as time progresses, all of his money is used to pay off nazis to save his jews. though the movie can bring one to tears, you can't help but feel wonderful about life when you watch the bravery, the love and the humanity, exemplified by oskar schindler, the schindler jews, and all of the jews who suffered under the nazis.";27 January 2005;10;['low', 'hopeless', 'graphic', 'good', 'real', 'many', 'excellent', 'favorite', 'jewish', 'dramatic', 'young', 'safe', 'good', 'jewish', 'dangerous', 'few', 'stern', 'stern', 'expensive', 'extraordinary', 'wonderful'];0.2264705882352941

1668;dream_on_100;"winner of seven academy awards in 1993, this three hour epic is based on a true story, by steven spielburg, it very well portrays the horrors and sadness of the holocaust. although three hours of black and white may put viewers off, once you give it a chance, it's quite interesting and rather intense. the horror of the holocaust is unfolded through a member of the nazi party, drinker, womaniser and ultimately war profiteer: oskar schindler (liam neeson), who initially employed jews from ghettos of poland to start a factory during the war, making pots and pans. he witnesses the horrors endured by the jews, and starts to save them covertly under the eyes of commandant amon goeth (ralph fiennes) who is in charge of the ghetto and later moves all the jews to a forced labour camp. schindler ensures their survival against odds, at the same time, he must remain solvent with the help of a jewish accountant itzhak stern (ben kingsley) who rescues those that are 'expendable' and at the same time negotiate business with a vicious, obstinate nazi commandant amon goeth (ralph fiennes) who enjoys shooting jews as target practice from the balcony of his villa overlooking a prison camp. the film is largely about oskar schindler's transformation in response to the horror around him and learning the corruption of political power. although the whole film is in black white, a significant jewish girl is seen about, wearing a red coat which is prominently shown in the film, the colour red is rather shocking amongst the black and white surroundings and the theme of mass massacre. we follow the little girl to the point where even she, herself is killed in the gas chambers. at this point we realise the full horrors of the holocaust and this is the turning point where we see the development of the schindlers list. the film depicts schindler's ultimately successful attempt to rescue 1,100 jews from hitler's ""final solution"" of mass massacre by getting them to safety outside of poland. this beautiful movie allows viewers to feel like they're actually a part of one of the darkest, most horrific periods in history.";9 February 2005;9;['true', 'black', 'white', 'interesting', 'intense', 'commandant', 'ralph', 'ghetto', 'same', 'solvent', 'jewish', 'expendable', 'same', 'vicious', 'ralph', 'political', 'whole', 'black', 'significant', 'jewish', 'red', 'shocking', 'black', 'white', 'mass', 'little', 'full', 'successful', 'final', 'mass', 'beautiful', 'dark', 'horrific'];-0.0105

1697;ethankirby437;"the holocaust is undoubtedly one of the most significant and horrifying events of the twentieth century. between 1938 and 1945, the jewish population was segregated and persecuted, culminating in the merciless slaughter of approximately six million jews (this figure is quoted in the film, though most historical estimates vary between five and seven million). amidst all this butchery, one man decided to make a difference, famously saving the lives of more than 1100 jews- men, women and children who would otherwise have been killed. oskar schindler was a sudeten german industrialist, a wealthy womanizer who wasn't afraid to throw his money around. always bearing his nazi party badge proudly, schindler would often frequent nightclubs, extravagantly showering high-ranked nazi officers and their girlfriends with champagne and caviar. with impeccable connections in the black-market, there was little that he couldn't get his hands on, and he was a good person to know. buying friends was something that schindler could do well, and he would often use these newfound alliances to aid his own business ventures. when thousands of the polish jew population was relegated to the krakow ghetto in 1941, schindler saw an opportunity for further success, enlisting desperate jewish investors and employing jewish workers (who were substantially cheaper to employ) to open an enamelware factory. his connections in high places ensured lucrative army contracts, and schindler need only have watched as his personal fortune grew, despite doing little to run the company beyond offering it ""a certain panache."" it is clear from the beginning that oskar schindler does not harbor any racial prejudices. when schindler requests the services of itzhak stern (a superb ben kingsley, ""gandhi""), a clever, humanitarian jewish accountant, stern declares that, ""by law i have to tell you, sir, i'm a jew."" ""well, i'm a german, so there we are,"" replies schindler indifferently, before getting straight to business. it is not race that he is concerned with, it is himself and, of course, his money. stern does not enjoy running schindler's business, and he initially acquires little satisfaction from it. when schindler attempts to convey his genuine gratitude for his profitable services with a glass of whiskey, stern absentmindedly refuses to drink it, and an embittered schindler drinks it himself before ordering stern to leave. with the arrival of amon goeth, a hauptsturmfuhrer of the ss, the hopeless plight of the jews grows darker. in a harrowing extended sequence, largely based on the testimonies of holocaust survivors, the jews are mercilessly ""liquidated"" from the krakow ghetto, many simply shot on the spot. ""today is history,"" proclaims goeth. ""today will be remembered. years from now the young will ask with wonder about this day. today is history and you are part of it. for six centuries there has been a jewish krakow. by this evening those six centuries will be a rumor. they never happened. today is history."" this sequence also marks the celebrated appearance of the little girl in the red coat. an ingenious plot device, the character was based upon a real girl named roma ligocka who, unlike her film counterpart, survived the war, and wrote a memoir entitled ""the girl in the red coat: a memoir"". the embodiment of innocence, schindler spots the small girl wandering amongst the black-and- white chaos of the krakow ghetto, and we follow her as she retreats into a building and takes shelter under a bed. when schindler later notices her disheveled corpse carted past him to be incinerated, he is understandably horrified, unable to understand how the soldiers could possibly destroy something so innocent. this event memorably signifies the turning-point of schindler's attitudes towards the carnage, fuelling his desire to save as many jews as possible. this is a great movie. its realism, depth, and willingness to touch on sensitive and dark topics cannot go unnoticed. it is one of the most critically acclaimed movies ever made, and for good reason. few movies draw out such emotion from the viewers. it is movies like this that will hopefully keep humans from committing such atrocities against each other in the future.";12 January 2017;10;['significant', 'horrifying', 'twentieth', 'jewish', 'most', 'historical', 'more', 'sudeten', 'german', 'wealthy', 'afraid', 'frequent', 'impeccable', 'black', 'little', 'good', 'newfound', 'own', 'further', 'desperate', 'jewish', 'jewish', 'cheap', 'high', 'lucrative', 'personal', 'little', 'certain', 'clear', 'racial', 'superb', 'clever', 'humanitarian', 'jewish', 'german', 'little', 'genuine', 'profitable', 'embittered', 'hopeless', 'dark', 'harrowing', 'extended', 'many', 'young', 'jewish', 'celebrated', 'little', 'red', 'ingenious', 'real', 'red', 'small', 'black', 'white', 'disheveled', 'horrified', 'unable', 'innocent', 'many', 'possible', 'great', 'sensitive', 'dark', 'unnoticed', 'good', 'few', 'such', 'such', 'other'];0.1028146258503401

1712;nicholasmchan100;schindler's list is a movie directed by steven spielberg. based on a true story about oskar schindler, this movie is about how a luxurious nazi party members ends up saving more than 1000 polish jews from the holocaust, also known as schindlerjuden (which translates into schindler's jews). he owed a factory to produce enamelware, and stern, his jewish assistant, mainly hired jews as they cost less. also, by having jewish workers and deeming them essential, they realized that the they wouldn't be removed and sent to concentration camps and be killed. because of this, stern, schindler's jewish assistant, immediately filled the factory with more jews, preventing them from being sent to death. originally, schindler was a wealthy man that was focused on making money. he was only concerned about himself, and all his profits and investments. he joined the nazi party not because he was interested in their ideology and fully supported their goals, rather because by joining the nazi party, it will help him make even more money. he had no intention of saving jews initially, it did not matter to him. the factory and his new apartment were originally confiscated from wealthy jewish, but he still felt no guilt at all. later, he realized that stern was abusing his position in the factory by saving jews. he scolded stern for hiring jewish people at first. a new concentration camp in plaszow is opened, and all the people from the krakow ghetto are moved and sent to the extermination camp. seeing this, he started to actively save jews. he persuades goeth to send him his workers, and are moved to the factory. over time, he also gives stern more of his belongings for bribes to bring people to his factory. one of the times is when a train was transporting children and women was being redirected to auschwitz, and he bribes the commander with a bag of diamonds to give them to him. he forbid ss soldiers to enter the new factory. once the war ends, schindler tells his workers that they are free and is bankrupt, but he will have to leave at midnight as he will get hunted as a war criminal. they give him a ring, he cries, then he flees. this movie really did feel realistic and everything seemed true. after reading the real wikipedia page on schindler, i can say that most of what happened in the movie was true. obviously, certain events that happened in reality were not included, and some of the things that happened in the movie did not happen in reality. one of the things that i didn't like about the movie was how everything was black and white, and there was only color for a few seconds in the beginning and end. also, throughout the movie, it was hard to pickup what the actors were trying to say. overall, i really did enjoy this movie, it presented the historical facts really well. i would give this movie a 4/5.;25 November 2014;8;['true', 'luxurious', 'more', 'polish', 'stern', 'jewish', 'less', 'jewish', 'essential', 'stern', 'jewish', 'more', 'wealthy', 'concerned', 'interested', 'more', 'new', 'wealthy', 'jewish', 'new', 'stern', 'more', 'ss', 'new', 'free', 'bankrupt', 'realistic', 'true', 'real', 'most', 'true', 'certain', 'black', 'white', 'few', 'hard', 'historical'];0.1933944032158317

1714;victor-ooi;"schindler's list (1993) is produced by steven spielberg and is about how oskar schindler, a greedy businessman turns the labor to salvation for the jews during the holocaust. schindler himself was a part of the nazi party, and he had been given a factory to produce military clothes, cooking items, and more. he didn't know how to run the factory, and received help from izakh stern (leader of a jewish council), suggesting that he should hire the jews over the polish, because they are cheaper. schindler follows stern's advice, creating false documents, so he could have ""enough"" jewish workers. this sneaky action prevented many of the jews from being sent to concentration camps, almost certainly saving their lives. the construction of a labor camp began nearby paszow, with the killing of everyone who opposed in the ghetto. during the time of the killing, schindler bribed an official so that he could build a camp for his own workers, in his mind; he wanted to keep them away from the guards, preventing any harm. he was also ordered to send all the remaining jews away to auschwitz, but managed to convince the same official to let him keep his workers, on the condition that he moved his factory to moravia (outside poland). schindler's list includes jews who have special skills, and almost all the jews on his list arrived safely t his factory in moravia. however, there were a few women and children redirected to auschwitz by accident, but schindler manages to bribe camp leaders and saves the children. basically, he has spent a majority of his money earned in poland to bribe officials, or leaders of camps. schindler, as a german nazi, had to flee from the soviet red army and told his nazi soldiers to return to their families, so they could avoid confrontation with the soviets. the jews give him a ring with the a quote, which means that he has saved a man and has saved the world, as well as a letter of appreciation for schindler being the jews' savior. it was then given that the thousand jews he had saved, brought up families, which amount over six thousand. it is really amazing how so many people were saved under the power of one man. not only was the number of people saved stunning, but also to have a german nazi save jews is unheard of. obviously, the movie was very good from the start to the end, courtesy to steven spielberg. with great acting skills by liam neeson (as schindler), and a very accurate representation of the events has made this movie prime during release, as well as in the present day. based on a true story, it has been a touching, moving and suspenseful movie. it is recommended for people who love to watch movies related to humanity, or want to learn more about the horrible times of world war 2 and the holocaust, 4.5 out of 5.";7 December 2014;9;['greedy', 'military', 'more', 'jewish', 'cheap', 'false', 'enough', 'jewish', 'sneaky', 'many', 'own', 'same', 'special', 'few', 'german', 'soviet', 'red', 'amazing', 'many', 'stunning', 'german', 'unheard', 'good', 'great', 'liam', 'accurate', 'present', 'true', 'touching', 'suspenseful', 'more', 'horrible'];0.2039682539682539

1758;larsenib;at the beginning of this movie it was unclear to me whether oskar schindler was a good person or a bad person. since he was german, my first instinct was that he was the enemy. however, as the plot progressed it was clear that he in fact was one of the good guys. he had an accountant who was jewish but oskar treated him like he was a human rather than a disposable creature. he also creates a list of jews he wants to work for him and provides them with a safe work environment. he insists that he rabbi carry out religious practices and take part in the sabbath. schindler is unlike the other germans portrayed in this movie, he is kind, accepting and overall a good person.;16 March 2016;8;['unclear', 'good', 'bad', 'german', 'first', 'clear', 'good', 'jewish', 'disposable', 'safe', 'religious', 'other', 'kind', 'overall', 'good'];0.2096153846153846

1760;fahimsiam;'schindler's list' is a movie based on the events of world war 2 that shows the cruelty of war that the jews suffered and how all this suffering changed a greedy nazi officer into a man who saved more than a thousand polish-jewish refugees. this movie shows the brutality everyone in a jews camp faced by an ss officer amon goth and how a lot of them were saved by the humanity of oskar schindler. the movie mostly based on the cruelty of war and the suffering of the innocent people who have no hand in the war. the movie starts vaguely showing the how inhumanly the german soldiers killed all the jews they could find at first and how they all hid under their beds and floor to save their lives. then came the main protagonist of the movie oskar schindler. a greedy german businessman who came to poland in search of cheap labor and make a lot of money of the jews. where he met his accountant itzhak stern and together they took in hundreds of workers and started making a lot of money by making metal home products. slowly he saw the cruelty his workers are facing and started to have sympathy for them. then we got to meet the german second lieutenant amon goth, who was in charge of the jews camp. we saw how he killed the people without a single thought. gradually, mr. schindler got close to amon goth and tried to manipulate him into not killing even more people but that didn't work either. slowly but surely mr. schindler felt sympathy of the jews as he saw his workers suffer and killed more and more and tried to be kind the people. he hit his limit when he saw hundreds of people killed and burned and he decided to buy all the people he can think of and afford with his accountant. that list is where the movie name comes from and we can see that at the end of the movie the war is over and schindler managers to save over one thousand jews and the german second lieutenant gets executed. i loved the movie because it was an engaging story. i felt for the jews and their suffering. now i know why it's called one of the worst moments in the history of mankind. this movie has multiple notable scenes among them four scenes made me wonder. in one scenes at the very start of the movie we see that the german soldiers are a building full of people and people had to eat their valuables to hide them from the germans and also they hid themselves under drawers for whole days to save their lives. another scene i found really significant was when the jews were killed and burned in hundreds and the air was full of ashes of those killed. it showed the severity of situation there. the third scene that was very notable to me was the moment where the main character we're following mr. schindler saved a women's parents by calling them in as employee's out of humanity. another scene that had the same significance was the scene where he gave water to all the people in the trains. it showed the contrast between the two types of people with power where mr. schindler was helping the people and the german soldiers were laughing at what he was doing. the last scene that was memorable was right at the end of the movie where mr. schindler mourned about all the number of people he could have saved if he hadn't wasted his money of his car, clothes etc. he realized the value of life and it broke his heart as he flee the country as the war was over. all of the characters performances were great. they really showed the emotions and captured the gruesome vibe of the war. among them my favorite was liam neeson playing the main protagonist mr. oskar schindler. the character development he had throughout the movie was heart warming to watch. he started of as any other greedy businessman trying to make money out the war situation but slowly ended up being the savior of thousands not regarding how much wealth it costed him. from the very start he seemed more human than all the other characters in power because of their cruelty. he's acting was so appealing because the audience could see the struggle in the eyes whenever he could not help the general people. i rate his performance 9 out of 10. the duration of the movie is quite long for a modern movie being a little more than three hours and the movie did feel is a little slow paced at start but i get why the directors waited to show the brutal situation of world war 2. the story picked up the pace after the half way mark. the story is based on historical events and they mostly stayed true to the main events and added the supporting characters to make the audience feel for the characters. the movie showed on significant points the actual history of the war that's relevant to the story. this movie was released in 1993 and it is is a black and white movie. the supporting character to our main protagonist the accountant ben kingsley had a really good performance. altogether the movie is well written and directed to understand the historical event. after watching this movie i realized that there's always hope. even in one of the worst moments in human history there was oskar schindler who helped save people who they were at war with.;2 March 2021;8;['greedy',

1780;Benixyl;know many of you, out there will disagree with me, when i say that schindler's list is one of the greatest film that there has ever been. it does sound that i'm extremely overrating it, but i truly believe that schindler's list is up there with the godfather and citizen kane i mean everything about is so good, that its close to perfection. the acting is brilliant, every actor does an amazing job. liam neeson as schindler is incredible, no doubt about it. he should of won an oscar for best actor. ralph fiennes is the one, who truly is the best actor in the film. he plays his antagonist role as amon goeth, so well that it is a travesty, he didn't win an oscar for best supporting actor. i'm happy though, that the academy chose this film for best picture, it was one of the best decisions they ever made. because if this film wasn't considered best picture by the academy, i don't know which film would be, expect maybe for the godfather. steven spielberg certainly deserved an oscar for best director. it was a smart idea for steven spielberg to make this film in black- white because it made the movie more bleak, emotional, hopelessness. but you see small patches of color -- a candle and a child's coat bringing the evilness of the tragedy into a agonizing focus. there's no doubt about it, this film will be a classic in decades, even hundreds of years to come in cinema. this film is without a doubt, the best film that spielberg has ever made. with many other steven spielberg's classics like jurassic park,jaws,e.t, raider of the lost ark, saving private ryan, etc. schindler's list will always be steven spielberg's most finest, important film. he blends his humanism to the tragic horror of the holocaust to create an emotional masterpiece.;16 January 2017;8;['many', 'great', 'good', 'brilliant', 'amazing', 'incredible', 'good', 'ralph', 'good', 'good', 'happy', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'smart', 'white', 'bleak', 'emotional', 'small', 'agonizing', 'good', 'many', 'other', 'private', 'fine', 'important', 'tragic', 'emotional'];0.3779982363315695

1807;shikhargupta-05613;you might not have heard about oscar schindler but you will definitely want to know more about him after watching the movie. he is credited with saving the lives of more than a thousand jews during the holocaust. he was named righteous among the nations by the israeli government a few years after the end of the second world war. righteous among the nations is awarded to those non-jews who helped jews during the holocaust in various ways such as providing them food or shelter, arranging escape out of germany and german- occupied territories, etc. schindler's list is based on a 1983 novel, schindler's ark. it tells the story of the efforts of oscar schindler, a german, to help jews during the holocaust. played by liam neeson, oscar is not an easy character to comprehend. it takes you time to fully understand who he is. he is a person who might come across selfish to you at first. he is an opportunistic businessman. he comes across as one who, even during the wartime, is trying to find opportunities to make money rather than worrying about people's lives. but deep inside, he has a heart bigger than the most and at a time when jews were struggling to find a helping hand, he helped more than a thousand jews. he is not a person who will give you sympathy for you are going to lose someone close, but he is one who would take actions to save your closed one and not tell you when he does. you can see this in the movie when a jewish lady approaches him begging to get her parents out of the concentration camp and into his factory. at first, he not only denies her help but also lashes out at his assistant showing frustration how his for-profit factory has come to be known to people outside as a charitable harbor for jews. but you can hear the pain he feels for that lady and all the other jews in his frustrated voice. later in the scene, the lady's parents are shown being escorted out of the concentration camp into his factory. the movie starts with how oscar schindler, in the midst of the second world war, sets up a factory manufacturing pots and pans to supply to the german army. oscar hires a jewish accountant to manage the factory. while the account runs the factory enormously profitably for schindler, he hires many jews who would have otherwise ended up in concentration camps. by getting german ss guards to believe that they have the important skill sets required for the factory, he cleverly sneaks many jews out of the concentration camps. as oscar is setting up his factory, the german ss is brutally evicting all the jews out of their houses and moving them to ghettos and later to labor camps. as oscar and his wife helplessly watch eviction of a ghetto from a hill overlooking it, he realizes the dreadfulness of the war and that he needs to look beyond the factory profits and help the jews. the atrocities that the jews face will touch your heart. in a scene of a labor camp, as little children are being taken away by german ss guards from their mothers, a child runs away to hide. he tries a few places including outhouses but finding them occupied by other children, he dives through a toilet seat in a toilet pit to hide. the fear of life on the face of the little child as he settles in the toilet pit will bleed your heart. as the war progresses, the state of the jews worsens. the ss plans to exterminate all the jews and hence gradually starts moving them from labor camps to concentration camps. oscar's pots and pans factory are not considered important enough for the war effort to continue employing the jews anymore but he is determined to keep the jews in his factory, by now called schindler jews, from the concentration camps as he devises a new plan. despite the dark and sad story-line, the movie has many snippets of humour. as oscar's manager is cleverly hiring jews in the factory by keeping the ss in dark, he also hires an old man without a left arm as a metal polisher. the state of the old man is sad and the act of the manager is kind. but the subtle humour in the situation is difficult to miss when oscar comes to know about the old man and frustratingly asks his manager how the old man is useful for the factory. overall, schindler's list is a heart-touching and a powerful movie that will force even a cold heart to warm for a moment. the movie is engaging and will keep you engaged for the entire three hours. it is a must-watch. i give it a rating of 9 out of 10.;27 August 2017;9;['more', 'more', 'righteous', 'israeli', 'few', 'second', 'righteous',

1809;leahtinclair;what i learned about the holocaust in the film 'schindler's list' is that it teachers us about the horrors of the holocaust and the nature of genocide. it also gave me the insight of what happened by showing a horrific number of deaths. the movie was shown through the eyes on the outside(nazi's) and then through the eyes on the inside(jews). this gave me more of an understanding. the first stage of the holocaust was 'definition'. jews were forced to wear the star of david and shown as a threat. the second stage was 'segregation'. jews were now forced into ghettos. the fourth stage was 'concentration camps'. jews were sent to these camps to work and do free slave labor. the fifth stage was 'extermination camps'. gas chambers were disguised as showers. by 1945, six million jews were executed. the final stage was the 'aftermath'. camps were liberated. oskar schindler changed drastically from bad to good throughout the film. at the beginning oskar was a greedy, money loving, womaniser but as the film progressed we were shown key moments that changed oskar. the first key moment was when cities were being evacuated of jews, oskar see a little girl in red being evacuated and this left him shocked. the second key moment was when the bodies were being burned, oskar noticed the very same red clothing the little girl was wearing. these moments, i think were major factors that led to his change. based on the events in this film, i do believe that one person can make a difference. i feel that oskar was influenced by how the treatment the jews were receiving etc. but also how the nazi's were carrying on like animals, thinking they can do whatever pleased them. oskar noticed all these actions and in a way he did act alone because he gave away personal items to get what needed to be done. my own personal response to this film is that it was 100% worth the watch. all the awards the film won were all well deserved because in my opinion, it made me realize just how horrendous and cruel it all was. from an educational view, i think this is a film that every student should see because it is a major moment in history that will never ever be forgotten. the film was depicted so superbly.;29 September 2017;10;['horrific', 'more', 'first', 'second', 'fourth', 'free', 'fifth', 'final', 'bad', 'good', 'beginning', 'greedy', 'loving', 'womaniser', 'key', 'first', 'key', 'little', 'red', 'shocked', 'second', 'key', 'same', 'red', 'little', 'major', 'personal', 'own', 'personal', 'worth', 'deserved', 'horrendous', 'cruel', 'educational', 'major'];0.0068965517241379

1828;thomso-67500;"imdb - review of schindler's list director: steven spielberg writers: thomas keneally (book), steven zaillian (screenplay) stars: liam neeson (oskar schindler), ralph fiennes (amon goeth), ben kingsley (itzhak stern) this a true story of the holocaust and an atrocity of the purest of evil. the theme of good vs evil and morality plagues this film. decisions made by the three main characters; oskar, amon & itzhak throughout the film depicts the disposition of their thoughts, actions and morals. stern is a humble jewish man living his life and working to support his family but uprooted in the worst ways because of the war. oskar at first sees the war as a vehicle towards his ambition in becoming a successful businessman and prove to his wife, friends and hometown that he has made it in life. amon goeth is the officer in charge of the concentration camp in the krakow that becomes close acquaintances with oskar. he ultimately makes the decisions that oskar constantly asks of him, such as the buying of the jewish people at the end of the film. schindler's list tells the story of a failed business man named oskar schindler, who is of german ethnicity. the timeframe is set in krakow, poland during world war ii. it is at the start of the german army forcing jewish people into the krakow ghetto and stripping them of all their rights before adolf hitler is set to impose his final solution, being the holocaust. oskar has failed at previous business ventures before and decides on a new route. his plan is to befriend high ranking german military officers and use this leverage towards being able to start up a factory selling pots and pans to the german military. he has used up all his funds while implementing this friendship and is now in need of more capital to run the factory. he befriends a jewish accountant named itzhak stern to both oversee his factory, and more importantly fund it as well. itzhak gains the trust of other jewish people to invest in oskar's idea. in turn oskar tells them that he will employ their family and friends and give them finished goods such as pots and pans to trade in the ghetto, which is worth more to them than their monies. throughout the film we see oskar's character swaying from greed to empathy as he sees the germans plan for the annihilation of the jewish race. he uses his funds that has made him rich over the course of the war to buy as many jewish people's freedom and stave off being sent to the death camps implemented by hitler. this film garnered several academy award nominations and wins. although this is a true story, we can claim because of the theme that it compares to a superhero film such as batman or superman; because the main character is the one fighting for good versus evil. oskar does not have super human powers but because of his actions; families, offspring and names have survived. oskar's character always waned in decision but made the best decision that he could in the eyes of morality. cinematography and lightening were huge ways for the director to show this theme throughout. it set the audience with a feeling of empathy, hatred, helplessness and sadness. the fact that the entire film was in black and white was significant. it made the claim that everything was surrounded by evil because of the darkness and that at various points light such as shabbat candles and the little girl in the red coat tried to shine through the darkness. another significant technique was the camera close-ups of the jewish people's personal effects, such as eye-glasses, gold plated teeth, luggage, and so on. this showed to the audience that the jewish people were nothing more than inanimate objects to the german soldiers and worth nothing except the value that they could extract from these objects. the atrocities that hitler and the german people committed against the jewish population, the staggering numbered killed during wwii and the holocaust, goes to show that there can be no greater evil than this.";17 March 2018;9;['ralph', 'true', 'pure', 'good', 'evil', 'main', 'humble', 'jewish', 'bad', 'successful', 'close', 'such', 'jewish', 'german', 'german', 'jewish', 'final', 'previous', 'new', 'high', 'german', 'military', 'able', 'german', 'more', 'jewish', 'other', 'jewish', 'finished', 'such', 'worth', 'more', 'jewish', 'rich', 'many', 'jewish', 'several', 'true', 'such', 'main', 'good', 'super', 'human', 'good', 'huge', 'entire', 'black', 'white', 'significant', 'various', 'such', 'little', 'red', 'significant', 'close', 'jewish', 'personal', 'such', 'jewish', 'more', 'inanimate', 'german', 'worth', 'german', 'jewish', 'staggering', 'numbered', 'great'];0.123057093180044

1849;mrshahinrashidi;schindler's list is another product of the long and fruitful collaboration between john williams and steven spielberg, which won another oscar for williams. many consider it a masterpiece of john williams and the best music of his life, and in fact it is one of the most beautiful music written for a film in the history of cinema. spielberg made schindler's list based on thomas kinley's novel and steven zillian's screenplay. the film tells the story of world war ii-era nazi-occupied poland, and is about the paradoxical nature of a german factory called oscar schindler, a former member of the nazi party, at a time when hitler's army was sending jews to death camps. he has saved many lives by hiring them at his metalworking factory. schindler (played by lim neeson) is an unsuccessful businessman who travels from czechoslovakia to krakow, poland, to use a cheap jewish labor force to set up his factory in the city and produce products for the german army. throughout the film, we see the gradual transformation of schindler's character from a gifted and opportunistic businessman to a philanthropic and liberating figure. influenced by documentaries such as shoah (1985) and the broken cross (1956), spielberg decided to make the film in black and white with a documentary approach. for this reason, instead of using a low stand, a crane or a zoom, he asked polish cinematographer janusz aminski to film it with a camera on his hand in most scenes. nearly 40 percent of the film was shot with the camera in hand, which was very different from his previous film style, in which he used the complex and bizarre movements of the camera and the crane to intimidate the viewer. the use of black and white images has also given his film a documentary and historical aspect. except for the final scene (a scene in which spielberg's actors, along with the real prisoners of war who played the role, gather at schindler's grave and pay their respects to him), which has a historical distance from the film's central event and is filmed in color. the other color of the film is a little girl with a red coat in a jewish ghetto, and then we see her body on a cart. john williams wrote the original theme of the film as the schindler's list for the piano, but at spielberg's suggestion he gave it to isaac perlman, a prominent violinist. although there are different themes in the film, each representing a specific idea or character, this is the main theme that is present in most parts of the film and shows itself. the theme, which williams borrowed from eastern european jewish music but offers a modern performance. a romantic and sad theme performed by isaac perlman's solo violin. the music themes in schindler's list are very simple, and there's not the usual complexity of williams' work, especially in jurassic park and star wars. just like spielberg's visual style in this film, which is very simple and well-documented, and it doesn't show the technical demonstrations and the subtle and complex movements of the camera and the crane. instead of the huge, glorious marches of indian war music or the thrilling music of indiana jones, williams has relied on soft, melodic melodies. music that conveys the emotions and feelings of the victims and the pain and suffering they suffer. schindler's list music is originally written for stringed instruments, with wind instruments playing a supporting role, except for the clarinet, which has been used in schindler's workforce to bring it closer to hebrew music. the use of choir songs is another feature of schindler's list music and a sign of john williams' mastery of folk music and local vocals in film music, examples of which have already been seen in the music of female violin films on the roof and far away. and we've heard further. the immolation piece is a passionate, beautiful and enchanting crawl piece. the presence of the violin in the music of schindler's list is very prominent and significant, and it has been used to create different moods and tones. perhaps no other instrument as powerful as the violin and no other musician like isaac perlman could convey this bitter and tragic feeling so powerfully. the music of john williams on the schindler's list is a collection of beautiful classical and symphonic pieces that retain their artistic value apart from the film.;5 June 2020;9;['long', 'fruitful', 'many', 'good', 'beautiful', 'paradoxical', 'german', 'former', 'many', 'unsuccessful', 'cheap', 'jewish', 'german', 'gradual', 'gifted', 'opportunistic',

1866;matouk-40766;"within the atrocity of the holocaust during the 40's, more than 6 million jews were slaughtered; in very bloody war and tragic events, there was schindler, a german nazi businessman who, even in the middle of conflict of interest, has succeed to create a different connection with the victims. schindler saw the victim as human, felt their pain and tried to do his best to save as many jews as possible. schindler was a greedy war businessman who want to take advantage of the cheap jewish labor to make fortune; he wasn't role model or hero for anyone; he was drinker and womanizer who wanted to hire jewish labor at starvation wages; however, some events marked him during the war. maybe among the most important elements of the story is how the filmmaker wanted to personalize each character, even victims. liam neeson (oskar schindler) in the film developed a sort of friendship with his chief worker ben kingsley (itzhak stern). the ultimate turning point that got him involved and discovers his humanity is when he saw the dead body of girl with red coat among other kids slaughtered by nazis; the image invaded his mind and awakens his emotions to turn into a savior. the girl with red coat was the center of attention even before she died as spielberg wanted the audience to focus on her as an innocent scary kid full of life, the only colored character in the film; her death was felt by schindler as the end of hope. schindler then started to recruit as much worker as possible to save them from death, his mission wasn't to make profit anymore as it was started at the beginning, he established solid relationships with some jewish workers and becomes a hope for many victims. the greedy guy who was capable to do everything to make money started to his workers as humans, feeling their pain, oskar schindler ended up broken, the only thing he kept was a list of people he saved, and he could have saved; full of regrets and sadness that he could have saved more but he didn't. schindler's list exhibits the good and the evil as theme, it also exhibits hope and redemption. the leader of the camp ralph fiennes (amon goethe) had another plot point elaborated in parallel with schindler's story to portrait the atrocity and the cruelty of the nazi regime, he is cold blooded killer who believes strongly in the nazi ideology; but conflicted at the end by developing feelings towards helen (eberth davidtz); she was his housekeeper, he beats her, slams her every time as his emotions were confronted between love of his mission as a nazi and loving a jewish girl; both were amazing and completed the roles, well played characters in all dimensions. as mentioned before, the theme also touches redemption, another film with appropriateness of the theme is probably valkyrie by tom cruise, another movie about soldier who collaborated with some of his superiors to kill adolph hitler, the character felt redemption after what happened at the war; the only solution to end the chaos is turn against his regime. there are many techniques that made the movie personable, touchable and interesting to the viewers, but maybe the most important ones in my opinion are lighting, color and editing; the movie was black and white except for the beginning before the nazis invade the town; the movie was grey to reflect the atrocity and loss of hope during the era, grey also was needed to exhibit explore the theme of evil which is represented by the misery and cruelty of life conditions of the jewish people. the girl with red coat was the only colored character, a bullet to the audience heart who can't miss the scene, she was the turning point of schindler; thus, the whole story. editing was also a relevant technique to expose the contrast of two parallel world, the cruelty the jews endure everyday with bullets in the head, starving to death and died in the cold contrasted with the luxury of nazis' houses dancing with women around drinks. the were two scenes that contradict each other many times in the film. what's amazing in this film is that, in many war movies, audience barely relates to the victims at the individual level, audience mainly feel the horror from the mass killing; this film however is different, steven spielberg exposed the victims and related them to the audience to feel them individually; he made a short story of each one differently, characters that we cannot ignore and forced to understand throughout the film, it made the movie so personalized to the audience.";9 December 2018;9;['more', 'bloody', 'tragic', 'german', 'different', 'good', 'many', 'possible', 'greedy', 'cheap', 'jewish', 'jewish', 'important', 'chief', 'ultimate', 'dead', 'red', 'other', 'red', 'innocent', 'scary', 'full', 'only', 'colored', 'much', 'possible', 'solid', 'jewish', 'many', 'greedy', 'capable', 'only', 'full', 'cold', 'blooded', 'helen', 'jewish', 'amazing', 'valkyrie', 'adolph', 'only', 'many', 'touchable', 'interesting', 'important', 'black', 'white', 'grey', 'jewish', 'red', 'only', 'colored', 'whole', 'relevant', 'parallel', 'cold', 'other', 'many', 'amazing', 'many', 'individual', 'mass', 'different', 'short'];0.0900641025641025
